            <li>This is a great product and kept my makeup &amp;#34;frozen&amp;#34; on my wedding day without my face being frozen.</li>
            <li>Heading to a event, makeup looked great.</li>
            <li>Works great however the sprayer leaves droplets on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It helped maintain the paint I applied to my face, which was a great thing.</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>Shipping speed was great.</li>
            <li>Works great with Snazaroo.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as great as the Graftobian  Make-up Spray, which I&#x27;m about to re-purchase.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It was nothing like the great reviews I read anout it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>The minty smell is great to me.</li>
            <li>This product is GREAT...</li>
            <li>it smelled really great</li>
            <li>So now it works great giving an even mist all over my face.</li>
            <li>I would buy more if I run out!!</li>
            <li>Love this product! !</li>
            <li>This spray is amazing!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant minty smell and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  </li>
            <li>Seals paint very easily (even when it is Snazaroo) and makes it refuse to come off!</li>
            <li>To be fair</li>
            <li>But it does feel good on my face.</li>
            <li>It does do a good job when I can use it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good for sealing your makeup.</li>
            <li>Absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good makeup sealant.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it does a good job of keeping my make-up from fading.  </li>
            <li>and I am good to go all day without re-applying.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of that.</li>
            <li>The product itself wasent as good as i thought, either that or</li>
            <li>The product was actually really good.</li>
            <li>This ia a good product</li>
            <li>(In a good way, at least).&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my Homestuck cosplays and it seals it to perfection.</li>
            <li>Smells good</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this would work great on someone who&#x27;s skin is not so oily.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, for the most part of the day makeup stays on....</li>
            <li>Great stuff over cream make-up :)</li>
            <li>Love this setting spray!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty great!</li>
            <li>Love this item, the way it works, it doesn&#x27;t smudge my makeup at all and is waterproof!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>But if you wear powdered makeup, I&#x27;m sure this would be the bomb!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is magic!</li>
            <li>so much better than ANYTHING else out there!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this spray a couple times and I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>and my makeup never moved and looked amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing item and</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells nice and sets your makeup until you wash it off.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best !</li>
            <li>My review is honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>It was kind of pricey</li>
            <li>Fast delivery great product!</li>
            <li>Also has a nice minty smell.</li>
            <li>The spray is lightweight, invisible, and the mint smell is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>I have reduced transfer which is nice, so I rate it three stars instead of four.  </li>
            <li>It is fairly effective.</li>
            <li>The smell of it kind of grosses me out.</li>
            <li>And when I pray it on, it isn&#x27;t like a nice mist.</li>
            <li>Minty smell is nice, no offputting taste.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t taste good, of course, but the product itself is okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it made my makeup stay flawless for a good 8-10 hours, even if the humidity outside was making me sweat</li>
            <li>You can very easily get water spots on your face.  </li>
            <li>I also love the minty smell and feel refreshing and wakes u up in the am!</li>
            <li>This by far works best for my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>So far this is the best product I have found for me.</li>
            <li>I have used MAC and Model in a bottle and this stuff is much more effective.</li>
            <li>Its actually a nice refreshing smell and does not linger.</li>
            <li>but this on by far is the best.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and there was a good amount for a good price.</li>
            <li>it works very very well and has a nice minty smell to it!</li>
            <li>a bit high priced for what it is, but it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>even my sprayer misted the product on really nice and lightly.</li>
            <li>make sure you spray and walk into the mist.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>wash and oil blot sheets keep my make up looking more matte.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than those points, I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything better to do what this Matte Makeup Sealer does.</li>
            <li>but I was not as pleased with the staying power it provided.</li>
            <li>it seems to work better for me.  </li>
            <li>This setting spray is awesome, I like it better than the Urban Decay all nighter and its cheaper too!!  </li>
            <li>goodness I was able to try someone else&#x27;s before mine arrived, and I ended up returning my unused product.  </li>
            <li>By the end of the day I would look like I didn&#x27;t have on any at all, now I am quite pleased that I still look &#x27;made up&#x27; at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>This is MOST DEFINITELY the BEST makeup sealer out there!!!!</li>
            <li>It does work better</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>My makeup more than lasted though.</li>
            <li>If I spray after, it lasts mostly all day.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll be adding baby powder/hairspray on top just to be sure I&#x27;m not getting my make up everywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it</li>
            <li>She was extremely pleased in the end.</li>
            <li>I love this for school</li>
            <li>I sweat more than any woman I know so this stuff</li>
            <li>BUT OMG seriously so glad I purchased it after all</li>
            <li>Love it makeup</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Love this finishing spray.  </li>
            <li>That being said, it works better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>..kept me matte for most of the day.</li>
            <li>with suck up your oil like a sponge then I spray on the sealer to make me even more matte.</li>
            <li>I felt like this in no way made my makeup stay on any better than when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wedding and it works fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love how it helps my makeup stay in place.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Looks great and really seals the paint in well.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>My make-up stays on better without it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok if you spray your face and buff your makeup in with it.</li>
            <li>Then its ok.</li>
            <li>but when I use it my makeup stays on for most of the day.</li>
            <li>,  final seal keeps my makeup matte and it looks great for hours upon hours!!</li>
            <li>Works even better when you spray before and after makeup application</li>
            <li>This one smells minty but it does keep your makeup in place a lot better than others.</li>
            <li>its much better.</li>
            <li>I love this sealer.  </li>
            <li>I received a lot of compliments on my makeup.  :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>You may like the way it looks, but if you don&#x27;t just put a tad bit of powder on top of it and it disappears with no problem.</li>
            <li>so be sure to moisturize before.</li>
            <li>It has an refreshing mint smell</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried this.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t spray too close to the face.</li>
            <li>sure what its purpose is.</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly, just beware of coating it too thickly, especially around your eyes</li>
            <li>Worked as well as the All- NIghter maybe even better.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant peppermint scent when you first spray it but goes away after the product dries.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly !!!!!</li>
            <li>but I used this on my special effects make up and face paint (not the crappy kind either)</li>
            <li>The most notable was on Halloween, when I painted my face with cheap costume store makeup that would surely run without a sealer.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and great for costume make up and daily use!</li>
            <li>The first day I did a fairly normal make-up style and was really impressed at how it lasted.  </li>
            <li>Great for when you&#x27;re too busy to stop and do touch ups.</li>
            <li>The spray is refreshing when you spray it on and it makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>It will, however, keep your makeup in place and looking flawless all day in every other scenario.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is great!</li>
            <li>My make up is easily cleaned off with a make up remover wipe,</li>
            <li>My makeup didn&#x27;t rub off all night, but then easily washed off as soon as I got in the shower.  </li>
            <li>My makeup now lasts, easily, 12 hours with NO problem.</li>
            <li>I can easily use an oil-blotting sheet (or two) to control the oil and shine, but thankfully I no longer have to worry about reapplying makeup as well.  </li>
            <li>I live in Orlando, FL and was impressed when I met a Disney Princess who highly recommended this product for &amp;#34;makeup that won&#x27;t go anywhere&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I remember wearing this in high school for school school plays so that our makeup would not smudge under the bright lights.</li>
            <li>It works pretty amazingly for the price even though you can get it on the Ben Nye website for cheaper.</li>
            <li>It has a nice minty scent to it when you first spray it on but</li>
            <li>I am really pleased that I bought this and have started wearing it whenever I wear full makeup.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not bad at all, just minty and refreshing.</li>
            <li>If you can, I would suggest getting a bottle that sprays out fine mist.</li>
            <li>Scent was fine,</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and using this product along with finishing powder over top works wonders!</li>
            <li>which for me is HUGE.  </li>
            <li>I am still on the search for a product that will keep my makeup sealed and my T-zone oil free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Definitely NOT trying to be a MUA just want great products..</li>
            <li>I bought this expecting total oil control and matte-ifying results, it&#x27;s a great makeup sealant</li>
            <li>It is a bit heavy on the skin, so it may not be best for every day use (although, i use it almost every day..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few make up setting sprays &amp; this is the best.</li>
            <li>but it definitely does a great job.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic with snazaroo, and ben nye paint.</li>
            <li>It also kinda makes your skin look a bit shiny in the light, but doesn&#x27;t affect what your makeup looks like.</li>
            <li>It also did not keep me matte free all day (or even 4 hours of the day.)</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>(if you squeeze your eyes you wont get as good of coverage in the eye area and its more likely to get into your eyes!)&lt;br /&gt;-On</li>
            <li>Works excellently, I often touch my face after putting on makeup and this helped it stay all day long - used first for my wedding events</li>
            <li>Also, it seems to keep eyeshadow from creasing if you make sure to apply it right at your eyelids.</li>
            <li>Very good product, I&#x27;ve found other uses for it as well.</li>
            <li>but so far it seals really well, no stickiness, just a good seal!</li>
            <li>It lasts all day long, and the minty smell is very refreshing!</li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Works great esp when you have a long day and don&#x27;t have time to touch up your makeup.</li>
            <li>Despite some pre-ceremony sweating, the makeup stayed in place and looked fresh!  </li>
            <li>Okay, so this is my first time trying this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my spray bottle is defective, but the sealer squirts out like a super soaker instead of a fine mist.</li>
            <li>I have oily/combination skin and usually get 5 hours maximum wear from the best of foundations.</li>
            <li>It may seem pricey but it is definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Keeps makeup fresh all day!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you&#x27;re going to use any kind of full body makeup/paint.</li>
            <li>After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to purchase for halloween.  </li>
            <li>I am very oily, and I live in a warm climate (the Bahamas) to boot!</li>
            <li>It was actually a huge shock to look into the bathroom mirror after lunch the first day I tried this and see that I still had makeup on!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially amazing when going away for the weekend or long days when I will be too busy &amp; just don&#x27;t want to have to even THINK about my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works fairly well in controlling oil and making my makeup last all day.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my sister after I complimented her on how smooth and fresh her makeup looked on her.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I bought it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to avoid having to do makeup touch-ups during their day or evening.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love it, but it irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>While it does not completely correct the issue of my smudged eyebrows, it does keep the pencil on much much better and keeps it from becoming oily and smuding (for the most part).</li>
            <li>I have yet to use it for a full day at a convention, but my makeup didn&#x27;t run or rub off at all, even on the neck where the shirt collar rubs a lot.</li>
            <li>Recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like having their clothes full of foundation!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it&#x27;s a minty scent-LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the spray is very erratic, and I find you have to use more than the couple of quick sprays recommended to ensure an even coating.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping as well, i love this.</li>
            <li>It is sticky at first but not a bad product!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really strong at first, but that does go away as it dries.</li>
            <li>I may shop around for some more sprays that control oil too, but I&#x27;m overall thrilled with this product and believe it delivers exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>It is cheaper than some of the other sealers and works great.</li>
            <li>It smells so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER sensitive/dry skin</li>
            <li>It has a minty scent that is inoffensive and quickly disappears.</li>
            <li>also use a quick spritz now</li>
            <li>I have nice full eyebrows until about midway through where it should continue, but the hair is so sparse that you can barely see it.</li>
            <li>I quickly bought a bottle.</li>
            <li>Super sticky, it doesnt work</li>
            <li>Also quick shipping arrived before estimated date</li>
            <li>Does its job extraordinarily.</li>
            <li>So I ran my race with my spooky costume makeup,  finished in 3rd place, broke my personal record, and the paint had stayed on PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li>Comes off very easily with make up remover and has not dried out my skin or caused me to break out.</li>
            <li>I will use it for special occasions, but my sensitive skin can&#x27;t handle it more than once a week.</li>
            <li>The 2oz bottle should last me a long while too, perfect</li>
            <li>I knew it would be Hot and Humid!  </li>
            <li>Worked wonders, and my makeup did not move, given the amount of dancing and how hot it was out all day!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried that many different ones because I liked this one so much from the first try.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and it has helped greatly.</li>
            <li>A light mist on your face after applying your makeup when you are done getting ready in the morning</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>For what it does, the price is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products.. including Model in a Bottle, Urban Decay&#x27;s All Nighter &amp; Oil Free Shine.</li>
            <li>(at least in my opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product with my own money and of my own volition.</li>
            <li>hot sun,  full wind.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it, though and think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh smell almost like mouthwash.</li>
            <li>makeup rarely lasts an hour after I leave the house.  </li>
            <li>Plus it smells minty fresh.</li>
            <li>Its absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li>but it is worth every penny</li>
            <li>The sealer can last all day and withstand sweat and has a nice minty scent.</li>
            <li>, im super oily only a couple hours into the day, and this makes my makeup look nice and fresh pretty much all day!</li>
            <li>When I get home in the late afternoon my makeup still looks good!</li>
            <li>and this really helps keep it under control while keeping my make-up looking fresh all day too!</li>
            <li>Perhaps I didn&#x27;t use it right</li>
            <li>This is the first time I can say a setting spray really did keep my makeup on my face all day!!</li>
            <li>Refreshing to the skin , it works like no other and I have tried them all.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many setting sprays in the past and love Ben Nye products, so was excited about this one.</li>
            <li>I kept the same smooth finish I love about that make up much longer into the day.  </li>
            <li>Made the oil more apparent - thank</li>
            <li>The scent is very refreshing and even though you might feel like your sweating your really not.  </li>
            <li>So push down fully and it should be good.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed and as a matter of fact have decided to order several more to keep at the ready and even give to family and friends.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, from the minty fresh scent to the lasting power.</li>
            <li>However, if you prep well and spray carefully you&#x27;ll love this product!</li>
            <li>Just wipe them in softly and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>the spray is kind of sticky, by the end of the day my makeup looked very dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>Good for a little bit</li>
            <li>The first time I used this (borrowed)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>If you are on any skin or acne medications, be aware it will increase dryness and irritation.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I needed something to help keep my cosplay make-up sealed and on during the hot heat and sweating.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>that also makes it burn/tingle a bit when I first spray it on my face.</li>
            <li>Urban decay setting spray is cheaper, and better</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>I really like it!  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more when my first bottle is done.</li>
            <li>Very Speedy Delivery!</li>
            <li>I tended to need a lot more than necessary.....</li>
            <li>You will most likely still need to blot if you get oily, but even if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re face will stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t love about it, was that it made my skin breakout if I wore it too often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light-feeling liquid and has a fresh, minty scent.  </li>
            <li>This is the first one I buy.</li>
            <li>Got married in North Carolina on the ocean.  </li>
            <li>The smell at first reminds me of a minty mouth wash smell</li>
            <li>I think the urban decay brand did a better job.</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li>I do it one more time in the middle.  </li>
            <li>My first time using this product was for my sister-in-laws wedding.  </li>
            <li>The wedding was outdoors on a hot August day.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE Final Seal Matte Makeup Sealer.</li>
            <li>I squirt it twice when i am done and it stays put, and matte most of the entire day.</li>
            <li>Now, it isn&#x27;t perfect for me, but I feel I&#x27;m an exception - the oiliness of my face is, sadly, apparently incurable.</li>
            <li>It worked a lot better than my Urban Decay make-up sealer.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The product really does keep your makeup fresh.</li>
            <li>So far I spray my face lightly before applying my foundation and again after all makeup has been applied.  </li>
            <li>I had better luck using Aqua Net to seal my body makeup.</li>
            <li>The spray did exactly what it was supposed to do, and my make-up was still on at the end of the night.</li>
            <li>Works way better than urban decay makeup setting spray.  </li>
            <li>The makeup doesn&#x27;t stay 100% but it holds pretty well.</li>
            <li>I first learned of this product on Pinterest.</li>
            <li>When you first get it.</li>
            <li>I tried it twice to make sure that it was the final seal that was making my skin break out.</li>
            <li>Cuz that&#x27;s exactly what it smells like.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and spray a light spray all over your face, let dry and lightly mist again.</li>
            <li>This is great for those in pageants, performances and everyday makeup!!</li>
            <li>I live in the sunny Caribbean and usually do a full face makeup</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and my makeup sweats off so quickly.</li>
            <li>My real tests of it are some concerts and Hallowe&#x27;en parties happening next week, but I&#x27;m confident that this product will keep my makeup in place.</li>
            <li>Holds make up in  place all day long with a refreshing mint smell when first applied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better than the thick primers they sell, and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, once you spritz a bit of this product on your face after applying makeup your face truly looks smooth and fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>This sealer works pretty good but sprays on very heavy.  </li>
            <li>my make-up stayed matte all day and barely rubbed off, which is a huge problem for me.</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin, so after a couple hours my skin is usually really greasy and shiny and my makeup slides off.</li>
            <li>really keeps make up from running when hot</li>
            <li>My makeup looks fresh even in the afternoon when I would normally need to reapply everything.  </li>
            <li>totally recommend this product for special occasions!</li>
            <li>My fiance and I took engagement photos last week in some serious heat, and my makeup stayed flawless!</li>
            <li>I was leary at first because it was a little pricier than I would have liked</li>
            <li>a absolute must unless you want to get your grey on everyone at the con&lt;br /&gt;its good for sealing my regular makeup too, and yes it does smell like mint at first</li>
            <li>that being said my face doesn&#x27;t feel odd after using it, nor is there any kind of smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spray it over top of my cc cream, let it dry, then put on mattifying powder.</li>
            <li>but you have to make sure you don&#x27;t let your skin get too dry if you use it a lot.  </li>
            <li>Yet If you apply this under makeup, (what is how many makeup artist use, over primer, than used again over makeup) it can make your skin look dry</li>
            <li>It smells like pure listerine mouthwash- doNOT accidentally get any in your eyes or nose.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m allergic to self-tanners and all lotion and certain make-up</li>
            <li>Ir sprays large deops that stays in, and you can see them</li>
            <li>Upon receiving it, I was excited to try it on my oily skin (especially the T-zone) and to test it out in the hot humid, rainy weather we experience during our spring and winter seasons.</li>
            <li>I use this product to seal my light grey Snazaroo body paint, and it works really well!</li>
            <li>seal I really wanted and my oily areas were visible within 3 hours of the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I was very please with this purchase</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t spray out so much...</li>
            <li>This has really help keeping my T-zone oils at bay.</li>
            <li>I still have to blot, but not as much as I used to.</li>
            <li>This product, has really helped a lot.</li>
            <li>Really wanted it to keep eye make up in place , but did not work for the eyes.  </li>
            <li>The whole, &amp;#34;this smells like mouth wash&amp;#34; reviews need to grow up...</li>
            <li>but you could get as much staying power for setting your makeup from a can of hairspray...</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it too much yet</li>
            <li>The y look real yet</li>
            <li>5.50 on camera ready cosmetics .</li>
            <li>Really leaves me my make up in place.</li>
            <li>I have found a lot of these type of products much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Definitely appreciated this spray with the summer heat.  </li>
            <li>If you have an event, cosplay or costume that you want to ensure long-lasting makeup, this is an absolute must</li>
            <li>I really feel this gives the finishing touch after applying my makeup.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see any difference at all in how my makeup looks at the end of the day whether I use this stuff or not.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this originally as an attendant of an outdoor wedding in Austin, TX....</li>
            <li>and it really does.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I did spray some on a makeup sponge and dabbed it around my eyes to really set my liner in.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>They minty feeling it leaves is a client really wakes up the actors who fell asleep in the makeup chair.</li>
            <li>i do not recommend this really.</li>
            <li>and my makeup really stays.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work well.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>I work in a very humid climate</li>
            <li>hotter days, or when you really want it to stay on well, apply it twice.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>is absolutely a MUST HAVE in anyone&#x27;s makeup kit.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for my face makeup (foundation, blush, etc)</li>
            <li>This sealer did absolutely nothing to help my makeup stay longer.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>I have a cheap makeup sealer from ELF that I use when I can remember, but this is the trusted go-to for more important days that I don&#x27;t want my makeup to look weird hours into the event.</li>
            <li>My make up stays on the whole day and thur the night.</li>
            <li>Works very well for all day, and smells minty ^-^</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Absolutely a MUST HAVE if you don&#x27;t feel like reapplying make up throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Very tacky feeling on my face and didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my makeup.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>but it holds really well</li>
            <li>Very minty like mouthwash, but I like it.</li>
            <li>Works really well did not give it 5 stars because of the smell</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and have been on the hunt for something to control it.</li>
            <li>be sure when you are spraying initially, that you keep your eyes closed, and perhaps even use a hand to fan it dry more quickly.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin, most &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; products don&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other drugstore setting mists and they were ok.</li>
            <li>This stuff dose work better than any of the other setting sprays I have tried.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use a full spray and not just a partial spray, it makes a big difference!</li>
            <li>I first heard about Final Seal on pinterest where it said the Princesses at Disney World use it to keep their makeup fresh and stay put.</li>
            <li>This sealer came highly recommended, and as it&#x27;s cheaper than many other sealers, I gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li>a quick spritz over entire face...and make-up is set for the day, without rubbing off on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>But with the work I do, constantly running, sweating, etc, I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the product that doesn&#x27;t work or if any setting spray wouldn&#x27;t really be able to last all day while running around everywhere.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I can live without this stuff now!</li>
            <li>I think someone with a bit less oily skin will be able to wear this and not worry about it all day.</li>
            <li>This has really helped keep my make up looking really fresh, matte, and last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It was decent.</li>
            <li>It made me look 10 years older.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok I am not sure if it really does make my makeup stay all day, but every time I use it, I break out!</li>
            <li>Im really surprised to see all of these positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work as perfectly in high humidity and heat.</li>
            <li>Me: oily, dehydrated, sensitive, acne prone skin with acne scars and large pores.&lt;br /&gt;OVERVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I agree with most of the previous reviews...you need to buy a new spray bottle</li>
            <li>For the price of this product... WOW!!</li>
            <li>The smell of the spray is a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li>but once you get that fixed, I really like the way it seals my makeup on.  </li>
            <li>After I complete my morning make up I spray it on my face and my makeup is set for the whole day.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but it works great.</li>
            <li>I am a student, so normally I have makeup on for about 7+ hours</li>
            <li>This makes your make up last and look fresh.</li>
            <li>If I make sure it is THOROUGHLY dried (to the point it feels like my skin is pulling together)</li>
            <li>This stuff really  does  keep your make-up looking exactly the same all day and night.  </li>
            <li>I think the key is to make sure that you hold it far enough from your face.</li>
            <li>second day I was doing a version of Cleopatra and applied a lot of distinct liquid eyeliner lines.  </li>
            <li>and I normally go to the gym afterward</li>
            <li>but now that I have had it for several months and use it EVERY DAY, It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this on normal day to day makeup</li>
            <li>I recommend putting it in a different spray bottle, though, because the sprayer it comes with doesn&#x27;t give a fine enough mist</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about all of the reviews initially because they all seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Live and learn...</li>
            <li>My only problem with it is that it has a very high alcohol content that burns!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin pretty dry, and I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>It works pretty well at what its suppose to do, seal the makeups final look.</li>
            <li>I like to do a lot of elaborate makeup, even in my day-to-day, but I usually don&#x27;t have time or space to carry the makeup around with me to do touch ups.</li>
            <li>Final Seal really gets the job done!</li>
            <li>We had pictures to take at 7 pm &amp; thought we&#x27;d try this since it was hot outside.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I had no trouble washing off with soap &amp; water!</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin and have used different products for this issue with none of them working for me.</li>
            <li>if that doesn&#x27;t bother you then its overall a pretty good/eh product,</li>
            <li>Completely recommend!</li>
            <li>My skin used to get oily/shiny within two hours or less of putting on my makeup, now it stays shine free for two to three times longer.</li>
            <li>Works well as expected, arrived very fast!</li>
            <li>my make up stays on all day even though I have to daily spend time outside in very hot and sweaty conditions...</li>
            <li>I love using this stuff, it holds eyeshadow and makeup, as well as greasepaint and other things, as long as you&#x27;ve put a layer of powder on.</li>
            <li>I apply it in the early morning hours.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and the make up</li>
            <li>Helps reasonably  keep make up off white clothes!</li>
            <li>I was extremely surprised by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I would avoid spraying it over your eyelids, or do so by holding the bottle further away, because it makes my eyes really teary as it was drying.</li>
            <li>I have sparse eyebrows that I meticulously brush in using a technique I learned from a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li>no harsh face scrubbing to get it off.</li>
            <li>not irritate sensitive skin</li>
            <li>All it takes is me accidently brushing my eyebrow against something and it smudges and leaves me completely embarrassed and needing to run away and re-apply my brow pencil.</li>
            <li>Really Helps my makeup last all night.</li>
            <li>But it really will help your makeup last.</li>
            <li>it arrived early.</li>
            <li>It makes your make up last much longer without breaking up through the day.</li>
            <li>- I was dancing the whole night &amp; definitely didn&#x27;t want to end up with a streaky face.</li>
            <li>It does eliminate the powdery look, but doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in the way of helping my makeup last longer.</li>
            <li>Your skin will be tight and shiny and you will not want to talk or smile because you&#x27;re scared your skin will crack!</li>
            <li>and I spray 4 times: once to the right, once in the middle, once on the left</li>
            <li>It does smell like mouthwash when you spray it on, but that quickly dies down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for long days when your makeup starts to look a little wonky after a few hours--like weddings, long workdays filled with meetings, etc.</li>
            <li>originally bought Ben Nye&#x27;s Final Seal to use for my Hallowe&#x27;en makeup this year, but I&#x27;ve been using it on some of my other looks before then to get used to the product.</li>
            <li>Overall a decent product.</li>
            <li>and I tend to sweat in my facial area under high stress.</li>
            <li>That same evening, I had a cross-country race for my high school team.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone that will be outside in humid weather and doesn&#x27;t want an oily face in pictures.</li>
            <li>I let my makeup set a few minutes (mostly to let mascara dry)  </li>
            <li>this stuff seals my grey paint very well</li>
            <li>I use it over Skin79 Hot Pink BB cream in the morning and my makeup stays put and my face has a matte finish still at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>A bit spendy and can bother my eyes just slightly, but so worth it.</li>
            <li>I wore this for only 5 hours, but my make-up still looked the same as it applied, but I wasn&#x27;t very matte...</li>
            <li>I was hesitant because it seemed so much more expensive than other brands, but it was completely worth it!  </li>
            <li>It was recommended on a major beauty blog</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a base because it is kind of sticky when you first put it on, but once your whole face is done... give it a spray</li>
            <li>I also used this for some pretty serious Halloween costume makeup, and that also worked really well!  </li>
            <li>Although if you arnt careful, this stuff can really burn your eyes.</li>
            <li>It smells similar to spraying hairspray directly in your face...</li>
            <li>complaints about it are few: I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>This product is okay, but not great.</li>
            <li>My face gets super oily thru the day and every other makeup spray wears off but not this one!!!</li>
            <li>The final seal gives my foundation (especially) a little more staying power.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any experience with other brands of this type of product, but this one really burns my eyes.</li>
            <li>and it made it very flakey and chip off while my other spray makes it stay on longer.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it can give a slight shine when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>but I understand what people are saying about the sprayer - it comes out pretty heavy</li>
            <li>, I have sensitive dry skin and it does not dry it out whatsoever</li>
            <li>I really have oily skin, this product make my face less oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a theater actress and keeping stage makeup on under hot lights is not easy.</li>
            <li>I wanted something cheaper than my usual Urban Decay setting spray but trust me, its worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Be sure to only use a little bit, otherwise it can appear &amp;#34;flaky,&amp;#34; with my experience at least.</li>

            <li> Heading to a event, makeup looked great.</li>
            <li> Works great however the sprayer leaves droplets on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It helped maintain the paint I applied to my face, which was a great thing.</li>
            <li> Lol.</li>
            <li> Great.</li>
            <li> Shipping speed was great.</li>
            <li> Works great with Snazaroo.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as great as the Graftobian  Make-up Spray, which I&#x27;m about to re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> It was nothing like the great reviews I read anout it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> The minty smell is great to me.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT...</li>
            <li> it smelled really great</li>
            <li> So now it works great giving an even mist all over my face.</li>
            <li> I would buy more if I run out!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! !</li>
            <li> This spray is amazing!</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant minty smell and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  </li>
            <li> Seals paint very easily (even when it is Snazaroo) and makes it refuse to come off!</li>
            <li> To be fair</li>
            <li> But it does feel good on my face.</li>
            <li> It does do a good job when I can use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good for sealing your makeup.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good makeup sealant.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it does a good job of keeping my make-up from fading.  </li>
            <li> and I am good to go all day without re-applying.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of that.</li>
            <li> The product itself wasent as good as i thought, either that or</li>
            <li> The product was actually really good.</li>
            <li> This ia a good product</li>
            <li> (In a good way, at least).&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my Homestuck cosplays and it seals it to perfection.</li>
            <li> Smells good</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this would work great on someone who&#x27;s skin is not so oily.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, for the most part of the day makeup stays on....</li>
            <li> Great stuff over cream make-up :)</li>
            <li> Love this setting spray!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great!</li>
            <li> Love this item, the way it works, it doesn&#x27;t smudge my makeup at all and is waterproof!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> But if you wear powdered makeup, I&#x27;m sure this would be the bomb!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This is magic!</li>
            <li> so much better than ANYTHING else out there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this spray a couple times and I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> and my makeup never moved and looked amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing item and</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells nice and sets your makeup until you wash it off.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best !</li>
            <li> My review is honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> It was kind of pricey</li>
            <li> Fast delivery great product!</li>
            <li> Also has a nice minty smell.</li>
            <li> The spray is lightweight, invisible, and the mint smell is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> I have reduced transfer which is nice, so I rate it three stars instead of four.  </li>
            <li> It is fairly effective.</li>
            <li> The smell of it kind of grosses me out.</li>
            <li> And when I pray it on, it isn&#x27;t like a nice mist.</li>
            <li> Minty smell is nice, no offputting taste.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste good, of course, but the product itself is okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it made my makeup stay flawless for a good 8-10 hours, even if the humidity outside was making me sweat</li>
            <li> You can very easily get water spots on your face.  </li>
            <li> I also love the minty smell and feel refreshing and wakes u up in the am!</li>
            <li> This by far works best for my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> So far this is the best product I have found for me.</li>
            <li> I have used MAC and Model in a bottle and this stuff is much more effective.</li>
            <li> Its actually a nice refreshing smell and does not linger.</li>
            <li> but this on by far is the best.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and there was a good amount for a good price.</li>
            <li> it works very very well and has a nice minty smell to it!</li>
            <li> a bit high priced for what it is, but it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> even my sprayer misted the product on really nice and lightly.</li>
            <li> make sure you spray and walk into the mist.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied.</li>
            <li> wash and oil blot sheets keep my make up looking more matte.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than those points, I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found anything better to do what this Matte Makeup Sealer does.</li>
            <li> but I was not as pleased with the staying power it provided.</li>
            <li> it seems to work better for me.  </li>
            <li> This setting spray is awesome, I like it better than the Urban Decay all nighter and its cheaper too!!  </li>
            <li> goodness I was able to try someone else&#x27;s before mine arrived, and I ended up returning my unused product.  </li>
            <li> By the end of the day I would look like I didn&#x27;t have on any at all, now I am quite pleased that I still look &#x27;made up&#x27; at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> This is MOST DEFINITELY the BEST makeup sealer out there!!!!</li>
            <li> It does work better</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> My makeup more than lasted though.</li>
            <li> If I spray after, it lasts mostly all day.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll be adding baby powder/hairspray on top just to be sure I&#x27;m not getting my make up everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it</li>
            <li> She was extremely pleased in the end.</li>
            <li> I love this for school</li>
            <li> I sweat more than any woman I know so this stuff</li>
            <li> BUT OMG seriously so glad I purchased it after all</li>
            <li> Love it makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Love this finishing spray.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it works better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> ..kept me matte for most of the day.</li>
            <li> with suck up your oil like a sponge then I spray on the sealer to make me even more matte.</li>
            <li> I felt like this in no way made my makeup stay on any better than when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wedding and it works fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love how it helps my makeup stay in place.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Looks great and really seals the paint in well.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> My make-up stays on better without it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok if you spray your face and buff your makeup in with it.</li>
            <li> Then its ok.</li>
            <li> but when I use it my makeup stays on for most of the day.</li>
            <li> ,  final seal keeps my makeup matte and it looks great for hours upon hours!!</li>
            <li> Works even better when you spray before and after makeup application</li>
            <li> This one smells minty but it does keep your makeup in place a lot better than others.</li>
            <li> its much better.</li>
            <li> I love this sealer.  </li>
            <li> I received a lot of compliments on my makeup.  :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> You may like the way it looks, but if you don&#x27;t just put a tad bit of powder on top of it and it disappears with no problem.</li>
            <li> so be sure to moisturize before.</li>
            <li> It has an refreshing mint smell</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t spray too close to the face.</li>
            <li> sure what its purpose is.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly, just beware of coating it too thickly, especially around your eyes</li>
            <li> Worked as well as the All- NIghter maybe even better.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant peppermint scent when you first spray it but goes away after the product dries.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly !!!!!</li>
            <li> but I used this on my special effects make up and face paint (not the crappy kind either)</li>
            <li> The most notable was on Halloween, when I painted my face with cheap costume store makeup that would surely run without a sealer.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and great for costume make up and daily use!</li>
            <li> The first day I did a fairly normal make-up style and was really impressed at how it lasted.  </li>
            <li> Great for when you&#x27;re too busy to stop and do touch ups.</li>
            <li> The spray is refreshing when you spray it on and it makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> It will, however, keep your makeup in place and looking flawless all day in every other scenario.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is great!</li>
            <li> My make up is easily cleaned off with a make up remover wipe,</li>
            <li> My makeup didn&#x27;t rub off all night, but then easily washed off as soon as I got in the shower.  </li>
            <li> My makeup now lasts, easily, 12 hours with NO problem.</li>
            <li> I can easily use an oil-blotting sheet (or two) to control the oil and shine, but thankfully I no longer have to worry about reapplying makeup as well.  </li>
            <li> I live in Orlando, FL and was impressed when I met a Disney Princess who highly recommended this product for &amp;#34;makeup that won&#x27;t go anywhere&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I remember wearing this in high school for school school plays so that our makeup would not smudge under the bright lights.</li>
            <li> It works pretty amazingly for the price even though you can get it on the Ben Nye website for cheaper.</li>
            <li> It has a nice minty scent to it when you first spray it on but</li>
            <li> I am really pleased that I bought this and have started wearing it whenever I wear full makeup.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not bad at all, just minty and refreshing.</li>
            <li> If you can, I would suggest getting a bottle that sprays out fine mist.</li>
            <li> Scent was fine,</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and using this product along with finishing powder over top works wonders!</li>
            <li> which for me is HUGE.  </li>
            <li> I am still on the search for a product that will keep my makeup sealed and my T-zone oil free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Definitely NOT trying to be a MUA just want great products..</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting total oil control and matte-ifying results, it&#x27;s a great makeup sealant</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy on the skin, so it may not be best for every day use (although, i use it almost every day..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few make up setting sprays &amp; this is the best.</li>
            <li> but it definitely does a great job.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic with snazaroo, and ben nye paint.</li>
            <li> It also kinda makes your skin look a bit shiny in the light, but doesn&#x27;t affect what your makeup looks like.</li>
            <li> It also did not keep me matte free all day (or even 4 hours of the day.)</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> (if you squeeze your eyes you wont get as good of coverage in the eye area and its more likely to get into your eyes!)&lt;br /&gt;-On</li>
            <li> Works excellently, I often touch my face after putting on makeup and this helped it stay all day long - used first for my wedding events</li>
            <li> Also, it seems to keep eyeshadow from creasing if you make sure to apply it right at your eyelids.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I&#x27;ve found other uses for it as well.</li>
            <li> but so far it seals really well, no stickiness, just a good seal!</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long, and the minty smell is very refreshing!</li>
            <li> Totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Works great esp when you have a long day and don&#x27;t have time to touch up your makeup.</li>
            <li> Despite some pre-ceremony sweating, the makeup stayed in place and looked fresh!  </li>
            <li> Okay, so this is my first time trying this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my spray bottle is defective, but the sealer squirts out like a super soaker instead of a fine mist.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin and usually get 5 hours maximum wear from the best of foundations.</li>
            <li> It may seem pricey but it is definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Keeps makeup fresh all day!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you&#x27;re going to use any kind of full body makeup/paint.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to purchase for halloween.  </li>
            <li> I am very oily, and I live in a warm climate (the Bahamas) to boot!</li>
            <li> It was actually a huge shock to look into the bathroom mirror after lunch the first day I tried this and see that I still had makeup on!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially amazing when going away for the weekend or long days when I will be too busy &amp; just don&#x27;t want to have to even THINK about my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works fairly well in controlling oil and making my makeup last all day.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my sister after I complimented her on how smooth and fresh her makeup looked on her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I bought it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to avoid having to do makeup touch-ups during their day or evening.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love it, but it irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> While it does not completely correct the issue of my smudged eyebrows, it does keep the pencil on much much better and keeps it from becoming oily and smuding (for the most part).</li>
            <li> I have yet to use it for a full day at a convention, but my makeup didn&#x27;t run or rub off at all, even on the neck where the shirt collar rubs a lot.</li>
            <li> Recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like having their clothes full of foundation!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it&#x27;s a minty scent-LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the spray is very erratic, and I find you have to use more than the couple of quick sprays recommended to ensure an even coating.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping as well, i love this.</li>
            <li> It is sticky at first but not a bad product!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really strong at first, but that does go away as it dries.</li>
            <li> I may shop around for some more sprays that control oil too, but I&#x27;m overall thrilled with this product and believe it delivers exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper than some of the other sealers and works great.</li>
            <li> It smells so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER sensitive/dry skin</li>
            <li> It has a minty scent that is inoffensive and quickly disappears.</li>
            <li> also use a quick spritz now</li>
            <li> I have nice full eyebrows until about midway through where it should continue, but the hair is so sparse that you can barely see it.</li>
            <li> I quickly bought a bottle.</li>
            <li> Super sticky, it doesnt work</li>
            <li> Also quick shipping arrived before estimated date</li>
            <li> Does its job extraordinarily.</li>
            <li> So I ran my race with my spooky costume makeup,  finished in 3rd place, broke my personal record, and the paint had stayed on PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li> Comes off very easily with make up remover and has not dried out my skin or caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> I will use it for special occasions, but my sensitive skin can&#x27;t handle it more than once a week.</li>
            <li> The 2oz bottle should last me a long while too, perfect</li>
            <li> I knew it would be Hot and Humid!  </li>
            <li> Worked wonders, and my makeup did not move, given the amount of dancing and how hot it was out all day!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried that many different ones because I liked this one so much from the first try.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it has helped greatly.</li>
            <li> A light mist on your face after applying your makeup when you are done getting ready in the morning</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> For what it does, the price is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products.. including Model in a Bottle, Urban Decay&#x27;s All Nighter &amp; Oil Free Shine.</li>
            <li> (at least in my opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product with my own money and of my own volition.</li>
            <li> hot sun,  full wind.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it, though and think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh smell almost like mouthwash.</li>
            <li> makeup rarely lasts an hour after I leave the house.  </li>
            <li> Plus it smells minty fresh.</li>
            <li> Its absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li> but it is worth every penny</li>
            <li> The sealer can last all day and withstand sweat and has a nice minty scent.</li>
            <li> , im super oily only a couple hours into the day, and this makes my makeup look nice and fresh pretty much all day!</li>
            <li> When I get home in the late afternoon my makeup still looks good!</li>
            <li> and this really helps keep it under control while keeping my make-up looking fresh all day too!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I didn&#x27;t use it right</li>
            <li> This is the first time I can say a setting spray really did keep my makeup on my face all day!!</li>
            <li> Refreshing to the skin , it works like no other and I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many setting sprays in the past and love Ben Nye products, so was excited about this one.</li>
            <li> I kept the same smooth finish I love about that make up much longer into the day.  </li>
            <li> Made the oil more apparent - thank</li>
            <li> The scent is very refreshing and even though you might feel like your sweating your really not.  </li>
            <li> So push down fully and it should be good.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed and as a matter of fact have decided to order several more to keep at the ready and even give to family and friends.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, from the minty fresh scent to the lasting power.</li>
            <li> However, if you prep well and spray carefully you&#x27;ll love this product!</li>
            <li> Just wipe them in softly and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> the spray is kind of sticky, by the end of the day my makeup looked very dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Good for a little bit</li>
            <li> The first time I used this (borrowed)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> If you are on any skin or acne medications, be aware it will increase dryness and irritation.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I needed something to help keep my cosplay make-up sealed and on during the hot heat and sweating.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> that also makes it burn/tingle a bit when I first spray it on my face.</li>
            <li> Urban decay setting spray is cheaper, and better</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> I really like it!  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more when my first bottle is done.</li>
            <li> Very Speedy Delivery!</li>
            <li> I tended to need a lot more than necessary.....</li>
            <li> You will most likely still need to blot if you get oily, but even if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re face will stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t love about it, was that it made my skin breakout if I wore it too often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light-feeling liquid and has a fresh, minty scent.  </li>
            <li> This is the first one I buy.</li>
            <li> Got married in North Carolina on the ocean.  </li>
            <li> The smell at first reminds me of a minty mouth wash smell</li>
            <li> I think the urban decay brand did a better job.</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li> I do it one more time in the middle.  </li>
            <li> My first time using this product was for my sister-in-laws wedding.  </li>
            <li> The wedding was outdoors on a hot August day.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Final Seal Matte Makeup Sealer.</li>
            <li> I squirt it twice when i am done and it stays put, and matte most of the entire day.</li>
            <li> Now, it isn&#x27;t perfect for me, but I feel I&#x27;m an exception - the oiliness of my face is, sadly, apparently incurable.</li>
            <li> It worked a lot better than my Urban Decay make-up sealer.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The product really does keep your makeup fresh.</li>
            <li> So far I spray my face lightly before applying my foundation and again after all makeup has been applied.  </li>
            <li> I had better luck using Aqua Net to seal my body makeup.</li>
            <li> The spray did exactly what it was supposed to do, and my make-up was still on at the end of the night.</li>
            <li> Works way better than urban decay makeup setting spray.  </li>
            <li> The makeup doesn&#x27;t stay 100% but it holds pretty well.</li>
            <li> I first learned of this product on Pinterest.</li>
            <li> When you first get it.</li>
            <li> I tried it twice to make sure that it was the final seal that was making my skin break out.</li>
            <li> Cuz that&#x27;s exactly what it smells like.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and spray a light spray all over your face, let dry and lightly mist again.</li>
            <li> This is great for those in pageants, performances and everyday makeup!!</li>
            <li> I live in the sunny Caribbean and usually do a full face makeup</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and my makeup sweats off so quickly.</li>
            <li> My real tests of it are some concerts and Hallowe&#x27;en parties happening next week, but I&#x27;m confident that this product will keep my makeup in place.</li>
            <li> Holds make up in  place all day long with a refreshing mint smell when first applied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot better than the thick primers they sell, and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, once you spritz a bit of this product on your face after applying makeup your face truly looks smooth and fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> This sealer works pretty good but sprays on very heavy.  </li>
            <li> my make-up stayed matte all day and barely rubbed off, which is a huge problem for me.</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin, so after a couple hours my skin is usually really greasy and shiny and my makeup slides off.</li>
            <li> really keeps make up from running when hot</li>
            <li> My makeup looks fresh even in the afternoon when I would normally need to reapply everything.  </li>
            <li> totally recommend this product for special occasions!</li>
            <li> My fiance and I took engagement photos last week in some serious heat, and my makeup stayed flawless!</li>
            <li> I was leary at first because it was a little pricier than I would have liked</li>
            <li> a absolute must unless you want to get your grey on everyone at the con&lt;br /&gt;its good for sealing my regular makeup too, and yes it does smell like mint at first</li>
            <li> that being said my face doesn&#x27;t feel odd after using it, nor is there any kind of smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spray it over top of my cc cream, let it dry, then put on mattifying powder.</li>
            <li> but you have to make sure you don&#x27;t let your skin get too dry if you use it a lot.  </li>
            <li> Yet If you apply this under makeup, (what is how many makeup artist use, over primer, than used again over makeup) it can make your skin look dry</li>
            <li> It smells like pure listerine mouthwash- doNOT accidentally get any in your eyes or nose.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m allergic to self-tanners and all lotion and certain make-up</li>
            <li> Ir sprays large deops that stays in, and you can see them</li>
            <li> Upon receiving it, I was excited to try it on my oily skin (especially the T-zone) and to test it out in the hot humid, rainy weather we experience during our spring and winter seasons.</li>
            <li> I use this product to seal my light grey Snazaroo body paint, and it works really well!</li>
            <li> seal I really wanted and my oily areas were visible within 3 hours of the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I was very please with this purchase</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t spray out so much...</li>
            <li> This has really help keeping my T-zone oils at bay.</li>
            <li> I still have to blot, but not as much as I used to.</li>
            <li> This product, has really helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Really wanted it to keep eye make up in place , but did not work for the eyes.  </li>
            <li> The whole, &amp;#34;this smells like mouth wash&amp;#34; reviews need to grow up...</li>
            <li> but you could get as much staying power for setting your makeup from a can of hairspray...</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it too much yet</li>
            <li> The y look real yet</li>
            <li> 5.50 on camera ready cosmetics .</li>
            <li> Really leaves me my make up in place.</li>
            <li> I have found a lot of these type of products much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Definitely appreciated this spray with the summer heat.  </li>
            <li> If you have an event, cosplay or costume that you want to ensure long-lasting makeup, this is an absolute must</li>
            <li> I really feel this gives the finishing touch after applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any difference at all in how my makeup looks at the end of the day whether I use this stuff or not.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this originally as an attendant of an outdoor wedding in Austin, TX....</li>
            <li> and it really does.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I did spray some on a makeup sponge and dabbed it around my eyes to really set my liner in.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> They minty feeling it leaves is a client really wakes up the actors who fell asleep in the makeup chair.</li>
            <li> i do not recommend this really.</li>
            <li> and my makeup really stays.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work well.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> I work in a very humid climate</li>
            <li> hotter days, or when you really want it to stay on well, apply it twice.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> is absolutely a MUST HAVE in anyone&#x27;s makeup kit.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for my face makeup (foundation, blush, etc)</li>
            <li> This sealer did absolutely nothing to help my makeup stay longer.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> I have a cheap makeup sealer from ELF that I use when I can remember, but this is the trusted go-to for more important days that I don&#x27;t want my makeup to look weird hours into the event.</li>
            <li> My make up stays on the whole day and thur the night.</li>
            <li> Works very well for all day, and smells minty ^-^</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Absolutely a MUST HAVE if you don&#x27;t feel like reapplying make up throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Very tacky feeling on my face and didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my makeup.  </li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> but it holds really well</li>
            <li> Very minty like mouthwash, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Works really well did not give it 5 stars because of the smell</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and have been on the hunt for something to control it.</li>
            <li> be sure when you are spraying initially, that you keep your eyes closed, and perhaps even use a hand to fan it dry more quickly.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, most &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; products don&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other drugstore setting mists and they were ok.</li>
            <li> This stuff dose work better than any of the other setting sprays I have tried.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use a full spray and not just a partial spray, it makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> I first heard about Final Seal on pinterest where it said the Princesses at Disney World use it to keep their makeup fresh and stay put.</li>
            <li> This sealer came highly recommended, and as it&#x27;s cheaper than many other sealers, I gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li> a quick spritz over entire face...and make-up is set for the day, without rubbing off on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> But with the work I do, constantly running, sweating, etc, I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the product that doesn&#x27;t work or if any setting spray wouldn&#x27;t really be able to last all day while running around everywhere.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can live without this stuff now!</li>
            <li> I think someone with a bit less oily skin will be able to wear this and not worry about it all day.</li>
            <li> This has really helped keep my make up looking really fresh, matte, and last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It was decent.</li>
            <li> It made me look 10 years older.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I am not sure if it really does make my makeup stay all day, but every time I use it, I break out!</li>
            <li> Im really surprised to see all of these positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work as perfectly in high humidity and heat.</li>
            <li> Me: oily, dehydrated, sensitive, acne prone skin with acne scars and large pores.&lt;br /&gt;OVERVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the previous reviews...you need to buy a new spray bottle</li>
            <li> For the price of this product... WOW!!</li>
            <li> The smell of the spray is a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li> but once you get that fixed, I really like the way it seals my makeup on.  </li>
            <li> After I complete my morning make up I spray it on my face and my makeup is set for the whole day.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it works great.</li>
            <li> I am a student, so normally I have makeup on for about 7+ hours</li>
            <li> This makes your make up last and look fresh.</li>
            <li> If I make sure it is THOROUGHLY dried (to the point it feels like my skin is pulling together)</li>
            <li> This stuff really  does  keep your make-up looking exactly the same all day and night.  </li>
            <li> I think the key is to make sure that you hold it far enough from your face.</li>
            <li> second day I was doing a version of Cleopatra and applied a lot of distinct liquid eyeliner lines.  </li>
            <li> and I normally go to the gym afterward</li>
            <li> but now that I have had it for several months and use it EVERY DAY, It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this on normal day to day makeup</li>
            <li> I recommend putting it in a different spray bottle, though, because the sprayer it comes with doesn&#x27;t give a fine enough mist</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about all of the reviews initially because they all seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Live and learn...</li>
            <li> My only problem with it is that it has a very high alcohol content that burns!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin pretty dry, and I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> It works pretty well at what its suppose to do, seal the makeups final look.</li>
            <li> I like to do a lot of elaborate makeup, even in my day-to-day, but I usually don&#x27;t have time or space to carry the makeup around with me to do touch ups.</li>
            <li> Final Seal really gets the job done!</li>
            <li> We had pictures to take at 7 pm &amp; thought we&#x27;d try this since it was hot outside.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I had no trouble washing off with soap &amp; water!</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin and have used different products for this issue with none of them working for me.</li>
            <li> if that doesn&#x27;t bother you then its overall a pretty good/eh product,</li>
            <li> Completely recommend!</li>
            <li> My skin used to get oily/shiny within two hours or less of putting on my makeup, now it stays shine free for two to three times longer.</li>
            <li> Works well as expected, arrived very fast!</li>
            <li> my make up stays on all day even though I have to daily spend time outside in very hot and sweaty conditions...</li>
            <li> I love using this stuff, it holds eyeshadow and makeup, as well as greasepaint and other things, as long as you&#x27;ve put a layer of powder on.</li>
            <li> I apply it in the early morning hours.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and the make up</li>
            <li> Helps reasonably  keep make up off white clothes!</li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would avoid spraying it over your eyelids, or do so by holding the bottle further away, because it makes my eyes really teary as it was drying.</li>
            <li> I have sparse eyebrows that I meticulously brush in using a technique I learned from a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> no harsh face scrubbing to get it off.</li>
            <li> not irritate sensitive skin</li>
            <li> All it takes is me accidently brushing my eyebrow against something and it smudges and leaves me completely embarrassed and needing to run away and re-apply my brow pencil.</li>
            <li> Really Helps my makeup last all night.</li>
            <li> But it really will help your makeup last.</li>
            <li> it arrived early.</li>
            <li> It makes your make up last much longer without breaking up through the day.</li>
            <li> - I was dancing the whole night &amp; definitely didn&#x27;t want to end up with a streaky face.</li>
            <li> It does eliminate the powdery look, but doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in the way of helping my makeup last longer.</li>
            <li> Your skin will be tight and shiny and you will not want to talk or smile because you&#x27;re scared your skin will crack!</li>
            <li> and I spray 4 times: once to the right, once in the middle, once on the left</li>
            <li> It does smell like mouthwash when you spray it on, but that quickly dies down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for long days when your makeup starts to look a little wonky after a few hours--like weddings, long workdays filled with meetings, etc.</li>
            <li> originally bought Ben Nye&#x27;s Final Seal to use for my Hallowe&#x27;en makeup this year, but I&#x27;ve been using it on some of my other looks before then to get used to the product.</li>
            <li> Overall a decent product.</li>
            <li> and I tend to sweat in my facial area under high stress.</li>
            <li> That same evening, I had a cross-country race for my high school team.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone that will be outside in humid weather and doesn&#x27;t want an oily face in pictures.</li>
            <li> I let my makeup set a few minutes (mostly to let mascara dry)  </li>
            <li> this stuff seals my grey paint very well</li>
            <li> I use it over Skin79 Hot Pink BB cream in the morning and my makeup stays put and my face has a matte finish still at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> A bit spendy and can bother my eyes just slightly, but so worth it.</li>
            <li> I wore this for only 5 hours, but my make-up still looked the same as it applied, but I wasn&#x27;t very matte...</li>
            <li> I was hesitant because it seemed so much more expensive than other brands, but it was completely worth it!  </li>
            <li> It was recommended on a major beauty blog</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a base because it is kind of sticky when you first put it on, but once your whole face is done... give it a spray</li>
            <li> I also used this for some pretty serious Halloween costume makeup, and that also worked really well!  </li>
            <li> Although if you arnt careful, this stuff can really burn your eyes.</li>
            <li> It smells similar to spraying hairspray directly in your face...</li>
            <li> complaints about it are few: I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, but not great.</li>
            <li> My face gets super oily thru the day and every other makeup spray wears off but not this one!!!</li>
            <li> The final seal gives my foundation (especially) a little more staying power.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any experience with other brands of this type of product, but this one really burns my eyes.</li>
            <li> and it made it very flakey and chip off while my other spray makes it stay on longer.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it can give a slight shine when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> but I understand what people are saying about the sprayer - it comes out pretty heavy</li>
            <li> , I have sensitive dry skin and it does not dry it out whatsoever</li>
            <li> I really have oily skin, this product make my face less oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a theater actress and keeping stage makeup on under hot lights is not easy.</li>
            <li> I wanted something cheaper than my usual Urban Decay setting spray but trust me, its worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Be sure to only use a little bit, otherwise it can appear &amp;#34;flaky,&amp;#34; with my experience at least.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and live in the southern US, so my makeup tends to just melt off in a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I only use power and blush, so my face makeup doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts and this didn&#x27;t clog my pores or feel uncomfortable like my skin couldn&#x27;t breathe.</li>
            <li> but apparently that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s suppose to smell since a lot of other reviewers from different sites explain it as.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wait long enough and my eyelids kept trying to stick!</li>
            <li> Makes your makeup last long onstage under lights.</li>
            <li> But it does make makeup last a long time.</li>
            <li> The menthol in this product can dry out your skin, especially if you have dry/combination like me.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT attractive or princess worthy.</li>
            <li> open your eyes until its dry!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating because no matter what I try, they rub off soooo easily.</li>
            <li> If you have ever come home after a long day or nite out to discover that the face you put on in the morning has somehow workied itself into a smeared puddle of shine, this is something you have got to try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bummer because the biggest part of my desire for this product was to hold my eyeshadow during long events without reapplication.</li>
            <li> The Ben Nye Final Sealer arrived faster than expected and it does smell like mouthwash</li>
            <li> I used this product to seal my make-up for long days at cosplay conventions.  </li>
            <li> I used this to seal grey make up for a homestuck cosplay.</li>
            <li> the smell doesn&#x27;t linger so you don&#x27;t smell like mint all day long.</li>
            <li> I work long shifts, and this helps keep my makeup in place all day.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long</li>
            <li> and I was just about to come to terms that I would always have to completely reapply my makeup every few hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not completely water proof</li>
            <li> setting spray holds my makeup in place ALL DAY LONG!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Model in a Bottle, E.L.F., Urban Decay (and 1 other</li>
            <li> When I get my other makeup, I&#x27;ll edit this post with how the quality is, but seeing as how it&#x27;s Ben Nye, I have total confidence in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makeup stays in place all day long!</li>
            <li> some reason, it causes snazaroo to flake/crack and dry</li>
            <li> We would just spray it on the face, let it dry, and then spray it again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then you have to fan it dry.</li>
            <li> Burns like fire when you spray it on, but the burning only last a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I use bare minerals and was a little worried it would make it look clumpy.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely oily/greasy skin &amp; live in the deep south where the humidity is at least 200% -my</li>
            <li> My make-up usually lasts anyway without a primer, but with summer approaching and my vacation, I definitely don&#x27;t want to have to do any touch ups.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting or make my skin feel dry, but be careful around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I used to have to use oil blotting sheets half way through the day and since starting this I haven&#x27;t had to do that.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Final Seal Makeup sealer in hopes that it would alleviate this atleast slightly.</li>
            <li> I used it for a long convention day while I was doing extreme costume make up</li>
            <li> and then if I just want my everyday makeup to last through a long day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone wanting to seal any type of makeup!</li>
            <li> It helps any makeup stay on and not rub off onto clothing, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone planning on doing a cosplay that requires wearing any body paint or heavy makeup.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help with makeup coming of as expected.</li>
            <li> learned that trick from a drag queen...</li>
            <li> Also the product does work as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m military stationed in Japan</li>
            <li> This product arrived sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a methol/peppermint smell to it and when trying to hurry up before we left for a wedding, I sprayed it a little too carelessly and shot myself right in the eye with it.</li>
            <li> It has a strong minty smell but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I get irritated with is if you push down on the nozzle too lighltly, it sprays out splotchy and you can see 1 or 2 little wet dots on yours face witch then cakes the powder in that spot.</li>
            <li> after trying other brands with minimal satisfaction, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff define deals my makeup, I really like it except that there is something minty it it which he&#x27;s into my eyes and stings, so that&#x27;s pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> A little does a long way.</li>
            <li> Oh and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> get this in your eyes, burns like unicorn glitter to the eye, just keep them closed for a few seconds after to spray to give your face a chance to dry.</li>
            <li> Even with the aid of setting powder and primer, my makeup usually ends up coming off after several hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has kept my makeup in place during shopping, teaching days, bonfires, and other activities.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that this product does anything other than smell like mint?</li>
            <li> that other products I have used but could use a finer sprayer for application.</li>
            <li> I have not compared this to any other finishing spray.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how it stacks up to other brands.  </li>
            <li> The bride,  my mother-in-law,  my other sister-in-law and myself all used it before the wedding.  </li>
            <li> Unlike all the other makeup setting sprays I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me...was trying to use to cover small red scar with makeup but still came off within an hour</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive for the amount provided.</li>
            <li> I will not repurchase this product because I believe there are other setting sprays that work just as well without the horrendous smell.</li>
            <li> I usually use Urban Decay Setting Spray</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it actually works.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a bad or crazy overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount every day so, although the bottle is somewhat small, it last a really really long time!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so, don&#x27;t be heavy handed when using it.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that it doesn&#x27;t last all day completely.</li>
            <li> So not worth it to me</li>
            <li> I just spray my face once on  each side &amp; leave my eyes closed for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> A few spritzes and your makeup will stay put for hours, even very heavy theatrical makeup will stay put when you&#x27;re performing and sweating.</li>
            <li> I have tried other setting sprays and nothing compares to this stuff!</li>
            <li> but it quickly goes away and is by no means an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> A little touch up done half way through each day around the nose, and other oily areas.</li>
            <li> Definitely did wonders for me during this hot muggy summer!</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have a minty sticky mouthwashy smell/quality, but that fades after it dries (which is 30 seconds or less.)</li>
            <li> It has a slight sting to the face when drying.</li>
            <li> Held their makeup in place all day and half the night.</li>
            <li> seriously cannot praise this enough!  </li>
            <li> My skin is much less greasy looking</li>
            <li> I got this to seal my Mehron metallic and black paints for a robot musician costume.</li>
            <li> It kept my makeup in place and also saved me from looking like a sweaty drenched oily mess at concerts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Can feel tight on the skin</li>
            <li> if I get a little wet, it smeared my makeup, it should have been water proof :/</li>
            <li> I will be a life long user, totally stepped up my makeup game!</li>
            <li> Wish the sprayer was a little finer; it tends to come out in sprays that leave spots of it on your face.</li>
            <li> i found my skin flaking a little bit after the work day finished.</li>
            <li> It feels a little sticky like that too.</li>
            <li> my make up came off just a little bit.</li>
            <li> The sprayer sometimes gets a little clogged and the product doesn&#x27;t spray on evenly but a tissue works well to blend it in.</li>
            <li> If face seems a little chalky rub face with fingers to blend in.</li>
            <li> but since I now work in the heat some of the day, I needed something a little stronger.</li>
            <li> It helped a little but it felt like i was just putting non arisol hair spray on my face.</li>
            <li> and it burned a little.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that is a little expensive compared to the other</li>
            <li> However, it can sometimes spray out a little harshly, a bit like a squirt instead of a mist.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday now.</li>
            <li> it smells like mouth wash and the spray is not light it sprays heavydrops</li>
            <li> but I still find myself reaching for my blotting sheets every few hours.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> so when it dries, you can see splotches of dried product on the face.</li>
            <li> It hurts when in your eyes, but goes away in a few seconds.</li>
            <li> product does leave a matte finish after I spray a few times</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this product for anything from performance/stage make-up to everyday wear.</li>
            <li> After you stop using it for a while then try using it everyday again, you&#x27;ll notice your makeup looks cracked around the chin and nose area.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who cosplays Homestuck trolls or any character with an odd skin tone!</li>
            <li> Keeps makeup in place and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or stiff feeling to the face.  </li>
            <li> It smells horrible and burns my sensitive skin, with the first ingredient being alcohol.</li>
            <li> I had a little accident and ended up scratching my nose, leaving a small scar.  </li>
            <li> By mid-day my eye makeup was completely dull or, simply faded to the point where the colors looked sloppy.</li>
            <li> I spray a small amount on my finger, and dab it onto the spot.</li>
            <li> so I would spray it a few times just to get used to the amount that comes out before putting it on your face!</li>
            <li> Your makeup will not come off all day or all night after a few sprays of this stuff!</li>
            <li> This Ben Nye Final Seal really is a game changer !</li>
            <li> If your face is relaxed it usually doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes</li>
            <li> you will random circles of make up left.</li>
            <li> Not sure how that would work...</li>
            <li> I recommend anyone with oily skin looking for a solution to the midmorning oil slick to try this.</li>
            <li> and I mean a few times too,</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel dry and weird.  </li>
            <li> Which is difficult not to do because with the spray bottle, the product comes out in a stream line, not a gentle mist.</li>
            <li> but when I sprayed it ONCE, it left this obvious shine on my face which I hated.</li>
            <li> It adds at least 6-8 hrs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t as bad a I expected from other reviewers and</li>
            <li> and I mean no disrespect</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I have not tried makeup sealer before and other products advertising to help with oily skin have disapointed me.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I had an unfortunate issue with very bad acne that has since cleared up, but left me with only half of my eyebrows on both sides.</li>
            <li> With this little bottle here for 15.50+  with shipping, sad</li>
            <li> Not good for eye-make up.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> but it looks worse through out the day.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it yet wearing false lashes, but I would probably hold my hand over those to avoid spraying them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can have a full face of makeup and go to sleep (terrible, I know, but I was drunk!)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I cannot say it worked as well as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> I even fell asleep in my makeup last night (awful, I know)</li>
            <li> I hate to waste money, so</li>
            <li> I would buy again, though it&#x27;s a tad too expensive</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Nothing was wrong with the delivery or shipment however the product doesn&#x27;t work as well as told.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these lines smeared halfway through the day and my make-up was coming off when rubbed.  </li>
            <li> I had to re-do my makeup and was not happy!</li>
            <li> i was using it wrong.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try it out, but unfortunately the makeup I ordered to use this with hasn&#x27;t arrived yet.</li>
            <li> it does keep the makeup on, but it leaves a weird sheen that almost cracks through out the day.</li>
            <li> However, it has a grotesque smell of mouth wash.</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;m crazy).</li>
            <li> They said it stinks so hold your breath while spritzing...</li>
            <li> I saw the bad reviews but decided to try it for myself.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have a minty mouthwash/toothpaste smell to it, but it&#x27;s necessarily a bad thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if I may have just received a bad one.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work, but noticed that after each use my skin had a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> This stuff seals my makeup like crazy!</li>
            <li> Ben Nye, you have disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I hate to say this</li>
            <li> In all honesty, this product is awful.</li>
            <li> Just terrible,</li>
            <li> Helped mine and my husbands makeup stay on from 10 am until 2 am, despite insane heat and sweating.  </li>
            <li> HORRIBLE MOUTHWASH SMELL.</li>
            <li> Awful!!!!</li>
            <li> Also the fragrance is horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I find it works best if I spray it b4 and after makeup application for my oily skin</li>
            <li> Great product. My fiance and I took engagement photos last week in some serious heat, and my makeup stayed flawless! be sure when you are spraying initially, that you keep your eyes closed, and perhaps even use a hand to fan it dry more quickly. The first time I used this (borrowed) I didn&#x27;t wait long enough and my eyelids kept trying to stick! LOL</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product. I am ALWAYS a oily in my t-zone. Not anymore. Great stuff. Just don&#x27;t get it in your eye (not that I did that or anything). ;)</li>
            <li> I live in Orlando, FL and was impressed when I met a Disney Princess who highly recommended this product for &amp;#34;makeup that won&#x27;t go anywhere&amp;#34;. Upon receiving it, I was excited to try it on my oily skin (especially the T-zone) and to test it out in the hot humid, rainy weather we experience during our spring and winter seasons. Unfortunately, I cannot say it worked as well as I had anticipated. I never got the &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; seal I really wanted and my oily areas were visible within 3 hours of the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t as bad a I expected from other reviewers and even my sprayer misted the product on really nice and lightly. However, the product just didn&#x27;t cut it for me. I am still on the search for a product that will keep my makeup sealed and my T-zone oil free.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, most &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; products don&#x27;t really work for me. This product works fairly well in controlling oil and making my makeup last all day. I am a student, so normally I have makeup on for about 7+ hours, I find that I only need to blot a the 4 hour mark and my face will be matte for the rest of the school day. I have sometimes wore my makeup on for 10+ hours, and am amazed to find that my makeup still looks great. The only con to this product is the spray bottle. If you can, I would suggest getting a bottle that sprays out fine mist. I really like this product, it is a necessity in my daily makeup routine.</li>
            <li> It has a strong minty smell but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant.  My make up did not move all day.</li>
            <li> Smells like mouth wash, the residue after spraying burns my eyes. Make up still didn&#x27;t appear to be &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who cosplays Homestuck trolls or any character with an odd skin tone! This makes your make up last and look fresh.</li>
            <li> To be fair I  haven&#x27;t sweated in it, yet, but so far it seals really well, no stickiness, just a good seal!</li>
            <li> Great matter makeup sealer! My only problem with it is that it has a very high alcohol content that burns! I will use it for special occasions, but my sensitive skin can&#x27;t handle it more than once a week. If you are on any skin or acne medications, be aware it will increase dryness and irritation.</li>
            <li> It really works! I didn&#x27;t think I would ever find one that actually would set my makeup and keep me from looking shiny and this does!  Do not saturate your face make sure you spray and walk into the mist.  If you don&#x27;t you will look like someone that just had a chemical peel done! Your skin will be tight and shiny and you will not want to talk or smile because you&#x27;re scared your skin will crack! A little does a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard wonderful things about this product and now I finally own it. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my Otakon 2013 trip. I needed something to help keep my cosplay make-up sealed and on during the hot heat and sweating. This stuff works great ! It kept my make-up on all day. My eyeliner didn&#x27;t run and my eyeshadow didn&#x27;t fade. I wore this for wll over 12 hours and everything stayed looking wonderful! I was very please with this purchase</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well! A bit spendy and can bother my eyes just slightly, but so worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this setting spray!  No shine for hours!!  I would have given it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t spray out so much...</li>
            <li> I use this product to seal my light grey Snazaroo body paint, and it works really well! It helps any makeup stay on and not rub off onto clothing, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone planning on doing a cosplay that requires wearing any body paint or heavy makeup.</li>
            <li> This has really help keeping my T-zone oils at bay. I still have to blot, but not as much as I used to. This has really helped keep my make up looking really fresh, matte, and last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I had a little accident and ended up scratching my nose, leaving a small scar.  I have been using cover up make up while it heals but everytime I blowed my nose, make up would come off on the tissue. Pressing powder helped to an extent. This product, has really helped a lot. I am not having to touch my make up throughout the day. Be sure to only use a little bit, otherwise it can appear &amp;#34;flaky,&amp;#34; with my experience at least. I spray a small amount on my finger, and dab it onto the spot. It does its job. Satisfied.</li>
            <li> Look matte for hours, that&#x27;s the T.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it multiple times for myself and even for gifts for friends!</li>
            <li> Love it !!! Works great my make up stays on all day even though I have to daily spend time outside in very hot and sweaty conditions...I recommend it highly !!!!!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my sister after I complimented her on how smooth and fresh her makeup looked on her. Sure enough, once you spritz a bit of this product on your face after applying makeup your face truly looks smooth and fresh all day long. I apply it in the early morning hours.  When I get home in the late afternoon my makeup still looks good! Its a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Not good for eye-make up.  Really wanted it to keep eye make up in place , but did not work for the eyes.  It did work for the face make up though.</li>
            <li> My makeup still rubbed off when blowing my nose. But it does feel good on my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great! I&#x27;m a theater actress and keeping stage makeup on under hot lights is not easy. It is not perfection though...the spray is very erratic, and I find you have to use more than the couple of quick sprays recommended to ensure an even coating. It does help with making foundation and blush last longer though. I also find that it&#x27;s best to spray after you&#x27;ve applied your eye makeup but before applying mascara. Every time I sprayed it after putting on mascara it made it run.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help with makeup coming of as expected.</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the previous reviews...you need to buy a new spray bottle but once you get that fixed, I really like the way it seals my makeup on.  I use bare minerals and was a little worried it would make it look clumpy.  I kept the same smooth finish I love about that make up much longer into the day.  I have really sensitive skin and the make up sealer didn&#x27;t seem to bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Im really surprised to see all of these positive reviews. In all honesty, this product is awful. It smells like pure listerine mouthwash- doNOT accidentally get any in your eyes or nose. Which is difficult not to do because with the spray bottle, the product comes out in a stream line, not a gentle mist. Its so sticky, it glues your eyelids shut. I wanted something cheaper than my usual Urban Decay setting spray but trust me, its worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> received product just as received.</li>
            <li> I read about this product on pinterest...after trying other brands with minimal satisfaction, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It&#x27;s awesome! I will continue to order. And seller sent product to me in a timely manner, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> Definitely did wonders for me during this hot muggy summer! I&#x27;d say it made my makeup stay flawless for a good 8-10 hours, even if the humidity outside was making me sweat and I had a 9 hour shift at work. It may vary for skin types (I&#x27;m somewhat oily) but I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive makeup sealer. Yes, it does have a minty sticky mouthwashy smell/quality, but that fades after it dries (which is 30 seconds or less.)</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME! Just not enough in the bottle! Helps reasonably  keep make up off white clothes!</li>
            <li> Very good product but sometimes it can make me shiny</li>
            <li> I read ALL of the reviews on this product and the fact that Disney Princesses use this for their make-up had me sold.  I have SUPER sensitive/dry skin and I&#x27;m allergic to self-tanners and all lotion and certain make-up makes me break out.  This product did not irritate my skin whatsoever. The whole, &amp;#34;this smells like mouth wash&amp;#34; reviews need to grow up...the smell didn&#x27;t bother me at all. It was a HINT of mint on my face. My make-up usually lasts anyway without a primer, but with summer approaching and my vacation, I definitely don&#x27;t want to have to do any touch ups.  I wore this for only 5 hours, but my make-up still looked the same as it applied, but I wasn&#x27;t very matte...I still had shine on my face, but I NEVER use liquid foundation since it gives me shine. I&#x27;m not wowed by this....and will not re-order..... I feel my oil face (get rid of shine) face wash and oil blot sheets keep my make up looking more matte.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other drugstore setting mists and they were ok. I didn&#x27;t understand what the hype was all about. #makeupgameonpoint reviewed this on her YouTube  and I ordered it. I love this stuff, from the minty fresh scent to the lasting power. This is the first time I can say a setting spray really did keep my makeup on my face all day!! A bit pricey for a newbie makeup person..I&#x27;m Definitely NOT trying to be a MUA just want great products..</li>
            <li> Works well as expected, arrived very fast! 5 stars</li>
            <li> Love this item, the way it works, it doesn&#x27;t smudge my makeup at all and is waterproof! Super fast shipping as well, i love this.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well at what its suppose to do, seal the makeups final look. The smell is not bad at all, just minty and refreshing. The only thing I get irritated with is if you push down on the nozzle too lighltly, it sprays out splotchy and you can see 1 or 2 little wet dots on yours face witch then cakes the powder in that spot. So push down fully and it should be good. I will buy it again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday now. I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it! This is definitely a must buy!</li>
            <li> I like to do a lot of elaborate makeup, even in my day-to-day, but I usually don&#x27;t have time or space to carry the makeup around with me to do touch ups. Even with the aid of setting powder and primer, my makeup usually ends up coming off after several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought Ben Nye&#x27;s Final Seal to use for my Hallowe&#x27;en makeup this year, but I&#x27;ve been using it on some of my other looks before then to get used to the product. Overall, I am extremely pleased. It has kept my makeup in place during shopping, teaching days, bonfires, and other activities. I even fell asleep in my makeup last night (awful, I know) and when I woke up, it was still almost entirely intact, even my eyebrows that I draw on each day. I was extremely surprised by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaints about it are few: I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell. It has sort of a minty mouthwash smell that&#x27;s really strong at first, but that does go away as it dries. I think it&#x27;s the ingredient that smells minty that also makes it burn/tingle a bit when I first spray it on my face. *Do not spray it in your eyes* -- I got some in my eye by mistake and it hurts! and I would avoid spraying it over your eyelids, or do so by holding the bottle further away, because it makes my eyes really teary as it was drying. I have not tried it yet wearing false lashes, but I would probably hold my hand over those to avoid spraying them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those points, I love it. It&#x27;s quick-drying and long-lasting. My real tests of it are some concerts and Hallowe&#x27;en parties happening next week, but I&#x27;m confident that this product will keep my makeup in place. I&#x27;m glad that I bought it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to avoid having to do makeup touch-ups during their day or evening.</li>
            <li> I hate to say this and I mean no disrespect but you could get as much staying power for setting your makeup from a can of hairspray...learned that trick from a drag queen...</li>
            <li> Forget all the big brands, fancy smashy setters, I like this one, and it smells like mint.  No stickiness,and sets my make up fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for face and body make up.</li>
            <li> This works great.  Kept my Aquacolor facepaint on all day multiple times for six to eight hours.  It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that this product does anything other than smell like mint? You want to mist yourself not saturate but I felt like that spray on the bottle didn&#x27;t help you mist at all. I got this to test out for my wedding in 40ish days. I&#x27;m still looking. How in the world is this suppose to be a sealer?</li>
            <li> If you have ever come home after a long day or nite out to discover that the face you put on in the morning has somehow workied itself into a smeared puddle of shine, this is something you have got to try. Final Seal holds your makeup in place without changing its appearance. It has no sparkle or glow to \\&quot;enhance\\&quot; your look -- it just keeps in place what you have already applied. It has a minty scent that is inoffensive and quickly disappears. For what it does, the price is well worth it. I&#x27;ve never found anything better to do what this Matte Makeup Sealer does. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Ir sprays large deops that stays in, and you can see them</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for heavy/widespread makeup application (painted arms, back, etc) unless you reapply and cover with a powder. It doesn&#x27;t sting or make my skin feel dry, but be careful around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Smells, and feels like I&#x27;m putting mouth wash on my face. Urban decay setting spray is cheaper, and better</li>
            <li> This is great! Works wonderfully. I have tried Urban Decay&#x27;s All Nighter, as well but I was not as pleased with the staying power it provided. Final Seal really gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any experience with other brands of this type of product, but this one really burns my eyes. Maybe it&#x27;s not supposed to be used around the eyes, I don&#x27;t know because I didn&#x27;t investigate before I purchased.  It&#x27;s a bummer because the biggest part of my desire for this product was to hold my eyeshadow during long events without reapplication. I hate to waste money, so, recently I&#x27;ve been trying to use it and avoid my eyes somewhat. If I make sure it is THOROUGHLY dried (to the point it feels like my skin is pulling together) it seems to work better for me.  It does do a good job when I can use it.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a difference using this spray. my make-up stayed matte all day and barely rubbed off, which is a huge problem for me. I would buy again, though it&#x27;s a tad too expensive</li>
            <li> our son needed it for cosplay....good product!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it too much yet but I understand what people are saying about the sprayer - it comes out pretty heavy so I would spray it a few times just to get used to the amount that comes out before putting it on your face!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. This stuff smells nice and sets your makeup until you wash it off. Your makeup will not come off all day or all night after a few sprays of this stuff!</li>
            <li> This setting spray is awesome, I like it better than the Urban Decay all nighter and its cheaper too!!  I will be using this stuff from now on!</li>
            <li> I have sparse eyebrows that I meticulously brush in using a technique I learned from a professional makeup artist. The y look real yet it was always a problem in the summer with the humidity keeping the powder on. This was my solution I just dab it on and I have great brows all day</li>
            <li> This stuff is good for sealing your makeup. But don&#x27;t buy it expecting it to stop makeup from smudging on your closthes. Although it does help with that type of thing, I still get makeup on my fingers from time to time.</li>
            <li> This stuff seals my makeup like crazy! It makes my skin pretty dry, and I have very oily skin so that&#x27;s the reason for only 4 stars. Also, the spray sometimes comes out in a shot instead of a mist. However, if you prep well and spray carefully you&#x27;ll love this product!</li>
            <li> Wish the sprayer was a little finer; it tends to come out in sprays that leave spots of it on your face. Just wipe them in softly and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best ! Refreshing to the skin , it works like no other and I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> Made the oil more apparent - thank goodness I was able to try someone else&#x27;s before mine arrived, and I ended up returning my unused product.  Scent was fine, no burn.  I tried using after my mattifying primer, then makeup, and also after makeup.  Just terrible, made my face look 10x greasier.  Will continue the search for oil matte heaven!</li>
            <li> 5.50 on camera ready cosmetics . com ladies! Thought I should inform you girls. With this little bottle here for 15.50+  with shipping, sad</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it. I no longer have that shiny face. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to all my friends with oily skin.  Love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Really works! I put my face on at 3am &amp; it&#x27;s still on at 3pm. I just spray my face once on  each side &amp; leave my eyes closed for a few seconds. It has a great minty smell which helps me wake up in the morning. My make up is easily cleaned off with a make up remover wipe, no harsh face scrubbing to get it off. The only down side is that is a little expensive compared to the other make up setting sprays.</li>
            <li> For all my Texas folks and others...this stuff is awesome. I tried it on to my recent trip to San Antonio...we walked the Riverwalk, seaworld  and rode rides with water and my makeup never moved and looked amazing. Please if you are like me and sweat all time, please buy this product and try it. You will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it does smell like toothpaste but will have you sweat proof. Texas heat seal of approval!</li>
            <li> Really leaves me my make up in place. it smells like mouth wash and the spray is not light it sprays heavydrops</li>
            <li> I was not impressed. We had pictures to take at 7 pm &amp; thought we&#x27;d try this since it was hot outside. It didn&#x27;t work. My makeup still came off.</li>
            <li> The menthol in this product can dry out your skin, especially if you have dry/combination like me. i found my skin flaking a little bit after the work day finished. Best for oily skin or use in the summer.</li>
            <li> After researching how to stop my mascara from running all the time, I came across this product.  I googled it, looked for it on youtube and of course read the Amazon reviews.  I really like it!  I am very oily, and I live in a warm climate (the Bahamas) to boot! The final seal gives my foundation (especially) a little more staying power.  By the end of the day I would look like I didn&#x27;t have on any at all, now I am quite pleased that I still look &#x27;made up&#x27; at the end of the day.  Will definitely be buying more when my first bottle is done.</li>
            <li> Works great! Bought for my wedding and it has lasted forever.  I have found a lot of these type of products much cheaper.  I haven&#x27;t tried any so I don&#x27;t know if they work as well. This stuff really  does  keep your make-up looking exactly the same all day and night.  Burns like fire when you spray it on, but the burning only last a few seconds.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb!!!!!!! Makeup lasted all day on brides and bridal party; the mom wiped sweat off of her face and the only thing that came off was sweat!!!! This is MOST DEFINITELY the BEST makeup sealer out there!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting total oil control and matte-ifying results, it&#x27;s a great makeup sealant but I still find myself reaching for my blotting sheets every few hours.</li>
            <li> Works well at sealing makeup and effects..except for snazaroo.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, it causes snazaroo to flake/crack and dry up.&lt;br /&gt;otherwise it&#x27;s a good makeup sealant.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! After I complete my morning make up I spray it on my face and my makeup is set for the whole day. I also love the minty smell and feel refreshing and wakes u up in the am! Also I used it on my niece for her dance competition and her makeup stayed put! However I have learned to just go ahead and buy 2 at a time so no risk of running out.</li>
            <li> Very Speedy Delivery! Definitely appreciated this spray with the summer heat.  It kept my makeup in place and also saved me from looking like a sweaty drenched oily mess at concerts.  The scent is very refreshing and even though you might feel like your sweating your really not.  I&#x27;ve tried many products.. including Model in a Bottle, Urban Decay&#x27;s All Nighter &amp; Oil Free Shine. This by far works best for my oily skin.  It also prevented breakouts from the summer heat because as soon as I ran out my face started breaking out again.  I&#x27;m definitely ordering a big bottle next time!</li>
            <li> I tended to need a lot more than necessary..... good product though!</li>
            <li> Nothing was wrong with the delivery or shipment however the product doesn&#x27;t work as well as told.</li>
            <li> This sealer works pretty good but sprays on very heavy.  I have had to apply it with a sponge after spraying which smears my make up.  It does work better that other products I have used but could use a finer sprayer for application.</li>
            <li> Me: oily, dehydrated, sensitive, acne prone skin with acne scars and large pores.&lt;br /&gt;OVERVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;This setting spray holds my makeup in place ALL DAY LONG! Like, i&#x27;m talking 16 hours at a time. I could be sweating, it could be raining, and my face stays put. I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a base because it is kind of sticky when you first put it on, but once your whole face is done... give it a spray and BAM it&#x27;s on your face until you wash it off. HOWEVER, it does not prevent my skin from sucking all the moisture out of my foundation. (When you have dehydrated skin, the parts of your skin that are dehydrated tends to suck the moisture out of your foundation causing it to be all speckled, blotchy, and just generally gross looking). You will most likely still need to blot if you get oily, but even if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re face will stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Fresh minty scent&lt;br /&gt;ACTUALLY WORKS&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;Sweat-proof&lt;br /&gt;Life-proof&lt;br /&gt;Does not irritate sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Does not prevent foundation for separating&lt;br /&gt;Sticky on the skin for a minute or two&lt;br /&gt;Spray bottle does not spray evenly&lt;br /&gt;Can feel tight on the skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED FOR:&lt;br /&gt;ALL SKIN TYPES&lt;br /&gt;Special Occasions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL THOUGHTS:&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it works. It is a bit heavy on the skin, so it may not be best for every day use (although, i use it almost every day.. because I&#x27;m crazy). If you&#x27;re looking for something to prevent your foundation from separating or from experiencing the effects dehydrated skin has on makeup, look elsewhere because it doesn&#x27;t do that. It will, however, keep your makeup in place and looking flawless all day in every other scenario. I recommend putting it in a different spray bottle, though, because the sprayer it comes with doesn&#x27;t give a fine enough mist (at least in my opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product with my own money and of my own volition. My review is honest and unbiased. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> this stuff seals my grey paint very well so it doesn&#x27;t smudge which is a absolute must unless you want to get your grey on everyone at the con&lt;br /&gt;its good for sealing my regular makeup too, and yes it does smell like mint at first but it goes away soon after&lt;br /&gt;but it doesnt protect from water or whatever so dont cry okay (i had to go touch up in the bathroom at the con)</li>
            <li> Great for when you&#x27;re too busy to stop and do touch ups. Makeup stays in place all day. . . .</li>
            <li> I loved this product! The only thing I didn&#x27;t love about it, was that it made my skin breakout if I wore it too often. My makeup more than lasted though. If you&#x27;re not wearing stage makeup though, I would suggest Urban Decay setting spray, it works wonders and doesn&#x27;t make you break out.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I&#x27;ve found other uses for it as well.</li>
            <li> The Ben Nye Final Sealer arrived faster than expected and it does smell like mouthwash but apparently that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s suppose to smell since a lot of other reviewers from different sites explain it as. Also the product does work as expected. I have a combo skin type and this product held my face paint perfectly well without smudging on my clothes or anything else so I am extremely happy for that.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and by mid-day my make-up would just just run off my face, but since using this product it stays on ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick spritz over entire face...and make-up is set for the day, without rubbing off on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is like hairspray for your face. It feels a little sticky like that too. I sweat in my face, it&#x27;s an issue. I use this everyday and it has helped greatly. I only use power and blush, so my face makeup doesn&#x27;t last very long. If I spray after, it lasts mostly all day. Plus, this is one of the cheapest brands and it works just as well (or better) as the expensive ones that I tried.</li>
            <li> I have yet to figure out if this works as well as I hope. I&#x27;ll figure out in November though when Nebcon arrives. It was kind of pricey so I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll work well to seal my make up but I&#x27;ll be adding baby powder/hairspray on top just to be sure I&#x27;m not getting my make up everywhere.</li>
            <li> Really wonderful product.  It was recommended to me by a fellow cosplayer and it worked perfectly.  It&#x27;s a very light-feeling liquid and has a fresh, minty scent.  Keeps makeup in place and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or stiff feeling to the face.  Helped mine and my husbands makeup stay on from 10 am until 2 am, despite insane heat and sweating.  If you have an event, cosplay or costume that you want to ensure long-lasting makeup, this is an absolute must and I&#x27;ll never go without it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Fast delivery great product!</li>
            <li> I really feel this gives the finishing touch after applying my makeup. It has a slight sting to the face when drying. I have not compared this to any other finishing spray. This is the first one I buy.</li>
            <li> Got married in North Carolina on the ocean.  hot sun,  full wind.  85° everybody was sweating off their make up except me! My makeup looked perfect at the end of the evening. Totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and using this product along with finishing powder over top works wonders! I&#x27;m glad I tried it</li>
            <li> My daughter the cosplayer is picky with what product she uses. After doing research, this is one of the products she decided to purchase. She was extremely pleased in the end.</li>
            <li> I have worn drug store make-up and department store make-up and none of them hold up throughout the day.  So, I decided to give this a try.  Surprisingly, it does a good job of keeping my make-up from fading.  It does smell like mouthwash when you spray it on, but that quickly dies down.</li>
            <li> When I used it my face felt like it was on fire.  I really wanted to love it, but it irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> I love using this stuff, it holds eyeshadow and makeup, as well as greasepaint and other things, as long as you&#x27;ve put a layer of powder on.</li>
            <li> worked great for my daughter and friends for their cosplay weekend. Held their makeup in place all day and half the night. They said it stinks so hold your breath while spritzing...</li>
            <li> Works beautifully from your arms and face when you paint them, but does not seal your eye makeup as well. I was in 90 degree weather with my gray paint and it did not smear. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re going to use any kind of full body makeup/paint.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I like the smell and the feel of it when you spray it on your face. Do not want to be without this stuff</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my makeup stays on through the day now. It smells so clean and fresh. It does periodically come out heavier, and cause a big spot on my face. I just dap it until it blends in. I think the key is to make sure that you hold it far enough from your face. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I used this product to seal my make-up for long days at cosplay conventions.  The first day I did a fairly normal make-up style and was really impressed at how it lasted.  It definitely kept my make-up fresher than it would have otherwise been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second day I was doing a version of Cleopatra and applied a lot of distinct liquid eyeliner lines.  Unfortunately, these lines smeared halfway through the day and my make-up was coming off when rubbed.  So that was disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used similar products before so I can&#x27;t say how it stacks up to other brands.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it, though and think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve tried a few make up setting sprays &amp; this is the best. I&#x27;ve tried Model in a Bottle, E.L.F., Urban Decay (and 1 other I cant think of the name) and this is 100% the best I have used.</li>
            <li> I tried it and I normally go to the gym afterward my make up came off just a little bit.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any difference at all in how my makeup looks at the end of the day whether I use this stuff or not.  I think it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this originally as an attendant of an outdoor wedding in Austin, TX.... in MAY.  I knew it would be Hot and Humid!  I apply this to my makeup brushes after coating with powder/blush/what have you, and the. stuff. stays.  I had no trouble washing off with soap &amp; water! Will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> This product says it will hold your makeup for 9-12 hours and it really does.  I love this for school my makeup stays on all day without a smudge even if i rub my eyes.  It works great even if you sweat. I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for it to take the shine away, but my face still gets shiny after a couple of hours. But my makeup does stay in place so that is a plus. I&#x27;m sure this would work great on someone who&#x27;s skin is not so oily.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have pretty oily skin and have used different products for this issue with none of them working for me. I was browsing the internet when I saw an article stating that the disney princesses use this and that it keeps their makeup on all day. So I searched and found it here. I must say it works wonders! The only bad thing is that it doesn&#x27;t last all day completely. I think someone with a bit less oily skin will be able to wear this and not worry about it all day. So far this is the best product I have found for me.</li>
            <li> I have never used a sealer before. I love this! My eye shadow and blush stays on all day. Follow the directions and spray a light spray all over your face, let dry and lightly mist again. There you are all set, and so is your makeup for the entire day. Comes off very easily with make up remover and has not dried out my skin or caused me to break out. The smell at first reminds me of a minty mouth wash smell but it quickly goes away and is by no means an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m military stationed in Japan so my address is FPO, AP. Which is stated in my profile. They sent it to APO, AP which is in KOREA...WTH!!!</li>
            <li> I have used MAC and Model in a bottle and this stuff is much more effective. I sweat more than any woman I know so this stuff&lt;br /&gt;is a miracle.</li>
            <li> This stuff dose work better than any of the other setting sprays I have tried. Although if you arnt careful, this stuff can really burn your eyes.</li>
            <li> After researching different setting sprays I went with the Ben Nye.  I wasn&#x27;t so impressed.  I think the urban decay brand did a better job.</li>
            <li> I remember wearing this in high school for school school plays so that our makeup would not smudge under the bright lights. It works just as well as I remember. A light mist on your face after applying your makeup when you are done getting ready in the morning and your makeup will stay all day. I especially like using this for my eye makeup as it eliminates those &#x27;eye creases&#x27; your makeup gets throughout the day with oil production. Id def. recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li> It seemed to work during the winter months. But in the humidity and heat it seems to almost make the makeup come off quicker! It has a fresh smell almost like mouthwash. Its actually a nice refreshing smell and does not linger. Overall a decent product.</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin and this really helps keep it under control while keeping my make-up looking fresh all day too! I spray it after putting on my foundation and I spray 4 times: once to the right, once in the middle, once on the left and then after it dries I do it one more time in the middle.  I used to have to use oil blotting sheets half way through the day and since starting this I haven&#x27;t had to do that.  By the end of the day, oil is just starting to show but it would be a miracle if it didn&#x27;t.  Would definitely recommend.  I will never be without this stuff.</li>
            <li> This. Is. Amazing.  I have extremely oily/greasy skin &amp; live in the deep south where the humidity is at least 200% -my makeup rarely lasts an hour after I leave the house.  But with this!?  This my makeup not only will last all day but into the next as well with just a touch up!  It is a LIFESAVER &amp; I cannot do without it anymore!  It&#x27;s especially amazing when going away for the weekend or long days when I will be too busy &amp; just don&#x27;t want to have to even THINK about my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now a MUST HAVE for my makeup bag! I let my makeup set a few minutes (mostly to let mascara dry)  Then spritz it on while wearing keeping my hair &amp; neck/shoulders covered with something b/c it can get on your hair/clothes &amp; feel funky, that being said my face doesn&#x27;t feel odd after using it, nor is there any kind of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously cannot praise this enough!  I now only need to carry around my face blotters instead of an entire makeup bag, &amp; I only need to use the blotting papers maybe once a day around the corners of my nose.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> This Ben Nye Final Seal really is a game changer ! I&#x27;m the type of person that reads the reviews before I bought and was kinda iffy BUT OMG seriously so glad I purchased it after all, I have sensitive dry skin and it does not dry it out whatsoever and my makeup does really LAST ALL DAY. I definitely recommend !</li>
            <li> I ordered the spray and what I got was the powder. So I can&#x27;t properly review this item.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and this has made a noticeable difference in helping my makeup stay. I spray it over top of my cc cream, let it dry, then put on mattifying powder. My skin used to get oily/shiny within two hours or less of putting on my makeup, now it stays shine free for two to three times longer.</li>
            <li> I used this to seal grey make up for a homestuck cosplay. Withstood a solid 15 hours each day during the convention, (and with all my sweating.) Doesn&#x27;t do so well with the grime and oil from your  hands, and rubbing my face too often thinned out some parts of my make up. (But, did not smear!) A little touch up done half way through each day around the nose, and other oily areas. Note, I did use this along with setting powder, but I&#x27;d definitely think any makeup will be sealed with just this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a quick spritz now and then if I just want my everyday makeup to last through a long day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone wanting to seal any type of makeup!</li>
            <li> My first time using this product was for my sister-in-laws wedding.  The wedding was outdoors on a hot August day.  The bride,  my mother-in-law,  my other sister-in-law and myself all used it before the wedding.  End of the night... my makeup looked awesome. I did spray some on a makeup sponge and dabbed it around my eyes to really set my liner in. Oh and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work it actually washes off the make up so u use it for to take off my gray makeup for cosplay</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.  After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to purchase for halloween.  I was hesitant because it seemed so much more expensive than other brands, but it was completely worth it!  My makeup didn&#x27;t rub off all night, but then easily washed off as soon as I got in the shower.  I have super sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts and this didn&#x27;t clog my pores or feel uncomfortable like my skin couldn&#x27;t breathe. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Works just like it says. It is sticky at first but not a bad product! I would buy more if I run out!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Final Seal Matte Makeup Sealer. I was leary at first because it was a little pricier than I would have liked but now that I have had it for several months and use it EVERY DAY, It is worth every penny. I had an unfortunate issue with very bad acne that has since cleared up, but left me with only half of my eyebrows on both sides. I have nice full eyebrows until about midway through where it should continue, but the hair is so sparse that you can barely see it. Because of this, I need to draw in my eyebrows on the &amp;#34;missing&amp;#34; areas. It&#x27;s very frustrating because no matter what I try, they rub off soooo easily. All it takes is me accidently brushing my eyebrow against something and it smudges and leaves me completely embarrassed and needing to run away and re-apply my brow pencil. I bought the Final Seal Makeup sealer in hopes that it would alleviate this atleast slightly. While it does not completely correct the issue of my smudged eyebrows, it does keep the pencil on much much better and keeps it from becoming oily and smuding (for the most part). It also seems to keep all of my makeup in place. Also, it seems to keep eyeshadow from creasing if you make sure to apply it right at your eyelids. You only need a very small amount every day so, although the bottle is somewhat small, it last a really really long time! It has a nice minty scent to it when you first spray it on but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger so you don&#x27;t smell like mint all day long. I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to keep their makeup from smudging or just to keep it in place. It is a great product!</li>
            <li> does make your makeup stay and last longer, but it still tends to rub off a bit. HORRIBLE MOUTHWASH SMELL. if that doesn&#x27;t bother you then its overall a pretty good/eh product,</li>
            <li> Works great esp when you have a long day and don&#x27;t have time to touch up your makeup. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Love it makeup On point</li>
            <li> Id definitely recommend to someone who wants to use this for stage makeup or someone who just needs a guarantee that their everyday makeup won&#x27;t go anywhere but please beware this stuff burns!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  It doesn&#x27;t work well on liquid makeup, like foundation or concealer.  So, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed. But if you wear powdered makeup, I&#x27;m sure this would be the bomb!</li>
            <li> my makeup stays put!  period.  I squirt it twice when i am done and it stays put, and matte most of the entire day.</li>
            <li> Really Helps my makeup last all night.</li>
            <li> Love this finishing spray.  I&#x27;ve used a couple different brands but this on by far is the best.  They minty feeling it leaves is a client really wakes up the actors who fell asleep in the makeup chair.</li>
            <li> I just like my final seal matte make up sealer by ben nye</li>
            <li> I love this product! I apply my makeup once, use the sealer and I am good to go all day without re-applying.</li>
            <li> it helped keep my body paint on some but it still rubbed off alot. i do not recommend this really.</li>
            <li> For the price of this product... WOW!! it works very very well and has a nice minty smell to it!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wedding day, but I use it all the time. I work long shifts, and this helps keep my makeup in place all day. I have pretty oily skin, so after a couple hours my skin is usually really greasy and shiny and my makeup slides off. This fixes all of those problems. My skin is much less greasy looking and my makeup really stays. It smells great too. Nice and fresh. The sprayer sometimes gets a little clogged and the product doesn&#x27;t spray on evenly but a tissue works well to blend it in. I don&#x27;t think I can live without this stuff now!</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work well. Now, it isn&#x27;t perfect for me, but I feel I&#x27;m an exception - the oiliness of my face is, sadly, apparently incurable. (This isn&#x27;t an issue the Disney Princesses would have, I imagine - Disney probably roots potential hirees with skin like mine out.) That being said, it works better than anything I have ever used. My makeup will actually last for several hours, instead of two or three. Also has a nice minty smell.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup sealer I have ever used. It lasts all day long, and the minty smell is very refreshing!</li>
            <li> Awful!!!! After my makeup was done, I sprayed this and I had splotches everywhere!! Unlike all the other makeup setting sprays I have ever used. I had to re-do my makeup and was not happy!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  I used it on my wedding makeup and never did any touch-ups.  Despite some pre-ceremony sweating, the makeup stayed in place and looked fresh!  I have some pictures from later in the evening with no evidence of shine.  I also used this for some pretty serious Halloween costume makeup, and that also worked really well!  No smearing.  The spray is lightweight, invisible, and the mint smell is a nice touch.  I am really pleased that I bought this and have started wearing it whenever I wear full makeup.  I also recommend using primer- this isn&#x27;t a substitute for primer.  But it really will help your makeup last.</li>
            <li> This sealer is great...have used it over my primer..kept me matte for most of the day. It worked a lot better than my Urban Decay make-up sealer. My makeup routine when I get out of the shower is apply Phillips Milk of Magnesia orginial flavor NOT flavored. Wipe my TEE zone. Phillips M. Of Mag. with suck up your oil like a sponge then I spray on the sealer to make me even more matte. I work in a very humid climate so I don&#x27;t wear makeup because will melt off. So I use the Phillips M of Mag. to matte me. If face seems a little chalky rub face with fingers to blend in. If you have darker skin u may have to put ur foundation on over it. Don&#x27;t understand see Youtube videos.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this on normal day to day makeup but I used this on my special effects make up and face paint (not the crappy kind either) and it made it very flakey and chip off while my other spray makes it stay on longer. Will stick to powders from now on.</li>
            <li> Great Purchase. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me...was trying to use to cover small red scar with makeup but still came off within an hour</li>
            <li> This is great for those in pageants, performances and everyday makeup!! Must get, I promise you won&#x27;t regret it! supper affordable too!</li>
            <li> I felt like this in no way made my makeup stay on any better than when I don&#x27;t use it. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product. I first heard about Final Seal on pinterest where it said the Princesses at Disney World use it to keep their makeup fresh and stay put. Now that I have tried it I will never go a night out with out my final seal on!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and kept my makeup &amp;#34;frozen&amp;#34; on my wedding day without my face being frozen. I have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work as perfectly in high humidity and heat.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I am pleased with this product. After I heard that the Disney face characters used this to set their makeup I quickly bought a bottle. I bought this for the use of keeping my eye makeup from running into the creases. However, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of that. By mid-day my eye makeup was completely dull or, simply faded to the point where the colors looked sloppy. It also dried parts of my cheeks much lighter than the rest of my skin (Yes, I kept it 10 inches from my face and did blot excess when I felt it was necessary)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only pro was the minty scent. It definitely wakes you up.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, but not great. It works as a makeup sealer. So your makeup won&#x27;t transfer, but it doesn&#x27;t make it last all day.  I thought this product would make my makeup last. I have reduced transfer which is nice, so I rate it three stars instead of four.  If you want a product that will make your makeup last go with the $10 setting spray from NYX. I ran out and thought I would try this product, but now I am going to go back and purchase the NYX spray. Live and learn...</li>
            <li> I had discovered that Disney princesses used this to seal their makeup for the day, so I decided to order this for my wedding.  The product really does keep your makeup fresh.</li>
            <li> Best makeup sealer I have ever tried!! My face gets super oily thru the day and every other makeup spray wears off but not this one!!! It lasts all day long</li>
            <li> Holds make up in  place all day long with a refreshing mint smell when first applied.</li>
            <li> It was decent. The product itself wasent as good as i thought, either that or i was using it wrong.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, for the most part of the day makeup stays on.... Used it going on a two hour flight... Heading to a event, makeup looked great.</li>
            <li> Perfect! It kept all of my stage makeup on and no amount of rubbing took off the makeup before it was time to wash off!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money. Perhaps I didn&#x27;t use it right but when I sprayed it ONCE, it left this obvious shine on my face which I hated.</li>
            <li> I worked at an haunted amusement park during Halloween last year and we used this Ben Nye Final Seal every day! This stuff is awesome! It can make your makeup last so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best ways to use this product:&lt;br /&gt;-Keep your face relaxed when you are spraying, just close your eyes but don&#x27;t squeeze them shut! (if you squeeze your eyes you wont get as good of coverage in the eye area and its more likely to get into your eyes!)&lt;br /&gt;-On hotter days, or when you really want it to stay on well, apply it twice. We would just spray it on the face, let it dry, and then spray it again.&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t open your eyes until its dry! If your face is relaxed it usually doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes but if you squeeze your eyes shut it will burn if you open them too soon!&lt;br /&gt;--If your spray bottle doesn&#x27;t work  well, just go buy a one at target for 75 cents! You want this stuff to mist all over your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product for special occasions! I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Okay, so this is my first time trying this product.  After reading all the reviews and looking for something that works to set my makeup I decided to stick to an industry standard (Ben Nye product).  I was not disappointed and as a matter of fact have decided to order several more to keep at the ready and even give to family and friends.  I have oily skin and my make-up no matter the product ALWAYS starts to fade and/or lift.  So far I spray my face lightly before applying my foundation and again after all makeup has been applied.  It adds at least 6-8 hrs. of wear, which for me is HUGE.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it!, im super oily only a couple hours into the day, and this makes my makeup look nice and fresh pretty much all day! and it smells like peppermint for a minute while it drys</li>
            <li> Great stuff over cream make-up :)</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and I was just about to come to terms that I would always have to completely reapply my makeup every few hours. Then I read about this product on another website and I saw the reviews so I took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely a MUST HAVE in anyone&#x27;s makeup kit. My makeup now lasts, easily, 12 hours with NO problem. Thank you Ben Nye!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wedding and it works fantastic!  My makeup stayed in place ,no rubbing off on anyone and didn&#x27;t feel like I even had it on. Completely recommend!</li>
            <li> Its like spraying your face with hair spray.  Makes your skin feel dry and weird.  Also the fragrance is horrible</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for my face makeup (foundation, blush, etc) but it did wonders keeping my eyeliner, mascara, and eyeshadow intact!</li>
            <li> I love it.  makes my makup last all day and night without having to do applications in the middle I suggest buying a larger size than I did it works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my spray bottle is defective, but the sealer squirts out like a super soaker instead of a fine mist. It smells horrible and burns my sensitive skin, with the first ingredient being alcohol. I have oily/combination skin and usually get 5 hours maximum wear from the best of foundations. This sealer did absolutely nothing to help my makeup stay longer. Ben Nye, you have disappointed me.</li>
            <li> The nozzle does not spray out product in a mist, instead it comes out as a squirt so when it dries, you can see splotches of dried product on the face. Not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing to put on to keep your makeup from sweating it off !!</li>
            <li> I saw the bad reviews but decided to try it for myself. It made me look 10 years older.  Yuck.</li>
            <li> Wore it over some Mehron Starblend cake makeup on my arms, chest, back, and face, and it kept it on and lasted all day.</li>
            <li> Super sticky, it doesnt work</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work. I try to use it sparingly, but I&#x27;ve had it over 6 months and still have quite a bit left. It&#x27;s perfect for long days when your makeup starts to look a little wonky after a few hours--like weddings, long workdays filled with meetings, etc. I have a cheap makeup sealer from ELF that I use when I can remember, but this is the trusted go-to for more important days that I don&#x27;t want my makeup to look weird hours into the event. I will warn you, though--do not spray it into your eyes. \\&quot;Well no s*** Sherlock,\\&quot; you&#x27;re thinking. \\&quot;Why would I spray it into my eye?\\&quot; This stuff has a methol/peppermint smell to it and when trying to hurry up before we left for a wedding, I sprayed it a little too carelessly and shot myself right in the eye with it. Not only does it burn like hell, but my eyes would not stop watering, which smeared my eye makeup all over my face, so I had to redo quite a bit of it. You&#x27;ve been warned!</li>
            <li> Amazing item and it arrived early. Can&#x27;t wait to use it this Halloween!</li>
            <li> This products does have that breath spray smell but it does help my make up stay put, still some slippage if I get a little wet, it smeared my makeup, it should have been water proof :/</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and great for costume make up and daily use! It makes your make up last much longer without breaking up through the day. I used it for a long convention day while I was doing extreme costume make up and I did not sweat any off! This is magic!</li>
            <li> Works great however the sprayer leaves droplets on my skin.  I prefer a finer mist.</li>
            <li> The product was actually really good. It helped maintain the paint I applied to my face, which was a great thing.</li>
            <li> This ia a good product but you have to make sure you don&#x27;t let your skin get too dry if you use it a lot.  It is fairly effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I am not sure if it really does make my makeup stay all day, but every time I use it, I break out! So not worth it to me</li>
            <li> I work in the healthcare field so when I actually do have time to put makeup on, I want it to last all day. But with the work I do, constantly running, sweating, etc, I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the product that doesn&#x27;t work or if any setting spray wouldn&#x27;t really be able to last all day while running around everywhere. The smell of it kind of grosses me out. And when I pray it on, it isn&#x27;t like a nice mist. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve just poured water all of your face and then you have to fan it dry. Lol. But that&#x27;s just my experience.</li>
            <li> This works well with the whiteface makeup my Granddaughter uses for Cosplay and this works perfectly to seal it.  Great.</li>
            <li> Great makeup setting spray! I haven&#x27;t tried that many different ones because I liked this one so much from the first try. Works well for my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as part of my cosplay makeup. I love how it helps my makeup stay in place. The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; to this problem is it burns my eyes. I follow the directions and even close my eyes, but it still burns. Other than that I love it. Shipping speed was great.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My make up stays on the whole day and thur the night. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I live in Florida and my makeup sweats off so quickly. I had to spray it on a couple times a day but it definitely does a great job. I rated a 4 based on the price. It&#x27;s pretty expensive for the amount provided.</li>
            <li> This product does not do what it says - does not set makeup.  I had better luck using Aqua Net to seal my body makeup.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do! Just make sure to use a full spray and not just a partial spray, it makes a big difference! It definitely helps control my oil throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this product every day, but if I have a night out it is the perfect make sealer.</li>
            <li> Love it. Looks great and really seals the paint in well. Also quick shipping arrived before estimated date</li>
            <li> Works very well for all day, and smells minty ^-^</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about all of the reviews initially because they all seemed too good to be true. I decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did. I have very oily skin and I tend to sweat in my facial area under high stress. This not only sealed in my make up but prevented my facial sweating all together. Absolutely a MUST HAVE if you don&#x27;t feel like reapplying make up throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. A few spritzes and your makeup will stay put for hours, even very heavy theatrical makeup will stay put when you&#x27;re performing and sweating. It may seem pricey but it is definitely worth every penny! Plus it smells minty fresh.</li>
            <li> Everything it said it would be, just wish the bottle was bigger</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle...so much better than ANYTHING else out there!</li>
            <li> The product works like it says it will. However, it has a grotesque smell of mouth wash. I will not repurchase this product because I believe there are other setting sprays that work just as well without the horrendous smell.</li>
            <li> Works excellently, I often touch my face after putting on makeup and this helped it stay all day long - used first for my wedding events and it worked perfectly. Minty smell is nice, no offputting taste.</li>
            <li> Works great with Snazaroo. Does its job extraordinarily.</li>
            <li> This product arrived sooner than I expected. I have yet to try it out, but unfortunately the makeup I ordered to use this with hasn&#x27;t arrived yet. When I get my other makeup, I&#x27;ll edit this post with how the quality is, but seeing as how it&#x27;s Ben Nye, I have total confidence in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the mentions of &#x27;smelling like mouthwash&#x27;. Yes, it does have a minty mouthwash/toothpaste smell to it, but it&#x27;s necessarily a bad thing. The smell does fade after a while, but if you don&#x27;t mind the smell of mint gum or mouthwash/toothpaste, then it shouldn&#x27;t be that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic with snazaroo, and ben nye paint. MUST HAVE WHEN BODY PAINTING. It hurts when in your eyes, but goes away in a few seconds.</li>
            <li> It does not spray evenly so by the end of the day you will random circles of make up left. It does not work! My make-up stays on better without it. I spray about 3 sprays and 5 hours later I will look in a mirror only to see my face is oily and blotchy because it doesn&#x27;t spray evenly.</li>
            <li> it does keep the makeup on, but it leaves a weird sheen that almost cracks through out the day. Good for a little bit but it looks worse through out the day.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected. My face feels sticky, and my make-up still transfer after using this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that is a great product because I could be using it incorrectly! I use this as a make-up setting spray, but I always get caught up on the toothpaste smell. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it&#x27;s a minty scent-LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does leave a matte finish after I spray a few times and I mean a few times too, but it&#x27;s not as great as the Graftobian  Make-up Spray, which I&#x27;m about to re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It help keep my makeup in place in different weather. The delivery was fast and there was a good amount for a good price.</li>
            <li> It feels like shelac on my face. Makes my makeup crack. It&#x27;s ok if you spray your face and buff your makeup in with it. Then its ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this spray a couple times and I&#x27;m pretty impressed. I usually use Urban Decay Setting Spray but since I now work in the heat some of the day, I needed something a little stronger. The smell of the spray is a little overwhelming. It smells similar to spraying hairspray directly in your face... but I&#x27;ll take it for all day makeup coverage!</li>
            <li> Great product. I don&#x27;t use it everyday but when I use it my makeup stays on for most of the day. I really have oily skin, this product make my face less oily.</li>
            <li> I received the product and im happy with it! I got it on time and just the product is perfect!</li>
            <li> I have purchased many setting sprays in the past and love Ben Nye products, so was excited about this one. I did not care for the smell or the consistancy of the spray.  Very tacky feeling on my face and didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my makeup.  I&#x27;ll stick to my NYC and Skindinavia setting sprays from now on...</li>
            <li> I used Final Seal to keep my facepaint in place on Halloween. - I was dancing the whole night &amp; definitely didn&#x27;t want to end up with a streaky face. The spray did exactly what it was supposed to do, and my make-up was still on at the end of the night. It has a pleasant minty smell and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  I would reccomend this product for anything from performance/stage make-up to everyday wear. Its absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best !!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin and do not want to worry about your makeup melting this is the spray for you. I have oily skin and have tried every setting spray on the market and this is the ONLY one I do not have to blot or re-apply powder with. Not only does it withstand just daily wear, but also heat and humidity. Its kinda  pricey but it is worth every penny</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and have always had trouble with my foundation running. I have tried other setting sprays and nothing compares to this stuff! I will be a life long user, totally stepped up my makeup game!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. It was nothing like the great reviews I read anout it. It had a sticky feel and did not hold my makeup in place. I&#x27;m wondering if I may have just received a bad one.</li>
            <li> Makeup stays in place all day long!</li>
            <li> I like this product, however; the spray bottle doesn&#x27;t output the product evenly on your face.  You can very easily get water spots on your face.  And on those spots your makeup will not move.  But on the areas around the water drops, your makeup will move.  So I guess you should drench your face in the stuff in order to get your entire makeup look to stay all day?  Not sure how that would work...haven&#x27;t yet gone that route.</li>
            <li> Love this product! ! I live in the sunny Caribbean and usually do a full face makeup,  final seal keeps my makeup matte and it looks great for hours upon hours!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Works even better when you spray before and after makeup application</li>
            <li> This product really works.  It set my makeup all day. I would definately recommend.  My daughter plays softball and volleyball and she doesn&#x27;t have to worry anymore about her makeup running from sweat.</li>
            <li> Loooove this! Tried Skindanavia before this one and it sucked. This one smells minty but it does keep your makeup in place a lot better than others. It&#x27;s not completely water proof but it holds really well</li>
            <li> Works way better than urban decay makeup setting spray.  This is the only one I will buy</li>
            <li> Not a fan- the spray is kind of sticky, by the end of the day my makeup looked very dry and flaky. I use urban decay all nighter. its much better.</li>
            <li> I love this sealer.  It was recommended on a major beauty blog and so I ordered.  I received a lot of compliments on my makeup.  :)</li>
            <li> I got this to seal my Mehron metallic and black paints for a robot musician costume. I have yet to use it for a full day at a convention, but my makeup didn&#x27;t run or rub off at all, even on the neck where the shirt collar rubs a lot. It also smells like mint, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and have used it for various things. The most notable was on Halloween, when I painted my face with cheap costume store makeup that would surely run without a sealer. That same evening, I had a cross-country race for my high school team. I didn&#x27;t want to take off my Halloween makeup, so I used this sealer to keep my paint from running while I ran. So I ran my race with my spooky costume makeup,  finished in 3rd place, broke my personal record, and the paint had stayed on PERFECTLY. The sealer can last all day and withstand sweat and has a nice minty scent. However, it can sometimes spray out a little harshly, a bit like a squirt instead of a mist. It also kinda makes your skin look a bit shiny in the light, but doesn&#x27;t affect what your makeup looks like. Love it.</li>
            <li> The spray is refreshing when you spray it on and it makes your skin feel smooth. My makeup now will last all day! It&#x27;s a lot better than the thick primers they sell, and I love the smell. Try it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I can have a full face of makeup and go to sleep (terrible, I know, but I was drunk!) and wake up with my makeup looking just as I went to sleep with it. I have used this before going swimming, and it helps to keep everything together then too. The only thing is that it can give a slight shine when you first put it on. You may like the way it looks, but if you don&#x27;t just put a tad bit of powder on top of it and it disappears with no problem. The 2oz bottle should last me a long while too, perfect amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get this in your eyes, burns like unicorn glitter to the eye, just keep them closed for a few seconds after to spray to give your face a chance to dry. The minty smell is great to me. Goes away a min after putting the spray on, it doesn&#x27;t linger like some people exaggerate it does but it&#x27;s not a bad or crazy overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff define deals my makeup, I really like it except that there is something minty it it which he&#x27;s into my eyes and stings, so that&#x27;s pretty annoying. Other than that it is great!</li>
            <li> I saw this backstage at a performance I was doing. Makes your makeup last long onstage under lights. I bought this for every day use and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> It does eliminate the powdery look, but doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in the way of helping my makeup last longer.</li>
            <li> It works pretty amazingly for the price even though you can get it on the Ben Nye website for cheaper. Yet If you apply this under makeup, (what is how many makeup artist use, over primer, than used again over makeup) it can make your skin look dry so be sure to moisturize before. I like the smell. Very minty like mouthwash, but I like it. I can seem how it could irritate skin since it has mint in it. But it does make makeup last a long time. I even when swimming with it and it worked wonders for the price.</li>
            <li> This spray is amazing! I used it on my makeup for my wedding in Mexico last November.  Worked wonders, and my makeup did not move, given the amount of dancing and how hot it was out all day! I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works really well did not give it 5 stars because of the smell</li>
            <li> It burns quite a bit and when you spray it, you automatically inhale it. Doesn&#x27;t taste good, of course, but the product itself is okay. The makeup doesn&#x27;t stay 100% but it holds pretty well.</li>
            <li> I first learned of this product on Pinterest. I always have a problem with my makeup lasting all day. This product keeps my makeup in place!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and live in the southern US, so my makeup tends to just melt off in a few hours.  This sealer came highly recommended, and as it&#x27;s cheaper than many other sealers, I gave it a shot.  It&#x27;s wonderful!  My makeup looks fresh even in the afternoon when I would normally need to reapply everything.  It was actually a huge shock to look into the bathroom mirror after lunch the first day I tried this and see that I still had makeup on!  I will caution, however, that this is NOT AN OIL CONTROL SPRAY.  I am still oily, but this does keep my makeup from melting off and keeps the shine at bay for a couple of extra hours.  I can easily use an oil-blotting sheet (or two) to control the oil and shine, but thankfully I no longer have to worry about reapplying makeup as well.  Also, some people complain about the smell of this product in reviews.  I&#x27;ve found that it does smell a bit like minty mouthwash, probably because it&#x27;s alcohol-based, but that smell goes away as it dries (about 30 seconds).  I may shop around for some more sprays that control oil too, but I&#x27;m overall thrilled with this product and believe it delivers exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> This product may have changed my life .</li>
            <li> Seals paint very easily (even when it is Snazaroo) and makes it refuse to come off! (In a good way, at least).&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my Homestuck cosplays and it seals it to perfection.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read Disney characters/ princesses uses this as a finishing spray. I was skeptical, but it works great. It has an refreshing mint smell and I don&#x27;t notice any shine on my face in pictures of me using this. Highly recommend for anyone that will be outside in humid weather and doesn&#x27;t want an oily face in pictures.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I&#x27;m a believer in setting sprays and this one is perfect!... When you first get it. After you stop using it for a while then try using it everyday again, you&#x27;ll notice your makeup looks cracked around the chin and nose area. Definitely NOT attractive or princess worthy.</li>
            <li> Love it! Does what it says. Keeps makeup fresh all day! No moisture or oil leaks through.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and have been on the hunt for something to control it. I have heard thru blogs that makeup sealer can make a big difference. I was skeptical because I have not tried makeup sealer before and other products advertising to help with oily skin have disapointed me. I am so glad I tried this. I use it over Skin79 Hot Pink BB cream in the morning and my makeup stays put and my face has a matte finish still at the end of the day. Unbelievable! It has a pleasant peppermint scent when you first spray it but goes away after the product dries. It does not make my face feel sticky, I can not even tell I have anything on my face! It is cheaper than some of the other sealers and works great. I recommend anyone with oily skin looking for a solution to the midmorning oil slick to try this.</li>
            <li> Smells good but I&#x27;m not sure if it actually works. My makeup still seems to smear</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my wedding and i love it. it does have a mouth wash smell to it but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Just make sure you don&#x27;t spray too close to the face.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT... a bit high priced for what it is, but it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> really keeps make up from running when hot</li>
            <li> i thought this sealer would help with makeup transfer to clothing, etc. but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what its purpose is.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work, but noticed that after each use my skin had a bad reaction. I tried it twice to make sure that it was the final seal that was making my skin break out.</li>
            <li> It helped a little but it felt like i was just putting non arisol hair spray on my face. it smelled really great but i wouldn&#x27;t buy this again</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly, just beware of coating it too thickly, especially around your eyes xD I had to pry mine open once or twice.</li>
            <li> The product arrived within the suggested estimated arrival time. This product just didn&#x27;t work for me. The spray nozzle spritz out the product rather than mists it out. I believe that is just a fault with the Ben Nye package rather than anything the seller had control over. It also did not keep me matte free all day (or even 4 hours of the day.) Overall, I would buy from this seller again, just not this product.</li>
            <li> Seals my makeup beautifully!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and my makeup always rubs off on everything. This stuff works great! My makeup doesn&#x27;t budge all day! Recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like having their clothes full of foundation!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care for their spritzer bottle though. It sprayed a stream instead of a mist. I had another bottle with a mister on it and switche them out.  So now it works great giving an even mist all over my face. Definetly will buy this again!</li>
            <li> This is a miracle worker!! I put it on every day to seal my makeup and feel like I&#x27;m saving a ton because I never have to reapply. A terrific product!</li>
            <li> Worked as well as the All- NIghter maybe even better. A little bit goes a long way so, don&#x27;t be heavy handed when using it.</li>
            <li> Did I just put listerine on my face? Cuz that&#x27;s exactly what it smells like. Didnt work either and it burned a little. Threw it away.</li>
