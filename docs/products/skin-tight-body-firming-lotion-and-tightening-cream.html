            <li>This isnt worth your time or money.</li>

            <li> Love it, I use it every where, Great product and would tell my friends about it for sure. Would like for you all to come out w/ something for the face.</li>
            <li> Did not see any noticeable difference after using this product.  Original fragrance is pleasant.  May help those who have minimal loose skin.</li>
            <li> I seen a small difference....... A little disappointed because of what I had read from other reviews.. :(</li>
            <li> Product received on time.and.packaged well</li>
            <li> Love it! It really does smooth and firm! I have ordered three times and recommended it to countless people. Great product!</li>
            <li> Nice smell. Hard to get out of the bottle. Did not seem to do much for me other than moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading good reviews on a couple of websites. The price didn&#x27;t matter as I use tons of different lotions. This one didnt be all it was cracked up to be. It made my skin feel really soft but didnt do anything to tighten it. Stick to Murad skin tightening and stretch marks from Sephora. Its expensive but WORKS! This isnt worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> I started using this for the underside of my forearms and above my knee&#x27;s.  You can actually feel a firming sensation as it dries. The underside of my forearms are now smoother.  I can actually say I can see that it has smoothed out my cellulite above my knee&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;This is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion about 6 weeks ago and it&#x27;s the only skin firming lotion that REALLY does what it says it will do.  Not only that, but the lavender and Love Spell Orange smell amazing and although lotion is thick, it soaks right in with no greasy feeling.  Love it, love it, can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
            <li> I first got this lotion to tighten up my skin for a dance performance. I lost quite a bit of weight, and had some loose skin leftover. My friend who does body building competitions recommended it. I definitely saw noticeable results. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker... It won&#x27;t take you down a size or something. But it helped tighten my skin noticeably. I use it all the time now! It smells nice, seems to use all (as far as I can tell) natural ingredients, and is paraben-free.</li>
            <li> not sure it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> READ THE REVIEWS ON AMAZON AND HAD SUCH HIGH HOPES FOR THIS LOTION. NUMBER ONE IT IS SO THICK THAT I HAVE TO REMOVE THE CAP AND BANG THE BOTTLE JUST TO GET THE LOTION OUT.. NO IMPROVMENT WHAT SO EVER.. GOING IN THE TRASH</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product is only $20.00. It truly firms and leaves skin smooth. I saw results after two weeks of constant use (once per day). The instructions say twice a day. My cellulite in my legs were less noticeable after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This lotion truly does what it says you just have to give it sometime.  My arms, my thighs and and my stomach is tightening and firming. I&#x27;m a fan forever!!!!!</li>
            <li> Over the past several weeks starting to notice a firmness. It works better than other products that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> There maybe a small improvement in my skin. I use this twice a day. My skin looks a bit lighter. But the difference isn&#x27;t enough to make me want to continue it. Plus I still have to use mmy moisturizer .</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money . Didnt work .</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite skin firming creams and it&#x27;s also one of the best.  I love this stuff because it really does what it says!!</li>
            <li> This is nice on your skin and moistens, but no skin tightening seen.  I would not recommend for skin tightening. Very expensive</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is thick so you don&#x27;t need much. I have noticed some firming in my skin. The only draw back is it smells a bit like vomit at first. After a few weeks the smell was not so bad. Not sure why that is. I would recommend this product for someone wanting firmer skin.</li>
