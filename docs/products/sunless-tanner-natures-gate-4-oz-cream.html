    <ol>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, sunless tanner can&#x27;t be the best for you</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect to get that &amp;#34;natural glow&amp;#34; without the harmful effects of UV rays.</li>
            <li>great stuff!</li>
            <li>I was really impressed with this self tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>This tanner is excellent.</li>
            <li>I followed the video instructions for my legs and it worked great!</li>
            <li>and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>And, the price is great too!</li>
            <li>(yeah, I&#x27;m experienced !)</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S EVEN BETTER THAN NEUTROGENA!!!!</li>
            <li>That ingredient will give you the effects that Vitamin C has on the collagen production, therefore it is actually GOOD for your skin!</li>
            <li>Great buy nevertheless...</li>
            <li>I was really really happy with the brown in the results (as opposed to orange).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they make the bronzing creme any longer which is a shame because it was great and the replacement is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Great alternative to Jergens, etc.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS SELF TANNER!!</li>
            <li>I had a nice tan on my face!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m even more impressed.</li>
            <li>and I actually liked the scent!  </li>
            <li>pleasant smell, but turned my ankes and feet orange.</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>This is actually good for your skin and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>I love this self-tanner!</li>
            <li>it does have a nice color that looks natural-my boyfriend liked it.</li>
            <li>I liked the olive oil component in it</li>
            <li>I applied another coat and got a really nice bronze color.</li>
            <li>kind.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a very nice light brown hue that people notice.  </li>
            <li>very good lotion...gives me a real looking tan!</li>
            <li>It creates a real nice color and is easy to apply; smooth and creamy feel to it.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for the face and neck area to achieve a nice and natural glow.</li>
            <li>Not too impressed although it is a natural ingredient product!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product after reading a lot of good reviews.  </li>
            <li>My favorite brand.</li>
            <li>you will love it</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as noticable on the neck area but that section seems to be more stubborn with any product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll end up buying more.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased that the tanning scent was non-existent when applied and was</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have a tried different brands and I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Love the results.</li>
            <li>The color guide could have been darker (I like to really be able to see where i&#x27;m putting it</li>
            <li>ok...</li>
            <li>indoors but more on the yellow/washed out orangeish side when I went outdoors.</li>
            <li>, the product is a bit too yellow for me (but definitely not bad), so there, u get the idea! :D</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s great so far!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this after purchasing \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Gate Happy Glow Lucky Bronzing Creme\\&quot; which was great and actually gave a true bronzed tan look.  </li>
            <li>this is a great natural self tanner.</li>
            <li>The price is great and if you have sensitive skin this is your self tanner.</li>
            <li>This product has good ingredients and works very well.</li>
            <li>Drys quickly, but very easy to make mistakes.</li>
            <li>I really wanted a product that would produce a nice tan without the orange.</li>
            <li>It was cheap</li>
            <li>May be better suited for someone who already has a golden tone to their skin.</li>
            <li>It smells tropical when squirted out, and glides on smoothly .</li>
            <li>and I suppose more natural ingredient wise than others and the price is right.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>Excited to start</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it&#x27;s made in the US and contains so many natural ingredients, but more than anything...</li>
            <li>Being very fair, I&#x27;ve tried a wide variety of sunless tanners to give me a natural sun kissed look and Natures Gate was able to do that.</li>
            <li>I was SOOO thrilled to see this \\&quot;natural \\&quot; tanner at my health food store.</li>
            <li>The consistency is creamy and smooth, just the right viscosity.</li>
            <li>I have tried many self tanners as well as high end products like St. Tropez which broke out my skin.</li>
            <li>I just started using this product a few days ago and it does work well but also has a nice, unusual sent and is good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>The lotion itself has a light, pleasant, slightly citrusy scent.</li>
            <li>It applied evenly, absorbed quickly on my skin (5 minutes, tops), and did not leave any residue.</li>
            <li>and I was able to go about my day with a very busy toddler without worrying about the color transferring onto anything I came into contact with.</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m going to Key West for my birthday, and I will be in a swimsuit (and slathered inthe highest SPF available, to avoid MORE tanning)</li>
            <li>It was not streaky at all, and while golden, not orange at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was not streaky at all, and while golden, not orange at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also like the fact that it is more natural.</li>
            <li>However I was extremely pleased the next day when it developed into a nice sun-kissed glow.</li>
            <li>However, the one coat was perfect to look like I just spent a day outside.</li>
            <li>It does include some natural ingredients as well and is much more bearable .&lt;br</li>
            <li>After applying 2 applications over the course of 2 days, I have a really nice, natural bronze tone that I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never had from any other product than Natures Gate.</li>
            <li>I have slight rosacea in the winter and the fact that this evens out my skin tone is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super itchy and still have a rash three days after first applying the sunless tanner.</li>
            <li>have noticed that as soon as you shower almost all of the color comes off right away</li>
            <li>My first application was right after I towel-dried from a shower, and I had shaved my legs and exfoliated my stomach with a scrubbie-shower-pouf.</li>
            <li>The new jergens natural glow smells great, feels like a light lotion, and gives a natural look, completly opposite from this product.</li>
            <li>I try to be as healthy as possible.  </li>
            <li>I chose this one and a Hemp brand that is more of a gradual tinting lotion (similar to the Jergens gradual self tanner).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the trip is the weekend, I started with the Nature&#x27;s Gate, as it is more of a traditional, works-in-a-few-hours self tanner.</li>
            <li>I applied directly to my thighs and lower legs, avoiding knees and ankles until almost no lotion was on my hands, and I then lightly rubbed that remaining product on those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my suggestion is that if you are doing the same then you should probably not wear anything for an hour because it wore off a bit of the lotion even after I waited 15 mins to make sure the lotion was \\&quot;dry\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>use only 1 layer, never tried more than that.</li>
            <li>Used for the first time as my summer tan is beginning to fade.</li>
            <li>This product gave a nice brown result, but greasy due to the olive oil content.  </li>
            <li>I looked up reviews and they seemed positive -- even when people spoke of the smell .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned and have used various self-tanners over the past 22 years</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly and the smell is very light and does not last long.</li>
            <li>It really works quick, its natural looking</li>
            <li>Scent is not bad compared to other self tanners, citrus smell and light.</li>
            <li>My legs and stomach already almost matched my feet, although both were still much lighter than my arms.</li>
            <li>legs.t matched my feet, although both were still much lighter than my arms.</li>
            <li>Needs to be rubbed in very well for even coverage.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>but then I don&#x27;t really care that much.</li>
            <li>Liked the product overall, however it did have a different smell that I did not care for.</li>
            <li>Most other brands you have to put on 3-4apps.  </li>
            <li>my body looks awesome afterwards, i was really addicted to it for a long time...</li>
            <li>Of all the different application methods, lotions are my least favorite, but the reviews on this one had me try it once more</li>
            <li>I have a reddish skin tone so the day I had the lotion actually on my skin, it looked orangey and fake and it does not smell as good (once on the body) as many of these comments suggest.</li>
            <li>I have been using it mainly on my lower body.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to exfoliate thoroughly (apparently using those paint buffer sticks they have at Home Depot is something some professionals do prior to application) and give time to dry; make sure to apply evenly to hands before washing and only rub off the palms so it doesn&#x27;t get spotty from the water.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>A few hours later, my legs perfectly matched my feet and my stomach -- which was the palest area to start with -- was darker but seemed still slightly lighter than my feet/</li>
            <li>A few hours later, my legs perfectly matched my feet and my stomach -- which was the palest area to start with -- was darker but seemed still slightly lighter than my feet/legs.</li>
            <li>It provides a little color without looking orange and doesn&#x27;t have the smell that many products do.  </li>
            <li>I used it on the area where my bikini bottom would normally cover and</li>
            <li>only very mild several hours</li>
            <li>was surprised to read the review claiming that it didn&#x27;t absorb quickly and was oily, but I think everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li>Glad to have this healthy alternative to real sun or expensive spray tans!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this self-tanner, and plan on using it frequently!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t like some of the new ones that deposit color in a matter of hours.  </li>
            <li>For a few summers I was using Natures Gate Upper Tanagement which was amazing , but has since been discontinued and either replaced or repackaged with this new product</li>
            <li>Many tanners result in a color that almost makes the skin appear dirty, but this gives you that healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The color looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a margarine sufferer and very sensitive to fragrances, but this one did not offend or affect me.</li>
            <li>a light fragrance, the color-not too dark</li>
            <li>I will be applying one more coat now, 3 days after the initial application, to test how dark it gets.</li>
            <li>The lotion is pleasant enough and non irritating for me.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll really use this one in the cooler months when my house is drier and my skin sucks up the moisture of a lotion super fast.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t actually WANT to be tan, but I live in Florida and even with sunscreen use, I get a little bit of color -- unevenly, because since I don&#x27;t sunbathe, my exposure is daily stuff that I can&#x27;t avoid; my left arm (from driving) is much darker than any other part of my body, my legs are fair because I mostly wear jeans, but my feet have tan lines from wearing flip-flops, and I have a tank-top \\&quot;farmer&#x27;s tan\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It gives a natural color to the skin.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t really rub it in all the way it only leaves part of your legs tan.</li>
            <li>Seems to be fairly natural in looks and ingredients.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, DO NOT USE this product.</li>
            <li>The color was fairly natural , save a 2x2 streaky</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that while the lotion goes on rather thick, it spreads very evenly and absorbs quickly into the skin</li>
            <li>I read pretty positive reviews on this sunless tanner and liked the fact that it&#x27;s from an organic company that doesn&#x27;t add a bunch of crap chemicals to their products.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and most importantly</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and thought this would finally be the sunless tanner for me.</li>
            <li>I have only used this on my face and neck area so far.  </li>
            <li>and I apply a little bit of body lotion to my elbows, ankles and knees right after I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li>next morning, I applied another coat (using the same method) to my stomach and legs, although I did not shower first, so my skin was completely dry, aside from any moisturizing benefits of the tanner itself from the night before.</li>
            <li>next morning, I applied another coat (using the same method) to my stomach and legs, although I did not shower first, so my skin was completely dry, aside from any moisturizing benefits of the tanner itself from the night before.</li>
            <li>Also, as opposed to the other locally available cruelty-free self-tanners, this one has a slight tint to it, making it easier to see where it&#x27;s going and prevent</li>
            <li>I am naturally fair skinned (despite being Italian..bummer), and wanted to look a little less pale for the summer.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think the benefits of the moisture far outweighs the nuisance of extra drying time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Eastern Asian and the color looks natural on me, just the way I would tan if I stay out in the sun for a long period of time.</li>

            <li> It was not streaky at all, and while golden, not orange at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was not streaky at all, and while golden, not orange at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also like the fact that it is more natural.</li>
            <li> However I was extremely pleased the next day when it developed into a nice sun-kissed glow.</li>
            <li> However, the one coat was perfect to look like I just spent a day outside.</li>
            <li> It does include some natural ingredients as well and is much more bearable .&lt;br</li>
            <li> After applying 2 applications over the course of 2 days, I have a really nice, natural bronze tone that I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never had from any other product than Natures Gate.</li>
            <li> I have slight rosacea in the winter and the fact that this evens out my skin tone is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super itchy and still have a rash three days after first applying the sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> have noticed that as soon as you shower almost all of the color comes off right away</li>
            <li> My first application was right after I towel-dried from a shower, and I had shaved my legs and exfoliated my stomach with a scrubbie-shower-pouf.</li>
            <li> The new jergens natural glow smells great, feels like a light lotion, and gives a natural look, completly opposite from this product.</li>
            <li> I try to be as healthy as possible.  </li>
            <li> I chose this one and a Hemp brand that is more of a gradual tinting lotion (similar to the Jergens gradual self tanner).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the trip is the weekend, I started with the Nature&#x27;s Gate, as it is more of a traditional, works-in-a-few-hours self tanner.</li>
            <li> I applied directly to my thighs and lower legs, avoiding knees and ankles until almost no lotion was on my hands, and I then lightly rubbed that remaining product on those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my suggestion is that if you are doing the same then you should probably not wear anything for an hour because it wore off a bit of the lotion even after I waited 15 mins to make sure the lotion was \\&quot;dry\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> use only 1 layer, never tried more than that.</li>
            <li> Used for the first time as my summer tan is beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> This product gave a nice brown result, but greasy due to the olive oil content.  </li>
            <li> I looked up reviews and they seemed positive -- even when people spoke of the smell .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and have used various self-tanners over the past 22 years</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly and the smell is very light and does not last long.</li>
            <li> It really works quick, its natural looking</li>
            <li> Scent is not bad compared to other self tanners, citrus smell and light.</li>
            <li> My legs and stomach already almost matched my feet, although both were still much lighter than my arms.</li>
            <li> legs.t matched my feet, although both were still much lighter than my arms.</li>
            <li> Needs to be rubbed in very well for even coverage.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> but then I don&#x27;t really care that much.</li>
            <li> Liked the product overall, however it did have a different smell that I did not care for.</li>
            <li> Most other brands you have to put on 3-4apps.  </li>
            <li> my body looks awesome afterwards, i was really addicted to it for a long time...</li>
            <li> Of all the different application methods, lotions are my least favorite, but the reviews on this one had me try it once more</li>
            <li> I have a reddish skin tone so the day I had the lotion actually on my skin, it looked orangey and fake and it does not smell as good (once on the body) as many of these comments suggest.</li>
            <li> I have been using it mainly on my lower body.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to exfoliate thoroughly (apparently using those paint buffer sticks they have at Home Depot is something some professionals do prior to application) and give time to dry; make sure to apply evenly to hands before washing and only rub off the palms so it doesn&#x27;t get spotty from the water.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A few hours later, my legs perfectly matched my feet and my stomach -- which was the palest area to start with -- was darker but seemed still slightly lighter than my feet/</li>
            <li> A few hours later, my legs perfectly matched my feet and my stomach -- which was the palest area to start with -- was darker but seemed still slightly lighter than my feet/legs.</li>
            <li> It provides a little color without looking orange and doesn&#x27;t have the smell that many products do.  </li>
            <li> I used it on the area where my bikini bottom would normally cover and</li>
            <li> only very mild several hours</li>
            <li> was surprised to read the review claiming that it didn&#x27;t absorb quickly and was oily, but I think everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li> Glad to have this healthy alternative to real sun or expensive spray tans!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this self-tanner, and plan on using it frequently!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t like some of the new ones that deposit color in a matter of hours.  </li>
            <li> For a few summers I was using Natures Gate Upper Tanagement which was amazing , but has since been discontinued and either replaced or repackaged with this new product</li>
            <li> Many tanners result in a color that almost makes the skin appear dirty, but this gives you that healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The color looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a margarine sufferer and very sensitive to fragrances, but this one did not offend or affect me.</li>
            <li> a light fragrance, the color-not too dark</li>
            <li> I will be applying one more coat now, 3 days after the initial application, to test how dark it gets.</li>
            <li> The lotion is pleasant enough and non irritating for me.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll really use this one in the cooler months when my house is drier and my skin sucks up the moisture of a lotion super fast.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually WANT to be tan, but I live in Florida and even with sunscreen use, I get a little bit of color -- unevenly, because since I don&#x27;t sunbathe, my exposure is daily stuff that I can&#x27;t avoid; my left arm (from driving) is much darker than any other part of my body, my legs are fair because I mostly wear jeans, but my feet have tan lines from wearing flip-flops, and I have a tank-top \\&quot;farmer&#x27;s tan\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It gives a natural color to the skin.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t really rub it in all the way it only leaves part of your legs tan.</li>
            <li> Seems to be fairly natural in looks and ingredients.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, DO NOT USE this product.</li>
            <li> The color was fairly natural , save a 2x2 streaky</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that while the lotion goes on rather thick, it spreads very evenly and absorbs quickly into the skin</li>
            <li> I read pretty positive reviews on this sunless tanner and liked the fact that it&#x27;s from an organic company that doesn&#x27;t add a bunch of crap chemicals to their products.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and most importantly</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and thought this would finally be the sunless tanner for me.</li>
            <li> I have only used this on my face and neck area so far.  </li>
            <li> and I apply a little bit of body lotion to my elbows, ankles and knees right after I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> next morning, I applied another coat (using the same method) to my stomach and legs, although I did not shower first, so my skin was completely dry, aside from any moisturizing benefits of the tanner itself from the night before.</li>

            <li> Also, as opposed to the other locally available cruelty-free self-tanners, this one has a slight tint to it, making it easier to see where it&#x27;s going and prevent</li>
            <li> I am naturally fair skinned (despite being Italian..bummer), and wanted to look a little less pale for the summer.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think the benefits of the moisture far outweighs the nuisance of extra drying time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Eastern Asian and the color looks natural on me, just the way I would tan if I stay out in the sun for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I just could not believe the smell was so strong and horrible (no , I&#x27;m not pregnant ) after having read the more positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Color develops over night so don&#x27;t plan on a quick tan&lt;br /&gt;Gives a fairly good base color, but a second application is needed if you are very pale like I am&lt;</li>
            <li> Tried waiting to air dry and then drying with hair dryer but still greasy until about 30 minutes later.</li>
            <li> The color looked very natural, although a little warmer than what little color I naturally develop.</li>
            <li> The color looked very natural, although a little warmer than what little color I naturally develop.</li>
            <li> The tanner does have a little bit of a.. shall we say.. &#x27;scent&#x27;,  and it does take a little while to dry, but it was so much better than the one I&#x27;d used in the past.</li>
            <li> The key to not streaking, by the way, is to rub-in, rub-in, rub-in...until your skin feels dry and there isn&#x27;t anything to rub in!  </li>
            <li> I never paid attention how long it lasts</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the tube is rather small if you plan on applying all over the body, but that is my one and only gripe, and it is certainly priced fairly enough for the amount provided.</li>
            <li> It lessened \\&quot;down \\&quot; to that \\&quot;fake tanner \\&quot; smell after a while (though I fear it may have smelled as strong to others--</li>
            <li> I use it on my face a lot (it has broken me out a little but the tiny little spots...no huge blemishes.</li>
            <li> -I apply it just like body lotion careful not to miss any spots</li>
            <li> Did not perform like I expected.</li>
            <li> Following the instruction, you see the tan developing within a few hours, not immediately.</li>
            <li> I wish I could tell where I&#x27;ve applied it, but other than that</li>
            <li> which other people even notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many sunless tanners in my life - from very inexpensive ones to very expensive ones, and they&#x27;ve all done the same thing - smelled bad, and turned my skin orange.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale so that could be a big reason.</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate is very different, at least it is for me.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this one, not worth it.</li>
            <li> especially you have a thick layer on (trying to achieve a darker tan).</li>
            <li> but I just use a little bit.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few sunless tanning lotions that does not streak or smell.  </li>
            <li> I can keep a tan all year round now.</li>
            <li> I had a few people ask me if I went to the beach, and had no idea</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; product.:/</li>
            <li> I put on one coat, and I was definitely a little darker-and NO STREAKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many sunless tanners and I beleive this was one of the worst.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical of all self-tanners since using one several years ago and turning..</li>
            <li> If you are skeptical on this product, definitely buy it!</li>
            <li> Since bleaching the darker parts is unrealistic and would take too long anyway, I figured I&#x27;d try a self-tanner on my lighter areas.</li>
            <li> Not only did it smell funky, but it also left me ORANGE and with a terrible rash.</li>
            <li> made my skin break out in bumps, color was not good, too greasy.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst tanning lotion I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> However, it streaked HORRIBLY and left me looking orange.  </li>
            <li> and &#x27;orange&#x27;, &#x27;fake tanning lotion look&#x27;</li>
            <li> which work but have bad chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> pleasant smell, but turned my ankes and feet orange. I only used it twice.I really wanted a product that would produce a nice tan without the orange.</li>
            <li> After using this stuff, I wonder when I got the suntan. It really works quick, its natural looking and I suppose more natural ingredient wise than others and the price is right. Unless somebody can convince me otherwise, will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My favorite brand. I try to be as healthy as possible.  Let&#x27;s face it, sunless tanner can&#x27;t be the best for you but this is one of the safest you can buy (in my price range and my opinion).  I cannot afford some of these $30 bottles! Give me a break! I use it on my face a lot (it has broken me out a little but the tiny little spots...no huge blemishes. They heal up in one day). The color looks very natural.  This isn&#x27;t like some of the new ones that deposit color in a matter of hours.  You need a minimum of 8 hours.  I will often put it on in the morning, wash off in the evening, and the color still continues to develop over night. The key to not streaking, by the way, is to rub-in, rub-in, rub-in...until your skin feels dry and there isn&#x27;t anything to rub in!  I never get streaking on my face but I just use a little bit.  Then I apply my regular moisturizer after applying the tanner.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for years.&lt;br /&gt;continue to buy it&lt;br /&gt;perfect sunless tan&lt;br /&gt;try it you will love it</li>
            <li> I love this self-tanner! It&#x27;s perfect to get that &amp;#34;natural glow&amp;#34; without the harmful effects of UV rays. It is also made with olive oil, so it keeps my skin hydrated. I have slight rosacea in the winter and the fact that this evens out my skin tone is amazing! I don&#x27;t even have to wear foundation!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product after reading a lot of good reviews.  However, it streaked HORRIBLY and left me looking orange.  I&#x27;ve used self tanner for years now so I&#x27;m pretty sure I know how to apply it correctly.  I also didn&#x27;t like the smell, I don&#x27;t think it smelled like citrus at all.  I will not be being buying again.</li>
            <li> the tanner actually gives u an extra glow, especially if you use it on yr face underneath yr makeup... my body looks awesome afterwards, i was really addicted to it for a long time... until i actually get a tan! the thing with self tanner is, when it&#x27;s summer, and you sweat, color comes off, especially you have a thick layer on (trying to achieve a darker tan). i still use it though even i hv a tan, because the product gives u extra glow and darker tan, so why not! i hv olive skin tone, the product is a bit too yellow for me (but definitely not bad), so there, u get the idea! :D Great buy nevertheless...</li>
            <li> I have only used this on my face and neck area so far.  The 1st time I used it, I applied 1 coat, waited about 5-10 min&#x27;s and applied a 2nd coat.  In about 4 hrs. I had a nice tan on my face!  It isn&#x27;t as noticable on the neck area but that section seems to be more stubborn with any product.  I wish I could tell where I&#x27;ve applied it, but other than that, I think it&#x27;s great so far!  It creates a real nice color and is easy to apply; smooth and creamy feel to it.  I will keep using this and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll end up buying more.  I wish they had it in a larger, pump bottle.... great stuff!</li>
            <li> Not too impressed although it is a natural ingredient product!</li>
            <li> For a few summers I was using Natures Gate Upper Tanagement which was amazing , but has since been discontinued and either replaced or repackaged with this new product and I&#x27;m even more impressed. Being very fair, I&#x27;ve tried a wide variety of sunless tanners to give me a natural sun kissed look and Natures Gate was able to do that. Self tanners always have some sort of \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; odor to them when applied so I&#x27;ve learned to expect this no matter what the product claims. I was pleased that the tanning scent was non-existent when applied and was only very mild several hours later.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to read the review claiming that it didn&#x27;t absorb quickly and was oily, but I think everyone&#x27;s skin is different. I was pleasantly surprised that while the lotion goes on rather thick, it spreads very evenly and absorbs quickly into the skin and I was able to go about my day with a very busy toddler without worrying about the color transferring onto anything I came into contact with. After applying 2 applications over the course of 2 days, I have a really nice, natural bronze tone that I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never had from any other product than Natures Gate. Many tanners result in a color that almost makes the skin appear dirty, but this gives you that healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the tube is rather small if you plan on applying all over the body, but that is my one and only gripe, and it is certainly priced fairly enough for the amount provided. Definitely give this tanner a try-I apply it just like body lotion careful not to miss any spots and I apply a little bit of body lotion to my elbows, ankles and knees right after I&#x27;m done and I&#x27;ve never had any streaking issues. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product a few days ago and it does work well but also has a nice, unusual sent and is good for your skin.  It has Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate in it which is the reason I bought it.  That ingredient will give you the effects that Vitamin C has on the collagen production, therefore it is actually GOOD for your skin!</li>
            <li> This is one of the few sunless tanning lotions that does not streak or smell.  You only need about 2 coats to go from nothing to tann. Most other brands you have to put on 3-4apps.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and thought this would finally be the sunless tanner for me. within 2 hrs of applying it I broke out in an itchy rash. it does have a nice color that looks natural-my boyfriend liked it. i won&#x27;t buy this again, though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually WANT to be tan, but I live in Florida and even with sunscreen use, I get a little bit of color -- unevenly, because since I don&#x27;t sunbathe, my exposure is daily stuff that I can&#x27;t avoid; my left arm (from driving) is much darker than any other part of my body, my legs are fair because I mostly wear jeans, but my feet have tan lines from wearing flip-flops, and I have a tank-top \\&quot;farmer&#x27;s tan\\&quot;. But, I&#x27;m going to Key West for my birthday, and I will be in a swimsuit (and slathered inthe highest SPF available, to avoid MORE tanning) so I want what color I have to be relatively even. Since bleaching the darker parts is unrealistic and would take too long anyway, I figured I&#x27;d try a self-tanner on my lighter areas. I chose this one and a Hemp brand that is more of a gradual tinting lotion (similar to the Jergens gradual self tanner). Both were chosen because of their price point and being cruelty-free. Also, as opposed to the other locally available cruelty-free self-tanners, this one has a slight tint to it, making it easier to see where it&#x27;s going and prevent streaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the trip is the weekend, I started with the Nature&#x27;s Gate, as it is more of a traditional, works-in-a-few-hours self tanner. The lotion itself has a light, pleasant, slightly citrusy scent. I&#x27;m a margarine sufferer and very sensitive to fragrances, but this one did not offend or affect me. The consistency is creamy and smooth, just the right viscosity. It applied evenly, absorbed quickly on my skin (5 minutes, tops), and did not leave any residue. My first application was right after I towel-dried from a shower, and I had shaved my legs and exfoliated my stomach with a scrubbie-shower-pouf. I applied directly to my thighs and lower legs, avoiding knees and ankles until almost no lotion was on my hands, and I then lightly rubbed that remaining product on those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple hours, I could definitely tell a difference. My legs and stomach already almost matched my feet, although both were still much lighter than my arms. The color looked very natural, although a little warmer than what little color I naturally develop. It was not streaky at all, and while golden, not orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, I applied another coat (using the same method) to my stomach and legs, although I did not shower first, so my skin was completely dry, aside from any moisturizing benefits of the tanner itself from the night before. A few hours later, my legs perfectly matched my feet and my stomach -- which was the palest area to start with -- was darker but seemed still slightly lighter than my feet/legs.t matched my feet, although both were still much lighter than my arms.

            <li> I was really impressed with this self tanning lotion.  I liked the olive oil component in it and I actually liked the scent!  I appreciate that it&#x27;s made in the US and contains so many natural ingredients, but more than anything... it&#x27;s about the tan. I was really really happy with the brown in the results (as opposed to orange).  Of all the different application methods, lotions are my least favorite, but the reviews on this one had me try it once more and I&#x27;m really glad I did.  I think I&#x27;ll really use this one in the cooler months when my house is drier and my skin sucks up the moisture of a lotion super fast.  In the meantime, I just lay in room under a fan and watch TV for 20 minutes to speed up the drying. Overall, I think the benefits of the moisture far outweighs the nuisance of extra drying time.  Besides, isn&#x27;t tanner softer skin what we&#x27;re ultimately trying to achieve?  Win-win.</li>
            <li> Drys quickly, but very easy to make mistakes. Washed my hands after use and must of splashed some water on my arm and woke up with white spots. That shouldn&#x27;t happen after it completly dries.&lt;br /&gt;Update: after taking a shower, I have patches everywhere. I applied around 9:00pm and showered at 3:20pm next day. I&#x27;ve used many sunless tanners and I beleive this was one of the worst. The new jergens natural glow smells great, feels like a light lotion, and gives a natural look, completly opposite from this product.</li>
            <li> very good lotion...gives me a real looking tan!</li>
            <li> This product has good ingredients and works very well. Needs to be rubbed in very well for even coverage. It gives a natural color to the skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after purchasing \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Gate Happy Glow Lucky Bronzing Creme\\&quot; which was great and actually gave a true bronzed tan look.  I don&#x27;t think they make the bronzing creme any longer which is a shame because it was great and the replacement is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for several months and it leaves me with and &#x27;orange&#x27;, &#x27;fake tanning lotion look&#x27; which other people even notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring back the bronzing creme Nature&#x27;s Gate and discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> What I like: the smell- a light fragrance, the color-not too dark&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am having issues with- if you don&#x27;t wash your hands it will stain. 2. If you don&#x27;t really rub it in all the way it only leaves part of your legs tan. I will write back and see if there is any improvement.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It provides a little color without looking orange and doesn&#x27;t have the smell that many products do.  Never had a problem with streaking.  Also like the fact that it is more natural.</li>
            <li> I have a tried different brands and I like this one the best.  It seems to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> Havent used this yet but all the reviews make this the affordable choice for a sunless tanner. Excited to start</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical of all self-tanners since using one several years ago and turning..well, orange. I am naturally fair skinned (despite being Italian..bummer), and wanted to look a little less pale for the summer. I put on one coat, and I was definitely a little darker-and NO STREAKS! The tanner does have a little bit of a.. shall we say.. &#x27;scent&#x27;,  and it does take a little while to dry, but it was so much better than the one I&#x27;d used in the past. I applied another coat and got a really nice bronze color. I highly recommend this self-tanner, and plan on using it frequently!</li>
            <li> This tanner is excellent. I reviewed tons of brands and decided to try Natures Gate.  Now I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else.  Very natural looking!</li>
            <li> been using for years. love it. It replaces my foundation.</li>
            <li> I can keep a tan all year round now. Seems to be fairly natural in looks and ingredients. Good deal.</li>
            <li> this is a great natural self tanner. none of that gross chemically type smell or feel. This goes on smoothly and the smell is very light and does not last long.</li>
            <li> Turned me orange and I could tell it was going to be streaky when I put it on and ofcorse it was! This is by far the worst tanning lotion I have ever tried. I would not recommend unless yOu want to walk around looking like an orange streaky fool lol</li>
            <li> This product gave a nice brown result, but greasy due to the olive oil content.  Tried waiting to air dry and then drying with hair dryer but still greasy until about 30 minutes later.</li>
            <li> I followed the video instructions for my legs and it worked great! the product doesn&#x27;t look as the photo does, but it&#x27;s the same brand and kind. i only applied one layer at the time, but will be applying 2 next time. just because it&#x27;s deeper into the summer and my legs will need to match my arms and face.</li>
            <li> made my skin break out in bumps, color was not good, too greasy. Wore off in spots . Did not perform like I expected.</li>
            <li> I like the product. I have been using it mainly on my lower body. I&#x27;m Eastern Asian and the color looks natural on me, just the way I would tan if I stay out in the sun for a long period of time. Following the instruction, you see the tan developing within a few hours, not immediately. I used it on the area where my bikini bottom would normally cover and my suggestion is that if you are doing the same then you should probably not wear anything for an hour because it wore off a bit of the lotion even after I waited 15 mins to make sure the lotion was \\&quot;dry\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use only 1 layer, never tried more than that. I never paid attention how long it lasts but then I don&#x27;t really care that much. The lotion is pleasant enough and non irritating for me.</li>
            <li> Liked the product overall, however it did have a different smell that I did not care for. I would recommend this product to someone who is trying to find a healthier way to get tan.</li>
            <li> Not only did it smell funky, but it also left me ORANGE and with a terrible rash. If you have sensitive skin, DO NOT USE this product. I&#x27;m super itchy and still have a rash three days after first applying the sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> Color develops over night so don&#x27;t plan on a quick tan&lt;br /&gt;Gives a fairly good base color, but a second application is needed if you are very pale like I am&lt;br /&gt;No scent that I noticed&lt;br /&gt;Lightly colored so you can see where you have put it&lt;br /&gt;Dries/absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that as soon as you shower almost all of the color comes off right away&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again</li>
            <li> Used for the first time as my summer tan is beginning to fade. Love the results. Could not tell a difference from using non organic brands.</li>
            <li> I just received this self tanner in the mail and I am very happy with it. The price is great and if you have sensitive skin this is your self tanner. Perfect for the face and neck area to achieve a nice and natural glow. Not orange at all. Scent is not bad compared to other self tanners, citrus smell and light. I have tried many self tanners as well as high end products like St. Tropez which broke out my skin. This is actually good for your skin and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. The only thing I will say is it is a bit greasy to wear underneath your makeup so I would recommend wearing it at night before bed.  If you are skeptical on this product, definitely buy it! You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I read pretty positive reviews on this sunless tanner and liked the fact that it&#x27;s from an organic company that doesn&#x27;t add a bunch of crap chemicals to their products. It was cheap so I gave it a try. The smell wasn&#x27;t horrible. The color guide could have been darker (I like to really be able to see where i&#x27;m putting it so I don&#x27;t end up with missed patches and streaks). I did get some color from this, but not enough to repurchase. The color looked...ok...indoors but more on the yellow/washed out orangeish side when I went outdoors. Not pretty. I&#x27;m very pale so that could be a big reason. May be better suited for someone who already has a golden tone to their skin.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003AFI8D8 Natures Gate Sunless Tanner Self Tanning Lotion 4 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many sunless tanners in my life - from very inexpensive ones to very expensive ones, and they&#x27;ve all done the same thing - smelled bad, and turned my skin orange.  Nature&#x27;s Gate is very different, at least it is for me.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and most importantly, it does not make my skin orange.  It gives my skin a very nice light brown hue that people notice.  I&#x27;ve been asked numerous times what I use and where I got it.  And, the price is great too!</li>
            <li> I have a reddish skin tone so the day I had the lotion actually on my skin, it looked orangey and fake and it does not smell as good (once on the body) as many of these comments suggest. However I was extremely pleased the next day when it developed into a nice sun-kissed glow. I will be applying one more coat now, 3 days after the initial application, to test how dark it gets. However, the one coat was perfect to look like I just spent a day outside. I had a few people ask me if I went to the beach, and had no idea it was sunless tanner! Great alternative to Jergens, etc. which work but have bad chemicals in them. Just make sure to exfoliate thoroughly (apparently using those paint buffer sticks they have at Home Depot is something some professionals do prior to application) and give time to dry; make sure to apply evenly to hands before washing and only rub off the palms so it doesn&#x27;t get spotty from the water. Glad to have this healthy alternative to real sun or expensive spray tans!</li>
            <li> I was SOOO thrilled to see this \\&quot;natural \\&quot; tanner at my health food store. I looked up reviews and they seemed positive -- even when people spoke of the smell . I&#x27;m very fair skinned and have used various self-tanners over the past 22 years (yeah, I&#x27;m experienced !).&lt;br /&gt;  When I opened this, and squirted it out and wanted to barf. I just could not believe the smell was so strong and horrible (no , I&#x27;m not pregnant ) after having read the more positive reviews. I hoped against hope that the smell would lessen. It lessened \\&quot;down \\&quot; to that \\&quot;fake tanner \\&quot; smell after a while (though I fear it may have smelled as strong to others-- and I&#x27;d just become adjusted&#x3D;scary).&lt;br /&gt;  The color was fairly natural , save a 2x2 streaky area.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m planning to try and return it to my health food store . I just can&#x27;t bear the smell and had to apologize to my husband for my stench.:/&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve switched back to the \\&quot;non- natural\\&quot; kind.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently giving Nivea a try . It smells tropical when squirted out, and glides on smoothly . It does include some natural ingredients as well and is much more bearable .&lt;br /&gt;  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; product.:/</li>
            <li> Do not like this stuff. It leaves you with an organgy color. I would not recommend this one, not worth it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SELF TANNER!! IT&#x27;S EVEN BETTER THAN NEUTROGENA!!!!</li>
