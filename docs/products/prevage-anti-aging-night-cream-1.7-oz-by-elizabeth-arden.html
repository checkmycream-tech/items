            <li>I love love this night cream, it really works!</li>
            <li>Love this product and it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon customer service who advised me to throw it away &amp; fortunately have credited my credit card &amp; re-ordered Elizabeth Arden Allergan Prevage Anti-Aging night cream.  </li>
            <li>I hope it is the genuine product</li>
            <li>Prevage night cream is worth every penny:))</li>
            <li>I finally ran out of it and asked her if I could buy it somewhere since I liked it and felt that my skin was more youthful.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is amazing, not heavy or grease.</li>
            <li>It seems like the same product I had used as a sample and is working as good as before.</li>
            <li>I ordered the prevage cream and I received it quickly.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>I will come back ,It&#x27;s a nice buying drip.</li>
            <li>The emollient cream does not feel greasy and is easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Originally I bought this cream at the local mall for much more money.</li>
            <li>While it does cost a pretty penny, I know I&#x27;m worth it.  </li>
            <li>I start seeing the results right in the first week.</li>
            <li>I had try so many different anti aging treatment</li>
            <li>Thanks !</li>
            <li>I look a decade or more younger.</li>
            <li>So far, I see a slight improvement on my face skin - more smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, all was resolved to my satisfaction - much appreciated.</li>
            <li>my older Prevage purchases were not.....</li>
            <li>This product is amazing for my skin which has been dying a slow and steady death since I turned 50 some 6 years ago.  </li>
            <li>It is expensive but she has great skin, if I do say so myself.</li>
            <li>(I knew it said it was new but was not in a box).  </li>
            <li>I like it so far!</li>
            <li>I plan on continuing to use this product for a long time as it makes the skin very dewy and radiant, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it in my book and a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> Average cream and too pricey for little effect.</li>
            <li> you squeeze product out of little hole.  </li>
            <li> She has been using it for a few years now</li>
            <li> Just had for a few days and can already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> and it is far less expensive on Amazon than at Nordstroms!</li>
            <li> it was putrid resulting in small bumps on my face.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the product either-it is not a \\&quot;second\\&quot;; who needs all the packaging and pay for it too?</li>
            <li> Seems I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market and have been disappointed with the results until now.  </li>
            <li> This a staple product for me; it is excessively expensive in department stores, but, at Amamzon prices, I can justify the purchase!!</li>
            <li> The product had a terrible smell to it -</li>

    <ol>
            <li> great product! Use all Prevage products.</li>
            <li> I love Elizabeth Arden Prevage line. I think they did a great job with this line. I tried their eye serum and it worked great on me, so I&#x27;m trying their night cream. So far, I see a slight improvement on my face skin - more smooth and radiant. I like it so far!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0016FZR88 Prevage Anti-Aging Night Cream - 50ml/1.7oz (UNboxed).]]      My daughter worked at a dermotology office last year in Florida and brought me samples of this product. I finally ran out of it and asked her if I could buy it somewhere since I liked it and felt that my skin was more youthful. We finally found it through Amazon. It seems like the same product I had used as a sample and is working as good as before. It is slightly tinted so I works well under my morning moisturizer. I plan on continuing to use this product for a long time as it makes the skin very dewy and radiant, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference only been using for a month</li>
            <li> This a staple product for me; it is excessively expensive in department stores, but, at Amamzon prices, I can justify the purchase!! There is nothing wrong with the product either-it is not a \\&quot;second\\&quot;; who needs all the packaging and pay for it too?</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT...I LOVE IT....IT DOES WANDERS FOR MY COMPLEXION!!!</li>
            <li> I love love this night cream, it really works! The fragrance is amazing, not heavy or grease. I had try so many different anti aging treatment so far this is one of the best. I start seeing the results right in the first week.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this stuff! She has been using it for a few years now and she says it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> My only problem was trying to get into the container. Finally had to cut a hole in the plastic &amp; squeeze the cream out. It was not packaged in a cardboard container like my other products were. The delivery service was great. The product is great., if you can get to it. Loved the good pricing. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Barb</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie and have tried everything.  I also have very sensitive, dry skin and this is the best for me.  I can already tell a difference in the glow of my skin.  Definitely worth a try and it is far less expensive on Amazon than at Nordstroms!</li>
            <li> I am prejudiced and I like Prevage. It does something wonderful for good skin and enhances aging or abused skin. I use this 3 time a week. I think rotating a good product enhances the products and skins do not build up an accommodation to the ingredients.</li>
            <li> No big deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it arrived quickly.  Thanks !</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother-in-law and she loves it. It is expensive but she has great skin, if I do say so myself.</li>
            <li> I ordered the prevage cream and I received it quickly. The price was the best.  Service was excellent. I will order again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful value for a fantastic product. Shipping was fast and service was great!</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product - the way it feels when it&#x27;s applied, the way it smells, the consistency.  And I think it makes a noticable difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the moisture this gives your face; I&#x27;m 62 and it truly gives a lift to your skin.  Will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Seems I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market and have been disappointed with the results until now.  This product is amazing for my skin which has been dying a slow and steady death since I turned 50 some 6 years ago.  I use this nightly and under my foundation for daytime.  My skin stays moist and radiant and that&#x27;s saying something considering my age.  Ladies, give it a shot.  It might be on the pricey side but it&#x27;s worth it in my book and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The product had a terrible smell to it - it was putrid resulting in small bumps on my face. I contacted Amazon customer service who advised me to throw it away &amp; fortunately have credited my credit card &amp; re-ordered Elizabeth Arden Allergan Prevage Anti-Aging night cream.  Thankfully, all was resolved to my satisfaction - much appreciated.</li>
            <li> Love the way this night cream feels. Just had for a few days and can already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Great product would buy again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.and it looks cute~I hope it will good for my skin.I will come back ,It&#x27;s a nice buying drip.</li>
            <li> I received my Prevage on time but haven&#x27;t had time to see any results yet.  I hope it is the genuine product (I knew it said it was new but was not in a box).  It has an odd cover under the lid that cannot be removed...you squeeze product out of little hole.  Maybe the product is now made this way...my older Prevage purchases were not.....</li>
            <li> Average cream and too pricey for little effect.</li>
            <li> This cream works wonders for my skin.  The emollient cream does not feel greasy and is easily absorbed.  My skin feels supple.  While it does cost a pretty penny, I know I&#x27;m worth it.  I use it sparingly at night - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Very good! Great texture and smells very nice and light.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. She says that it is one of the best products that she has found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So,If she is happy ,then I am happy!</li>
            <li> Originally I bought this cream at the local mall for much more money. It goes for ever and it gives the skin what it needs to preserve hydrogenation. I get so many compliments that at the age if 50 I look a decade or more younger. Prevage night cream is worth every penny:)) I paid for it.</li>
