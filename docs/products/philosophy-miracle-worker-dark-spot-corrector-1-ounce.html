    <ol>
            <li>which is PERFECT to me.  </li>
            <li>I think it is for discolorations which to date has been awesome.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Save your money to find a good one.</li>
            <li>Bought the full size and will continue to use it!!!  </li>
            <li>Works better than the product prescribed by my dermatologist!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, but it can&#x27;t erase all of the damage you have not been preventing or managing.</li>
            <li>and this did not bother it, in fact it smells kind of like honey.</li>
            <li>would purchase again and recommend it according to how effective it is</li>
            <li>pleasant aroma and easily applied.</li>
            <li>my 4 year old daughter &amp; my face looked awesome!  </li>
            <li>Ok ok it was even better</li>
            <li>I love this product because it works.</li>
            <li>It is why I ordered this product from you for maintenance &amp; I make sure I wear a hat when I go swimming or sit in the shade.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t do much by itself, but if used with the retinoid pads or even with roc retinoid serum it works beautifully -- and quickly.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m happy how my face is looking now, look more clear and clean.</li>
            <li>This is very gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>First and formost, I am 44 yrs old, have taken VERY good care of my skin since my teens.</li>
            <li>I used this cream and broke out with huge hives.</li>
            <li>I used this every night until I ran out and can&#x27;t believe the amazing results, my spots have faded at least 50% or more, pore size is the most amazing, tightens them up and the overall texture of my skin is amazing!</li>
            <li>I am willing to try one more 30 day application before I  give up on the product altogether.</li>
            <li>I needed a product after a beach vacation where my nose and forehead were significantly darker than the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>I use 3 pumps on my whole face every night &amp; don&#x27;t have to use a moisturer on top.  </li>
            <li>If you are just NOW starting to take care of your skin, have lots of spots and issues, I suggest you go to a good esthetician for treatment to get your skin to where it needs to be.</li>
            <li>, this tiny .4oz tube was amazing, I ordered a 1 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li>and I think it was a waste of a great gift.  </li>
            <li>Note I have very oily skin and use an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have been a religious user for about 6 years maybe more.</li>
            <li>It really makes a world of difference to the effectiveness of this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried BB creams, Clean and Clear products, Neutrogena products,Palmers cocoa butter products, etc.</li>
            <li>but they were bumps &amp; never really formed anything more</li>
            <li>My skinn was very damaged from being on the beach for 3 Summers on the Mediterranean,mid-East.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>And no noticeable result on my face after I have used a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>It really does wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I love it ,it works,&amp; your discounted prices are half the price off</li>
            <li>So I took a picture of a mark that was left, used miracle for another week and sure enough it looked like it did at 2 days...</li>
            <li>I saw results fairly quickly even on spots that had been there for some time unrelated to the recent sun damage.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to even out their skin tone.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I live in Florida</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have combination skin &amp; it moisturizes my face just fine without feeling tight or overly greasy.  </li>
            <li>Even though my skin is clear as can be now, I have still bought another bottle.</li>
            <li>I use an all natural skin oil I make for myself as my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>With this product, not only are the dark spots non-existent, but it the only cream that I have used that had no negative effects on my skin (i.e- dryness, create more acne, burning/ swelling, etc.).</li>
            <li>Since I am 70, I have developed age spots on my face and hands.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be working, though I don&#x27;t know if the spots will eventually fade completely.</li>
            <li>The few light sun spots that I had it did not even deminish them.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t tan my face, but still had uneven skin tone, some age spots and a few fine lines and large pores.</li>
            <li>It has not work any better than local drug store dark spot removers that cost considerably less than this product.  </li>
            <li>a product is really working for dark spots.</li>

            <li> I am darker skinned and have suffered a lot of discoloration from acne and this product is the only one that can rapidly remove the dark spots (even older ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not using long enough to comment on effectivness.</li>
            <li> Squirt just a small bit on the tip of your finger, and using the finger from your other hand, apply it very carefully to the dark spot(s) on your face making sure that the product is only on the part that you want to lighten.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trick is to only apply this to the dark spots, DO NOT apply it to your entire face!</li>
            <li> If you apply it to your entire face like you would a lotion, you&#x27;re lightening your dark spots at the same rate as you&#x27;re lightening the rest of your face, so of course it won&#x27;t appear to be working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only about 2.5 weeks into using the product, but I&#x27;m STARTING to see the dark spots on my face Lighten</li>
            <li> but they always left little white discoloration scars.   </li>
            <li> I will keep using it because I have freckles lighter skin than other spots and red tinges too.</li>
            <li> too early to tell - spots appear to be a little lighter but not much.  </li>
            <li> I have even had to tell the reps at Nordstroms to tell their customers to only apply it on the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I must say I was skeptical because other dark spot treatments have been too strong or didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am to naive and a cheerleader for Miracle in general.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, in the 5th week my face became extremely itchy and I had to stop using the product...</li>
            <li> You just have to be prepared to have a dark spot that week.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no changes with my dark spots regretfully because it is not cheap.</li>
            <li> I have clusters of dark freckles</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been applying the dark spot corrector just over my freckles</li>
            <li> Even though the bottle is small, it lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> I am using this product to try to lighten the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I typically like everything this company produces, but this one is a dud.  </li>
            <li> After a month of faithfully applying...the spots are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but this product needs careful use.</li>
            <li> had freckles all over my face &amp; for first time I developed dark spots,together made a very ugly appearance on my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;.It took a few months freckles &amp; sun spots started to fade away.</li>
            <li> I have had dark spots on my cheeks/ sides of my face from past acne.</li>
            <li> Eventually all ugly stuff was gone except for one large dark spot(nickel size)  but faded.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never too late to start taking care of you skin, but don&#x27;t get upset with products if you think they didn&#x27;t change everything.</li>
            <li> I applied it at least once a day sometimes twice on my cheeks, chin, and sides of my face.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference in that also not as dramatic, but noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not impressed with this product and will not order it again</li>
            <li> which without I looked very ugly..</li>
            <li> They look terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Maybe I am to naive and a cheerleader for Miracle in general. I have been a religious user for about 6 years maybe more. I tried this for 2 days and started seeing results. I used to be on a medication that broke my skin out but they were bumps &amp; never really formed anything more but they always left little white discoloration scars.   I did this for two days and thought no way. So I took a picture of a mark that was left, used miracle for another week and sure enough it looked like it did at 2 days... Ok ok it was even better but there was no white mark at all GONE - which is PERFECT to me.  I will keep using it because I have freckles lighter skin than other spots and red tinges too. I can tell a difference in that also not as dramatic, but noticeable. The liquid is actually makeup color but nothing rubs off at night with a towel or anything else - This is NOT a self-tanning solution. I think it is for discolorations which to date has been awesome.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Philosophy product for several weeks and have yet to notice any result.  I feel for the price I should be seeing some improvement at this point.  So, based on my experience, save your money and get a laser treatment from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this at Sephora, used it for 3 weeks and my face was glowing!!  Took a picture next to my 4 year old daughter &amp; my face looked awesome!  Bought the full size and will continue to use it!!!  I use 3 pumps on my whole face every night &amp; don&#x27;t have to use a moisturer on top.  I have combination skin &amp; it moisturizes my face just fine without feeling tight or overly greasy.  I am sold on it!</li>
            <li> I received a tube of this as a beauty insider at Sephora. WISH I would have gotten 2!&lt;br /&gt;Well, this tiny .4oz tube was amazing, I ordered a 1 ounce bottle. First and formost, I am 44 yrs old, have taken VERY good care of my skin since my teens. I mask every week, exfoliate and use the peel pads once a week. I use an all natural skin oil I make for myself as my moisturizer. Having said that, I live in Florida and I don&#x27;t tan my face, but still had uneven skin tone, some age spots and a few fine lines and large pores.I have VERY sensitive skin and this did not bother it, in fact it smells kind of like honey. I used this every night until I ran out and can&#x27;t believe the amazing results, my spots have faded at least 50% or more, pore size is the most amazing, tightens them up and the overall texture of my skin is amazing! If you are just NOW starting to take care of your skin, have lots of spots and issues, I suggest you go to a good esthetician for treatment to get your skin to where it needs to be. This product is amazing, but it can&#x27;t erase all of the damage you have not been preventing or managing. It&#x27;s never too late to start taking care of you skin, but don&#x27;t get upset with products if you think they didn&#x27;t change everything.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it works.My skinn was very damaged from being on the beach for 3 Summers on the Mediterranean,mid-East.&lt;br /&gt;I had freckles all over my face &amp; for first time I developed dark spots,together made a very ugly appearance on my face,I had to wear liquid heavy cover up makeup to look pretty ,which without I looked very ugly..I saw product 3 yrs ago on Dr. Oz show,I bought it ,used it according to instructions&lt;br /&gt;.It took a few months freckles &amp; sun spots started to fade away.Eventually all ugly stuff was gone except for one large dark spot(nickel size)  but faded. I went to my skin Dr. &amp; she froze it for me,went away but not totally.It is why I ordered this product from you for maintenance &amp; I make sure I wear a hat when I go swimming or sit in the shade.I love it ,it works,&amp; your discounted prices are half the price off form a make up store.Thanks.</li>
            <li> pleasant aroma and easily applied. not using long enough to comment on effectivness. would purchase again and recommend it according to how effective it is</li>
            <li> I used this product for over a month and I saw no improvement at all. I used CURADERM  and the spot was gone in a week. You just have to be prepared to have a dark spot that week. I did cover it with make up though.</li>
            <li> I typically like everything this company produces, but this one is a dud.  I tried it and saw no difference what-so-ever and I followed the directions, so that should not have been a factor.</li>
            <li> I am darker skinned and have suffered a lot of discoloration from acne and this product is the only one that can rapidly remove the dark spots (even older ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to only apply this to the dark spots, DO NOT apply it to your entire face! Squirt just a small bit on the tip of your finger, and using the finger from your other hand, apply it very carefully to the dark spot(s) on your face making sure that the product is only on the part that you want to lighten. If you apply it to your entire face like you would a lotion, you&#x27;re lightening your dark spots at the same rate as you&#x27;re lightening the rest of your face, so of course it won&#x27;t appear to be working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So before saying that this product doesn&#x27;t work, please try this method instead, as it has worked wonders for me! I have even had to tell the reps at Nordstroms to tell their customers to only apply it on the dark spots. It really makes a world of difference to the effectiveness of this product!</li>
            <li> Went through 2 bottles of this with no results.  Absolutely no changes with my dark spots regretfully because it is not cheap.</li>
            <li> The product came in 2 containers; one pump and one squeeze tube.  The product was brown. Shouldn&#x27;t it be white?</li>
            <li> This product is actually working. I&#x27;m only about 2.5 weeks into using the product, but I&#x27;m STARTING to see the dark spots on my face Lighten</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do much by itself, but if used with the retinoid pads or even with roc retinoid serum it works beautifully -- and quickly. I have clusters of dark freckles and I&#x27;ve been applying the dark spot corrector just over my freckles and they are noticeably lighter after just 2 weeks of use at night. Works better than the product prescribed by my dermatologist!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to improve my skin tone. And no noticeable result on my face after I have used a whole bottle. Save your money to find a good one.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but this product needs careful use. I used this cream and broke out with huge hives. I have somewhat sensation skin, and would warn against not using it if you have this skin type. Would look for something else and save your money</li>
            <li> I have had dark spots on my cheeks/ sides of my face from past acne. This product is the ONLY ONE I have used that has actually improved my skin. I&#x27;ve tried BB creams, Clean and Clear products, Neutrogena products,Palmers cocoa butter products, etc. and nothing worked. With this product, not only are the dark spots non-existent, but it the only cream that I have used that had no negative effects on my skin (i.e- dryness, create more acne, burning/ swelling, etc.). I applied it at least once a day sometimes twice on my cheeks, chin, and sides of my face. After everything that I have tried, it was such a relief to actually find something that worked. Even though the bottle is small, it lasted me a long time. I saw results within weeks of using it. Even though my skin is clear as can be now, I have still bought another bottle. It really does wonders for my skin. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to even out their skin tone.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to lighten an abrasion scar and sun damage spots on my face.  After about 3 weeks of use I haven&#x27;t seen a discernible change in either the scar or the spots.  I am willing to try one more 30 day application before I  give up on the product altogether.</li>
            <li> It has not work any better than local drug store dark spot removers that cost considerably less than this product.  I used a gift certificate to help with the cost and I think it was a waste of a great gift.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Since I am 70, I have developed age spots on my face and hands.  I am using this product to try to lighten the dark spots.  It seems to be working, though I don&#x27;t know if the spots will eventually fade completely.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work.  Save your money.  I used this product along with the miracle spot dimishing pads.  Neither product works.</li>
            <li> I got this product, Im having gooood results, I&#x27;m happy how my face is looking now, look more clear and clean. This product really works. Finally I have in my hand a product is really working for dark spots. It&#x27;s a miracle!!!!</li>
            <li> too early to tell - spots appear to be a little lighter but not much.  Probably need to try it longer</li>
            <li> I been having this product for a month and I&#x27;m still waiting for it to work. I don&#x27;t see any difference yet. I think I need to switch back to Clinique.</li>
            <li> I am a hispanic female. I needed a product after a beach vacation where my nose and forehead were significantly darker than the rest of my face. This product did the trick. I used it every night for 4 weeks. I saw results fairly quickly even on spots that had been there for some time unrelated to the recent sun damage. Note I have very oily skin and use an oil free moisturizer. This product was not oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in the 5th week my face became extremely itchy and I had to stop using the product... I never broke out in hives or never any redness... my face simply itched. After 3 weeks of not using, the itchiness went away. I have not used the product since, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> The few light sun spots that I had it did not even deminish them. I&#x27;m really not impressed with this product and will not order it again</li>
            <li> I must say I was skeptical because other dark spot treatments have been too strong or didn&#x27;t work at all. This is very gentle yet effective. I have sun spots under my eyes. They look terrible! After a month of faithfully applying...the spots are less noticeable. I will continue to use it. Great product!</li>
