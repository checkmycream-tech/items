    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Probably one of the best waxes out there.</li>
            <li>I will say again, very nice!!</li>
            <li>This wax is the best.</li>
            <li>Wonderful stuff!</li>
            <li>Best &#x27;stache wax for me.</li>
            <li>Best of all it holds up to coffee.</li>
            <li>Looks great for Movember, and helps raise prostate cancer awareness.</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>Also it smells great.</li>
            <li>Love this product, works great!</li>
            <li>Brothers is a good product and I would also purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>should also say that this product was shipped packed well and in good condition.</li>
            <li>A fair wax.  </li>
            <li>this is smooth, smells great, and holds well.  </li>
            <li>steps up in like kind.  </li>
            <li>What I liked about it is that it does not stay &amp;#34;Sticky&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Step two - Brothers Love Bartwichse Moustache Wax.</li>
            <li>Having this wax, along with a prominent amount of mustache hairs, literally and figuratively grows on you and those @ work and home.</li>
            <li>Dear hipster, we see you w/ your five o&#x27;clock shadow mustaches perfectly placed, or for the \\&quot;brave\\&quot; ones out there w/ an actual mustache.</li>
            <li>As such, I want to look my best and demand my mustache</li>
            <li>However, the smell is not my favorite, so kissing him goodbye in the morning is now just a peck on the</li>
            <li>(i don&#x27;t even remember touching it) than others</li>
            <li>I have just started to use mustache wax and didn&#x27;t have a good experience with the first wax I tried.</li>
            <li>If you have a nice, stylish mustache and have any kind of formal or social event, Brothers Love Bartwichse Moustache Wax will ensure you&#x27;re presented in your best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K</li>
            <li>This wax on the other hand was excellent.</li>
            <li>The hold is strong once it sets</li>
            <li>Did not like the STRONG SCENT..........</li>
            <li>STRONG SCENT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a gel than a wax to be honest, but the hold is great for a small to medium sized moustache.</li>
            <li>It sets much faster than traditional moustache waxes and is easier to apply, however i doubt it&#x27;s as good for your whiskers as waxes with organic beeswax and good</li>
            <li>right under your nose, you will love this stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even so, it will return to its original state.  </li>
            <li>so I am now excited to try them all out.</li>
            <li>Buy a bright blue wrist band, that&#x27;s step three.</li>
            <li>Women should thank Brothers Love&#x27;s wax as much as men thank any type of waxing on women.</li>
            <li>It hardened nicely but found a little more than halfway through the day</li>
            <li>Strong, nice scent and takes a little dab.</li>
            <li>A definitely better wax than Clubman, although I still use Clubman on my &amp;#34;cheap days.&amp;#34; I use my cheap stuff on normal dye and save this wax for nicer occasions, especially church where I am in the choir.</li>
            <li>Applies clear unlike other &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; stache waxes, and is the firmest hold I have experienced.</li>
            <li>My freakishly potent array of mustache hair can finally be set into a non-discombobulated structured piece of shimmer and shine.</li>
            <li>First step is not even a step.</li>
            <li>use this product for those days when the moustache has to look top notch, where a traditional wax doesn&#x27;t quite cut it.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The tube is fragile, but with care, you can make sure you don&#x27;t tear the edges.  </li>
            <li>And it holds very well also!</li>
            <li>It begins to feel more like a light powder on the stache after a few minutes of drying.</li>
            <li>The other issue was the very strong chemical scent.</li>
            <li>Is pure glory with this wax.</li>
            <li>In applying the silky smooth pomade, the clean, crisp smell solidified those memories and I knew, this was the exact same product my father used decades earlier.  </li>
            <li>Gently pull through the ends and give wee twist at the tips.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with mustache waxes so take my review with that grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a tiny tube and for $15 it isn&#x27;t a cheap option but neither is the end result.</li>
            <li>The greys in my beard are extremely curly and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that I can apply easily and tames the curl.</li>
            <li>Better than clubman&#x27;s hands down.</li>
            <li>Provides a high level of control for an unruly &#x27;stache.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Application is very easy, spreading a small amount between your thumbs and forefingers.</li>
            <li>A bit stiffer than medium but not hard.</li>
            <li>After that it feels very natural.</li>
            <li>I love the hard hold just not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t set fast and left my considerable handlebar flopping over.</li>
            <li>Those are two very different things and this is really styling gel.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and sets up very stiff.  </li>
            <li>When I decided to move from my goatee of nearly 30 years and go to a traditional turn of the century style mustache, I knew I was going to need some thing to keep it managed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds OK, BUT seems to require so much of it that I was sneezing and miserable from the ultra strong scent!&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this, nor would I admit having any....</li>
            <li>It is more like a real thick gel than a wax</li>
    </ol>

            <li> everyday waxing, I&#x27;d go with traditional waxes.</li>
            <li> I never really knew what it was, until I saw this product listed on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m harder on my mustache</li>
            <li> A little stiff, not for a relaxed natural hold.</li>
            <li> Other waxes have a Pinaud sent this one just smells like glue.</li>
            <li> I ordered a couple other brands</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells pretty much like mosquito repellent (a lemony chemical smell)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let haters* keep you down.</li>
            <li> Pull down about 3/4&amp;#34; from the end of your mustache, then pull up as you reach the end to achieve the telltale gentleman&#x27;s curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perhaps not that bad, but i prefer more subtle smells under my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> From remembering my father with his mustache, I also remembered a very small silver tube in the medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li> Even if they hate it, at least when the lights shut off, they&#x27;ll like the tickle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mustache gets a bad rap these days.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Is pure glory with this wax. Women should thank Brothers Love&#x27;s wax as much as men thank any type of waxing on women. My freakishly potent array of mustache hair can finally be set into a non-discombobulated structured piece of shimmer and shine. The mustache gets a bad rap these days. So men, in hopes we can bring it back into prominence, Tom Selleck yourselves. First step is not even a step. Just stop shaving the area above your lips. Step two - Brothers Love Bartwichse Moustache Wax. Looks great for Movember, and helps raise prostate cancer awareness. Buy a bright blue wrist band, that&#x27;s step three. Having this wax, along with a prominent amount of mustache hairs, literally and figuratively grows on you and those @ work and home. Don&#x27;t let haters* keep you down. And despite what they say, women like a mustached man. Whether they know it or not. Even if they hate it, at least when the lights shut off, they&#x27;ll like the tickle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*using a plural word starting with an \\&quot;h\\&quot; reminded me of another type of person - hipster. Dear hipster, we see you w/ your five o&#x27;clock shadow mustaches perfectly placed, or for the \\&quot;brave\\&quot; ones out there w/ an actual mustache. We know who you are. You aren&#x27;t in the club. Growing a mustache is not a rebellious way to get back at your parents who probably spent 100&#x27;s of thousands on your education. We know you, and keep in mind, Freddie Mercury had a mustache too ... look what happened to him ... he had a multitude or prostate exams, but not by a licensed doctor nor with any attempts of checking into his well being. Quite the contrary.</li>
            <li> Not like a lot of the waxes out there. Goes on very soft and dries to a stiff hold. Holds all day in the shape it dries to. You can&#x27;t comb through it once it dries or it will release its hold. A little stiff, not for a relaxed natural hold. For a longer handlebar or a Dali style, it holds all day.</li>
            <li> The greys in my beard are extremely curly and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that I can apply easily and tames the curl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a gel than a wax to be honest, but the hold is great for a small to medium sized moustache. It sets much faster than traditional moustache waxes and is easier to apply, however i doubt it&#x27;s as good for your whiskers as waxes with organic beeswax and good oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells pretty much like mosquito repellent (a lemony chemical smell) It&#x27;s perhaps not that bad, but i prefer more subtle smells under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d use this product for those days when the moustache has to look top notch, where a traditional wax doesn&#x27;t quite cut it.&lt;br /&gt;For everyday waxing, I&#x27;d go with traditional waxes.</li>
            <li> I love the hard hold just not a fan of the smell. Other waxes have a Pinaud sent this one just smells like glue. But if you are going for the curl this is your wax!</li>
            <li> Probably one of the best waxes out there. Better than clubman&#x27;s hands down. Applies clear unlike other &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; stache waxes, and is the firmest hold I have experienced. Gel like texture and hold.</li>
            <li> When I decided to move from my goatee of nearly 30 years and go to a traditional turn of the century style mustache, I knew I was going to need some thing to keep it managed.  From remembering my father with his mustache, I also remembered a very small silver tube in the medicine cabinet.  I never really knew what it was, until I saw this product listed on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do presentations, lectures and other types of ceremonies on a regular basis.  In conducting these, I must be dressed and groomed well as I am representing the words I speak.  As such, I want to look my best and demand my mustache steps up in like kind.  I knew when I started growing my mustache I would need something that I could depend on during these engagements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the package, memories came flooding back.  In applying the silky smooth pomade, the clean, crisp smell solidified those memories and I knew, this was the exact same product my father used decades earlier.  The tube is fragile, but with care, you can make sure you don&#x27;t tear the edges.  Application is very easy, spreading a small amount between your thumbs and forefingers. Gently pull through the ends and give wee twist at the tips.  Pull down about 3/4&amp;#34; from the end of your mustache, then pull up as you reach the end to achieve the telltale gentleman&#x27;s curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the product &#x27;cures&#x27;, try not to touch as it will flake a bit and would need tending to using a tiny bit of water.  Even so, it will return to its original state.  If you have a nice, stylish mustache and have any kind of formal or social event, Brothers Love Bartwichse Moustache Wax will ensure you&#x27;re presented in your best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K</li>
            <li> Works great,.all day hold if kept dry. It is more like a real thick gel than a wax but that is why I like it</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and sets up very stiff.  Provides a high level of control for an unruly &#x27;stache.</li>
            <li> I have just started to use mustache wax and didn&#x27;t have a good experience with the first wax I tried. This wax on the other hand was excellent. What I liked about it is that it does not stay &amp;#34;Sticky&amp;#34;. It begins to feel more like a light powder on the stache after a few minutes of drying. After that it feels very natural. And it holds very well also! I ordered a couple other brands so I am now excited to try them all out. Brothers is a good product and I would also purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;I should also say that this product was shipped packed well and in good condition. It also exceeded the description from the seller. I will say again, very nice!!</li>
            <li> So I have very stiff mustache hairs, and this was the only wax I could find that would actually hold them in place. It works like essentially the worlds strongest hair gel.  Get a small amount apply and let dry and it will stay stiff for the whole day, and the next day if you sleep on your back.  The only downside is that you can&#x27;t rework it like the beeswax based waxes, but those never worked that well for me anyway.</li>
            <li> It is listed as Moustache Wax AND Styling Pomade. Those are two very different things and this is really styling gel. The hold is strong once it sets but it doesn&#x27;t set fast and left my considerable handlebar flopping over. It also can&#x27;t be reshaped once it sets. The other issue was the very strong chemical scent. Not pleasant to have that scent right under your nose all day. If one doesn&#x27;t mind the scent and has a short moustache, this would probably work out. Under no circumstances should this be referred to as wax though, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Great buy. You only need a tiny amount and it holds all day. Also it smells great. Will buy again when I run out</li>
            <li> The hold isn&#x27;t very firm, but the product goes on well and is actually clear, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> This wax is the best. This is the only wax I&#x27;ve every used to style my mustache and probably the only stuff I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this and he likes it. However, the smell is not my favorite, so kissing him goodbye in the morning is now just a peck on the cheek.&lt;br /&gt;And, the stuff wears off by the end of the day and his stache ends up looking bizarre.&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with mustache waxes so take my review with that grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gobbed it in, spread it through the stache with my stache comb and left it alone.  It hardened nicely but found a little more than halfway through the day it was non-existent.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m harder on my mustache (i don&#x27;t even remember touching it) than others but it definitely did not last for me.  I will try some of products out there but I will continue using this one for now.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff! Strong, nice scent and takes a little dab. It is a tiny tube and for $15 it isn&#x27;t a cheap option but neither is the end result. A definitely better wax than Clubman, although I still use Clubman on my &amp;#34;cheap days.&amp;#34; I use my cheap stuff on normal dye and save this wax for nicer occasions, especially church where I am in the choir.</li>
            <li> Did not like the STRONG SCENT..........&lt;br /&gt;If you like SWEEEEEEEET  STRONG SCENT right under your nose, you will love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;It holds OK, BUT seems to require so much of it that I was sneezing and miserable from the ultra strong scent!&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this, nor would I admit having any....Threw it away after one application.</li>
            <li> A fair wax.  Does not work well for shaping even though it is described for styling.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Love this product, works great!</li>
            <li> Best &#x27;stache wax for me. A bit stiffer than medium but not hard. Best of all it holds up to coffee.</li>
            <li> I have four o five different waxes (firemans, australian beeswax, etc. etc.) this is smooth, smells great, and holds well.  Highly, highly recommended.</li>
