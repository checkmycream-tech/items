            <li>A nice berry sort of color.  </li>
            <li>I can tell you that GELISH by Harmony is absolutely the best in category.  </li>
            <li>Indoors, it looks more purple/cranberry.</li>
            <li>A lot of people aren&#x27;t quite sure how to use shellac at home</li>
            <li>so be sure to visit the gelish website for instructions.</li>

            <li>I was pleased with the look.</li>
            <li>It has no shimmer and is more of a matte color.</li>
            <li>IÂ´ve tried several brands of gel nail polish and for me this is the best.</li>
            <li>Some will love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the Gelish line by Harmony, it is so easy to work with</li>
            <li>I get it done by a professional and she experienced this as well.</li>
            <li>easy for DIY at home soak off gel nail polish users</li>
            <li>I use Perfect Match with the Harmony base on top coats and it dries perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I bought this color because it is my absolute favorite -- the perfect raspberry red.  </li>
            <li>The polish went on fine but after drying under the LED as instructed it was all crinkly looking.  </li>
            <li>It is very pretty though and would work well on most skin tones.</li>
            <li>I figure that one time was what I would have paid at a salon, but I have lots more polish left to do many more times!  </li>
            <li>But ultimately did receive in great condition.</li>
            <li>I have a Thermal Spa light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s raspberry/cranberry depending on the light.</li>
            <li>but thats why i don&#x27;t buy the light colors anymore.</li>
            <li>you cure it with a light then set it with the finishing liquid.</li>
            <li>With 2 coats, it is a rich cranberry color.</li>
            <li>This is a true burgundy.</li>
            <li>It really looks like the picture and is more of a matte finish.</li>
            <li>it is a raspberry color kind of two toned depending on the lighting looks pinkish in the sun light and red in darker lighting.  </li>
            <li>It is very pretty but not the darker color I was looking for, for the winter months.</li>
            <li>This color is cute but it&#x27;s more pink than it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li>Not to red and not to purple just a nice balance.</li>
            <li>It is very similar to Rose Garden.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorites, but honestly, I&#x27;ve amassed quite a variety of Gelish colors now, and I haven&#x27;t found any that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>color is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I love this color, is the same as the image, so I was really surprise, usually it is different, but the color, was really nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wait until the polish starts curling off before you start nudging it off entirely.  </li>
            <li>This is a lush, dark fuchsia color that looks great on all complexions.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Once I painted two at a time, with some minor touchups at the very end of painting all ten, it looked great.  </li>
            <li>It is great for winter because it&#x27;s not bright, and not too purple.  </li>
            <li>Easy to work with after the second application.</li>
            <li>The product is above expectations, but receiving the products was a little more challenging.</li>
            <li>I really like that.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this color.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this color.  </li>
            <li>I really like this color.</li>
            <li>like a light red wine with 2-3 coats.  </li>
            <li>Application is easy and the results are long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I use the Nail prep Ph bond,base coat, first coat of polish, second (seal the nails) third coat and top coat..3 min cure time between each step .</li>
            <li>our computer monitors vary so much in their&lt;br /&gt;ability to properly show true colors.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>It is more like a dark raspberry color.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but now after 2 weeks, it still looks like the day I did my nails in the comfort of my own home!  </li>
            <li>If you like big, bold color, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>It also is removed easily, with 100% acetone Gel Polish Remover -- just be careful when scraping off the old polish.  </li>
            <li>When my favorite salon closed and my new salon didn&#x27;t carry this color, I simply bought it on Amazon and bring it with me to the salon!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff but selecting colors is difficult because they&#x27;re not always true to what is displayed on the bottle (or on computer monitors).  </li>
            <li>This color is a nice dark pink color.</li>
            <li>It is a nice choice for those who shy away from the bold look of red and the too soft look of soft pinks.</li>
            <li>would describe this color as deep plum - its very flattering</li>
            <li>I like Gelish products in general.</li>
            <li>Was disappointed as this color was beautiful.</li>
            <li>Dark but still very feminine.</li>

            <li> Dark but still very feminine.</li>
            <li> The picture make it look pretty dark but its not as dark as it looks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do be aware that the colors are hard to anticipate</li>
            <li> Not too red, not too pink.  </li>
            <li> Neither too pink nor too red.</li>
            <li> One thing I did notice, as with some other Gelish colors, is that it &amp;#34;runs&amp;#34; so I can only do about two nails at a time.  </li>
            <li> for people whom think this doesn&#x27;t dry; it is not supposed to!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting Gel manicures for a a few years and have tried several brands of gel polish.  </li>
            <li> Polish was not as dark as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> Too dark and purple for me.  </li>
            <li> First I take off the old polish  as I said I  have trouble getting the base coat off)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
            <li> the color is not true to photo</li>
            <li> The picture is not completely accurate as it is a little bit lighter than shown.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this was just my bottle.</li>
            <li> If I do all four or five nails, the first two look horrible due to the color migrating away from the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> A lot of negative reviews I have read are acutally the fault of the consumer.</li>
            <li> Gellish  is a bit expensive</li>
            <li> but I tried it twice using the other Harmony products and it was horrible.  </li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Harmony Gelish Gel Polish!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> With 2 coats, it is a rich cranberry color. Indoors, it looks more purple/cranberry. It&#x27;s a pretty color. Looks good on toenails too.</li>
            <li> The product is above expectations, but receiving the products was a little more challenging. But ultimately did receive in great condition.</li>
            <li> This color is great! Under different lights it looks totally different. I really like that. There is no sparkle to it. A lot of people aren&#x27;t quite sure how to use shellac at home so be sure to visit the gelish website for instructions. A lot of negative reviews I have read are acutally the fault of the consumer. Shellac is not like regular nail polish at all! My nail salon uses this same brand and I love it, but I decided I could do my own manicures for a lot cheaper if I purchased the supplies. After 2 uses, the supplies have paid for themselves.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and applied it last night. I recently got into the gel nail polish obsession which was started with my Red Carpet Manicure kit I bought from ulta. I wanted more and saw Gelish stuff and figured i would give it a go.  the color is not at all like the color on the computer. It is more like a dark raspberry color. It is very pretty but not the darker color I was looking for, for the winter months. I have tan skin tone and it looks great.</li>
            <li> Could anyone help me!! What am I doing wrong???I have had wonderful luck and pleased IF I could get the tips from chipping. I have bought BOTH the Shellac and Gelish systems although I never mix them. I have a Thermal Spa light. First I take off the old polish  as I said I  have trouble getting the base coat off), I then soak my nails,clip,file etc. I use the Nail prep Ph bond,base coat, first coat of polish, second (seal the nails) third coat and top coat..3 min cure time between each step . Thanks</li>
            <li> Application is easy and the results are long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy for DIY at home soak off gel nail polish users&lt;br /&gt;as it self levels so it never comes out with polish lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would describe this color as deep plum - its very flattering&lt;br /&gt;to most skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do be aware that the colors are hard to anticipate&lt;br /&gt;because our computer monitors vary so much in their&lt;br /&gt;ability to properly show true colors.&lt;br /&gt;Best to do some google searches and find one of the many&lt;br /&gt;images posted to see it applied on others to help decide&lt;br /&gt;which color you want.</li>
            <li> It works.  I was skeptical at first, but now after 2 weeks, it still looks like the day I did my nails in the comfort of my own home!  I figure that one time was what I would have paid at a salon, but I have lots more polish left to do many more times!  I love it.</li>
            <li> love the Gelish product.  Lasts for weeks if applied properly and if taken  care of can last 2 weeks or longer</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend and she loved it. This color is cute but it&#x27;s more pink than it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> This color is a cranberry red, the color I hoped it would be.  It looks beautifil on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Polish was not as dark as I thought it would be.  The picture make it look pretty dark but its not as dark as it looks</li>
            <li> The color is actually quite close to that pictured on the computer. Not to red and not to purple just a nice balance. I love the Gelish line by Harmony, it is so easy to work with and my nails always look amazing. I cannot tell you how many compliments I get!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was just my bottle. The polish went on fine but after drying under the LED as instructed it was all crinkly looking.  I loved the color, it was just what I wanted but I tried it twice using the other Harmony products and it was horrible.  I use Perfect Match with the Harmony base on top coats and it dries perfectly.  Was disappointed as this color was beautiful.</li>
            <li> I really like this color. It&#x27;s raspberry/cranberry depending on the light. Easy to work with after the second application. Dark but still very feminine.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Harmony Gelish Gel Polish!  Goes on nicely with two coats and stays until you decide to change the color.</li>
            <li> This is a really great color.  A nice berry sort of color.  I&#x27;m very fair skinned, and it compliments me nicely.  One thing I did notice, as with some other Gelish colors, is that it &amp;#34;runs&amp;#34; so I can only do about two nails at a time.  If I do all four or five nails, the first two look horrible due to the color migrating away from the cuticle.  Once I painted two at a time, with some minor touchups at the very end of painting all ten, it looked great.  I had no problems with the wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting Gel manicures for a a few years and have tried several brands of gel polish.  I can tell you that GELISH by Harmony is absolutely the best in category.  The polish lasts for 3 weeks without chips or cracks, staying mirror-shiny for the duration.  It also is removed easily, with 100% acetone Gel Polish Remover -- just be careful when scraping off the old polish.  Make sure you wait until the polish starts curling off before you start nudging it off entirely.  I bought this color because it is my absolute favorite -- the perfect raspberry red.  Not too red, not too pink.  I literally get compliments *every* time I wear it.  When my favorite salon closed and my new salon didn&#x27;t carry this color, I simply bought it on Amazon and bring it with me to the salon!  Best. Color. Ever. !!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but selecting colors is difficult because they&#x27;re not always true to what is displayed on the bottle (or on computer monitors).  This is a lush, dark fuchsia color that looks great on all complexions.  I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on it since I applied and I&#x27;m glad I made this selection.  If you like big, bold color, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this color.  It is great for winter because it&#x27;s not bright, and not too purple.  The picture is not completely accurate as it is a little bit lighter than shown.  However, it was great quality and worked great!  A perfect fall/winter color.</li>
            <li> This is a great color.  I get a lot of compliments on this color.</li>
            <li> I like this color.  It is opaque &amp; covers well.  It is a brighter raspberry color than the picture shows.  It is very similar to Rose Garden.</li>
            <li> Wears great, 2 coats was all neded,. This is a true burgundy. Perfect color for Fall &amp; Winter. Gellish  is a bit expensive so I have ordered IBD gel nail clor, it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color! Definitely one of my favorites, but honestly, I&#x27;ve amassed quite a variety of Gelish colors now, and I haven&#x27;t found any that I don&#x27;t like. Great product!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been doing gelish nails for my friends and myself for over a year. works great as ALWAYS the color is not true to photo but thats why i don&#x27;t buy the light colors anymore. for people whom think this doesn&#x27;t dry; it is not supposed to! you cure it with a light then set it with the finishing liquid. i put mine in a spray bottle it works best for me :)</li>
            <li> I really like this color. It really looks like the picture and is more of a matte finish. I was pleased with the look.</li>
            <li> I applied two coats and it lasted well, but I think 3 coats will actually get me the color as shown.</li>
            <li> What is this it takes for ever to dray&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never seen any thing like this before</li>
            <li> This color is a nice dark pink color. It has no shimmer and is more of a matte color. It is very pretty though and would work well on most skin tones. It is a nice choice for those who shy away from the bold look of red and the too soft look of soft pinks.</li>
            <li> I love this color, is the same as the image, so I was really surprise, usually it is different, but the color, was really nice. I used it a lot</li>
            <li> IÂ´ve tried several brands of gel nail polish and for me this is the best. I do my nails myself at home and the polish lasts up to 10 days hands and feet almost a month.&lt;br /&gt;This color is my favorite so far. Neither too pink nor too red.</li>
            <li> Too dark and purple for me.  Some will love it.  I just don&#x27;t happen to care for the color.  Gelish polish is a good product, though.</li>
            <li> I loved loved loved this color it is a raspberry color kind of two toned depending on the lighting looks pinkish in the sun light and red in darker lighting.  I have gotten a tone of complements with this color.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; color....like a light red wine with 2-3 coats.  I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> I like Gelish products in general. This is the thinnest of all of the colors I have ordered (8-10). It pulls away from the end a bit. I get it done by a professional and she experienced this as well. Still like the product and color (a deep raspberry) it just takes some extra work.</li>
