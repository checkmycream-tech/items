    <ol>
            <li>and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>Best translucent powder I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I am very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>Not the best value.  </li>
            <li>She said this mineral veil is the best she ever came across.</li>
            <li>The product itself is awesome!</li>
            <li>The color is perfect, it blends it perfectly with my skin color.</li>
            <li>Mineral Veil is the best finishing powder I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>My wife loves this makeup, she&#x27;s happy with it, which means she&#x27;s happy with me!  </li>
            <li>Always a great product line.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome &amp; smooths out your imperfections. :)</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I use this as a powder seems good.</li>
            <li>If you just want to try it this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>Good product, though.</li>
            <li>Good as always have used for years</li>
            <li>love it great product  </li>
            <li>Love this, it&#x27;s a great sample or travel size</li>
            <li>: love my 2-day Prime shipping!  </li>
            <li>I loved the price and thrilled to be able to order from Amazon and not go to the brick and mortar.</li>
            <li>Nice Powder.</li>
            <li>However, I no longer use the eyeshadows because they&#x27;re all shimmery now, wonderful colors, but far to glittery for me.  </li>
            <li>It covers very good and makes my skin very natural looking.</li>
            <li>My favorite Bare Minerals product, the perfect blend and brightener to seal in your look!</li>
            <li>Lovely highlighting.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, don&#x27;t forget this is the smaller sized version.</li>
            <li>They love it too.</li>
            <li>I love the mineral veil.</li>
            <li>I use it on top of liquid foundation and mineral foundation to set the makeup and keep the shine away.</li>
            <li>I should have been paying more attention.</li>
            <li>A must buy and especially at such a great price!</li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I should have read the section better.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I am totally buying again! :D</li>
            <li>Love, love, love I can&#x27;t say any more.</li>
            <li>Love this makeup.  </li>
            <li>Love all there products</li>
            <li>I Absolutely Love This Product.</li>
            <li>a wonderful surprise to find something that goes on quickly, easily and washes off with simple soap and water.</li>
            <li>I wish these huge cosmetic conglomerates would quit messing with winning formulas.  </li>
            <li>This product seems to be good quality,and would receive 5 stars from me, but to be perfectly honest; when I received it, there was barely any in there.</li>
            <li>product does not come out of container very well, otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li>However powder can fall out easily.</li>
            <li>Great product, my wife loves Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>I still love several BM products, including the new Bare Skin foundation and the wonderful beautifully pigmented blushes (I have quite a collection of them).  </li>
            <li>Good coverage liked the powder did not care for the foundation at all too dry formy face and way too light.</li>
            <li>You dont need very much to get that soft pretty flawless result.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a bit light..</li>
            <li>Forever&#x27;s HD powder, which is also talc free and untinted.  </li>
            <li>But if you know what you have and you like it, this was worth it for me to get here on Amazon for sure.  </li>
            <li>I recommend you go into the store and buy one which will securely lock</li>
            <li>really like it, for many years.  </li>
            <li>Considering it&#x27;s half the size of one that costs $5 more, this isn&#x27;t actually a good deal at all.</li>
            <li>I am rather miffed that Mineral Veil has a noticeable pink tint because it was the perfect product for my talc sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels super lightweight on my skin, and it  absorbs all the oils in my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice finisher to my every day makeup, even if I don&#x27;t wear bare minerals foundation.</li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive skin and absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the natural look and have recommended it to all of my family and friends.  </li>
            <li>So Light &amp; Sheer, Not Like A Heavy Powder, Gives A Flawless Look To Your Complexion.</li>
            <li>Love Bare Minerals, the mineral veil is a must!</li>
            <li>I have used Bare Escentuals for many years and like Veil for covering up of blemishes.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased the kit I thought it was a modest enough investment to determine if it would be a good choice for my situation.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s working out fine.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage, good color matching, a little thick though.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 3 stars, because while I LOVE bareminerals, this product is misleading.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years--ever since it first came out in those sample size kits.</li>
            <li>I am very with this product!</li>
            <li>This only has the holes in the top</li>
            <li>Good product - price a little high</li>
            <li>In any case, they&#x27;ve certainly lost some of my business.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m almost certain it matters not.</li>
            <li>I guess Bare Minerals has been bought out and the woman who developed it has been made a very rich gal.  </li>
            <li>I apply Bare Escentuals BareMinerals Original Mineral Veil on occasion when my nose or chin begins to shine, without it looking caked as most other brands of face powder do.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it is that slightly pink hue that brings a more flattering glow to the skin without looking like something pasted on.</li>
            <li>The whole container is not but a 1/4 inch tall.</li>
            <li>I will be more careful going forward.  </li>
            <li>As a person with sensitive skin, finding anything that doesn&#x27;t cause some kind of irritation or breakout whether it be cosmetics, lotions or soaps has been a lifelong challenge.</li>
            <li>From the outside it looks as if I had a full container</li>
            <li>I love the product, but was super surprised at just how small it was.</li>
            <li>Seems priced too high for the amount received.</li>
            <li>This came with my starter kit I bought 4 years ago when I first started using Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth getting it on Amazon as I saved $20 from my total listing price.  </li>
            <li>Maybe because in storage it got dried out, but when I buy it at the store its more &#x27;creamier&#x27; on my skin.</li>
            <li>Mineral veil has always been a favorite of mine used in conjunction with the other Bare Minerals products,it achieves the look I want.</li>
            <li>Make sure to tightly close!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little lighter than I remembered but, because it&#x27;s so sheer, it blends nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be more careful in the future.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this!</li>
            <li>Product is OK, but small size.  </li>
            <li>Once you open it for the first time you can&#x27;t replace the sticky piece and the product flies all over the place.</li>
            <li>It was then that I discovered that the packaging is an illusion to make it appear as if the bottom of the container is full even when it is completely empty.  </li>
            <li>The price of this item is close enough to the full size that I didn&#x27;t notice that it was only 2g compared to 9g.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure it looks as good as my other concealer and powder.</li>
            <li>It is much smaller than the size I normally purchase in the store.  </li>
            <li>Will go buy regular size at store for only a few more dollars.</li>
            <li>On a final note, if your skin tends to be dry, a bit of light moisturizer to start may be helpful in the application as it is a loose powder.</li>
            <li>This seemed different than the  mineral veil I got via Macy&#x27;s, much more of a talc texture, felt a little rough on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long-time Bare Minerals user.</li>
            <li>Once you open it for the first Tim you will repeatedly waste loads of the product due to the lack of ability to fully close it after the first opening.</li>
            <li>I was never able to use the original BM powder foundation because there was no suitable color, but I have remained a loyal customer for other items for nearly 20 years.  </li>
            <li>It is an age neutral product--in other words women young and mature</li>
            <li>Same price as sephoria&#x27;s normal size bare minerals, and is half the size</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was never able to use the original BM powder foundation because there was no suitable color, but I have remained a loyal customer for other items for nearly 20 years.  </li>
            <li> It is an age neutral product--in other words women young and mature</li>
            <li> Same price as sephoria&#x27;s normal size bare minerals, and is half the size</li>
            <li> This mineral powder does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> The product was smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> can use this without looking overly &#x27;made up&#x27; if that is the goal.&lt;br /&gt;There have since been other manufacturers that have taken up the trend if you will, of mineral cosmetics, but this line, especially the mineral veil still stands out.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a translucent powder, but apparently, they&#x27;ve changed it and now it has a slight pink tinge.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I will by over my old not mineral</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and none cover as well or stay as long as BareMinerals.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very hard to gauge how much to tap into the cap.  </li>
            <li> Works well, just as expected.</li>
            <li> Severe scars or other marks may be beyond the scope of the product.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but was disappointed when i rec&#x27;d it, it did not have the &amp;#34;dial&amp;#34; that controls the amount of product that goes into the cap.  </li>
            <li> Lately, it is the only thing that I use as makeup.  </li>
            <li> It covers well presuming you have an average skin condition.</li>
            <li> and it is difficult to control how much you pour into the cap.</li>
            <li> I just want to keep the shine down on my face</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just use the mineral veil by itself to cut down on any oil sheen when I don&#x27;t want to put on all of my makeup.</li>

            <li> Too white and dusty. Not at all what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be good quality,and would receive 5 stars from me, but to be perfectly honest; when I received it, there was barely any in there. I&#x27;m disappointed because I feel I didn&#x27;t receive what I paid for. So consider this when ordering...</li>
            <li> Fits Wife&#x27;s need, she likes that.</li>
            <li> Tiny jar. This is the size you get in the starter kit, not the size you&#x27;d get if you bought an individual Mineral Veil. Considering it&#x27;s half the size of one that costs $5 more, this isn&#x27;t actually a good deal at all.</li>
            <li> product does not come out of container very well, otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years....would not use anything else.</li>
            <li> Same as I buy at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Lately, it is the only thing that I use as makeup.  I just want to keep the shine down on my face and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Best translucent powder I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever been this disappointed with any item I have ever purchased,  EVER!  I  don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up what I purchase typically lasts for quite awhile.  I opened the package of mineral veil two weeks ago and when I went to use it this morning,  I found out that it was all gone.  From the outside it looks as if I had a full container yet nothing was coming out.  It was then that I discovered that the packaging is an illusion to make it appear as if the bottom of the container is full even when it is completely empty.  Do not waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be VEIL and ended up being foundation! Very disappointed.  Will not order again! Sephora store here I come!</li>
            <li> Same price as sephoria&#x27;s normal size bare minerals, and is half the size</li>
            <li> Would have gave 5 stars but it&#x27;s a bit light..</li>
            <li> Lovely highlighting. Nice finisher to my every day makeup, even if I don&#x27;t wear bare minerals foundation.</li>
            <li> love it great product  I will use forever</li>
            <li> I used to use this all the time and I did really like it, for many years.  However, the last time I went to purchase it, I was surprised at how pink it looked in the package.  I thought this was a translucent powder, but apparently, they&#x27;ve changed it and now it has a slight pink tinge.  So I decided to pass.  I hate when companies change tried and true formulas.  I guess Bare Minerals has been bought out and the woman who developed it has been made a very rich gal.  I still love several BM products, including the new Bare Skin foundation and the wonderful beautifully pigmented blushes (I have quite a collection of them).  However, I no longer use the eyeshadows because they&#x27;re all shimmery now, wonderful colors, but far to glittery for me.  I was never able to use the original BM powder foundation because there was no suitable color, but I have remained a loyal customer for other items for nearly 20 years.  I am rather miffed that Mineral Veil has a noticeable pink tint because it was the perfect product for my talc sensitive skin.  Oh well, I now use Make Up Forever&#x27;s HD powder, which is also talc free and untinted.  So far, it&#x27;s working out fine.  So I&#x27;ve said my rather sad goodbyes to Mineral Veil but will continue to check in at the BM counter to see whether they&#x27;ve come up with a truly translucent version like the old one.  I wish these huge cosmetic conglomerates would quit messing with winning formulas.  It seems that they want change for change sake and not because they&#x27;ve improved the product.  In any case, they&#x27;ve certainly lost some of my business.  And I&#x27;m almost certain it matters not.</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size when I purchased it.  I thought it would be the regular size mineral veil but it was the smaller size.  Otherwise, I am very happy with the product.  I&#x27;m a long-time Bare Minerals user.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, don&#x27;t forget this is the smaller sized version. I use it over foundation and it helps to take away the shine.</li>
            <li> Good coverage liked the powder did not care for the foundation at all too dry formy face and way too light.</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin and absolutely love this product. I always use it after applying my foundation and blusher to set the foundation and give me a softer look. I apply Bare Escentuals BareMinerals Original Mineral Veil on occasion when my nose or chin begins to shine, without it looking caked as most other brands of face powder do.  I love the natural look and have recommended it to all of my family and friends.  They love it too.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 3 stars, because while I LOVE bareminerals, this product is misleading.  It is much smaller than the size I normally purchase in the store.  I will confess that I didn&#x27;t read the description, but it never occurred to me that it even came in different sizes.  Not the best value.  I&#x27;ll be more careful in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product, my wife loves Bare Escentuals. She said this mineral veil is the best she ever came across. She will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Seems to match well with what I buy in the store. Would buy again, would prefer the illuminating veil. Good product.</li>
            <li> This came with my starter kit I bought 4 years ago when I first started using Bare Minerals.  I use this as my last step as shown in the  helpful dvd that also came with kit.  This mineral powder does go a long way.  You dont need very much to get that soft pretty flawless result.</li>
            <li> I love the mineral veil. I use it on top of liquid foundation and mineral foundation to set the makeup and keep the shine away.</li>
            <li> Product is OK, but small size.  I should have been paying more attention. The price is not good for the size provided.&lt;br /&gt;I will be using for travel, since the size is convenient for that, but otherwise not a good deal.</li>
            <li> Love this, it&#x27;s a great sample or travel size</li>
            <li> I use this as a powder seems good. Not sure I will by over my old not mineral makeup.this is the second time I&#x27;ve tried mineral make up and I&#x27;m not sure it looks as good as my other concealer and powder.</li>
            <li> My favorite Bare Minerals product, the perfect blend and brightener to seal in your look! A must buy and especially at such a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before when I purchased it on BareEscentuals.  It&#x27;s definitely worth getting it on Amazon as I saved $20 from my total listing price.  It also helps when there is no nearby Sephora and I didn&#x27;t have a car to get to one: love my 2-day Prime shipping!  I would say that unless you know your shade and if you have used it before, I can&#x27;t say it will work for everyone.  With all beauty products, it differs for each individual.  But if you know what you have and you like it, this was worth it for me to get here on Amazon for sure.  Would totally buy again and hope the quality doesn&#x27;t change!</li>
            <li> love this product.  helps reduce oily skin from showing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years--ever since it first came out in those sample size kits. As a person with sensitive skin, finding anything that doesn&#x27;t cause some kind of irritation or breakout whether it be cosmetics, lotions or soaps has been a lifelong challenge. When I first purchased the kit I thought it was a modest enough investment to determine if it would be a good choice for my situation.&lt;br /&gt;What a wonderful surprise to find something that goes on quickly, easily and washes off with simple soap and water. It does cover well using a small amount of product and the brushes blend it all in without all those telltale lines. You don&#x27;t have to constantly fuss over it or freshen it like some of the others. It covers well presuming you have an average skin condition. Severe scars or other marks may be beyond the scope of the product. It evens out skin tones and the mineral veil finishes it all off. It is an age neutral product--in other words women young and mature can use this without looking overly &#x27;made up&#x27; if that is the goal.&lt;br /&gt;There have since been other manufacturers that have taken up the trend if you will, of mineral cosmetics, but this line, especially the mineral veil still stands out. Perhaps it is that slightly pink hue that brings a more flattering glow to the skin without looking like something pasted on. On a final note, if your skin tends to be dry, a bit of light moisturizer to start may be helpful in the application as it is a loose powder. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Item was what I expected but delivered days late.</li>
            <li> This is very small for the money. Will go buy regular size at store for only a few more dollars. If you just want to try it this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome &amp; smooths out your imperfections. :)</li>
            <li> I wish this was labeled as a travel or trial size. When you are purchasing an item online, it is hard to tell the scale of the item. The price of this item is close enough to the full size that I didn&#x27;t notice that it was only 2g compared to 9g. I would not purchase this size again.</li>
            <li> The product was as intended and is working well for me.  I loved the price and thrilled to be able to order from Amazon and not go to the brick and mortar.</li>
            <li> This seemed different than the  mineral veil I got via Macy&#x27;s, much more of a talc texture, felt a little rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> The product itself is awesome! The packaging, however, is not. Once you open it for the first Tim you will repeatedly waste loads of the product due to the lack of ability to fully close it after the first opening. The one I got had a sticky piece over the holes. Once you open it for the first time you can&#x27;t replace the sticky piece and the product flies all over the place. So every time you twist the cap off you will find the product blows around and it is difficult to control how much you pour into the cap. I recommend you go into the store and buy one which will securely lock shut</li>
            <li> I love the product, but was super surprised at just how small it was. The whole container is not but a 1/4 inch tall. Keep that in mind!!</li>
            <li> Gift.  My sister loves it.  She says it lasts four to six months.</li>
            <li> Works well, just as expected. However powder can fall out easily. Make sure to tightly close!</li>
            <li> Always a great product line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little lighter than I remembered but, because it&#x27;s so sheer, it blends nicely. However, the size of the container (and therefore the amount in it) is much smaller than what I buy at the store. Seems priced too high for the amount received. Good product, though.</li>
            <li> Container seemed very low not enough powder</li>
            <li> I should have read the section better.  The product was smaller than I expected.  I will be more careful going forward.  The product was exacting what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have very red skin on my skin. It covers very good and makes my skin very natural looking. I am very with this product!</li>
            <li> I have used Bare Escentuals for many years and like Veil for covering up of blemishes.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. The color is perfect, it blends it perfectly with my skin color. It feels super lightweight on my skin, and it  absorbs all the oils in my skin. I am totally buying again! :D</li>
            <li> Love, love, love I can&#x27;t say any more.</li>
            <li> Love Bare Minerals, the mineral veil is a must!</li>
            <li> Nice Powder. Not the 1st time I used and not the last.</li>
            <li> Mineral Veil is the best finishing powder I have ever used!  It smooths out all of the color variations on my face after putting on the bareMinerals foundation and concealing powder.  Sometimes I just use the mineral veil by itself to cut down on any oil sheen when I don&#x27;t want to put on all of my makeup.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup.  I have tried other brands and none cover as well or stay as long as BareMinerals.  Even stays on in heat.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, good color matching, a little thick though. I thought it might be my powder brush so I tried 3 different ones... Still kinda cakey. Maybe I&#x27;ll try a 4th.</li>
            <li> Would prefer to buy at the store, doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same quality. Maybe because in storage it got dried out, but when I buy it at the store its more &#x27;creamier&#x27; on my skin. This just feels powdery and makes my face feel chalky.</li>
            <li> Love all there products</li>
            <li> Good as always have used for years</li>
            <li> Mineral veil has always been a favorite of mine used in conjunction with the other Bare Minerals products,it achieves the look I want.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but was disappointed when i rec&#x27;d it, it did not have the &amp;#34;dial&amp;#34; that controls the amount of product that goes into the cap.  This only has the holes in the top and it&#x27;s very hard to gauge how much to tap into the cap.  Once it&#x27;s in the cap, you can&#x27;t the powder back in the jar.  Otherwise, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely Love This Product. So Light &amp; Sheer, Not Like A Heavy Powder, Gives A Flawless Look To Your Complexion.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this makeup, she&#x27;s happy with it, which means she&#x27;s happy with me!  5 stars!</li>
            <li> Good product - price a little high</li>
            <li> Use this product for quite a while now</li>
