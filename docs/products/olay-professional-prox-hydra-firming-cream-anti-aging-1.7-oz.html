            <li>my skin loved it!</li>
            <li>Tried others and just not as good as this - and is not stinky!</li>
            <li>My skin is on the mend, and looks great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great Product.  </li>
            <li>Great cream.</li>
            <li>It is a great product for the price.  </li>
            <li>This is great for people, that have wrinkles under your eyes.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>Great skin care product.  </li>
            <li>and it smells great, quality product</li>
            <li>and have to say no additional water/lotion before the cream is a great help.</li>
            <li>Although I was quite happy with the Clarins results, I did switch for a couple of years to Arbonne&#x27;s anti-aging line because a friend had begun selling the product.</li>
            <li>I then tried the serum, the eye cream, and the wrinkle smoothing cream...and was happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>but the hydration is great for day and night use.  </li>
            <li>Also worked great under makeup.</li>
            <li>Great  products,</li>
            <li>The recipients are happy with these cream.</li>
            <li>Shipping and packaging was great.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for using before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>Did I say amazing!?  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed and pleased.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly suprised.</li>
            <li>Outstanding products, very good service from seller.</li>
            <li>Good way to get my face cream at a discount is to use Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save.  </li>
            <li>GOOD SERVICE</li>
            <li>good price for this cream</li>
            <li>I knew I needed a good firming lotion, and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li>There was a good 70-75% improvement.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it felt so good, that I went to bed without applying aquaphor.  </li>
            <li>but it feels good going on and never leaves a greasy or shiny look</li>
            <li>Good product I recommend it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it that good.  </li>
            <li>You could get just as good of results by putting water on your face.</li>
            <li>Good product, works well and came packaged well and on time.</li>
            <li>Olay is a good brand &amp; affordable.</li>
            <li>Makes you fell good about your looks.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I got a really good price.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and feels so good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but a bit overpriced I believe.  </li>
            <li>It was a good purchase for that, as I found this cream to be non-irritating--and even soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels so good to &amp;#34;smooth</li>
            <li>and i can tell its moisturizing because any dryness is gone for good.</li>
            <li>Good stuff if used in combination with a Retinol anti-wrinkle cream or filler.</li>
            <li>Have purchased at a lower price befor, But still a good price.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>It feels good going on</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and feels good.  </li>
            <li>seems to work well, just started using it, best thing is that it is a nice, light moisturizer, very comfortable to use</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cream!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The Hydra Firming cream was the first Pro-X product that I tried, and I was quite impressed.  </li>
            <li>I love me some OLAY!  </li>
            <li>This works better for me!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see amazing results with Olay</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but I especially liked the price I paid for this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice feel to the skin.</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night after my own firming serum and before applying mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>I really liked this cream.</li>
            <li>I liked the price.</li>
            <li>Nicely done, Olay.</li>
            <li>Honestly it feels like I just rubbed KY on my face.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nicely with a gel-like feel without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this firming, moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>As night creams go, you wont break out and it has a nice dense feel.</li>
            <li>greasy goes on very nice and smooth</li>
            <li>Great vendor - fast and good packing - but</li>
            <li>Does a good job of reducing fine lines and moisturizing the face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I also use a very good glycolic acid exfolient, so don&#x27;t feel I need this product as much.</li>
            <li>I am a &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; but have received many compliments on my nice complexion.  </li>
            <li>But this is the best for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many creams, Olay Prox firming cream is so far the best for my skin</li>
            <li>of a cream is WAY too good to be true at this price.</li>
            <li>skin looks very smooth</li>
            <li>Very smooth application.  </li>
            <li>so light cream!  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it at night and its just ok.</li>
            <li>I really love this cream and have been using it for a while.  </li>
            <li>Not just for women : )</li>
            <li>I have not used aquaphor since I started using the proX kit, but my face now feels more moisturized than before.  </li>
            <li>she loves it uses it... :-)</li>
            <li>Love this Olay firming cream.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased most everything in this line and the Hydra Firming Cream  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My face is better when using these products.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks more even in color.  </li>
            <li>My skin appears more toned in terms of tightness.  </li>
            <li>I almost always see more visible lines on my face, when I try something else.  </li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing more  when I run out.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and I think I look better.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this feels on my face and how it makes my face feel and look.</li>
            <li>well maybe not disappear, but looking much better.  </li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>Better then some</li>
            <li>Okay, but don&#x27;t like the greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I love buying from amazon.  </li>
            <li>a must try for everyone I&#x27;ve tried many creams over the years</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for several years and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST facial moisturizer I have EVER USED!  </li>
            <li>I just wish there was more of it in a jar.</li>
            <li>I love the Olay brand.</li>
            <li>Its ok.... not a lot of product.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, I have tried everything from Chanel to Elizabeth Arden.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to sulfur which most lotions have.</li>
            <li>Cannot see where It is firming yet will probably take more applications,</li>
            <li>Nothing more than silicone.  </li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Olay ProX line.</li>
            <li>Plus, using the Amazon Prime&#x27;s subscribe and save I&#x27;m able to save money as well.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Better than the $200 jars.  </li>
            <li>The Prox line of OLAY is outstanding.</li>
            <li>Better off buying at Walmart.</li>
            <li>Do not know why Olay sells many things in China instead of one bottle cream.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My complexion did okay on it, but not quite as well as it did on the Clarins.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased this Olay pro x ;and i love it</li>
            <li>do love this cream .</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definably will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this before &amp; love it.</li>
            <li>But I love 95% of Oil of Olay products.</li>
            <li>I recommend this line...and if the ProX is too much, Regenerist is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>Love the texture and scent.  </li>
            <li>and I not complaining about that! : )</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and having been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>but...it did look better</li>
            <li>I love my face ,after 1 week</li>
            <li>i noticed my skin get more tide and fresh&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just discovered that Olay is one of the most notorious on the market for animal cruelty.</li>
            <li>i honestly use it as a preventative thing, but i like how light it is.</li>
            <li>I love Olay.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the Pro-X Hydra Firming cream.</li>
            <li>love this face cream, I don&#x27;t look 20 yet...</li>
            <li>I am 63 and consone of the best creams on the market.. smooth and creamy.. a rich alternative to the costly ones and does a better all-around job..</li>
            <li>I have decided to use the nighttime recovery cream instead day and night and have better results but this stuff is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>Olay is a great product and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Great price for a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Nothing amazing but not bad.</li>
            <li>Olay products are actually pretty good for the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I do put a moisturizer on top of the Hydra firming cream, and it seems to work fine in cooperation with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product for most, but not for someone with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good or better than high priced department store or specialty store products.</li>
            <li>feels very good on a skin, light, absorbed fast..........</li>
            <li>Olay Professional Pro-X Hydra Firming Cream, 1.7 Ounce is a great product for the money.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, it makes my skin feel so smooth but not oily.</li>
            <li>so it might be great for people who are sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating, super lux and great under makeup or all alone</li>
            <li>I have all of the items on subscribe and save which makes it really easy - never have to think about reordering.  </li>
            <li>Love it - makes my skin feel &amp; look great - definitely would purchase again &amp; advise others to as well</li>
            <li>It is a bit tacky until completely absorbed, but my skin looks more radiant, is much better hydrated</li>
            <li>If you wash your face and put on any cream it really won&#x27;t work effectively and will sit on the top of your skin.</li>
            <li>go easy...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it has a strong odor</li>
            <li>Very, very good,  I had an age spot spanning my right cheek that looked like a birth mark, it has completely removed it.  </li>
            <li>Best face cream for the money, hands down.</li>
            <li>, fine wrinkles are also smoothening away and not as noticeable.  </li>
            <li>This fluffs my skin and does reduce the appearance on fine lines.  </li>
            <li>SURE, IF YOU ARE WILLING TO PAY $300, THERE MAY BE A BETTER ONE OUT THERE.  </li>
            <li>One of those products that &amp;#34;improves the APPEARANCE of fine lines and wrinkles.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll continue using it to see if there are longer term benefits as they promise.  </li>
            <li>But the product does seem to soften fine lines over time.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>love it.. can see it helping the very first day I used it</li>
            <li>Amazon had the best price for this cream, which is economical and does as promised, moisturizing my dry patches without feeling greasy or clogging pores.</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference when I use this product.</li>
            <li>Light and smooth, soaks in well...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light, yet so moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on silky smooth and just makes your face and neck feel good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this every night and like its smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and has a light scent.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin hydrated and smooth all day.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Great product and especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This product is just greasy and doesn&#x27;t do anything to smooth out wrinkles at all.</li>
            <li>Use it t night and in morning skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li>As with the Eye Restoration product the Hydra Firming Cream is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes when I hope for miracles from a face-care product, I forget how important it is what the product does NOT do, i.e. cause irritation.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried cheaper brands of facial moisterizer that worked just as good or better.  </li>
            <li>You will want to use a good serum underneath for firming if that is your goal because this product will not firm your skin</li>
            <li>save your money and spend it on great hair color, cut and makeup...just as effective in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li>However, it is really good, keep skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>No strong fragrance, glides on smoothly, feels wonderful on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love that the price has dropped so much!  </li>
            <li>The advantage of the Olay regenerist line was that it beat out department store brands in performance, but at a significantly lower price.  </li>
            <li>I AM GOING WITH HEALTHY ORGANIC CREAMS, FACIAL EXERCISE, LOTS OF CLEAN WATER AND A HEALTHY CLEAN DIET :)</li>
            <li>At night I use the hydra firming cream which I absolutely love, makes my skin feel really nice when I go to bed and wake up the next morning.  </li>
            <li>He said this is silky smooth and super hydrating on his face and neck.</li>
            <li>I tried this product thinking it would be good daily moistuizer and make my skin look fabulous.</li>
            <li>This is great for dry skin also.</li>
            <li>My skin feels good, never dry, even in freezing Chicago winters.</li>
            <li>While I found this cream left my skin with a nice healthy glow, it did absorb quickly</li>
            <li>When your friends notice, you know its doing something positive!!</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with this product and use  it at night; the next morning my skin is still hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have tried Clinique&#x27;s moisture surge cream, but it was only good for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, thanks</li>
            <li>and I credit that to sticking to one good beauty line, especially this night moisturizer.</li>
            <li>fast delivery,very pleased</li>
            <li>but I really do see a difference:)</li>
            <li>The cream goes on smooth and not oily, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I hope this gets better with more usage in the future.  </li>
            <li>Too soon to see results really, I have really good skin for a 51 year old but</li>
            <li>This absorbs quickly and keeps skin moist overnight.  </li>
            <li>Received it quickly.  </li>
            <li>The price is excelent and i like this product ;i have bin useing this cream for quite a long time and it is none greasy and feels good on the skin .</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL AND GLIDES ON EASILY TO THE SKIN.  </li>
            <li>This product is easy to get and so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have been using pro x age repair lotion and really love it.  </li>
            <li>Will be sending this one back and saving for the pro x age repair lotion which is fabulous!!</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, best for keeping my 42 year old skin silky soft &amp; looking &amp; feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>Although this product leaves your face feeling very silky and smooth, I do not see any change in the appearance of my skin;</li>
            <li>This is so worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This cream is worth the price&#x27; in my opinion.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still wrinkly from smoking, drinking, laughing and having too much fun.</li>
            <li>So far, I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t keep me wrinkle free forever, but I am looking 10 years younger than I am, and that works for me!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In morning i look fresh and not i did not sleep all night</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough how surprised was when i got it and seen they paid almost $30!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>and I really haven&#x27;t see any significant firming.  </li>
            <li>A couple of times I tried switching to a much lower priced drugstore brand, but always felt that the condition of my skin significantly deteriorated.  </li>
            <li>Olay Pro-X products are excellent and much less expensive than those claiming to do be much more effective and are not.     </li>
            <li>I do believe the price is right</li>
            <li>To key to get the best results from this or any other night cream is to exfoliate first.  </li>
            <li>Pro-X is the top of the line for Olay, so my expectation for this particular product was high.</li>
            <li>I assume this will be as good as the other products, but I&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to love it, but it smells nice.</li>
            <li>plus the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I hope this can be during the day, because I like the textile very much.</li>
            <li>When the Olay Pro-X line first came out, they offered significant incentives/rebates to try out their new skincare.  </li>
            <li>Mix vaseline with a drop of water and you will notice the difference first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>About 45 minutes after my first application, I just happened to look in the mirror and couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw.</li>
            <li>and now I find I am only able to use it on my neck.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband and he absolutely LOVES this!</li>
            <li>but I definitely think it makes my skin look better.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this Hydra-Firming cream to anyone who not only wants an excellent moisturizer but one that helps firm their face and neck.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Really like this product and would continue to use it!</li>
            <li>I tried this Hydra Firming Cream for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I am planning to try the Olay Tightening Serum for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I like to apply it on my face first, and rub it out with a face sponge that come with my cleansing brush.</li>
            <li>, I know I have seend it higher elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and find it to be as efficient at doing what it claims as products much more pricey.</li>
            <li>I still use Kinerase for my eyes, but this cream makes my face feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>And my skin did not improve anymore after that first use, so I cannot recommend this product</li>
            <li>L&#x27;oreal has very similar products, and they&#x27;re safe.</li>
            <li>I have used this product several times and have been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>It is super light and actually firms...while still moisturizing!  </li>
            <li>And I wake up to a nice looking/feeling face than with the other products alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream makes my skin feel so soft and smooth, I really like it.</li>
            <li>This review is not so much a knock on the product as it is a tale that I hope will encourage anyone else looking to try this product to test it out first.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t worth animals&#x27; torture, and there are many other products, such as Avon, Burt&#x27;s Bees, and countless others, that have excellent products for even less money.</li>
            <li>And I certainly have that.</li>
            <li>this woman i knew when i was little swore by this cream, and according to everyone else, she looked amazing for her age.</li>
            <li>that my skin has mostly healed, I&#x27;m using it AFTER my rejuvenating products, which were really not providing much if any moisture.</li>
            <li>though that neither this Pro x Hydra Firming Cream or the Pro X Wrinkle Smoothing Cream were really doing anything.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel very moist.</li>
            <li>I really like how this product feels.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to increased moisture in my skin</li>
            <li>There was some very \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; reviews for this product</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference on my neck.</li>
            <li>I had been really looking for something for the bags under my eyes and since using this product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference between the products (regenerist and pro-x), but pro-x</li>
            <li>My face feels very moisturized and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t believe you need to spend a fortune on creams.</li>
            <li>I have used product for a while now and really like it.</li>
            <li>I started using this product a couple of years ago , it has made a real difference in my complexion .</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe that is because my skin isn&#x27;t aging quite as fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very &amp;#34;happy camper&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Like the cream but can&#x27;t tell much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>and yes, looks and feels much firmer.  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Received this and really like the product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for supplying these products at reasonable rates.</li>
            <li>I works really well.  </li>
            <li>Gluten free and after using this product after discovering it I have been using it for several years</li>
            <li>The container is WAY to much plastic that can&#x27;t be recycled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I felt that my skin improved more than when it was on the Clarins, but it stayed the same for a considerably lower cost.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is thick and rich, but still feels light and leaves my face feeling fresh and dew-like, not greasy.</li>
            <li>I have really seen a significant improvement wtih daily use over about three months time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting tired of writing Rave Reviews about Olay products, but the fact is they are Fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>I love the other Olay products, so I got this one as a gift to give to my mother.  </li>
            <li>Also, the product itself doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything more than any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It does not seem any better than other products I have used.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try other products just to see, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>He is 35 and wants to not look any older.</li>
            <li>Wow, this really works!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my wrinkles, but it&#x27;s still pretty early.</li>
            <li>After stirring the contents to eliminate the air pocket, the jar was only 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>I guess we really want to believe that the more expensive a product line, the better it is...</li>
            <li>I re-ordered this product because while it did noticeably help the appearance of fine lines, I mostly became addicted to how it made my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>It goes on super sheer, so no build up.</li>
            <li>I have one more jar left and will use it twice a day as directed, but it there is no improvement after the second jar, I would not recommend for the &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; population.</li>
            <li>I cannot say it is perfect, since I don&#x27;t have wrinkle, or dry skin, so i don&#x27;t see the dramatic change.</li>
            <li>until i&#x27;m much older and needing something stronger for wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li>Overall been very pleased and have not wanted to look at other skin care lines which, before finding this, I used to jump around and try new stuff every time I ran out of something.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for firming the skin; but what I like is that it makes my skin very soft after applying it.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy and makes the skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to older women -</li>
            <li>I get tons of compliments on my skin -- I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend.</li>
            <li>if you try this I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>my wife found it to be fantastic and does exactly as expected as advertised.</li>
            <li>i was very hopeful about this cream, but it didn&#x27;t work for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>FAR better than any of the more expensive creams I have purchased.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I had used this one, I normally use Regenerist, it made a huge difference in my skin within a few days.</li>
            <li>and I normally am told I look 40.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a new product that came highly recommended by Olay.  </li>
            <li>But I think a lot of people with skin on the dry side may be able to use it for day, especially if applied sparingly.</li>
            <li>Burned my skin and made it red, had to go wash it off right away.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived with packaging stating it is a new product.</li>
            <li>I highy recommend the Pro-X line over the regular Olay products and if you are a mature woman, it is worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>i have been useing this cream since it came out ;it is very expensive in the shops ;but here on Amozan  makes the price very good to buy .So</li>
            <li>The vaseline wins by a long shot, I dont know why</li>
            <li>The first night I applied the wrinkle smoothing cream, my face actually felt moisturized!  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I do have particularly sensitive skin and a hormonal problem, so it may work well for others with normal skin.</li>
            <li>When you first apply it to your face and neck, your skin INSTANTLY looks smoother...</li>
            <li>noticeable results pretty quickly on regular skin, non-oily, non-dry..</li>
            <li>This product is nice to use, a little goes a long way, and makes your skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>, I have started to notice a positive change within the last week.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this at other stores and the jar was completely full.</li>
            <li>When I opened the jar I noticed a large air pocket in the middle of the jar.</li>
            <li>It is the only moisturizer I have found that is silky and light, yet REALLY hydrates without being greasy, heavy or an adverse reaction, like breakouts.  </li>
            <li>a big savings from the regular retail price...and a HUGE savings from the big bucks that I used to spend for Clarins.</li>
            <li>That would clearly show you how Olay Pro X &amp; Regenerist products keep her looking 35 years old when she is now 59 years old.</li>
            <li>It is greasy and I would NOT recommend it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and Olay Professional Pro-X Hydra firming Cream doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one jar, so I really can&#x27;t judge.</li>
            <li>I can say my face feels ultra soft</li>
            <li>Does not remove wrinkles on this 80 year old skin however.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B001JQLNMI Olay Professional Pro-X Hydra Firming Cream, 1.7 Ounce]]  </li>
            <li>OR THE TIME THEY USE 20 YEAR OLD MODELS TO MAKE US THINK THIS WILL WORK</li>
            <li>I am 59 years old and need something with a thicker consistency.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 58 years old and nobody can tell I am.</li>
            <li>just began using this product and my skin feels silky and soft in the mornings....</li>
            <li>Like I said this stuff is soft, you can feel it work</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have used the Pro X complete line for two years</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old and have used a lot of face creams.  </li>
            <li>my philosophy is to think young and age gracefully.</li>
            <li>I am very satifsfied and will continue to purchase this product in the future</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive, don&#x27;t really know if it works (I&#x27;ve nearly finished the cream) since I&#x27;m already old and wrinkled.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this product and only the first few nights I have already seen the difference.</li>
            <li>This firming cream lasts me about 3 months or more depending on the time of year - a little goes a long way as it is really thick &amp; rich.  </li>
            <li>and I get told I look several years younger than my real age.</li>
            <li>Buyers beware, I received my lotion today and when i opened the jar it was only half full.</li>
            <li>I have strayed multiple times to try out a fancy, highly recommended moisturizer, and always find myself going back to this one.  </li>
            <li>As far as the latter, my dermatologist said that my skin barrier wasn&#x27;t working as it should.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 30year old male</li>
            <li>I alternate Renova (old lady version of Retin-A) and a glycolic serum.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely continue to use the proX kit and will not hesitate to get other proX line of products.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really need super dramatic results.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face soft and has actually smoothed away some of my smaller wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and moist all day long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other night cream&#x27;s that seem to just stay on top of your skin, are thick and don&#x27;t seem to go into your skin.</li>
            <li>As much as any of us hate to admit, how well we age is determined predominately by genetics plus exercise, good nutrition, hydration, sunscreen and regular skin care.</li>
            <li>I wish it came in large vats and costed less -- I would use it all over my body instead of just my face and neck.</li>
            <li>It also reminded me of thinned down crisco, and didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that my skin looks brighter and less wrinkly.</li>
            <li>Next morning, my face felt slightly dry, but nowhere near before.  </li>

            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> Great skin care product.  </li>
            <li> and it smells great, quality product</li>
            <li> and have to say no additional water/lotion before the cream is a great help.</li>
            <li> Although I was quite happy with the Clarins results, I did switch for a couple of years to Arbonne&#x27;s anti-aging line because a friend had begun selling the product.</li>
            <li> I then tried the serum, the eye cream, and the wrinkle smoothing cream...and was happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> but the hydration is great for day and night use.  </li>
            <li> Also worked great under makeup.</li>
            <li> Great  products,</li>
            <li> The recipients are happy with these cream.</li>
            <li> Shipping and packaging was great.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great for using before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Did I say amazing!?  </li>
            <li> I am very impressed and pleased.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly suprised.</li>
            <li> Outstanding products, very good service from seller.</li>
            <li> Good way to get my face cream at a discount is to use Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save.  </li>
            <li> GOOD SERVICE</li>
            <li> good price for this cream</li>
            <li> I knew I needed a good firming lotion, and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> There was a good 70-75% improvement.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it felt so good, that I went to bed without applying aquaphor.  </li>
            <li> but it feels good going on and never leaves a greasy or shiny look</li>
            <li> Good product I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it that good.  </li>
            <li> You could get just as good of results by putting water on your face.</li>
            <li> Good product, works well and came packaged well and on time.</li>
            <li> Olay is a good brand &amp; affordable.</li>
            <li> Makes you fell good about your looks.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I got a really good price.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and feels so good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but a bit overpriced I believe.  </li>
            <li> It was a good purchase for that, as I found this cream to be non-irritating--and even soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels so good to &amp;#34;smooth</li>
            <li> and i can tell its moisturizing because any dryness is gone for good.</li>
            <li> Good stuff if used in combination with a Retinol anti-wrinkle cream or filler.</li>
            <li> Have purchased at a lower price befor, But still a good price.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> It feels good going on</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and feels good.  </li>
            <li> seems to work well, just started using it, best thing is that it is a nice, light moisturizer, very comfortable to use</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> The Hydra Firming cream was the first Pro-X product that I tried, and I was quite impressed.  </li>
            <li> I love me some OLAY!  </li>
            <li> This works better for me!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see amazing results with Olay</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but I especially liked the price I paid for this product.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice feel to the skin.</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night after my own firming serum and before applying mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> I really liked this cream.</li>
            <li> I liked the price.</li>
            <li> Nicely done, Olay.</li>
            <li> Honestly it feels like I just rubbed KY on my face.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nicely with a gel-like feel without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this firming, moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> As night creams go, you wont break out and it has a nice dense feel.</li>
            <li> greasy goes on very nice and smooth</li>
            <li> Great vendor - fast and good packing - but</li>
            <li> Does a good job of reducing fine lines and moisturizing the face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I also use a very good glycolic acid exfolient, so don&#x27;t feel I need this product as much.</li>
            <li> I am a &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; but have received many compliments on my nice complexion.  </li>
            <li> But this is the best for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many creams, Olay Prox firming cream is so far the best for my skin</li>
            <li> of a cream is WAY too good to be true at this price.</li>
            <li> skin looks very smooth</li>
            <li> Very smooth application.  </li>
            <li> so light cream!  </li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it at night and its just ok.</li>
            <li> I really love this cream and have been using it for a while.  </li>
            <li> Not just for women : )</li>
            <li> I have not used aquaphor since I started using the proX kit, but my face now feels more moisturized than before.  </li>
            <li> she loves it uses it... :-)</li>
            <li> Love this Olay firming cream.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased most everything in this line and the Hydra Firming Cream  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> My face is better when using these products.</li>
            <li> and my skin looks more even in color.  </li>
            <li> My skin appears more toned in terms of tightness.  </li>
            <li> I almost always see more visible lines on my face, when I try something else.  </li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing more  when I run out.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> and I think I look better.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my face and how it makes my face feel and look.</li>
            <li> well maybe not disappear, but looking much better.  </li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> Better then some</li>
            <li> Okay, but don&#x27;t like the greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I love buying from amazon.  </li>
            <li> a must try for everyone I&#x27;ve tried many creams over the years</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several years and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> This is the BEST facial moisturizer I have EVER USED!  </li>
            <li> I just wish there was more of it in a jar.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay brand.</li>
            <li> Its ok.... not a lot of product.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I have tried everything from Chanel to Elizabeth Arden.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to sulfur which most lotions have.</li>
            <li> Cannot see where It is firming yet will probably take more applications,</li>
            <li> Nothing more than silicone.  </li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Olay ProX line.</li>
            <li> Plus, using the Amazon Prime&#x27;s subscribe and save I&#x27;m able to save money as well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Better than the $200 jars.  </li>
            <li> The Prox line of OLAY is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Better off buying at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Do not know why Olay sells many things in China instead of one bottle cream.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My complexion did okay on it, but not quite as well as it did on the Clarins.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased this Olay pro x ;and i love it</li>
            <li> do love this cream .</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definably will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> But I love 95% of Oil of Olay products.</li>
            <li> I recommend this line...and if the ProX is too much, Regenerist is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> Love the texture and scent.  </li>
            <li> and I not complaining about that! : )</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and having been using it for years.  </li>
            <li> but...it did look better</li>
            <li> I love my face ,after 1 week</li>
            <li> i noticed my skin get more tide and fresh&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just discovered that Olay is one of the most notorious on the market for animal cruelty.</li>
            <li> i honestly use it as a preventative thing, but i like how light it is.</li>
            <li> I love Olay.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the Pro-X Hydra Firming cream.</li>
            <li> love this face cream, I don&#x27;t look 20 yet...</li>
            <li> I am 63 and consone of the best creams on the market.. smooth and creamy.. a rich alternative to the costly ones and does a better all-around job..</li>
            <li> I have decided to use the nighttime recovery cream instead day and night and have better results but this stuff is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Olay is a great product and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Great price for a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Nothing amazing but not bad.</li>
            <li> Olay products are actually pretty good for the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I do put a moisturizer on top of the Hydra firming cream, and it seems to work fine in cooperation with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product for most, but not for someone with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good or better than high priced department store or specialty store products.</li>
            <li> feels very good on a skin, light, absorbed fast..........</li>
            <li> Olay Professional Pro-X Hydra Firming Cream, 1.7 Ounce is a great product for the money.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, it makes my skin feel so smooth but not oily.</li>
            <li> so it might be great for people who are sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating, super lux and great under makeup or all alone</li>
            <li> I have all of the items on subscribe and save which makes it really easy - never have to think about reordering.  </li>
            <li> Love it - makes my skin feel &amp; look great - definitely would purchase again &amp; advise others to as well</li>
            <li> It is a bit tacky until completely absorbed, but my skin looks more radiant, is much better hydrated</li>
            <li> If you wash your face and put on any cream it really won&#x27;t work effectively and will sit on the top of your skin.</li>
            <li> go easy...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it has a strong odor</li>
            <li> Very, very good,  I had an age spot spanning my right cheek that looked like a birth mark, it has completely removed it.  </li>
            <li> Best face cream for the money, hands down.</li>
            <li> , fine wrinkles are also smoothening away and not as noticeable.  </li>
            <li> This fluffs my skin and does reduce the appearance on fine lines.  </li>
            <li> SURE, IF YOU ARE WILLING TO PAY $300, THERE MAY BE A BETTER ONE OUT THERE.  </li>
            <li> One of those products that &amp;#34;improves the APPEARANCE of fine lines and wrinkles.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll continue using it to see if there are longer term benefits as they promise.  </li>
            <li> But the product does seem to soften fine lines over time.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> love it.. can see it helping the very first day I used it</li>
            <li> Amazon had the best price for this cream, which is economical and does as promised, moisturizing my dry patches without feeling greasy or clogging pores.</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Light and smooth, soaks in well...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light, yet so moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Goes on silky smooth and just makes your face and neck feel good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this every night and like its smooth texture.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and has a light scent.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin hydrated and smooth all day.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Great product and especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This product is just greasy and doesn&#x27;t do anything to smooth out wrinkles at all.</li>
            <li> Use it t night and in morning skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li> As with the Eye Restoration product the Hydra Firming Cream is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes when I hope for miracles from a face-care product, I forget how important it is what the product does NOT do, i.e. cause irritation.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried cheaper brands of facial moisterizer that worked just as good or better.  </li>
            <li> You will want to use a good serum underneath for firming if that is your goal because this product will not firm your skin</li>
            <li> save your money and spend it on great hair color, cut and makeup...just as effective in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> However, it is really good, keep skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> No strong fragrance, glides on smoothly, feels wonderful on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love that the price has dropped so much!  </li>
            <li> The advantage of the Olay regenerist line was that it beat out department store brands in performance, but at a significantly lower price.  </li>
            <li> I AM GOING WITH HEALTHY ORGANIC CREAMS, FACIAL EXERCISE, LOTS OF CLEAN WATER AND A HEALTHY CLEAN DIET :)</li>
            <li> At night I use the hydra firming cream which I absolutely love, makes my skin feel really nice when I go to bed and wake up the next morning.  </li>
            <li> He said this is silky smooth and super hydrating on his face and neck.</li>
            <li> I tried this product thinking it would be good daily moistuizer and make my skin look fabulous.</li>
            <li> This is great for dry skin also.</li>
            <li> My skin feels good, never dry, even in freezing Chicago winters.</li>
            <li> While I found this cream left my skin with a nice healthy glow, it did absorb quickly</li>
            <li> When your friends notice, you know its doing something positive!!</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased with this product and use  it at night; the next morning my skin is still hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Clinique&#x27;s moisture surge cream, but it was only good for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, thanks</li>
            <li> and I credit that to sticking to one good beauty line, especially this night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> fast delivery,very pleased</li>
            <li> but I really do see a difference:)</li>
            <li> The cream goes on smooth and not oily, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I hope this gets better with more usage in the future.  </li>
            <li> Too soon to see results really, I have really good skin for a 51 year old but</li>
            <li> This absorbs quickly and keeps skin moist overnight.  </li>
            <li> Received it quickly.  </li>
            <li> The price is excelent and i like this product ;i have bin useing this cream for quite a long time and it is none greasy and feels good on the skin .</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL AND GLIDES ON EASILY TO THE SKIN.  </li>
            <li> This product is easy to get and so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been using pro x age repair lotion and really love it.  </li>
            <li> Will be sending this one back and saving for the pro x age repair lotion which is fabulous!!</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, best for keeping my 42 year old skin silky soft &amp; looking &amp; feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> Although this product leaves your face feeling very silky and smooth, I do not see any change in the appearance of my skin;</li>
            <li> This is so worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This cream is worth the price&#x27; in my opinion.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still wrinkly from smoking, drinking, laughing and having too much fun.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t keep me wrinkle free forever, but I am looking 10 years younger than I am, and that works for me!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In morning i look fresh and not i did not sleep all night</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough how surprised was when i got it and seen they paid almost $30!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> and I really haven&#x27;t see any significant firming.  </li>
            <li> A couple of times I tried switching to a much lower priced drugstore brand, but always felt that the condition of my skin significantly deteriorated.  </li>
            <li> Olay Pro-X products are excellent and much less expensive than those claiming to do be much more effective and are not.     </li>
            <li> I do believe the price is right</li>
            <li> To key to get the best results from this or any other night cream is to exfoliate first.  </li>
            <li> Pro-X is the top of the line for Olay, so my expectation for this particular product was high.</li>
            <li> I assume this will be as good as the other products, but I&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to love it, but it smells nice.</li>
            <li> plus the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I hope this can be during the day, because I like the textile very much.</li>
            <li> When the Olay Pro-X line first came out, they offered significant incentives/rebates to try out their new skincare.  </li>
            <li> Mix vaseline with a drop of water and you will notice the difference first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> About 45 minutes after my first application, I just happened to look in the mirror and couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw.</li>
            <li> and now I find I am only able to use it on my neck.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he absolutely LOVES this!</li>
            <li> but I definitely think it makes my skin look better.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this Hydra-Firming cream to anyone who not only wants an excellent moisturizer but one that helps firm their face and neck.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Really like this product and would continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I tried this Hydra Firming Cream for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I am planning to try the Olay Tightening Serum for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I like to apply it on my face first, and rub it out with a face sponge that come with my cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> , I know I have seend it higher elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and find it to be as efficient at doing what it claims as products much more pricey.</li>
            <li> I still use Kinerase for my eyes, but this cream makes my face feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> And my skin did not improve anymore after that first use, so I cannot recommend this product</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal has very similar products, and they&#x27;re safe.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times and have been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> It is super light and actually firms...while still moisturizing!  </li>
            <li> And I wake up to a nice looking/feeling face than with the other products alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream makes my skin feel so soft and smooth, I really like it.</li>
            <li> This review is not so much a knock on the product as it is a tale that I hope will encourage anyone else looking to try this product to test it out first.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t worth animals&#x27; torture, and there are many other products, such as Avon, Burt&#x27;s Bees, and countless others, that have excellent products for even less money.</li>
            <li> And I certainly have that.</li>
            <li> this woman i knew when i was little swore by this cream, and according to everyone else, she looked amazing for her age.</li>
            <li> that my skin has mostly healed, I&#x27;m using it AFTER my rejuvenating products, which were really not providing much if any moisture.</li>
            <li> though that neither this Pro x Hydra Firming Cream or the Pro X Wrinkle Smoothing Cream were really doing anything.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel very moist.</li>
            <li> I really like how this product feels.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to increased moisture in my skin</li>
            <li> There was some very \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; reviews for this product</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference on my neck.</li>
            <li> I had been really looking for something for the bags under my eyes and since using this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference between the products (regenerist and pro-x), but pro-x</li>
            <li> My face feels very moisturized and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t believe you need to spend a fortune on creams.</li>
            <li> I have used product for a while now and really like it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a couple of years ago , it has made a real difference in my complexion .</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe that is because my skin isn&#x27;t aging quite as fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very &amp;#34;happy camper&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Like the cream but can&#x27;t tell much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> and yes, looks and feels much firmer.  </li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Received this and really like the product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for supplying these products at reasonable rates.</li>
            <li> I works really well.  </li>
            <li> Gluten free and after using this product after discovering it I have been using it for several years</li>
            <li> The container is WAY to much plastic that can&#x27;t be recycled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I felt that my skin improved more than when it was on the Clarins, but it stayed the same for a considerably lower cost.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is thick and rich, but still feels light and leaves my face feeling fresh and dew-like, not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have really seen a significant improvement wtih daily use over about three months time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting tired of writing Rave Reviews about Olay products, but the fact is they are Fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> I love the other Olay products, so I got this one as a gift to give to my mother.  </li>
            <li> Also, the product itself doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything more than any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It does not seem any better than other products I have used.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try other products just to see, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> He is 35 and wants to not look any older.</li>
            <li> Wow, this really works!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my wrinkles, but it&#x27;s still pretty early.</li>
            <li> After stirring the contents to eliminate the air pocket, the jar was only 2/3 full.</li>
            <li> I guess we really want to believe that the more expensive a product line, the better it is...</li>
            <li> I re-ordered this product because while it did noticeably help the appearance of fine lines, I mostly became addicted to how it made my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> It goes on super sheer, so no build up.</li>
            <li> I have one more jar left and will use it twice a day as directed, but it there is no improvement after the second jar, I would not recommend for the &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; population.</li>
            <li> I cannot say it is perfect, since I don&#x27;t have wrinkle, or dry skin, so i don&#x27;t see the dramatic change.</li>
            <li> until i&#x27;m much older and needing something stronger for wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li> Overall been very pleased and have not wanted to look at other skin care lines which, before finding this, I used to jump around and try new stuff every time I ran out of something.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for firming the skin; but what I like is that it makes my skin very soft after applying it.  </li>
            <li> Very creamy and makes the skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to older women -</li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments on my skin -- I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend.</li>
            <li> if you try this I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> my wife found it to be fantastic and does exactly as expected as advertised.</li>
            <li> i was very hopeful about this cream, but it didn&#x27;t work for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> FAR better than any of the more expensive creams I have purchased.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I had used this one, I normally use Regenerist, it made a huge difference in my skin within a few days.</li>
            <li> and I normally am told I look 40.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a new product that came highly recommended by Olay.  </li>
            <li> But I think a lot of people with skin on the dry side may be able to use it for day, especially if applied sparingly.</li>
            <li> Burned my skin and made it red, had to go wash it off right away.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived with packaging stating it is a new product.</li>
            <li> I highy recommend the Pro-X line over the regular Olay products and if you are a mature woman, it is worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> I have super dry skin</li>
            <li> i have been useing this cream since it came out ;it is very expensive in the shops ;but here on Amozan  makes the price very good to buy .So</li>
            <li> The vaseline wins by a long shot, I dont know why</li>
            <li> The first night I applied the wrinkle smoothing cream, my face actually felt moisturized!  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I do have particularly sensitive skin and a hormonal problem, so it may work well for others with normal skin.</li>
            <li> When you first apply it to your face and neck, your skin INSTANTLY looks smoother...</li>
            <li> noticeable results pretty quickly on regular skin, non-oily, non-dry..</li>
            <li> This product is nice to use, a little goes a long way, and makes your skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> , I have started to notice a positive change within the last week.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this at other stores and the jar was completely full.</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar I noticed a large air pocket in the middle of the jar.</li>
            <li> It is the only moisturizer I have found that is silky and light, yet REALLY hydrates without being greasy, heavy or an adverse reaction, like breakouts.  </li>
            <li> a big savings from the regular retail price...and a HUGE savings from the big bucks that I used to spend for Clarins.</li>
            <li> That would clearly show you how Olay Pro X &amp; Regenerist products keep her looking 35 years old when she is now 59 years old.</li>
            <li> It is greasy and I would NOT recommend it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and Olay Professional Pro-X Hydra firming Cream doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one jar, so I really can&#x27;t judge.</li>
            <li> I can say my face feels ultra soft</li>
            <li> Does not remove wrinkles on this 80 year old skin however.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001JQLNMI Olay Professional Pro-X Hydra Firming Cream, 1.7 Ounce]]  </li>
            <li> OR THE TIME THEY USE 20 YEAR OLD MODELS TO MAKE US THINK THIS WILL WORK</li>
            <li> I am 59 years old and need something with a thicker consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old and nobody can tell I am.</li>
            <li> just began using this product and my skin feels silky and soft in the mornings....</li>
            <li> Like I said this stuff is soft, you can feel it work</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have used the Pro X complete line for two years</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and have used a lot of face creams.  </li>
            <li> my philosophy is to think young and age gracefully.</li>
            <li> I am very satifsfied and will continue to purchase this product in the future</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive, don&#x27;t really know if it works (I&#x27;ve nearly finished the cream) since I&#x27;m already old and wrinkled.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this product and only the first few nights I have already seen the difference.</li>
            <li> This firming cream lasts me about 3 months or more depending on the time of year - a little goes a long way as it is really thick &amp; rich.  </li>
            <li> and I get told I look several years younger than my real age.</li>
            <li> Buyers beware, I received my lotion today and when i opened the jar it was only half full.</li>
            <li> I have strayed multiple times to try out a fancy, highly recommended moisturizer, and always find myself going back to this one.  </li>
            <li> As far as the latter, my dermatologist said that my skin barrier wasn&#x27;t working as it should.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30year old male</li>
            <li> I alternate Renova (old lady version of Retin-A) and a glycolic serum.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely continue to use the proX kit and will not hesitate to get other proX line of products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need super dramatic results.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face soft and has actually smoothed away some of my smaller wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and moist all day long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other night cream&#x27;s that seem to just stay on top of your skin, are thick and don&#x27;t seem to go into your skin.</li>
            <li> As much as any of us hate to admit, how well we age is determined predominately by genetics plus exercise, good nutrition, hydration, sunscreen and regular skin care.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in large vats and costed less -- I would use it all over my body instead of just my face and neck.</li>
            <li> It also reminded me of thinned down crisco, and didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that my skin looks brighter and less wrinkly.</li>
            <li> Next morning, my face felt slightly dry, but nowhere near before.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, Olay has been an \\&quot;ok\\&quot; product, but seemed \\&quot;watery\\&quot; to me, never a very effective line for moisturizing skin that really needs moisture.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it after having some spots frozen (cryotherapy) at the dermatologist, thinking that my normal &amp;#34;rejuvenating&amp;#34; products would be too harsh post-procedure.</li>
            <li> Worked much better than the other expensive creams</li>
            <li> I am a pale, blue eyed blonde with roseacea from my red haired irish mother.</li>
            <li> but I would prefer not really old product.</li>
            <li> have only been using for a couple of weeks, no real noticeable changes.</li>
            <li> but doubt I&#x27;ll buy another, unless some long term effects show.</li>
            <li> What I received was a face and neck full of red and angry bumps.</li>
            <li> This cream is such a change from the oily night creams I&#x27;ve been using (like L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift, other Olay products, Avon, Arbonne, Lancome).  </li>
            <li> I knew greasy petroleum product was causing the breakouts, but it was either that or severely dry face and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> This cream seems to make my dry wrinkles disappear, and I&#x27;m 74...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on any of the more expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li> (I think their regular price has recently dropped a few bucks).  </li>
            <li> This has been out for a couple years and is not a new product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not better or worse than most of the other firming creams.</li>
            <li> &#x27;plump&#x27; provides limited &#x27;firming&#x27; though.</li>
            <li> Not sure the desired effects are clear for me and those around me</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a difference in the tone &amp; quality of my skin since I started using the line of Olay PROx products (been about a year now) - less wrinkles,</li>
            <li> I have read some disappointing reviews of this product line but I strongly beg to differ.</li>
            <li> I am 72 and have very dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dry in Colorado.</li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;m told I don&#x27;t look any where near my age.</li>
            <li> I can tell and see the difference when I&#x27;m too lazy to use it as part of my general complexion maintenance.</li>
            <li> Gently use an exfoliation pad or serum type exfoliator with small granulates, rinse well, then apply a small amount of Pro X.  People</li>
            <li> I really do like the way this cream is thin</li>
            <li> The jar is just about empty</li>
            <li> Then find myself going back to the Hydra Firm.  </li>
            <li> Did not work as expected.  </li>
            <li> I saw no real results.</li>
            <li> Delivered timely and product was as expected and described</li>
            <li> They are expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is one of a few facial moisturizers I use repeatedly.</li>
            <li> Makes every other night cream I ever used seem like a sheer waste of money.</li>
            <li> Instantly I noticed a very slight difference...</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel less dry during the Winter months.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so I only put very little around the eyes and neck area.</li>
            <li> DUE</li>
            <li> USED 3 WEEKS ALONG WITH OTHER PRODUCTS FROM THIS COMPANY</li>
            <li> Use it at night with other Pro x products</li>
            <li> I will try some other products to compare</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like wearing creams on my face under my makeup due to the fact I have oily skin and it makes my face shine.  </li>
            <li> this gives my skin other than to say my skin felt \\&quot;relaxed\\&quot;, and my color \\&quot;calmed down.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> then other creams.</li>
            <li> I use it along with my other Olay products.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks, I have not seen any changes except for a few milia around the mouth (sort of like minor acne).</li>
            <li> a little goes a very long ways.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have been having some serious dry face issues past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> Olay makes decent not brilliant procducts .</li>
            <li> Usually I had to pay a little over $40 for each of the Pro-X products at places like Target, with an occasional sale price of around $35</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li> My skin is my worst feature, so I have spent years and money chasing every skin care promise made by most American manufacturers.  </li>
            <li> Steroid creams provide relief from the itching and the dry skin, but they thin the skin and turn it red.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not follow the old rule of thumb - try on a small swatch of skin 24 hours prior to...</li>
            <li> and I can seriously see a big difference in my skin</li>
            <li> My face appears less lined.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been an Olay fan for that reason but this cream is slightly greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about half way through the jar and don&#x27;t see a lot of difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using the starter kit now for a little over a week</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE PAST DECADE, AND I DO GIVE THEM ALL TIME, BUT EVENTUALLY MOVE ON.  </li>
            <li> so maybe it will take a little longer for me to notice the firming aspect of this product.</li>
            <li> My forehead gets dry and extremely itchy, and I am prone to fungal infections behind my ears and on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Does it firm the skin?  </li>
            <li> A FEW MONTHS, YOU WILL SEE RESULTS.</li>
            <li> Hopefully my skin will firm up  after I use it for awhile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is supposed to be a night cream, and for me (combo-oily) it would be too heavy for day.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles were diminished in a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few others since trying this one</li>
            <li> , so bad that i added several drops of essential oils to improve it and still the nauseating scent of rotting vegetation shines through, ugghhh</li>
            <li> In fact, my face would get so dry after washing that I resorted to applying aquophor all over my face which was greasy and disgusting, but it was the only thing stopping my face from completely drying out, flaking and even cracking.  </li>
            <li> It seems improve the tone and texture of my skin, but I&#x27;m not sure it warrants the price.  </li>
            <li> If you are still not satisfied, consider a plastic surgeon.</li>
            <li> and I must admit that Consumer Reports is usually on target.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would buy again.</li>
            <li> At my age, I&#x27;, no sure anything would pass the &#x27;firming&#x27; muster, but it does plump and hydrate well</li>
            <li> This cream is a different, lighter base (liquid crystal tech, I think) that disappears instantly.  </li>
            <li> I have never had allergies and am not allergic to anything, so this was a surprise to say the least.</li>
            <li> I share my secrets and this is one I use on face and hands at least 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> I desperately needed to give my dulling complexion a boost with the sudden onset of dry, cold air.  </li>
            <li> The glass bottle it comes in is very thick.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles did not lessen, if anything they&#x27;re worse.</li>
            <li> Like the price of Olay products, especially Firm cream which is not oily</li>
            <li> Lately the products have been difficult to get, some are discontinued and some increased in price by almost 50%.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product was packed and delivered sloppily, that&#x27;s why 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Although the results have not been dramatic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost always disappointed when I try some other brand.</li>
            <li> product is pretty bad... smells really awful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skeptical person by nature, so I write this with some qualifiers.  </li>
            <li> and now I am sorry I made the purchase because it made my skin itch</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has gotten really expensive</li>
            <li> Yes, buy this product, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but at my age, can&#x27;t expect a miracle.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there is no difference in the level of wrinkles or firmness of my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say i will be returning it.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong because it works just as well as the expensive creams.  </li>
            <li> The cream has a very thin consistency.  </li>
            <li> Then this year, my face started breaking out really bad</li>
            <li> As a result, I had these hideously ugly wrinkly excess skin lines under my chin and throat.  </li>
            <li> and this is the one my skin has never felt softer you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> It is like home base for my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worthless.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CREAM.  </li>
            <li> Awful, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Light and smooth, soaks in well... repeat customer - I&#x27;ve used Olay products for almost 30 years and I&#x27;m told I don&#x27;t look my age...</li>
            <li> Very, very good,  I had an age spot spanning my right cheek that looked like a birth mark, it has completely removed it.  Worked much better than the other expensive creams</li>
            <li> Good way to get my face cream at a discount is to use Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save.  I like the texture and smell of this one.</li>
            <li> I loved this!!  so light cream!  my skin loved it! thanksss.</li>
            <li> At night I use the hydra firming cream which I absolutely love, makes my skin feel really nice when I go to bed and wake up the next morning.  I have definitely noticed a difference in the tone &amp; quality of my skin since I started using the line of Olay PROx products (been about a year now) - less wrinkles, skin looks younger &amp; softer.  I use the tightening serum in the morning along with the lotion - age repair SPF30 and the eye restoration cream.  I have all of the items on subscribe and save which makes it really easy - never have to think about reordering.  This firming cream lasts me about 3 months or more depending on the time of year - a little goes a long way as it is really thick &amp; rich.  Overall been very pleased and have not wanted to look at other skin care lines which, before finding this, I used to jump around and try new stuff every time I ran out of something.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  I have been suffering for several years with atopic dermatitus.  My forehead gets dry and extremely itchy, and I am prone to fungal infections behind my ears and on my neck.  As far as the latter, my dermatologist said that my skin barrier wasn&#x27;t working as it should.  I recently went through allergy patch testing and now know what hair care products that I&#x27;m allergic to.  Steroid creams provide relief from the itching and the dry skin, but they thin the skin and turn it red.  When I heard the ProX commercial and the words, \\&quot;restores moisture barrier\\&quot;, I had to try this product. I now avoid those products to which I am allergic, and use this cream.  In the morning I put the cream on my forehead and ears before my makeup routine, and in the evening I use the cream as suggested.  My skin is on the mend, and looks great.  Does it firm the skin?  I&#x27;ve seen some improvement in the deep folds that run from my nose to my chin. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I really do like the way this cream is thin and I like the way it spreads on. I have been using it at night and its just ok. Nothing amazing but not bad. I find my best face comes from using vaseline at night, no joke. Makes every other night cream I ever used seem like a sheer waste of money. Mix vaseline with a drop of water and you will notice the difference first thing in the morning. I only tried this again recently when I though that neither this Pro x Hydra Firming Cream or the Pro X Wrinkle Smoothing Cream were really doing anything. The vaseline wins by a long shot, I dont know why but it works.</li>
            <li> The price is excelent and i like this product ;i have bin useing this cream for quite a long time and it is none greasy and feels good on the skin .</li>
            <li> GOOD SERVICE A AA AA AA AAA AAAA AAAA AAAAA AAAAA AAAAAAA AAA AAA AA AA AA AA AAA AA AA</li>
            <li> good price for this cream</li>
            <li> The product arrived with packaging stating it is a new product. This has been out for a couple years and is not a new product. There is no expiation date on the packaging but I would prefer not really old product.</li>
            <li> After using this a month I don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> This cream is gross! It is greasy and I would NOT recommend it for sensitive skin. Yes folks, 1.7 oz. of a cream is WAY too good to be true at this price. Skip this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skeptical person by nature, so I write this with some qualifiers.  This is my second jar of the Olay Hydra Firming Cream.  It seems improve the tone and texture of my skin, but I&#x27;m not sure it warrants the price.  In any case, I plan to use the produce for six months or so before coming to a final conclusion.</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased with this product and use  it at night; the next morning my skin is still hydrated and smooth.  I highy recommend the Pro-X line over the regular Olay products and if you are a mature woman, it is worth the investment.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> A bit of Olay?  I use it all day!  If life gives you wrinkles, iron &#x27;em out!</li>
            <li> It is a product that I currently use.  It arrived promptly and at a cost savings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57 and just lost 64 lbs.  As a result, I had these hideously ugly wrinkly excess skin lines under my chin and throat.  I was contemplating ultherapy at $250 a session, and I&#x27;ve never contemplated a cosmetic procedure.  I knew I needed a good firming lotion, and decided on this one.  I&#x27;ve never written a review on any products before, but this product deserved it.  About 45 minutes after my first application, I just happened to look in the mirror and couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw. There was a good 70-75% improvement.  Now it&#x27;s been 4 days later and these lines are almost gone.  Best cosmetic purchase I ever made. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in large vats and costed less -- I would use it all over my body instead of just my face and neck. It&#x27;s so light, yet so moisturizing. I get tons of compliments on my skin -- I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL AND GLIDES ON EASILY TO THE SKIN.  BUT, I WILL NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN DUE TO THE COUNTRY IT IS MADE IN, WHICH IS TOXIC AND POLLUTED.  I AM GOING WITH HEALTHY ORGANIC CREAMS, FACIAL EXERCISE, LOTS OF CLEAN WATER AND A HEALTHY CLEAN DIET :)</li>
            <li> I really love this cream and have been using it for a while.  I recently tried a more expensive cream (ROC firming serum) and now I am sorry I made the purchase because it made my skin itch and now I find I am only able to use it on my neck. I have rosacea and Olay Professional Pro-X Hydra firming Cream doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Wow, this really works!  I am very impressed and pleased.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he absolutely LOVES this! He is 35 and wants to not look any older. He said this is silky smooth and super hydrating on his face and neck. He said he is going to put in his calendar when he started to see his progress. Yes guys can and should use anti-aging products too! Not just for women : ) Amazing product!</li>
            <li> love it.. can see it helping the very first day I used it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to love it, but it smells nice.</li>
            <li> have only been using for a couple of weeks, no real noticeable changes. Will use for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes your face feel very moist.</li>
            <li> My skin feels good, never dry, even in freezing Chicago winters. Even my children tell I look younger than my friends the same age.This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of face creams.  I really like how this product feels.  I&#x27;m not saying it makes me look 10 years younger but I definitely think it makes my skin look better.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have been having some serious dry face issues past couple of years.  In fact, my face would get so dry after washing that I resorted to applying aquophor all over my face which was greasy and disgusting, but it was the only thing stopping my face from completely drying out, flaking and even cracking.  Then this year, my face started breaking out really bad and I was at wit&#x27;s end.  I knew greasy petroleum product was causing the breakouts, but it was either that or severely dry face and wrinkles.  I have tried Clinique&#x27;s moisture surge cream, but it was only good for 5 minutes.  On desperation, I did some research and bought the proX starter kit.  The first night I applied the wrinkle smoothing cream, my face actually felt moisturized!  In fact, it felt so good, that I went to bed without applying aquaphor.  Next morning, my face felt slightly dry, but nowhere near before.  I have been using the starter kit now for a little over a week and it has made a world of difference.  My breakouts are going away and my face is smoothening too!  I have not used aquaphor since I started using the proX kit, but my face now feels more moisturized than before.  I hope this gets better with more usage in the future.  Thanks to increased moisture in my skin, fine wrinkles are also smoothening away and not as noticeable.  I am so thankful to have found this product that actually works for my skin!  I will absolutely continue to use the proX kit and will not hesitate to get other proX line of products.</li>
            <li> Save your money. I used it for a month. The jar is just about empty and I don&#x27;t see any change. Even bought the eye cream to go with it. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I tried this product thinking it would be good daily moistuizer and make my skin look fabulous. What I received was a face and neck full of red and angry bumps. I have never had allergies and am not allergic to anything, so this was a surprise to say the least. The reaction lasted about a week. Unfortunately, I did not follow the old rule of thumb - try on a small swatch of skin 24 hours prior to... This review is not so much a knock on the product as it is a tale that I hope will encourage anyone else looking to try this product to test it out first.</li>
            <li> There was some very \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; reviews for this product and I had hoped to see the same benefits.  While I found this cream left my skin with a nice healthy glow, it did absorb quickly and I really haven&#x27;t see any significant firming.  Will continue to use until the jar is finished but doubt I&#x27;ll buy another, unless some long term effects show.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but I especially liked the price I paid for this product. I will order this product again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Been using this since it Olay put it on the market.  I am a &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; but have received many compliments on my nice complexion.  Cheaper than plastic surgery;</li>
            <li> Olay Pro-X products are excellent and much less expensive than those claiming to do be much more effective and are not.     I would recommend this Hydra-Firming cream to anyone who not only wants an excellent moisturizer but one that helps firm their face and neck. It can&#x27;t work miracles but I do see a marketable improvement and it only takes a very short time and I will continue to use it to maintain the appearance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not better or worse than most of the other firming creams. I&#x27;ve only used one jar, so I really can&#x27;t judge.</li>
            <li> Great cream. I&#x27;m a 30year old male and I use this after showers and as an after shave. Leaves your skin feeling silky smooth. Also did reduce the appearance of the lines on my forehead. Will definitely buy again and recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have tried every anti-aging cream out there and for the money this one is the best. it works just as well as any of the pricier creams at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> my wife found it to be fantastic and does exactly as expected as advertised. she loves it uses it... :-)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been using pro x age repair lotion and really love it.  Unfortunately, it has gotten really expensive so, I thought I would give this lotion a try.  Burned my skin and made it red, had to go wash it off right away.  It also reminded me of thinned down crisco, and didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin very well. Will be sending this one back and saving for the pro x age repair lotion which is fabulous!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect in every way. I have really seen a significant improvement wtih daily use over about three months time. It&#x27;s not at all greasy either. Don&#x27;t waste money on any of the more expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li> Too soon to see results really, I have really good skin for a 51 year old but I can say my face feels ultra soft withe the pro x series</li>
            <li> Love this Olay firming cream.  I use it at night and it isn&#x27;t sticky at all. Goes on silky smooth and just makes your face and neck feel good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other night cream&#x27;s that seem to just stay on top of your skin, are thick and don&#x27;t seem to go into your skin. I have since reordered this and will continue to use. I am 72 and have very dry skin and this makes it feel supple.</li>
            <li> very happy with this product-</li>
            <li> This product is nice to use, a little goes a long way, and makes your skin feel so soft.  Have been using it for about 6 months and like it.  Does not remove wrinkles on this 80 year old skin however.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001JQLNMI Olay Professional Pro-X Hydra Firming Cream, 1.7 Ounce]]  I use this every night and like its smooth texture.  Plan on continuing using product.</li>
            <li> USED 3 WEEKS ALONG WITH OTHER PRODUCTS FROM THIS COMPANY DID NOTHING NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE TIME THEY USE 20 YEAR OLD MODELS TO MAKE US THINK THIS WILL WORK</li>
            <li> Great Product! Fast Shipping! Thank You!!! A+A+A+A+A+</li>
            <li> I have purchased most everything in this line and the Hydra Firming Cream  is the only one  that I have re-ordered. It leaves a nice feel to the skin. I use it morning and night after my own firming serum and before applying mineral makeup. I do not think it is a \\&quot;miracle creme\\&quot;(that requires a facelift)  but it feels good going on and never leaves a greasy or shiny look plus the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> seems to work well, just started using it, best thing is that it is a nice, light moisturizer, very comfortable to use</li>
            <li> have been using for over a week and don&#x27;t notice any difference.  Maybe it will take longer to show a difference!</li>
            <li> Visible difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I love this product.  This absorbs quickly and keeps skin moist overnight.  It really makes a difference on my neck.</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference when I use this product. I have decided to use the nighttime recovery cream instead day and night and have better results but this stuff is pretty good too. My face is better when using these products. I started getting wrinkles and a dehydrated look. This stuff changes that but you have to keep using it to keep the results.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this product and only the first few nights I have already seen the difference. My skin looks smoother and firmer. I would recommend this product and seller to everyone and would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Great price! Tried numerous anti-aging creams through the years but always come back to Oil Of Olay. This is their BEST cream! Quick shipping! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Olay Professional Pro-X Hydra Firming Cream, 1.7 Ounce is a great product for the money.  Does a good job of reducing fine lines and moisturizing the face and neck.  I will stick with the product.</li>
            <li> I keep this on order all the time it is as close as you can come to the best for the price. I share my secrets and this is one I use on face and hands at least 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about a week and my skin looks more even in color.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my wrinkles, but it&#x27;s still pretty early.</li>
            <li> Great customer support !!! I paid $14 .. They didn&#x27;t have it in stock. They ordered from another company ..They paid  $16 out of pocket for this so i would get it on time!!!!!!!  Can&#x27;t say enough how surprised was when i got it and seen they paid almost $30!!!!!!!! And a great product on top of that!!! Recommend for sure!!!</li>
            <li> WORKS ABOUT LIKE OTHERS FOR SALE.  HAVE YET TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND THAT YOU CAN AFFORD SO WILL PROBABLY NOT REORDER</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to Olay products.  I don&#x27;t see amazing results with Olay but I like the way it feels on my skin.  I&#x27;m almost always disappointed when I try some other brand. I&#x27;ve tried several of the Olay moisturizing creams and I like them all equally. I see them as preventing rather than fixing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Started using this product about 3 weeks ago.  It actually compliments the Pro X Age Repair.  My skin appears more toned in terms of tightness.  I had been really looking for something for the bags under my eyes and since using this product, I have started to notice a positive change within the last week.  I will highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream since it was introduced to the market and at $50.  I love that the price has dropped so much!  I have strayed multiple times to try out a fancy, highly recommended moisturizer, and always find myself going back to this one.  It is the only moisturizer I have found that is silky and light, yet REALLY hydrates without being greasy, heavy or an adverse reaction, like breakouts.  This fluffs my skin and does reduce the appearance on fine lines.  I almost always see more visible lines on my face, when I try something else.  Then find myself going back to the Hydra Firm.  It is like home base for my skin.</li>
            <li> Olay is a great product and I would recommend it highly. I plan on purchasing more  when I run out.</li>
            <li> Olay products are actually pretty good for the money. Pro-X is the top of the line for Olay, so my expectation for this particular product was high. I have not used it before because of the cost in the stores, so was happy to see Amazon&#x27;s price! It is working well for my skin, but it&#x27;s not one to use during the day. Need a separate moisturizer for this. I&#x27;m about half-way through the content.</li>
            <li> Did I say amazing!?  I could tell the difference the next day!  Wow!  This is so worth the money.  I&#x27;ve paid 3 times this before and got the same results.  Yes, buy this product, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Good product I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the product. I have super dry skin and I use this as a day cream under my make up. It&#x27;s not greasy and has a light scent.</li>
            <li> Works okay but nothing&#x27;s impressive.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CREAM.  I HAVE BEEN USING IT FAITHFULLY FOR 3 WKS. NOW AND NOT A BIT OF CHANGE.</li>
            <li> I think it made my face break out a bit so I only put very little around the eyes and neck area.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for the price.  It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky.  Keeps skin hydrated and smooth all day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream!  It is super light and actually firms...while still moisturizing!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and I can seriously see a big difference in my skin --How it looks AND how it feels!</li>
            <li> The cream has a very thin consistency.  I don&#x27;t find it that good.  I will not buy it again.  I am 59 years old and need something with a thicker consistency.</li>
            <li> The advantage of the Olay regenerist line was that it beat out department store brands in performance, but at a significantly lower price.  I don&#x27;t see much difference between the products (regenerist and pro-x), but pro-x is much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year &amp; get compliments about my skin all the time.  Have it on subscription.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it works as well as the bhigher priced creams!</li>
            <li> That about sums it up - I didn&#x27;t like that the next morning my neck felt tacky and moist and it has a medicinal smell.  I threw mine away!</li>
            <li> When I found out that Olay tests on animals, I stopped buying their products. My skin isn&#x27;t worth animals&#x27; torture, and there are many other products, such as Avon, Burt&#x27;s Bees, and countless others, that have excellent products for even less money.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it makes my skin feel so smooth but not oily.</li>
            <li> I think this has firmed up my face and neck.  Use it at night with other Pro x products and I think I look better.  At least I&#x27;m told I don&#x27;t look any where near my age.</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my face and how it makes my face feel and look. Another one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Only product that I buy that does improve my skin and neck.  Tried others and just not as good as this - and is not stinky!</li>
            <li> This product continually makes me break out and doesn&#x27;t seem to help my skin at all.  I do have particularly sensitive skin and a hormonal problem, so it may work well for others with normal skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for several years.  No strong fragrance, glides on smoothly, feels wonderful on my skin.  Will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I definitely see a difference. My face appears less lined. Really like this product and would continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Everything it is advertised to be. Does not do deep wrinkles which it makes no claim to do. The packaging is deceptive. The glass bottle it comes in is very thick. The red part in the picture is all you get.</li>
            <li> Great vendor - fast and good packing - but product is pretty bad... smells really awful, so bad that i added several drops of essential oils to improve it and still the nauseating scent of rotting vegetation shines through, ugghhh... threw it away, couldn&#x27;t stand to put it on my face.</li>
            <li> I love the other Olay products, so I got this one as a gift to give to my mother.  I assume this will be as good as the other products, but I&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> Greasy. Prefer Olay Pro-X Wrinkle Smoothing Cream. Went rancid after 6 months.</li>
            <li> This cream seems to make my dry wrinkles disappear, and I&#x27;m 74...well maybe not disappear, but looking much better.  It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Works ok. Better then some</li>
            <li> This stuff is worthless. You could get just as good of results by putting water on your face. My wrinkles did not lessen, if anything they&#x27;re worse.</li>
            <li> I do not have to use anything separate for my eyelids or skin surrounding my eyes. I will continue to order this item.</li>
            <li> I tried this Hydra Firming Cream for the first time.  It doesn&#x27;t do much for firming the skin; but what I like is that it makes my skin very soft after applying it.  I am planning to try the Olay Tightening Serum for the first time.  Then I will write my review about that cream.</li>
            <li> Okay, but don&#x27;t like the greasy feel. I&#x27;ve always been an Olay fan for that reason but this cream is slightly greasy. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> i was very hopeful about this cream, but it didn&#x27;t work for my sensitive skin.  my face got so itchy/rashy and i had to stop using it.  i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product for most, but not for someone with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Still searching for a cream.......this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Love it - makes my skin feel &amp; look great - definitely would purchase again &amp; advise others to as well</li>
            <li> This is great for people, that have wrinkles under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I like product. Makes skin feel and look better.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect miracles but do expect improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Product was packed and delivered sloppily, that&#x27;s why 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I love buying from amazon.  I don&#x27;t have to pay the drug store prices.  ProX</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar I noticed a large air pocket in the middle of the jar. After stirring the contents to eliminate the air pocket, the jar was only 2/3 full. Also, the product itself doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything more than any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected.  I will try some other products to compare</li>
            <li> Good product, works well and came packaged well and on time.</li>
            <li> I tried this as an alternative to Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Mico Sculpting cream and did not like it as well. I have gone back to the Micro Sculpting formula.</li>
            <li> I saw no real results.</li>
            <li> Love this product, thanks</li>
            <li> a must try for everyone I&#x27;ve tried many creams over the years and this is the one my skin has never felt softer you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you try this I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I really liked this cream. It goes on super sheer, so no build up. A little goes a long way. I like to apply it on my face first, and rub it out with a face sponge that come with my cleansing brush. I would recommend this for nightly use.</li>
            <li> Amazon had the best price for this cream, which is economical and does as promised, moisturizing my dry patches without feeling greasy or clogging pores. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. This is my 2nd jar. My face feels very moisturized and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old and nobody can tell I am. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles at all. Been using this product for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR A YEAR.  I SEE RESULTS.  I HAVE TRIED OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE PAST DECADE, AND I DO GIVE THEM ALL TIME, BUT EVENTUALLY MOVE ON.  I HAVE NOT MOVED ON FROM THIS ONE.  SURE, IF YOU ARE WILLING TO PAY $300, THERE MAY BE A BETTER ONE OUT THERE.  BUT MY BUDGET DOESN&#x27;T ALLOW FOR THAT, AND IF YOU ARE READING THIS REVIEW, I&#x27;M GUESSING YOURS DOESN&#x27;T EITHER.  GIVE IT A FEW MONTHS, YOU WILL SEE RESULTS.</li>
            <li> Delivered timely and product was as expected and described</li>
            <li> Very good and lightweight</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and feels good.  It does not seem any better than other products I have used.  I will probably try something else when it is gone.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several years and am very happy with it.  Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat this.  Goes on smooth, not greasy.  Works great I have noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t believe you need to spend a fortune on creams. Olay is a good brand &amp; affordable. Also look for coupons online.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST facial moisturizer I have EVER USED!  FAR better than any of the more expensive creams I have purchased. When you first apply it to your face and neck, your skin INSTANTLY looks smoother...no lie. Key word &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34;. One of those products that &amp;#34;improves the APPEARANCE of fine lines and wrinkles.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll continue using it to see if there are longer term benefits as they promise.  I just wish there was more of it in a jar.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay brand. This was the first time I had used this one, I normally use Regenerist, it made a huge difference in my skin within a few days. I also bought the Pro-x under eye cream and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Been using &amp;#34;Olay&amp;#34; since highschool,  never disappoints!</li>
            <li> My skin breaks out and this is the only product that helps. This cream is worth the price&#x27; in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Its ok.... not a lot of product.  and not as moisture as I thought.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that my skin looks brighter and less wrinkly. Makes you fell good about your looks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dry in Colorado. I needed something that has alot of moisturizer in it. It feels good on my skin. Hopefully my skin will firm up  after I use it for awhile. I got a really good price.</li>
            <li> I have used product for a while now and really like it. I liked the price.</li>
            <li> Non greasy.  Didn&#x27;t make me 10 years younger but does make skin smoother and brighter</li>
            <li> No miracles, but it does seem to tighten up the neck a bit. I&#x27;m about half way through the jar and don&#x27;t see a lot of difference.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a couple of years ago , it has made a real difference in my complexion . Love it</li>
            <li> Used to be a deal. Now they jacked the price up, I can get it for the same price as Walmart.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I have tried everything from Chanel to Elizabeth Arden. But this is the best for sensitive skin. I am allergic to sulfur which most lotions have. This is great for dry skin also.</li>
            <li> Best face cream for the money, hands down. Give it a couple minutes before applying makeup. Nicely done, Olay.</li>
            <li> Great product and especially for the price.</li>
            <li> just began using this product and my skin feels silky and soft in the mornings....I don&#x27;t like wearing creams on my face under my makeup due to the fact I have oily skin and it makes my face shine.  But, I have used it four or five times now and I can feel the difference in the mornings.  I don&#x27;t believe it has a strong odor, I have not detected anything like that.  It goes on very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.  I do believe the price is right, I know I have seend it higher elsewhere.  Cannot see where It is firming yet will probably take more applications, like I said I don&#x27;t use it during the day under my make up so maybe it will take a little longer for me to notice the firming aspect of this product.</li>
            <li> Great skin care product.  My skin feels soft and moist all day long.</li>
            <li> work like the instructions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many creams, Olay Prox firming cream is so far the best for my skin</li>
            <li> Like I said this stuff is soft, you can feel it work and it smells great, quality product.. use tiny amount.goes along way, I use it with the serum..Remeber exfoliate!</li>
            <li> Nothing more than silicone.  Honestly it feels like I just rubbed KY on my face.  It got all over my pillow cases too.  I used the entire bottle but I&#x27;m still wrinkly from smoking, drinking, laughing and having too much fun.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and am very satisfied with it.  I have extremely sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
            <li> feels very good on a skin, light, absorbed fast..........skin looks very smooth...recommended..and the price was very good too&lt;br /&gt;nice size</li>
            <li> I have used the Pro X complete line for two years and I get told I look several years younger than my real age. I believe that is because my skin isn&#x27;t aging quite as fast and I credit that to sticking to one good beauty line, especially this night moisturizer. I love it!  I just turned 48 and I normally am told I look 40. I will take that!!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Olay ProX line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and find it to be as efficient at doing what it claims as products much more pricey. Plus, using the Amazon Prime&#x27;s subscribe and save I&#x27;m able to save money as well. I&#x27;m a very &amp;#34;happy camper&amp;#34;. I highly recommend this product to older women - it&#x27;s good on sensitive skin. And I certainly have that.</li>
            <li> did not do any difference</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and have used a lot of face creams.  I highly recommend this product.  It is not greasy and feels so good on my skin.  I can tell a difference in my complexion.  Not perfect, but at my age, can&#x27;t expect a miracle.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is just greasy and doesn&#x27;t do anything to smooth out wrinkles at all.</li>
            <li> I am a pale, blue eyed blonde with roseacea from my red haired irish mother. My skin is my worst feature, so I have spent years and money chasing every skin care promise made by most American manufacturers.  In my experience, Olay has been an \\&quot;ok\\&quot; product, but seemed \\&quot;watery\\&quot; to me, never a very effective line for moisturizing skin that really needs moisture.  The Pro-X Hydra Firming Cream was a total surprise.  It felt like silk going on, and my skin went to a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; color of skin....it eliminated the redness (not permanently, but for about 10 hours until the next application).  I don&#x27;t know how to express the feeling this gives my skin other than to say my skin felt \\&quot;relaxed\\&quot;, and my color \\&quot;calmed down.\\&quot;  I re-ordered this product because while it did noticeably help the appearance of fine lines, I mostly became addicted to how it made my skin feel.  I do put a moisturizer on top of the Hydra firming cream, and it seems to work fine in cooperation with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a new product that came highly recommended by Olay.  Unfortunately, there is no difference in the level of wrinkles or firmness of my face and neck.  I have one more jar left and will use it twice a day as directed, but it there is no improvement after the second jar, I would not recommend for the &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; population.</li>
            <li> I seam to go thought this a lot faster then other creams. Usually I only go 2 days cream a year.</li>
            <li> fast delivery,very pleased</li>
            <li> I like the effects of this product. Although the results have not been dramatic. I didn&#x27;t really need super dramatic results. But the product does seem to soften fine lines over time.</li>
            <li> Like the cream but can&#x27;t tell much of a difference. Doesn&#x27;t have an odor so it might be great for people who are sensitive to fragrances. It does make my skin feel smoother but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I desperately needed to give my dulling complexion a boost with the sudden onset of dry, cold air.  This moisturizer is thick and rich, but still feels light and leaves my face feeling fresh and dew-like, not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a lightweight cream that I use every night.  I&#x27;ve seen a big reduction in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Use it t night and in morning skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li> Better than the $200 jars.  The Prox line of OLAY is outstanding. I use the moisturizer for day and this on weekends and nights.</li>
            <li> Buyers beware, I received my lotion today and when i opened the jar it was only half full. I have purchased this at other stores and the jar was completely full. Needless to say i will be returning it. Better off buying at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Like the price of Olay products, especially Firm cream which is not oily and no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I think it did well for lines and can somehow against gravity and hope so.&lt;br /&gt;Also I hope this can be during the day, because I like the textile very much. and have to say no additional water/lotion before the cream is a great help. Do not know why Olay sells many things in China instead of one bottle cream.</li>
            <li> excellent service and product</li>
            <li> Use this all the time. Love it.</li>
            <li> I used the french skincare line, Clarins, for about 15 years.  It was pricy at well over $100 for each 1.7 oz container of cream and similar pricing on their day creams and serums.  A couple of times I tried switching to a much lower priced drugstore brand, but always felt that the condition of my skin significantly deteriorated.  Although I was quite happy with the Clarins results, I did switch for a couple of years to Arbonne&#x27;s anti-aging line because a friend had begun selling the product. My complexion did okay on it, but not quite as well as it did on the Clarins.  When the Olay Pro-X line first came out, they offered significant incentives/rebates to try out their new skincare.  The Hydra Firming cream was the first Pro-X product that I tried, and I was quite impressed.  It goes on nicely with a gel-like feel without feeling greasy.  I then tried the serum, the eye cream, and the wrinkle smoothing cream...and was happy with the results.  It&#x27;s not that I felt that my skin improved more than when it was on the Clarins, but it stayed the same for a considerably lower cost.  Usually I had to pay a little over $40 for each of the Pro-X products at places like Target, with an occasional sale price of around $35 (I think their regular price has recently dropped a few bucks).  The last time I ordered the Hydra Firming cream from this seller, the price was $18.79...a big savings from the regular retail price...and a HUGE savings from the big bucks that I used to spend for Clarins.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this Olay pro x ;and i love it i have been useing this cream since it came out ;it is very expensive in the shops ;but here on Amozan  makes the price very good to buy .So i will continue with this until they decide to stop making it .&lt;br /&gt;hope they don&#x27;t stop .Not greasy goes on very nice and smooth i think anyone who trys this you will like it .&lt;br /&gt;I do love this cream .</li>
            <li> Definally has helped my skin from aging faster....&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived on time, and I applied it the next night :-)&lt;br /&gt;I will definably will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Yes, yes, yes.  I can tell and see the difference when I&#x27;m too lazy to use it as part of my general complexion maintenance. It actually makes a visible difference.  It&#x27;s as good or better than high priced department store or specialty store products.</li>
            <li> Its very good, I like it ...................I would introduce to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Its very good compare with the price. So I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but a bit overpriced I believe.  I have tried cheaper brands of facial moisterizer that worked just as good or better.  I also use a very good glycolic acid exfolient, so don&#x27;t feel I need this product as much.</li>
            <li> Just like the rest of the Olay products I use, this one is great! For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong because it works just as well as the expensive creams.  Being an esthetician I have tried them all.  You will want to use a good serum underneath for firming if that is your goal because this product will not firm your skin but the hydration is great for day and night use.  Thanks again Olay!</li>
            <li> I ordered this olay ,but I got smaller one not look like the the picture above...cheating!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before &amp; love it. But I love 95% of Oil of Olay products.</li>
            <li> I have sever eczema and this stuff is awesome!!!!! My skin needs lots of moisture and this product gives it to me</li>
            <li> Was using Kinerase line before trying this product...went immediately from my Kinerase regimen (cleanser,toner, cream, and eye formula)to the Olay Pro X line...it&#x27;s been three weeks and I cannot tell a difference between Kinerase and Pro X...will definitely purchase ProX again. I have read some disappointing reviews of this product line but I strongly beg to differ. I was pleasantly suprised. As much as any of us hate to admit, how well we age is determined predominately by genetics plus exercise, good nutrition, hydration, sunscreen and regular skin care. No skin care line is going to be a miracle for any of us...my philosophy is to think young and age gracefully. If you are still not satisfied, consider a plastic surgeon. Besides, Consumer Reports (both USA and France)tested a variety of skincare lines (StriVectin, Lancome, La Mer, included) and found that after a couple of months, Olay had the BEST results of any of them...and I must admit that Consumer Reports is usually on target. I recommend this line...and if the ProX is too much, Regenerist is a great alternative. I am very satifsfied and will continue to purchase this product in the future Why I have wasted so much money on lines like Kinerase, Dr Hauschka, and NV Perricone, I&#x27;ll never know. I guess we really want to believe that the more expensive a product line, the better it is...save your money and spend it on great hair color, cut and makeup...just as effective in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> This cream is such a change from the oily night creams I&#x27;ve been using (like L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift, other Olay products, Avon, Arbonne, Lancome).  It has a wonderful, silky texture.  It is a bit tacky until completely absorbed, but my skin looks more radiant, is much better hydrated and yes, looks and feels much firmer.  I don&#x27;t know if the firmness is just a temporary or cosmetic illusion, or if in time the product will actually make my skin firmer, but I swear I am seeing a difference in my neck, face and decollete.  I&#x27;m using the Pro-X Starter Kit with this product, and I&#x27;m using the Hydra cream twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have been using Kinerase products for years. They are expensive but well worth it. Lately the products have been difficult to get, some are discontinued and some increased in price by almost 50%. I decided to try other products just to see, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I still use Kinerase for my eyes, but this cream makes my face feel so smooth and soft. I really like it and I do not see a decline in results from stopping the Kinerase. This product is easy to get and so much cheaper. I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Received this and really like the product.  Very creamy and makes the skin very soft.  Received it quickly.  Thanks for supplying these products at reasonable rates.</li>
            <li> I really liked this firming, moisturizer.  I works really well.  Also worked great under makeup. Got rid of my turkey neck!</li>
            <li> I love me some OLAY!  I use all their products!  I used to use Mary Kay .....This works better for me!</li>
            <li> Very smooth application.  Love the texture and scent.  My skin appears smoother.  I have been using it around 1 week.  So far, I love it.</li>
            <li> As with the Eye Restoration product the Hydra Firming Cream is fantastic.  It keeps my face soft and has actually smoothed away some of my smaller wrinkles.  I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t keep me wrinkle free forever, but I am looking 10 years younger than I am, and that works for me!!!  Great  products, great deal through Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product since it came out and it&#x27;s the best product that I have ever used as an overnight treatment cream.  To key to get the best results from this or any other night cream is to exfoliate first.  If you wash your face and put on any cream it really won&#x27;t work effectively and will sit on the top of your skin. Gently use an exfoliation pad or serum type exfoliator with small granulates, rinse well, then apply a small amount of Pro X.  People think that I am 10-12 years younger than I am and I not complaining about that! : )</li>
            <li> This is one of a few facial moisturizers I use repeatedly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and having been using it for years.  I will continue to use it  - I have the skin of a 30 something while I&#x27;m almost 50.</li>
            <li> I doubt that this is a miracle cream, but I&#x27;ve only been using it a week now. I purchased it after having some spots frozen (cryotherapy) at the dermatologist, thinking that my normal &amp;#34;rejuvenating&amp;#34; products would be too harsh post-procedure. It was a good purchase for that, as I found this cream to be non-irritating--and even soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my skin has mostly healed, I&#x27;m using it AFTER my rejuvenating products, which were really not providing much if any moisture. I alternate Renova (old lady version of Retin-A) and a glycolic serum. After letting the treatment product soak in, I apply this Pro-X cream. It feels so good to &amp;#34;smooth it on,&amp;#34; as directions say. And I wake up to a nice looking/feeling face than with the other products alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is supposed to be a night cream, and for me (combo-oily) it would be too heavy for day. But I think a lot of people with skin on the dry side may be able to use it for day, especially if applied sparingly. It does absorb nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes when I hope for miracles from a face-care product, I forget how important it is what the product does NOT do, i.e. cause irritation. This cream definitely passes the non-irritation test for me, and I plan to stick with it for a while.</li>
            <li> impressed.  I use and have used over the years 63 of them and had never tried oly guess it was too inexpensive well i was impressed  i am voing to pur hase again.my skin felt moisturized and i dont know but...it did look better i have always taken care of my skin #1 of course Get Sun Screen!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love my face ,after 1 week i noticed my skin get more tide and fresh&lt;br /&gt;In morning i look fresh and not i did not sleep all night</li>
            <li> Instantly I noticed a very slight difference...And my skin did not improve anymore after that first use, so I cannot recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using 2 times a day....go easy...a little goes a very long ways.  I can see a difference after just 3 days on the dryness of my face and yes, even the crows feet and lip lines.  When your friends notice, you know its doing something positive!!</li>
            <li> Just discovered that Olay is one of the most notorious on the market for animal cruelty. Awful, I&#x27;ve been using it for years. L&#x27;oreal has very similar products, and they&#x27;re safe. Going with that!</li>
            <li> They were presents. The recipients are happy with these cream. I do not have further news about this cream.</li>
            <li> Gluten free and after using this product after discovering it I have been using it for several years I feel it does help and keeps it&#x27;s promise.  You can see a difference!! Thank you Oil of Olay!!</li>
            <li> this woman i knew when i was little swore by this cream, and according to everyone else, she looked amazing for her age. i was like five so what did i know. but i got this based on that memory. i think it works? i honestly use it as a preventative thing, but i like how light it is. and i can tell its moisturizing because any dryness is gone for good.</li>
            <li> Although this product leaves your face feeling very silky and smooth, I do not see any change in the appearance of my skin; especially when the product states its a &amp;#34;firming cream&amp;#34;??</li>
            <li> Good stuff if used in combination with a Retinol anti-wrinkle cream or filler. Use it at night over your anti-age serum.</li>
            <li> This cream makes my skin feel so soft and smooth, I really like it. I use it along with my other Olay products.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks, I have not seen any changes except for a few milia around the mouth (sort of like minor acne). Not sure I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a cream I have been using for years, I was getting a lot of wrinkles products of sun damage, and I will recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times and have been pleased with the results.  The cream goes on smooth and not oily, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> The cream is just ok.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t notice any difference even tho I have used it for quite sometime.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks...the Mrs.</li>
            <li> Have purchased at a lower price befor, But still a good price. Will re-order in three months</li>
            <li> Love this! Wrinkles were diminished in a few uses.</li>
            <li> I love Olay.  This cream is a different, lighter base (liquid crystal tech, I think) that disappears instantly.  Very hydrating, super lux and great under makeup or all alone (my preference).  At my age, I&#x27;, no sure anything would pass the &#x27;firming&#x27; muster, but it does plump and hydrate well...&#x27;plump&#x27; provides limited &#x27;firming&#x27; though.</li>
            <li> I cannot say it is perfect, since I don&#x27;t have wrinkle, or dry skin, so i don&#x27;t see the dramatic change. However, it is really good, keep skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes your skin feel less dry during the Winter months.  Shipping and packaging was great.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Use daily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting tired of writing Rave Reviews about Olay products, but the fact is they are Fantastic!!! I wish I could post a picture of my wife. That would clearly show you how Olay Pro X &amp; Regenerist products keep her looking 35 years old when she is now 59 years old. Outstanding products, very good service from seller.</li>
            <li> I have added it to my regimen using Olay&#x27;s microsculpting serum and cream.  It does seem to have made a difference around the mouth and chin.  It feels good going on and it&#x27;s great for using before going to bed.  It doesn&#x27;t have a smell and does seem to hydrate well.  With my regimen, I notice a difference if I go a day without using it.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive, don&#x27;t really know if it works (I&#x27;ve nearly finished the cream) since I&#x27;m already old and wrinkled. The container is WAY to much plastic that can&#x27;t be recycled. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love the Pro-X Hydra Firming cream. I have tried a few others since trying this one and I come back to the Pro-X. This is the 2nd jar I have purchased on Amazon. It&#x27;s the best price that i have found with it&#x27;s included coupon. This is, hands down, best for keeping my 42 year old skin silky soft &amp; looking &amp; feeling healthy. It&#x27;s not oily or drying.. it&#x27;s the perfect night time moisturizer with just a hint of scent. I won&#x27;t try anything else..  until i&#x27;m much older and needing something stronger for wrinkles, etc. I&#x27;ve been using Olay products since i was 29.</li>
            <li> I am 54, and is the only product that has shown a visable difference! Love it!</li>
            <li> love this face cream, I don&#x27;t look 20 yet...lol but I really do see a difference:)</li>
            <li> I am 63 and consone of the best creams on the market.. smooth and creamy.. a rich alternative to the costly ones and does a better all-around job.. noticeable results pretty quickly on regular skin, non-oily, non-dry.. I use it on my neck and under my jaw regularly along with Olay sculpting cream.</li>
            <li> Great price for a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Not sure the desired effects are clear for me and those around me</li>
            <li> Olay makes decent not brilliant procducts . As night creams go, you wont break out and it has a nice dense feel.</li>
    </ol>
