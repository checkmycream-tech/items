            <li>so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon as I have been using this for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it; but, it&#x27;s nice to know they provide help.</li>
            <li>But, that is fine with me !  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find any highlight products in Chile, where we lived for 18 months, so I had my daughter send me the Clairol Nice &#x27;N Easy Hairpainting kit.</li>
            <li>Would buy this product from here again :)</li>
            <li>I am somewhat pleased with the color, although when I lift up the outer layer of my hair, the under layer looks tiger-striped.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>IT IS BETTER AND CHEAPER THAN HAVING IT DONE AT A SALON</li>
            <li>Just make sure</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ve enjoyed most over the years is that you can be creative with this product.</li>
            <li>(I ended up using my fingers for the most part; but, practicing w/</li>
            <li>the brush will give better results</li>
            <li>ANY MORE</li>
            <li>Amazed there is a product that gives such great results and the shipper sent this product out immediately!  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>BUT...those test strips are MOST important.</li>
            <li>For very light blonde on brownish hair 40 minutes works great.</li>
            <li>This product is so easy, just mix the powder with the liquid and paint your hair however you want it to be.</li>
            <li>IT IS SO EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>It was perfect--natural looking and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never colored before leaving it on light brown hair for about 20-30 minutes gives a beautiful shade of red!</li>
            <li>My first try was more brass/red in some areas; but, am not too fanatical/fussy, as I once had to be, so a learning curve is okay w/me.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a toll free # to call if you have questions/problems.</li>
            <li>I stopped after only 9 strands, figuring that was a fair trade for $14.  </li>
            <li>IT DOES SUCH A GOOD JOB</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the results are consistent.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put it on your skin or scalp, I did that once and got a mild rash.</li>
            <li>Blessed lots of w/thick, curly hair, I was able to cut 6 decent pieces, in varying head locations,  for testing and made notes of the resulting times to achieve the req&#x27;d shades.</li>
            <li>The product is great - I&#x27;ve used it for years to lighten my dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>With much sadness/disappointment a new fact of my life is, I have to do my own highlighting.</li>
            <li>It is easy, quick, and at a decent price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite and looks as if a professional has done my hair.</li>
            <li>I am a natural strawberry blond already, but through the winter months, I lose most of my blond highlights.  </li>
            <li>Just remember, the lighter your hair the less time you will need to get great results, this stuff works fast!</li>
            <li>can get right to the root and paint wherever you want with varying degrees of lightness.</li>
            <li>Turned my dark brown hair bright orange..........</li>
            <li>Amazon shipped it super fast</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I tried highlighting my hair by myself.</li>
            <li>Of the different hair painting kits I have used, I find that Clairol Nice &#x27;n Easy Hairpainting Blonde Hair Highlights kit gives me the most natural looking highlights on my medium blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I am now considering my options, most likely lightening up my whole head as I do each summer.</li>
            <li>She went to volleyball tryouts and no one even realized she highlighted her hair even though it is easily two shades lighter and blonde in the front area.  </li>
            <li>The hairpaint is very east to use and does the job.  </li>
            <li>I CAN USE AS MUCH OR</li>
            <li>It did mix easily; however, the brush was inexplicably wide and the mixture did not adhere to my hair strands.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t buy this particular product again.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m a very long term user and it has never disappointed.</li>
            <li>I recommend doing a strand test first to get the timing right because the first time I did it, the color didn&#x27;t show at all because I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough.</li>
            <li>Also, I can achieve all over blonde color by using two boxes (I have very long hair) and smearing the product all over the top of my hair, leaving the bottom darker.</li>
            <li>I also like the abiltiy to control how dark or light I want to go.</li>
            <li>It is several hours later and my hair is dry (mostly air-dry, but I did finish it with the blow dryer).</li>
            <li>The mixture clearly did not rinse, or even wash, out of my hair.</li>
            <li>It will never look like &#x27;Dexter&#x27; did it; but, my need to look professional is not longer a requirement (she says</li>
            <li>Because I was trying to give a little life to some professional highlights I had done a few months ago, I decided I needed more control than the cap, and this seemed like the right</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much gray, but a little peeking through and this wipes it right out.</li>
            <li>You can apply on any color of hair and go from a carmel highlights with dark hair to a platinum highlight with light brown or blonde.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s where the colour is now lightest - something I could do nothing about without making a colossal mess.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural dark blonde, but I like to highlight a few strands around my face and on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>and I ended up using my bare fingers, washing and drying my hands between each strand I highlighted.  </li>
            <li>I only put the cream mixture on areas (or streaks) of hair for about 15 minutes to achieve a natural blond look.  </li>
            <li>The developing time was a reasonable 35 minutes, but where the wet strands lay against my dry hair, I have leopard-spots underneath.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this for a long time.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you follow the directions carefully and leave the product on long enough or you may have a brassy look.</li>
            <li> My basic natural color becomes somewhat dull.....</li>
            <li> My hair feels dry and powdery.</li>
            <li> Much less work and does the same job!  </li>
            <li> I ended up having to splotch some on my hair and pull the mixture down with my fingers.</li>
            <li> so I open a window because I am very sensitive to fumes, but it&#x27;s not too bad compared to other products.</li>
            <li> and I realized I was headed for a mess.</li>
            <li> I can use as much or as little as I like,</li>
            <li> Little balls of bleach cream fell off the edge</li>
            <li> AS LITTLE AS I LIKE EACH TTIME.  </li>
            <li> After leaving on for the allotted time, I rinsed it out in the shower, washed it, then applied the intensive conditioner and rinsed it out after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have been disappointed.</li>
            <li> The job looks really amateur to me, and I&#x27;m ashamed of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the brush is silly - far too wide and awkward.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> But $80 for 3 is crazy when you can get it at your local drug store for around $14 each.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the way the lightened strands look at the root either - that&#x27;s where the mixture was on thickest</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that stores don&#x27;t sell this anymore.</li>
            <li> I just used my fingers and pulled out random hair pieces to highlight and waited 50 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The hair painting is a product that is difficult to find in the stores.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have many allergies so this product is very good for me as it does not need to touch the scalp. Also, I can achieve all over blonde color by using two boxes (I have very long hair) and smearing the product all over the top of my hair, leaving the bottom darker. I get a lot of compliments because the darker shades begin to mingle with the blonde. I also like the abiltiy to control how dark or light I want to go. For very light blonde on brownish hair 40 minutes works great. If you&#x27;ve never colored before leaving it on light brown hair for about 20-30 minutes gives a beautiful shade of red! I have multiple shades of color streaked through my hair and everyone loves it, I always get compliments. This product is so easy, just mix the powder with the liquid and paint your hair however you want it to be. It does smell a lot so I open a window because I am very sensitive to fumes, but it&#x27;s not too bad compared to other products. My local stores quit carrying this product so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon as I have been using this for over 10 years. it worked great over gray too! I don&#x27;t have much gray, but a little peeking through and this wipes it right out. Just remember, the lighter your hair the less time you will need to get great results, this stuff works fast! You can watch the color coming up within minutes. Don&#x27;t put it on your skin or scalp, I did that once and got a mild rash. Read the instructions! Amazon shipped it super fast and it was well packed. Would buy this product from here again :)</li>
            <li> I have used Clairol hair color products, exclusively, for years. This is the first time I have been disappointed. It did mix easily; however, the brush was inexplicably wide and the mixture did not adhere to my hair strands. I ended up having to splotch some on my hair and pull the mixture down with my fingers. After leaving on for the allotted time, I rinsed it out in the shower, washed it, then applied the intensive conditioner and rinsed it out after a few minutes. It is several hours later and my hair is dry (mostly air-dry, but I did finish it with the blow dryer). My hair feels dry and powdery. The mixture clearly did not rinse, or even wash, out of my hair. I am somewhat pleased with the color, although when I lift up the outer layer of my hair, the under layer looks tiger-striped. I am now considering my options, most likely lightening up my whole head as I do each summer. It is now January. Won&#x27;t buy this particular product again.</li>

            <li> I love this product.  I always get great results and have hairdressers ask me where I get my hair done.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that stores don&#x27;t sell this anymore.</li>
            <li> Great product that I can&#x27;t find on store shelves anymore.  Highlights by using a comb or brush instead of a cap.  Much less work and does the same job!  Shipped promptly, and arrived in great condition.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. It&#x27;s the first time I tried highlighting my hair by myself.</li>
            <li> Great product that I have used for many years now. I don&#x27;t have to leave this product on my hair long to get the touch of blonde I need. I wish I could find it in stores again. Hard to find these days. Recommended.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST HIGHLIGHTER ON THE MARKET. IT IS EASY TO APPLY AND COMES OUT GREAT YOU CAN&#x27;T MAKE MISTAKES  IT IS BETTER AND CHEAPER THAN HAVING IT DONE AT A SALON</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted natural looking highlights for her dark blonde hair.  We were nervous so we waited until school was out.  It turned out wonderful.  She went to volleyball tryouts and no one even realized she highlighted her hair even though it is easily two shades lighter and blonde in the front area.  Very happy with the product.  I just used my fingers and pulled out random hair pieces to highlight and waited 50 minutes.  Will definitely use again.</li>
            <li> This a great product I have been using for years.  It is easy to use and the results are consistent.  Just make sure&lt;br /&gt;you follow the directions carefully and leave the product on long enough or you may have a brassy look.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more years than I care to remember! I started with it when it was called Quiet Touch and I was a teen. I&#x27;m now in my 50&#x27;s!! So I&#x27;m a very long term user and it has never disappointed. I can use as much or as little as I like, it&#x27;s easy to mix and gives very good results. I only leave it on 10 minutes from the time I finish painting but that seems to be enough for my hair. What I&#x27;ve enjoyed most over the years is that you can be creative with this product. You can just highlight the front, go way blonder with it all over or whatever you like.</li>
            <li> The hair painting is a product that is difficult to find in the stores.  My wife likes to just highlight her hair.  She has used this product for years and loves the result.</li>
            <li> Easy and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have been cap-highlighting my hair at home for 35 years, and I&#x27;m good at it.  I even have a certificate from Clairol hair colouring school from my days as a cosmetician at Shoppers Drug Mart.  Because I was trying to give a little life to some professional highlights I had done a few months ago, I decided I needed more control than the cap, and this seemed like the right product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the brush is silly - far too wide and awkward.  Little balls of bleach cream fell off the edge and I realized I was headed for a mess. Second, the gloves are stiff, you can&#x27;t really feel what you&#x27;re doing, and again, mixture rolled off them and spread around, so I took them off and I ended up using my bare fingers, washing and drying my hands between each strand I highlighted.  I stopped after only 9 strands, figuring that was a fair trade for $14.  The developing time was a reasonable 35 minutes, but where the wet strands lay against my dry hair, I have leopard-spots underneath.  Now I have to go in a &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; them out with another colour.  I am not happy with the way the lightened strands look at the root either - that&#x27;s where the mixture was on thickest so that&#x27;s where the colour is now lightest - something I could do nothing about without making a colossal mess.  The job looks really amateur to me, and I&#x27;m ashamed of it.</li>
            <li> With much sadness/disappointment a new fact of my life is, I have to do my own highlighting. It will never look like &#x27;Dexter&#x27; did it; but, my need to look professional is not longer a requirement (she says w/slight sigh of regret.).&lt;br /&gt;No caps or foils; but, there is a brush that requires some finesse to use (I ended up using my fingers for the most part; but, practicing w/the brush will give better results, I&#x27;ll bet.)&lt;br /&gt;You can get right to the root and paint wherever you want with varying degrees of lightness. BUT...those test strips are MOST important. Blessed lots of w/thick, curly hair, I was able to cut 6 decent pieces, in varying head locations,  for testing and made notes of the resulting times to achieve the req&#x27;d shades. If you want the varying shades, you&#x27;ll have to &#x27;time&#x27; applications...and keep notes!!  My first try was more brass/red in some areas; but, am not too fanatical/fussy, as I once had to be, so a learning curve is okay w/me. Getting a pack a 3 is a good start at a good price. There&#x27;s also a toll free # to call if you have questions/problems. I didn&#x27;t use it; but, it&#x27;s nice to know they provide help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this for a long time. It&#x27;s my favorite and looks as if a professional has done my hair.</li>
            <li> Turned my dark brown hair bright orange..........</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR 30 YEARS.  IT DOES SUCH A GOOD JOB THAT I NEVER HAVE TO GO TO THE  SALON FOR HAIRPAINTING ANY MORE AS I DO IT MYSELF WITH CLAIROL&#x27;  IT IS SO EASY TO USE AND WITH DOING IT MYSELF I CAN USE AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE AS I LIKE EACH TTIME.  IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Of the different hair painting kits I have used, I find that Clairol Nice &#x27;n Easy Hairpainting Blonde Hair Highlights kit gives me the most natural looking highlights on my medium blonde hair.  I was happy to find this product on amazon.com!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. Hard to find in stores. When you do find it, it is more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using Clairol&#x27;s &amp;#34;Hairpainting&amp;#34; for several years now.  I am a natural strawberry blond already, but through the winter months, I lose most of my blond highlights.  My basic natural color becomes somewhat dull.....So using this &amp;#34;hairpainting&amp;#34; gives me beautiful and natural-looking highlights, as though I have been in the sun all year.  Even my hairdresser remarks on how &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; the blond highlights look.  I only put the cream mixture on areas (or streaks) of hair for about 15 minutes to achieve a natural blond look.  Again, I do not cover all my hair with the product because I want the high-light/low-light look, not an all-over blond. Since I keep my hair rather short and in a layer cut, I have to &amp;#34;hairpaint&amp;#34; every 3 hair cuts. But, that is fine with me !  I am very, very pleased with the Clairol Hairpainting Kit.  It is easy, quick, and at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and great price</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any highlight products in Chile, where we lived for 18 months, so I had my daughter send me the Clairol Nice &#x27;N Easy Hairpainting kit. It was perfect--natural looking and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> For the last 20 years I have gone to upscale salons in the states.  This product delivered salon results at home without the hassle, time and expense of the salon!  Love this lightener!  You can apply on any color of hair and go from a carmel highlights with dark hair to a platinum highlight with light brown or blonde.  Amazed there is a product that gives such great results and the shipper sent this product out immediately!  I received in 2 days!  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> The product is great - I&#x27;ve used it for years to lighten my dark brown hair.  But $80 for 3 is crazy when you can get it at your local drug store for around $14 each.</li>
