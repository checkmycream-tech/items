            <li> I love this product! It is one of the few products that has staying power, with my hair moving, and fluffing out with casual style. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hairspray for more than 25 years.   It is the absolute, best hairspray I have ever found to keep my fine hair in place all day without weighing it down.   It has a very fine mist that you can immediately comb to style without waiting for the spray to completely dry on your hair. You absolutely cannot beat the hold that this hair spray provides for those with fine hair.      At first, I could only buy it through salons. Then, I was able to purchase it at Long&#x27;s Drugs and Rite Aid.  I don&#x27;t have either of those two stores in my immediate neighborhood now, so I will purchase it through Amazon.  It&#x27;s twice the price of the other hairsprays, but you definitely get what you pay for with this one!  It will always be a 5-star favorite with me!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff that&#x27;s all she usese she able to style her hair and its stay all day even when she comes home I can tell it work it&#x27;s not all flat like others  sprays</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It is the perfect finish, turning my very fine limp hair into a \\&quot;do\\&quot; that lasts all day without weighing it down. I lift my hair and spray the shafts for body that lasts and lasts. When I could no longer find the product in the stores I started buying it through Amazon where I can shop for the best price.  I highly recommend this product and Amazon for the best price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> been ordering and using this for years and don&#x27;t intend to change-Thank you for carrying this product.  I will continue to buy it from your site.</li>
            <li> BEST HAIRSPRAY EVER FOR NATURALLY CURLY HAIR!  I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR 20 YEARS AND NOTHING ELSE COMPARES. TOTALLY CONTROLS HUMIDITY.</li>
            <li> Buy this product for my mom, she has used it since likely the 80&#x27;s. She loves it and has tried hundreds of other products. This is the only on e for her. Happy that its availoable on here for her to purchase as its not on the shelves in the stores in our area.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray!!!</li>
            <li> Product did what i wanted. I can recommend this product. Good product. Hair is easy to reset after use. Good product.</li>
            <li> My wife says that this is the best hairspray . The hold is excellent.  We purchased the hairspray to complete a order to get it over the&lt;br /&gt;$35 free shipping even if it was slightly more expensive than we can purchase locally</li>
            <li> Holds firmly , I have really fine hair . Much cheaper than at the salon, my favorite hair spray, and I have used many !!</li>
            <li> My mom is in love with this stuff and i will be making more purchases from you. Packaging was a little over kill, box was huge for the 4 cans  i ordered but i can&#x27;t complain it came in a decent time. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and works like a charm!!! I recommend this and will be purchasing again when I run out. :)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used(and I have tried many), amazing all day hold, even in humidity,natural look.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is the very best for hold and it doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty build up on my hair.  I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and it&#x27;s a waste of money.  I find the aerosol is better than the spray pump.  So, buy this product and you&#x27;ll be happy like me.</li>
            <li> I used this when I was visiting my sister in law in California. She told me she has been using it since high school and it&#x27;s the best. I tried it and fell in love. I have fine thin hair and it&#x27;s not heavy but holds. It doesn&#x27;t leave you with helmet head and it smells good.  How have I missed this all these years! She said it was hard to find and it was. I had to come to Amazon to find it. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Splash for almost 30 years.  It has the best hold.</li>
            <li> I first used this product many years ago, but then unfortunately, my salon no longer had it. I have looked for it for years. I found it here on Amazon (where I can find most any product I am looking for). It keeps my hair in place even on outing to the beach. Granted, that windblown hair is a style a lot of women try to create, but at my age, Neat is in....from morning to night. Thanks to you and your suppliers.</li>
            <li> Finally found a Good hairspray that holds my fine hair without having to use alot.  Price is cheaper than what I was paying at beauty store. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite hair spray years ago, and still is the favorite.  So glad to be able to order online!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this product until I was searching on Amazon and found it.  I wanted an inexpensive but effective hairspray.  After reading the reviews I decided to try it.  I absolutely love this hairspray.  It is inexpensive but effective.  It does not weigh down your hair but has a firm hold and it is very easy to wash out.  I would definitely recommend this hairspray.</li>
            <li> Impressed with this spray, I will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for years with great results.  I used to be able to buy it at Rite-Aid but I haven&#x27;t seen it there in over a year. The only place I can find it is Amazon.  Holds my hair in place all day and doesn&#x27;t look like &amp;#34;helmet head&amp;#34;.  Even works well on rainy or humid days.  No objectionable smell like many other sprays.  Love this stuff!</li>
