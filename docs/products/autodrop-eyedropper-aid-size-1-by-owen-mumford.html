            <li>The hinged tab clips onto eye drop bottle ok, but unless you are totally vertical over your eye, the drop is going to miss.</li>

            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> it works well with a dropper bottle, but not very well with the vials that some of the drops come in.  </li>
            <li> Does not work with small ball bottles prescribed by doctor.</li>
            <li> Bought this after hacing eye surgery and having a hard time putting in the drops, I thought this would help</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this eyedropper and would definitely not recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I chose three because believe it or not it was difficult for my Mom to use.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> No instructions and when the bottle is entered have to try every way except the proper way to get a drop in. No thanks.</li>
            <li> I got this for my aunt who can&#x27;t put drops into her eyes. I&#x27;m not sure that she&#x27;s used it yet, but it came quickly and looks like it will work.</li>
            <li> not as good as i thought it would be, but u may like it. that&#x27;s just my personal opinion. will say my sister uses one and it works for her.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the EYEDROPPER as it met my expectations 100%.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Does not work with small ball bottles prescribed by doctor.</li>
            <li> I gave this item a 5 star because it really help me. was wasting eye drops I would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> my eye brop bottle doesn&#x27;t fin in the holder.  my bottle in larger.</li>
            <li> Great service and product. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Big help, glad I got it!!</li>
            <li> it works well with a dropper bottle, but not very well with the vials that some of the drops come in.  The hole is not small enough for the vials.</li>
            <li> I have glaucoma and have to put drops into my eyes 5 times a day.  Because the drops don&#x27;t always go in with ease, I was looking forward to receiving this product to eliminate the problem.  The truth is--it did not help at all.  I am very disappointed in this eyedropper and would definitely not recommend it.  I&#x27;m stuck with it because it probably costs more to send it back than it is worth.  So, I will take a loss on this one.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s me but I still miss my eye when putting in my drops. I just gave up.</li>
            <li> KIND OF HARD TO USE, BUT DOES WORK ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT!</li>
            <li> My mother had cataract surgery and we hav hadto put drops in 4 times a day and with me working I had to leave work to do it because her arms are arthritic and can&#x27;t raise them she cant put drops in. She now does it on her own and it is no longer and controlling our lives. I love it and mom thanks you.</li>
            <li> It works great, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> HEY BOB ... I CAN SEE THE OCEAN !</li>
            <li> Great helpful product. It was for my husband after having eye surgery.  Since at times I wasn&#x27;t home to assist him, his Dr recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I chose three because believe it or not it was difficult for my Mom to use. I am very pleased with the service. I had a problem with the s&amp;h but this company made it right.</li>
            <li> Design is good but the open hole one is to look through to allow drop to enter eye is hard to see with impaired vision so it&#x27;s not working like we had hoped.  The hinged tab clips onto eye drop bottle ok, but unless you are totally vertical over your eye, the drop is going to miss. No way the lady in the ad picture is getting the drop into her eye at that angle - NO way!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I needed</li>
            <li> Bought this after hacing eye surgery and having a hard time putting in the drops, I thought this would help but it didn\\&quot;t, the drops did not always go in the eye.</li>
