            <li> yes hard to remove w regular face wash but getting smudged easily.</li>
            <li> At least the black is a nice black color, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to wear heavy makeup, so I rarely use oil-based makeup removers, but without it, expect to get a little bit of a residual &amp;#34;smokey eye&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I let the brush dry with some product on it and it stiffed enough to allow me to apply a thin line that dried quickly.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because there weren&#x27;t too many reviews and some were negative</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The brush is small so you might want to get a different one.</li>
            <li> At first I had a difficult time getting a thin line as the brush provided was rather soft.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it likes to stay on even after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t run down like other ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> If applied too thick, it takes time to dry and ends up on my lid.</li>
            <li> + on a little pot of eyeliner</li>
            <li> I use this ryeliner everyday</li>
            <li> it was not cheap.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived broken.</li>
            <li> n forced me to check on constantly and its very annoying if u r out.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for gel eyeliner for a while, I didn&#x27;t want to get an expensive brand since oftentimes</li>
            <li> I even bought the bend eyeliner brush which helps a lot to applie :-(</li>

            <li> Product seems to work well.  Wore it today and it didn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> I really wanted  to like this cream but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me. I even bought the bend eyeliner brush which helps a lot to applie :-( The cream itself goes on smooth, is it waterproof yes hard to remove w regular face wash but getting smudged easily. Leaving marks on top of eyelid as well. Did not survive even two hrs. n forced me to check on constantly and its very annoying if u r out.</li>
            <li> Will not come off.  At least the black is a nice black color, though.</li>
            <li> Good eyeliner. Lasts awhile before reapplying. Reasonable price</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for. So much better than liquid liner. Goes on smooth and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Awesome, smooth and easy to apply . I use this ryeliner everyday</li>
            <li> Exactly what is listed not 100% water proof but gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Good eyeliner - it&#x27;s not toally waterproof (I wore it to a pool party, so maybe I should say it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;CHLORINE PROOF&amp;#34;) - it&#x27;s easy to apply and nice and waxy. I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Great !! Besides the stick !</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to applying with a brush, but stays on with no smearing after hours of wear. Glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> Bought  this eyeliner it was not cheap.  It smeared when trying to put on and then smudged by the end of 8 hours on a humid, hot day it faded on my lids I looked like Rocky Racoon.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner. I used a basic eyeliner brush purchased at Sephora rather than the brush with the kit. The product really lasted on my eyes, was easy to apply and provided even coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good eyeliner. I like how when I put it on it doesn&#x27;t run down like other ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. I give it 4 stars b/c the brush it came w/ was horrible.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner dies not budge! Waterproof and doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li> ommmmgggg best gel liner i&#x27;ve ever had it applies so easily and it doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes and easy to remove</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of gel/clay eyeliners.  I loved urban decay&#x27;s &amp;#34;Inked&amp;#34; liner, and when that was discontinued, I switched over to tarte&#x27;s liner- but I still wasn&#x27;t wild about spending $30+ on a little pot of eyeliner so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.  Definitely worth a go, this stuff is rich, creamy, and wonderfully opaque.  My only complaint is that it likes to stay on even after I wash my face.  I&#x27;m not one to wear heavy makeup, so I rarely use oil-based makeup removers, but without it, expect to get a little bit of a residual &amp;#34;smokey eye&amp;#34; morning after effect if you aren&#x27;t super-thorough about washing it off.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth. Great product!</li>
            <li> I was looking for gel eyeliner for a while, I didn&#x27;t want to get an expensive brand since oftentimes I ended up collecting makeup that i can&#x27;t apply correctly so it&#x27;s a waste of money, I decided purchase this one with a really affordable price based in the before  reviews and I&#x27;m so glad I did, it&#x27;s really easy to get a desire eye line with it , the brush liner which comes with it is absolutely soft and draw a nice, perfect and easy line as a professional, the other point that I love is the waterproof thing... Awesome, it&#x27;s not going to ruin your makeup, even if you are dancing and sweating (believe me! I already tested it), so highly recommended</li>
            <li> good, the brush hardens when the liner gets on it. it isn&#x27;t completely waterproof and it does smear some</li>
            <li> I purchased this from another vender. At first I had a difficult time getting a thin line as the brush provided was rather soft. If applied too thick, it takes time to dry and ends up on my lid. I let the brush dry with some product on it and it stiffed enough to allow me to apply a thin line that dried quickly. Also, the brush shed quite a bit. A better quality brush would help. The product once dried, does not come off easily. I&#x27;m used to soap and water to remove my makeup. Even my Mary Kay markup remover doesn&#x27;t do a great job.  Olive oil works well. If you have oily lids like I do, a primer is a must or it will smear a bit in the lid folds. In all I like it. Glad I gave it a try. The product flows along when applied. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The brush is small so you might want to get a different one. But the eyeliner works well and looks good!</li>
            <li> Product arrived broken. Can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> This is NOT smudgeproof and definitely not waterproof.  I put it on around 7 am and by 9:30 it bled all over my eyes - I looked like a raccoon.  I will not purchase this brand again and I&#x27;m considering returning this.</li>
            <li> Really nice eyeliver will deff repurchase.. Does really last.. Very pigmented...</li>
            <li> Good for what I paid for</li>
            <li> I will not use anything else....this is a great product, tons of staying power....I only wish it came with multiple brushes.</li>
            <li> This is great! Way better than Maybelline. I was skeptical because there weren&#x27;t too many reviews and some were negative but I decided to try it since I dislike maybelline. I LOVE IT!! I have never found an eyeliner that stays on my waterline ALL DAY infact it still looks good the morning after! As for taking it off all I had to use were baby wipes (:</li>
