            <li>Definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I chose the 5-star rating because it was as described and accurate plus a very good product.</li>
            <li>If I was expecting amazing quality and lifetime durability, then I would have given it a 2 star rating.</li>
            <li>When I got it in the mail, it looked as if it were nicely packaged and intact.</li>
            <li>Looks nice, as well.</li>
            <li>I did most of my shopping this year by mail, mostly through Amazon, but some from catalogs, and it was great.</li>

            <li>I love products that are useful and beautiful.</li>

            <li>I need more words....done.</li>
            <li>MOSTLY PLEASED..</li>
            <li>Bought one before, but this is much better because of the mirror that is attached.</li>
            <li>Looks much better in the pic.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the how well made the case is.</li>
            <li>It does an ok job but thought it had three trays not two.</li>
            <li>The case as I received it was priced  $10.00 more in stores.</li>
            <li>and there is still space for more</li>
            <li>She just opens a compact and uses that on top of the case.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think their cases would get better with age</li>
            <li>Wished that it looked more like the one pictured as I was hoping to get for her.</li>

            <li>i love this traincase.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to fit most of my MAC brushes on the top n</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS VERY TRUE TO DESCRIPTION.  </li>
            <li>That is exactly how much I love my own Caboodle Train Case.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest  the product and vender!!!!</li>
            <li>The tiers are great for holding smaller flat palettes and lipsticks or eyeliners, while the large compartment is great for literally everything else.</li>
            <li>I FIND IT TRUE TO PRICE AND DESCRIPTION.  </li>
            <li>My daughter really loves this, like most women she has tons of makeup</li>
            <li>It looks elegant on the counter too; a classic beauty.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the price</li>
            <li>I love love love my caboodle however if I knew that my local Ulta sold the same brand</li>
            <li>Overall it was a nice product.</li>
            <li>Not as big as I would have liked and not the design I thought I was getting inside the case, but it is an overall good product and the shipping was exceedingly fast.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>This caboodle broke right away.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a pretty nice case.</li>
            <li>The compartments dont slide open very easily.</li>
            <li>I was afraid it wasn&#x27;t going to fit my brushes or palettes, but it fits all my makeup perfectly!</li>
            <li>I saw the exact case at a large beauty store (national chain) at over twice the price!  </li>
            <li>However upon receiving the item it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Got this for my granddaughter and filled it with every nail polish i could find she be busy for quite some time.</li>
            <li>filling them is difficult, I have since bought one from sephora and gave this one to my niece as it is perfect for her</li>
            <li>The first one I recived was damaged so the company sent another out that day.</li>
            <li>The only issues my daughter has with it is the trays that lift up are a bit wobbly, and the mirror in the top tray fell off while she was putting her makeup in.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for in a makeup train</li>
            <li>My daughter really liked all the room for makeup, brushes, and other items.  </li>
            <li>Not the most expensive item of its kind, but it meets my needs and has adequate storage space.  </li>
            <li>The locks are nice because you know nobody is messing in your stuff if you live with other people.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice-looking, too.  </li>
            <li>This thing made me realize how much makeup I have.  </li>
            <li>When the trays are all extended, the whole case tips over backwards.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it looked old and used.</li>
            <li>Overall it is not a bad purchase for the price.</li>
            <li>Luckily I just needed something basic to keep my stuff in at home, but I wouldn&#x27;t travel with my makeup in this case.</li>
            <li>Arrived at a decent time.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this case.</li>
            <li>They said is for profesional makeup is not, is to small look nice but is not a for a professional person whit a lot makeup</li>
            <li>I do not recommend anyone buying this product as you will have to purchase a replacement pretty shortly after.</li>
            <li>The bottom is very narrow, I use the top as a jewlery case, and the rest for make-up.</li>
            <li>Its light weight but doesn&#x27;t give that feel of something that will last long.  </li>
            <li>I will get another when this gets too old and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This was a big hit with her, it is very roomy and keeps all the powder products from shattering into dust.  </li>
            <li>Well, I thought it would be cuter, but it is still cute in a way, at least it hold all my stuff</li>
            <li>Cool, shiny black exterior.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this makeup train because I loved the shiny black finish and thought the hard ware was going to be metal, and when it got here I couldn&#x27;t believe how small it was and</li>
            <li>the drawers are so flimsy that they barely bend out correctly so</li>
            <li>The mirror can be glued back on though, and the trays don&#x27;t feel so loose that they will fall out very soon.</li>
            <li>I was able to re-glue it with some industrial strength glue, but overall, I was not very impressed with the quality of this case.</li>
            <li>Hinges were pretty stiff but may work on in time.  </li>

            <li> Hinges were pretty stiff but may work on in time.  </li>
            <li> It has a enclosed tray with a mirror, a flat open tray, and a bottom.</li>
            <li> The case arrived earlier than expected but the mirror had fallen out in transit.</li>
            <li> I do not regret buying this and it will be with me for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Exterior seems to be clued on so be careful when cleaning not to get it soaked.  </li>
            <li> I bought mine in pink</li>
            <li> The one drawback is its a little too small and the larger ones don&#x27;t have the attached fold out mirror!</li>
            <li> Sad, really.</li>
            <li> The pictures are little misleading.</li>
            <li> Second, one of the hinges was broken.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my fiance, but there were a few cosmetic damages to it.</li>
            <li> I save a few dollars getting it from here than going to a retail store to buy it!</li>
            <li> No more draw or bag searching.  </li>
            <li> While it seems durable, it is a little shaky around the hinges, this is not a product you will have for a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in the overall quality of the case.</li>
            <li> The handle seems quite weak.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t that expensive, I don&#x27;t feel ripped off</li>
            <li> Mirror is completely useless.</li>
            <li> However, you should know that using the mirror to put on makeup is impossible, since it is not adjustable.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I wanted this for nail polish,etc. The handle seems quite weak.</li>
            <li> When I got it in the mail, it looked as if it were nicely packaged and intact. I was wrong. First of all, it looked old and used.Second, one of the hinges was broken. I was extremely disappointed. Never again!!!</li>
            <li> When I saw the case being offered on Amazon and saw the picture I thought is was a step smaller than the big case I wanted. However upon receiving the item it was exactly what I wanted. I save a few dollars getting it from here than going to a retail store to buy it! It is worth the price and i recommend the product for anyone!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use makeup often.  So, this is a great addition to my collection of stuff.  Stylish and sleek, and holds lots of my makeup.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present.  My daughter really liked all the room for makeup, brushes, and other items.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Not the most expensive item of its kind, but it meets my needs and has adequate storage space.  Looks nice, as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the big plastic caboodles before, but never one like this. It has a enclosed tray with a mirror, a flat open tray, and a bottom.The bottom is very narrow, I use the top as a jewlery case, and the rest for make-up.</li>
            <li> Not as big as I would have liked and not the design I thought I was getting inside the case, but it is an overall good product and the shipping was exceedingly fast. I would buy from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> I love love love my caboodle however if I knew that my local Ulta sold the same brand then I probably would not have purchased this one online. How ever there was a speedy delivery only thing is its not as sturdy as I would like it to be but it gets the job done! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and I want one for myself now. It is so nice, strong and&lt;br /&gt;spacious inside..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother (it&#x27;s a bit smaller than the Caboodles Ultimate Organizer) and she loves it!  It&#x27;s really nice-looking, too.  I saw the exact case at a large beauty store (national chain) at over twice the price!  I highly recommend this case.</li>
            <li> They said is for profesional makeup is not, is to small look nice but is not a for a professional person whit a lot makeup</li>
            <li> I chose the 5-star rating because it was as described and accurate plus a very good product. Great material and design. I would recommend this product to any female who is looking for a simple but spacious makeup case or even a younger adult/teen.</li>
            <li> Got this for my granddaughter and filled it with every nail polish i could find she be busy for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I can put all my face cleansers, creams, lips, eyes, skin and concealers in it.  It fits it all in one box!  It has helped me organize my items and keep them together.  No more draw or bag searching.  Just open the case and it&#x27;s all there.  I will get another when this gets too old and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this makeup train because I loved the shiny black finish and thought the hard ware was going to be metal, and when it got here I couldn&#x27;t believe how small it was and the drawers are so flimsy that they barely bend out correctly so filling them is difficult, I have since bought one from sephora and gave this one to my niece as it is perfect for her</li>
            <li> Durable, beautiful, has plenty of room for all my stuff. I would definitely recommend getting this one! I need more words....done.</li>
            <li> Great seller, great product!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS VERY TRUE TO DESCRIPTION.  OF COURSE IT NEEDS NOT TO BE THROWN OR NOT TAKEN CARE OF.. VERY NICE LOOKING AND THE MIRROR ALSO.  I FIND IT TRUE TO PRICE AND DESCRIPTION.  MOSTLY PLEASED..</li>
            <li> I have one just like this for about 2 years and it is literally falling apart.  Becuase it wasn&#x27;t that expensive, I don&#x27;t feel ripped off but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is not durable at all. After only two months of use, the brackets that support the shelves and layers stated to loosen and collapse. I do not recommend anyone buying this product as you will have to purchase a replacement pretty shortly after.</li>
            <li> I like it. The price is right. The only thing I wish it had another side and that is what I thought it was, but I like it alot.</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown if not better. I&#x27;m very happy that I got it. Everything fits in and the mirrow is great</li>
            <li> This caboodle broke right away.  The latch doesn&#x27;t lock and the mirror inside broke.  Luckily I just needed something basic to keep my stuff in at home, but I wouldn&#x27;t travel with my makeup in this case.</li>
            <li> Works great for holding make up and hair accessories. Bought one before, but this is much better because of the mirror that is attached.</li>
            <li> Arrived at a decent time.  Wasn&#x27;t as well made as I thought it would be.  Looks much better in the pic.  Exterior seems to be clued on so be careful when cleaning not to get it soaked.  Gave it to my niece as a gift, I didn&#x27;t have time to get an option B.  Its light weight but doesn&#x27;t give that feel of something that will last long.  Hinges were pretty stiff but may work on in time.  My niece has had this over a year with no complaints (or she hasn&#x27;t mentioned them) On the plus side she loved it!</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the how well made the case is.I had seen them at Ulta and I think this one was 30 or 40 dollars.The first one I recived was damaged so the company sent another out that day.They were great to work with. I highly suggest  the product and vender!!!!</li>
            <li> The mirror wasnt even attached to the flap that is supposed to fold up when i received it. The compartments dont slide open very easily.</li>
            <li> I did most of my shopping this year by mail, mostly through Amazon, but some from catalogs, and it was great. No fighting crowds or hunting for parking.  My daughter really loves this, like most women she has tons of makeup and I noticed she was keeping it in ziplock bags.  This was a big hit with her, it is very roomy and keeps all the powder products from shattering into dust.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This thing made me realize how much makeup I have.  It does an ok job but thought it had three trays not two.</li>
            <li> I received my case three days ago. It seems sturdy enough for a makeup case. It&#x27;s not something I would check-in on an airplane, but for carryon travel it might be o.k. I am using it for at home use and it seems good for that purpose. The pictures are little misleading. Mine has no side drawer. Overall it is not a bad purchase for the price. The case as I received it was priced  $10.00 more in stores.</li>
            <li> The case arrived earlier than expected but the mirror had fallen out in transit. I was able to re-glue it with some industrial strength glue, but overall, I was not very impressed with the quality of this case.</li>
            <li> Well, I thought it would be cuter, but it is still cute in a way, at least it hold all my stuff and there is still space for more</li>
            <li> I was afraid it wasn&#x27;t going to fit my brushes or palettes, but it fits all my makeup perfectly! Definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> The case has ample space for the amount of makeup my daughter has. The locks are nice because you know nobody is messing in your stuff if you live with other people. The only issues my daughter has with it is the trays that lift up are a bit wobbly, and the mirror in the top tray fell off while she was putting her makeup in. The mirror can be glued back on though, and the trays don&#x27;t feel so loose that they will fall out very soon. Overall it&#x27;s a pretty nice case.</li>
            <li> I bought this case for my Mom to replace the Caboodles case she&#x27;d been using since the 80&#x27;s. This case is quite nice-looking, IMO. Cool, shiny black exterior. Lots of storage. However, you should know that using the mirror to put on makeup is impossible, since it is not adjustable. It just kind of lays back at an awkward angle. My Mom doesn&#x27;t even use the mirror, in fact. She just opens a compact and uses that on top of the case. Sad, really. I&#x27;d bought it so she could USE the mirror--just like she&#x27;d always used the mirror in her 80&#x27;s Caboodles case. Honestly. You&#x27;d think their cases would get better with age [shrug]. Anyhoo..in sum..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO: Great storage capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[big fat] CON: Mirror is completely useless.</li>
            <li> The case is sturdy and I take it with me when I&#x27;m traveling. It holds my basic essentials and then some. The tiers are great for holding smaller flat palettes and lipsticks or eyeliners, while the large compartment is great for literally everything else.</li>
            <li> The product is great. I bought it for my fiance, but there were a few cosmetic damages to it. Wished that it looked more like the one pictured as I was hoping to get for her. Overall it was a nice product.</li>
            <li> I love this train case . I was able to fit most of my MAC brushes on the top n fill the rest up with the makeup I use often . I bought mine in pink, Im now looking for one in a different color to buy as Christmas gift</li>
            <li> i love this traincase. it. holds. EVERYTHING. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This product arrives as described and on time. I am a little disappointed in the overall quality of the case. While it seems durable, it is a little shaky around the hinges, this is not a product you will have for a lifetime. The reason I am giving it four stars is because it is a &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; type of product. If I was expecting amazing quality and lifetime durability, then I would have given it a 2 star rating. The price of the product fits the quality.</li>
            <li> this case is really big.  will hold anything you would ever want to keep in your makeup case. mirror is nice.</li>
            <li> This case holds everything that I need all in one place and not scattered about the counter like it used to be.  It looks elegant on the counter too; a classic beauty.  I love products that are useful and beautiful. I just ordered another one just like mine to give my Mother-in-law for Mother&#x27; Day. That is exactly how much I love my own Caboodle Train Case.</li>
            <li> The hardware is flimsy.  When the trays are all extended, the whole case tips over backwards.  My last train case for makeup lasted 15 years.  I don&#x27;t see this one making it 6 months.</li>
            <li> The one drawback is its a little too small and the larger ones don&#x27;t have the attached fold out mirror!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great train case -- this is it.  This case holds everything, has a mirror and lots of compartments for organizing.  I love it.  It arrived on time and in great condition.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for in a makeup train case!All my makeup fits into it perfectly! I do not regret buying this and it will be with me for a very long time.</li>
