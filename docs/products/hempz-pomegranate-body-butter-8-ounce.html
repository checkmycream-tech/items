            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The pomegranate is also a nice smell, I was used to using the original mainly so it was a good change :)</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!! :))</li>
            <li>Fabulous pomegranate Herbal Body Butter.  </li>
            <li>Use after showering and wear socks to smooth bottoms of feet and ankles.</li>
            <li>and i found the pomegranate scent to be light and sweet</li>
            <li>After using the original body butter, I tried the Pomegranate and will purchase this one from now on.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, and smells alright, but seems pretty greasy.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great for our dry skin, we use this all over.</li>
            <li>and it makes your skin feel so nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The pomegranate scent is nice &amp; soft; not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It is super rich, but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>For me it does not absorb as quickly as I would like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li>I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, smells nice and smoothes out rough areas.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly, and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>This cream is thick, and have healed up a sore that I&#x27;ve had and it smells so clean and fresh, and I truly love it, and it feels so good.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>I would probably give it three stars, because it is cheaper than many other brands, but I&#x27;m doing two to counter the many other great reviews (which convinced me to buy it.).  </li>
            <li>This is a more lush version of the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This product is great because I use it not just on my hands, but also my neck area, face, &amp; actually the entire body.  </li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s thick but still very easy to spread around.</li>
            <li>Received my first jar as a gift from my sister.  </li>
            <li>I will defintely be buying more of this when my supply runs low.</li>
            <li>I received really fast!</li>
            <li>My favorite and only lotion!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even touch my mouse or keyboard after I put it on; I feel like I have to wipe my hands off first.  </li>
            <li>Super to use on feet at night with light socks until it drys and even your heels will get smooth and rid of that winter roughness in a few days.</li>
            <li>I also use the regular lotion which I also love, however, the body cream is much richer.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret using this, if you need a really good, long lasting lotion.</li>
            <li>At 62 years old, my skin feels soft &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li>I find I&#x27;m not using it much at home because someone gave me a jar of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>i really like hempz products.</li>
            <li>Really soaks into your skin.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for the cold Minnesota weather.</li>
            <li>I just used too much.  </li>
            <li>Thicker and not so much to use</li>
            <li>The original is not as thick and seems more like the lotion.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing, isn&#x27;t too greasy.. but enough to help dry skin through out winter!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and it leaves your skin feeling amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>So happy to have found this Hempz body butter on amazon because it is way too expensive in Ulta or else where.</li>
            <li>I normally use the Hempz non-fragrance body butter.  </li>
            <li>(in a lavender-vanilla scent), and despite the added cost, I prefer its wonderful creamy texture - and its scent, though the scent is fairly heavy and would probably be easy to hate if you&#x27;re not crazy about lavender.</li>
            <li>I have very very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I am allergic to Glycerin, and have to be super careful with lotions.</li>
            <li>Living in Colorado is very very drying, and I usually soak once a day in a hot tub, so that makes me even more dried out.</li>
            <li>I wish I had known and not wasted my money.</li>
            <li>The lotion makes my skin really soft and absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li>Soft, not geasey.  </li>
            <li>Very rich and thick.</li>
            <li>It smells divine and really moisturizes my itchy dry</li>
            <li>It smells great, works wonders on dry skin, and is half the price (at least) of similar products.</li>
            <li>It does wonders for old skin such as mine.  </li>
            <li>This product is not at all expensive and you get a nice quantity for the amount that you pay...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nourishing but doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily like some other butters i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This body butter is really great if you have bad knees/elbows or just dry skin in general.</li>
            <li>I am amazed that my skin looks so much healthier and with less lines on my face.  </li>

            <li> I am amazed that my skin looks so much healthier and with less lines on my face.  </li>
            <li> I. also, put it on my legs because they do get dry especially in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> Especially food for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Especially people with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My legs are not as dry anymore either.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Helps keep dry heel skin away.  </li>
            <li> I even used it on my extraordinarily dry skin after my mastectomy.</li>
            <li> This body butter does the job, doesn&#x27;t have an offensive scent, and is my choice for travel, since it&#x27;s possible to buy it in a jar small enough to satisfy the airport security check - see</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it moisturizes all day long without being too heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li> I will try the other scents as well!</li>
            <li> The cold dry air and the constant hand washing this time of year, means that I use this several times a day.</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy, so I use it at night.</li>
            <li> I would have just purchased the plain body butter.</li>
            <li> This one is thick and soaks in immediately.  </li>
            <li> It is too thick and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was sad when it ran out.</li>

            <li> Wife loves this product...</li>
            <li> This is one of the best body butter I ever used...Love it!!  It is perfect for the cold Minnesota weather. I will definitely buy again! Thank-you!</li>
            <li> I prefer Hempz herbal butter not the pomegranate version. It is too thick and difficult to apply. It does not moisturize well and does not last on my skin . I wish I had known and not wasted my money. I would have just purchased the plain body butter. Well lesson learned. It may work for some people but I did not like it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE Hempz Pomegranate Herbal Body Butter! It smells divine and really moisturizes my itchy dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day!</li>
            <li> Fabulous pomegranate Herbal Body Butter.  This cream is thick, and have healed up a sore that I&#x27;ve had and it smells so clean and fresh, and I truly love it, and it feels so good.  I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product....Received my first jar as a gift from my sister.  I thought I would try it on my face.  At 68, I am  in the market for products that help lines, especially since I lost alot of weight.  This product is amazing. I lavish it on my face after showering and before bedtime...let it soak in.  I am amazed that my skin looks so much healthier and with less lines on my face.  I use it daily.  I. also, put it on my legs because they do get dry especially in the winter months.  My legs are not as dry anymore either.  This product is not at all expensive and you get a nice quantity for the amount that you pay...so, I do not scimp when I put it on.  I will defintely be buying more of this when my supply runs low.</li>
            <li> This is a another go to of my wifes. It smells great. I was so happy when I found this on Amazon</li>
            <li> I love, love this lotion! I received really fast! The lotion makes my skin really soft and absorbs into my skin. I will definitely keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily. It&#x27;s very creamy and it leaves your skin feeling amazingly soft. It&#x27;s the only cream or lotion that I have found to keep me moist.  My skins drinks up moisture.</li>
            <li> This body butter is really great if you have bad knees/elbows or just dry skin in general. It&#x27;s very nourishing but doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily like some other butters i&#x27;ve used. The pomegranate is also a nice smell, I was used to using the original mainly so it was a good change :)</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, and this price can&#x27;t be beat! It is super rich, but absorbs quickly. It smells great, too!</li>
            <li> This smells great but not overly impressed. For me it does not absorb as quickly as I would like. Would I buy it again? Maybe..... unless I find something dreamy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I also use the regular lotion which I also love, however, the body cream is much richer. I have dry skin so this keeps my skin moisturized all day! I will definitely be buying again! I will try the other scents as well!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really awesome.  Feels good on the skin and smells nice.  I am a longtime user and I definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone.  Especially people with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a more lush version of the moisturizer.  I use it on my legs after bathing and shaving.  Helps keep dry heel skin away.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, good price &amp; product is great.</li>
            <li> This body butter has a luxurious feeling, moisturizes your skin yet never feels greasy. I find it to be one of the best lotions out there. My husband likes to use it on his face before shaving. He said it&#x27;s great at softening the beard.</li>
            <li> This is far and away the best hand cream! The cold dry air and the constant hand washing this time of year, means that I use this several times a day.</li>
            <li> great scent and moisture</li>
            <li> love love love this stuff.  I have been using the regular lotion for years until i discovered the body butter.  It is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever!! I am allergic to Glycerin, and have to be super careful with lotions. Most lotions I can use are watery and useless. This is amazing!! I even used it on my extraordinarily dry skin after my mastectomy. This worked amazingly!! I would give this 20 stars if I could! You won&#x27;t regret using this, if you need a really good, long lasting lotion. All the scents are delightful! My favorite and only lotion!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I was sad when it ran out. Will be getting more at some point. Not greasy at all and smells great!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT !!!&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful and it makes your skin feel so nice and soft. Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Texture of the body butter awesome, leaves skin feeling smooth and silky - yet not greasy. Fragrance is also great.</li>
            <li> Love this. My husband and I love the smell.  Great for our dry skin, we use this all over. I use it on my feet and hands and he uses it on his hands and elbows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant and I&#x27;ve been using this body butter since the I found out I was pregnant.  I love how it&#x27;s thick but still very easy to spread around.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Very rich and thick. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This Hempz line is the cat&#x27;s pajamas. It smells great, works wonders on dry skin, and is half the price (at least) of similar products. I  speak from lots and lots of experience and a drawer-full of creams, butters, souffles, serums, infusions, capsules. Save your money and your skin, and I wasn&#x27;t paid to write this:-)</li>
            <li> Soft, not geasey.  I can&#x27;t buy this in my home town but wpold buy from Amazon again.  I love it</li>
            <li> All time favorite body butter. Smells amazing, isn&#x27;t too greasy.. but enough to help dry skin through out winter! So happy to have found this Hempz body butter on amazon because it is way too expensive in Ulta or else where.</li>
            <li> I would probably give it three stars, because it is cheaper than many other brands, but I&#x27;m doing two to counter the many other great reviews (which convinced me to buy it.).  It&#x27;s okay, and smells alright, but seems pretty greasy.  I can&#x27;t even touch my mouse or keyboard after I put it on; I feel like I have to wipe my hands off first.  Maybe I just expect too much.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;okay, I take it back.  I just used too much.  it&#x27;s actually not greasy, and I like it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Love this. Thicker and not so much to use</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like as well as the regular Hempz.  Doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well.  The fragrance is nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> I like the Hempz moisturizers and their great fragrances but this one is the best for winter. Super to use on feet at night with light socks until it drys and even your heels will get smooth and rid of that winter roughness in a few days. A thicker and heavier duty worker than the lotion. Necessity for North Dakota.</li>
            <li> Softens the heals of the foot...apply after your shower</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Add moisture to your hands.</li>
            <li> This is great as a moisturizer after a shower.  Especially food for dry skin.  It is a bit heavy, so I use it at night.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this at a tanning salon and fell in love with it! I use Hemptz tanning extender (purchased on Amazon) for all over moisture and to extend life of tan. The body butter I use for the backs of my ankles, feet, elbows and knees. I love this product, smells nice and smoothes out rough areas. Use after showering and wear socks to smooth bottoms of feet and ankles. Way cheaper here than the salon! Thanks, Amazon!! :))</li>
            <li> I normally use the Hempz non-fragrance body butter.  I decided to venture out &amp; purchase one that is scented.  I got it faster than anticipated &amp; well packaged.  The pomegranate scent is nice &amp; soft; not overpowering.  It smells somewhat like lavender.  Also, the price is excellent for an 8oz jar.  My last purchase was from a beautician who charged me $10.00 for a 2.5oz jar.  Trust me, this is a steal for 8oz.  This product is great because I use it not just on my hands, but also my neck area, face, &amp; actually the entire body.  It does wonders for old skin such as mine.  At 62 years old, my skin feels soft &amp; smooth.  Thank you for offering such a versatile product.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and wonderful.  The texture is definitely &#x27;body body&#x27;.  It soaks in quickly, and is not greasy.  I have very very sensitive skin...it doesn&#x27;t irritate or inflame.  Living in Colorado is very very drying, and I usually soak once a day in a hot tub, so that makes me even more dried out. This keeps my skin in balance.  Highly recommended.</li>
