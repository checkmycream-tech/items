            <li> Well this took a long time to receive, but the main problem is there aren&#x27;t any cut outs for the volume buttons, or the on/off button! No point of complaining or returning since this was only 2 bucks.</li>

            <li> friend loves owl anything she wanted this and loves it</li>
            <li> Cute slim and protective from falls highly recommend</li>
            <li> Came as advertised. Nice case, bought it for my mom she loves it</li>
            <li> its pretty is kind a soft but it doesn&#x27;t protect to much from the front of the phone.</li>
            <li> I ordered a regular 6 case and they sent me a case for a 6Plus. I didn&#x27;t contact the seller, because it took like 3 weeks to get here from China and it was only a couple of dollars so I didn&#x27;t feel like it was worth all the work to get s couple dollars back. The case is super cute though! I really wish that it fit my phone. It&#x27;s silicon and the owl and colors are awesome! I&#x27;m trying to just find someone with the 6Plus to give it to, but haven&#x27;t found anyone yet.</li>
            <li> Adorable and good quality.</li>
