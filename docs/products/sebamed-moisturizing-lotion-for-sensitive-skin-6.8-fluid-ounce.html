    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I got this lotion from Costco when they had the road show, and I&#x27;m so happy I did!</li>
            <li>This lotion is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best lotion in the world</li>
            <li>They are all wonderful products, whether you have a skin condition or not.</li>
            <li>Excellent product!  </li>
            <li>the cleansing bar work best and for the longest time.</li>
            <li>The lotion is a great texture and it goes on wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>This is a great lotion.</li>
            <li>It smells good and feels good going on.</li>
            <li>We were looking for a lotion that was good for people with eczema and psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;d read so many great reviews so had to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Amongst all of Sebamed products, this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Make this FRAGRANCE FREE!!</li>
            <li>I did find a great alternative that is fragrance free</li>
            <li>Yes, kind of.  </li>
            <li>It is really strong like roses, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>which for me was very important , because my husband doesn&#x27;t like my skin to feel to greasy...</li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions before, but never ever finished a bottle, but with this one  I just ordered 2 more bottles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love:).</li>
            <li>This lotion is incredibly light yet nourishes my skin unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!)</li>
            <li>Wish the scent was a bit better though.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My husband was bothered with skin itching and tried many products and this did the trick.  </li>
            <li>Ok, but no miracle.</li>
            <li>The next best was my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation of safflower oil, but it stained clothing.</li>
            <li>Smells overwhelmingly like roses.</li>
            <li>I simply love it, it is great,&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>
            <li>Gold bond and Burt&#x27;s Bees is so much better.</li>
            <li>I love how this lotion goes on easy and does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Amazon does carry these, but the Earth Science website gives you free shipping on orders of $25 or more.</li>
            <li>Found it at a fair price and delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel nice and soft, but it&#x27;s more of an acute effect and doesn&#x27;t over time change the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just a bit strong.</li>
            <li>The smell is so strong, I have been banned from putting it on when anyone is around.</li>
            <li>This one does not have a strong smell at all, which is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a very fair person who grew up playing in the Florida sun long before sunscreen hit the markets.</li>
            <li>It goes on very easy, it absorbs right into your skin</li>
            <li>I also love the smell of this product: clean and light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use especially when your skin is irritated.</li>
            <li>Clarifying face wash, and their fragrance free moisturizer, and their Apricot Nite cream.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using it after shower, the scent smells clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking an old lady overpowering rose scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products from Seba-Med that were great, but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li>It hurt my mildly irritated skin as well.</li>
            <li>It is too much for my skin, I need fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>It was worth the try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absorbed into the skin thoroughly and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily like other body lotions out there; meanwhile the moisture is locked in fairly well</li>
            <li>After reading reviews I thought I made the right purchase .</li>
            <li>Maybe the vendor on Amazon sent me a really old version but the new one I just purchased from the pharmacy is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to order smaller, individual items from Amazon as I need them.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m pregnant I&#x27;m having really itchy skin which breaks out into rashes</li>
            <li>It claims to be for sensitive skin, but the lotion has an unbearably strong fragrance and burns my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian and male, and don&#x27;t care of lotion with good smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy, absorbs instantly &amp; has a clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I used to purchase it from the Middle East when it wasn&#x27;t available here in the USA.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY liquidity.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin but didn&#x27;t help that much either.</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot more aqueous than most lotions I&#x27;ve used, which makes it feel a little less moisturizing after it&#x27;s absorbed</li>
            <li>My skin feels heavenly- smooth, soft, supple and never dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many other lotions, creams, medications, ointments, herbal remedies, oil, etc!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for everyone,  regardless of skin type.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the face and body wash, also.</li>
            <li>For dry, itching skin, over the last 20 years or so, I have tried many things.</li>
            <li>I had to wash it back off my hands/arms right after I applied it.</li>
            <li>just purchased a new bottle</li>
            <li>I live in the desert</li>
            <li>After it&#x27;s absorbed, my skin feels naturally soft like it did when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin which includes perfume.  </li>
            <li>This is the only moisturizer that I consistently find myself using,</li>
            <li>Not a good rose fragrance either.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this lotion has a lot of perfume in it!</li>
            <li>I put it on my arms first to give it a try and had a migraine almost instantly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It take a while for the liquid to dry and get absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>It helped to clear my complexion and keep it that way.</li>
            <li>I whole heartedly agree with the above review so no need to repeat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always searching for the end-all sensitive skin moisturizer to help me out.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to discover that this product, a lotion advertised for sensitive skin, contained fragrance.</li>
            <li>This lotion is completely non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>but I will continue to use this product to restore the natural balance of my skin.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion to the company is to not use quite as much fragrance in the formula.  </li>
            <li>: If you&#x27;ve been looking for a lotion for a sensitive skin, this works well.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes, leaves my skin soft and not greasy like a lot of moisturizing lotions can do.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s rich enough for the drier winter months, but it&#x27;s definitely sufficient otherwise as a regular lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on severely dry areas, and does seem to help.  </li>
            <li>I started using the Sebamed products when Costco carried one of them briefly five or so years ago, and I now find the combination of maintaining hydration and Sebamed&#x27;s lotion, daily use of the cleanser or (particularly for travel)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely different than the old one.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 6 year old daughter whose eczema had recently flared up.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this multiple times (and directly from Amazon, not from other merchants)  - and in one of the deliveries the contents was &#x27;watery&#x27; and shipped without a box (only came with &#x27;ready to ship&#x27; wrapped in plastic).</li>

            <li> Works extremely well for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> You think when making a lotion for sensitive skin, they would also figure out sensitive skinned people usually tend toward allergies which means fragrance allergies too!</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is comparable to what I spent for this item at Costco, when it was sold as a set of 3 with the cleanser and the facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I tried many lotions and suffers from them as they dry out.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> In areas where my skin has been particularly dry, I use this lotion to balance my skins PH</li>
            <li> Heals dry skin and does not flake or irritates skin.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this lotion for my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I have to shake it around just to have it mixed a little</li>
            <li> so it takes a little extra effort for me</li>
            <li> I have to be careful pouring it out of the bottle or</li>
            <li> I wiped it off with a wet towel.</li>
            <li> It moisturized just fine, but it is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if other people are experiencing this</li>
            <li> My order had the &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; texture that other reviews have claimed is a defect.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers about the smell.</li>
            <li> But I wish it was a little thicker and not so watery.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the perfume got on my clothes and was so hard to get rid of!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does not sting or burn at all, rubs in nicely - no greasy residue either.</li>
            <li> It is not a nice fragrance -- it doesn&#x27;t add to the product&#x27;s sensory appeal in any way -- and it is detrimental to my family&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Actually my grandmother would have hated this fragrance, as well.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter, whose skin  becomes broken  and itchy when the weather turns cold.</li>
            <li> It also STINKS.</li>
            <li> It does smell of perfume, but not in an unpleasant way.  </li>
            <li> absolutely hate it.</li>

            <li> I got this lotion from Costco when they had the road show, and I&#x27;m so happy I did! I have tried many lotions before, but never ever finished a bottle, but with this one  I just ordered 2 more bottles and I also got my sisters hooked on it also.It goes on very easy, it absorbs right into your skin and it&#x27;s non greasy at all,which for me was very important , because my husband doesn&#x27;t like my skin to feel to greasy... Yay! I&#x27;m in love:). Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful!  It smells good and feels good going on. It even makes itchiness go away! It&#x27;s great to use especially when your skin is irritated.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using SebaMed Body lotion, on my face since 1989, and can&#x27;t survive without this in my bag when I travel  I used to purchase it from the Middle East when it wasn&#x27;t available here in the USA.    I recommend it to anyone with dry/sensitive face and body problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best lotion in the world</li>
            <li> I saw the rave reviews and decided to purchase a bottle.  Since I&#x27;m pregnant I&#x27;m having really itchy skin which breaks out into rashes easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s the bottle I got or they recently changed their formula but my lotion feels like liquid milk.  I have to shake it around just to have it mixed a little but I feel like I&#x27;m putting milk on my skin.  It&#x27;s VERY liquidity.  I don&#x27;t know if other people are experiencing this but that&#x27;s how my bottle is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It take a while for the liquid to dry and get absorbed into my skin.  Now is it helping with the itchiness?  Yes, kind of.  But I wish it was a little thicker and not so watery.  I have to be careful pouring it out of the bottle or else the liquid just runs everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added 5/25/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased a new bottle and it&#x27;s completely different than the old one.  The lotion is a great texture and it goes on wonderfully.  Maybe the vendor on Amazon sent me a really old version but the new one I just purchased from the pharmacy is amazing.</li>
            <li> I whole heartedly agree with the above review so no need to repeat. I use this along with the bath oil wash and let me tell you, my skin is just as it was when I was a kid. My skin feels heavenly- smooth, soft, supple and never dry.</li>
            <li> I use all the Sebamed products after being introduced to them during a Costco Roadshow. They are all wonderful products, whether you have a skin condition or not. It&#x27;s nice to be able to order smaller, individual items from Amazon as I need them. I hope they continue to carry these products.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I found this.  I used to buy it at CVS until it was discontinued.  This was the only thing that worked for my daughter and her eczema.  Wish the scent was a bit better though.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Highly recommended for everyone,  regardless of skin type. It is ph balanced, soothing and transforms your skin.  Highly recommend the face and body wash, also.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My husband was bothered with skin itching and tried many products and this did the trick.  This is all we use now.</li>
            <li> Ok, but no miracle. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin but didn&#x27;t help that much either. It was worth the try. I&#x27;m always searching for the end-all sensitive skin moisturizer to help me out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 6 year old daughter whose eczema had recently flared up. I&#x27;ve tried SO many other lotions, creams, medications, ointments, herbal remedies, oil, etc! 99% of lotions would sting or burn her when we put them on. I was hesitant to try this because it does contain parabens I believe and parfum. However, I&#x27;d read so many great reviews so had to give it a try. It does not sting or burn at all, rubs in nicely - no greasy residue either. seems to help keep her eczema under control without medication (we also follow a diet, don&#x27;t just rely on a lotion). But anything that keeps her moisturized and doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin is 5 stars to me!</li>
            <li> I am a very fair person who grew up playing in the Florida sun long before sunscreen hit the markets. Sebamed lotion is soothing. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> For dry, itching skin, over the last 20 years or so, I have tried many things. The next best was my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation of safflower oil, but it stained clothing. I started using the Sebamed products when Costco carried one of them briefly five or so years ago, and I now find the combination of maintaining hydration and Sebamed&#x27;s lotion, daily use of the cleanser or (particularly for travel) the cleansing bar work best and for the longest time.</li>
            <li> We were looking for a lotion that was good for people with eczema and psoriasis.  The Sebamed moisturizing lotion has lived up to it&#x27;s advertisement.  Found it at a fair price and delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to discover that this product, a lotion advertised for sensitive skin, contained fragrance. I bought it for my daughter, whose skin  becomes broken  and itchy when the weather turns cold. After a minute or two, she started to cry and begged me to get it off of her. I wiped it off with a wet towel. Then I tried it on myself. It hurt my mildly irritated skin as well. It also STINKS. It is not a nice fragrance -- it doesn&#x27;t add to the product&#x27;s sensory appeal in any way -- and it is detrimental to my family&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is completely non-greasy.  It&#x27;s absorbed into the skin thoroughly and leaves no residue.  After it&#x27;s absorbed, my skin feels naturally soft like it did when I was younger.  In areas where my skin has been particularly dry, I use this lotion to balance my skins PH and then I follow up with a regular moisturizing cream.  I live in the desert so it takes a little extra effort for me but I will continue to use this product to restore the natural balance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well for sensitive skin.  My only suggestion to the company is to not use quite as much fragrance in the formula.  I like the smell, it&#x27;s just a bit strong.</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied with the product. It claims to be for sensitive skin, but the lotion has an unbearably strong fragrance and burns my skin. My order had the &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; texture that other reviews have claimed is a defect. It leaves the skin feeling oily. It moisturized just fine, but it is very uncomfortable. I&#x27;ve used other products from Seba-Med that were great, but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on severely dry areas, and does seem to help.  The smell is so strong, I have been banned from putting it on when anyone is around.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this multiple times (and directly from Amazon, not from other merchants)  - and in one of the deliveries the contents was &#x27;watery&#x27; and shipped without a box (only came with &#x27;ready to ship&#x27; wrapped in plastic). Of the times it did came in a box it was the correct viscosity. This is the only moisturizer that I consistently find myself using,</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is comparable to what I spent for this item at Costco, when it was sold as a set of 3 with the cleanser and the facial moisturizer. It helped to clear my complexion and keep it that way.</li>
            <li> I tried many lotions and suffers from them as they dry out.&lt;br /&gt;Not with this, it seems to keep moisture longer and does not cause skin to flake.</li>
            <li> Amongst all of Sebamed products, this one is my favorite! It&#x27;s not oily like other body lotions out there; meanwhile the moisture is locked in fairly well (~20hrs). I also love the smell of this product: clean and light.</li>
            <li> PROS: Works well for face as well. Heals dry skin and does not flake or irritates skin. Label is a fact, not a sales pitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION: If you&#x27;ve been looking for a lotion for a sensitive skin, this works well. I&#x27;m Asian and male, and don&#x27;t care of lotion with good smell. This one does not have a strong smell at all, which is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by: @CJaysImage on Twitter</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion. Moisturizes, leaves my skin soft and not greasy like a lot of moisturizing lotions can do. Those are all the pros. The big con is, the fragrance. Smells overwhelmingly like roses. Not a good rose fragrance either. I&#x27;m talking an old lady overpowering rose scent. Something your grandma would wear. Actually my grandmother would have hated this fragrance, as well. absolutely hate it. You think when making a lotion for sensitive skin, they would also figure out sensitive skinned people usually tend toward allergies which means fragrance allergies too! Make this FRAGRANCE FREE!!</li>
            <li> I simply love it, it is great,&lt;br /&gt;buy it since it will meet your expectations, and the needs,&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this lotion for my dry winter skin. After reading reviews I thought I made the right purchase . If you have sensitive skin, this lotion has a lot of perfume in it! I put it on my arms first to give it a try and had a migraine almost instantly. The smell of the perfume got on my clothes and was so hard to get rid of!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all! Gold bond and Burt&#x27;s Bees is so much better.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers about the smell. It is really strong like roses, and not in a good way. I had to wash it back off my hands/arms right after I applied it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin which includes perfume.  This has perfume, although in the german spelling of parfum.  It is too much for my skin, I need fragrance free.  So I had to send all of the items of sebamed that I ordered.  I did find a great alternative that is fragrance free which is the Earth Science Clarifying face wash, and their fragrance free moisturizer, and their Apricot Nite cream.  Amazon does carry these, but the Earth Science website gives you free shipping on orders of $25 or more.</li>
            <li> It does smell of perfume, but not in an unpleasant way.  It&#x27;s a lot more aqueous than most lotions I&#x27;ve used, which makes it feel a little less moisturizing after it&#x27;s absorbed/dries.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s rich enough for the drier winter months, but it&#x27;s definitely sufficient otherwise as a regular lotion.  I enjoy using it after shower, the scent smells clean.  My skin does feel nice and soft, but it&#x27;s more of an acute effect and doesn&#x27;t over time change the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> I love how this lotion goes on easy and does not feel greasy. My skin feels so soft and supple.</li>
