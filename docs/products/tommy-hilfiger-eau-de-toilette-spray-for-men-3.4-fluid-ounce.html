            <li>love this....got it for my hubby for xmas</li>
            <li>so pleased they didnt change the scent.  </li>

            <li>Love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Great perfume, a classic TH</li>
            <li>bought the first bottle in 1995 (i think) and loved the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Very good seller, even better price.i might even get me another bottle just to have the extra bottle for this price.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>Since this item is sold by Amazon I was thinking it will be a genuine product</li>
            <li>This cologne is also a relatively light scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm me or my co-workers.</li>
            <li>Packing and bottle was original, but cologne was just an liquid with a bit fragrance.</li>
            <li>Original one which i got it from store stays 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li>This scent only lasts for a couple of hours at best then disappears completely.</li>
            <li>smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>but this is a water-down version, it&#x27;s very diluted, beware!!</li>
            <li>Ordered product shown, but recieved larger bottle of another kind of Tommy.</li>
            <li>Usually have great service.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne, began wearing it back in middle school lol, bringing back the old smell.</li>
            <li>Ok quality, does not stay on long.</li>
            <li>it smells good, but doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this beauty.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend</li>
            <li>way.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible product...don&#x27;t waste your money...buy from a reputable dealer....</li>
            <li>I was able to get it from Amazon for almost half price as what my local Wal-Mart was selling it for!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last for a long time as the original product.</li>
            <li>I stopped buying it at my local Wal-Mart because of how much they had raised the price.  </li>
            <li>Had great experience with Tommy in past and purchased this to replace exhausted supply.</li>
            <li>This product was not as strong smelling as what I have had in the past, it was like it was watered down.</li>
