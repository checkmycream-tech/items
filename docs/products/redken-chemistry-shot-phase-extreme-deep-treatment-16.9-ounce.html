            <li>/&gt;It is important to also note that using this product is step 1 in a 2 step process.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>After you do this initial 3 times treatment, wait to see how many days your hair will look good.  </li>
            <li>and I had to do a moisturizing treatment to get it nice and soft again (which worked just fine).</li>
            <li>I love how smootha dns ilky my hair is, and I love that my salon offers a treatment for 10 dollars</li>
            <li>great product, my hair is less damaged and going much faster com coloring, Plush Hair Buys is fast and fair</li>
            <li>But if you are like me and bleach or dye your hair then this product is a complete hair savior that you will love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never pay that much again!</li>
            <li>My hair went from straw-like texture and a rats nest to smooth, soft, and manageable.</li>
            <li>FIRST STEP OF A TWO STEPS.</li>
            <li>My hair is deep fried thanks to Best Cuts, and Redken Chemistry Shot Phase is definitely helping put moisture back in my hair and keep it there.</li>
            <li>This product is basically pure protein.</li>
            <li>The large amount of protein in this can cause breakage if used too often.</li>
            <li>It is large size and hope he will use it up before expiration date</li>
            <li>THIS IS PURE PROTEIN. 1.</li>
            <li>much cheaper and easier than going to the salon.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>and I can really tell a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Hair health is a balancing act between moisture and protein, if you have to much of either your hair will suffer.</li>
            <li>So after reading the reviews that the stuff in here might not be real, I went to the salon and had a session done.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for people with damaged hair as I saw immediate results!</li>
            <li>I have studied hair chemistry a little, but mostly know what I do about hair from trial and error.</li>
            <li>If you hair is dry and needs moisture then using this product could potentially make your hair even more brittle and prone to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then rinse out cool water and towel dry again and repeat shot phase for another 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind these are professional products not meant for home use.</li>
            <li>This will drive the protein in the the hair shaft especially for real damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>LIKE CLEAR SHOT OR SOFT</li>
            <li>The first time you use this product follow these instructions: after shampooing hair, towel dry then put the shot phase on and leave it for 20 minutes and put a cap on.  </li>
            <li>My middle aged hair was excited about prospect of body, shine, etc.</li>
            <li>My hair is still very course and dry.</li>
            <li>I have used this right before getting my hair highlighted and noticed that there was significantly less damage and hair fall.</li>
            <li>I am 26 years old and dye/bleach my hair numerous times til it&#x27;s close to ruined (won&#x27;t hold any dye anymore</li>
            <li>Now I’m natural and blonde.</li>
            <li>I will stick with the Redken Soft Shot Phase next time.</li>
            <li>usually follow up this treatment with a deep conditioning masque just to make sure I don&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>(Redken has other protein product in their extreme line that has the same ingredients only not as strong.)</li>
            <li>It is real but you need the third step which is the extreme deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>different types can be mixed and I usually mix mine in a little cup or shot glass&lt;br /&gt;-Apply to damp hair- make sure to divide the hair into a couple of sections and spread it evenly onto them</li>

            <li> The Extreme Moisture treatment did not provide the moisture advertised; it is not a &#x27;deep treatment,&#x27; &#x27;fortifier,&#x27; or a &#x27;booster&#x27; for distressed hair.</li>
            <li> It definitely did not live up to the name &#x27;Extreme Moisture.&#x27;</li>
            <li> My dry hair remained...dry...after treatment.</li>
            <li> Towel dry hair&lt;</li>
            <li> but it leaked all over the package it came in so only half of it was there.</li>
            <li> When I told my hairdresser of my disappointment in this product, she claimed that the &#x27;Extreme&#x27; system possesses little  moisture when compared with the All Soft and Smooth Down treatments.</li>

            <li> I use this every other week and leave it on for 10 minutes</li>

            <li> I have used Shot Phase Extreme both alone and in conjunction with Shot Phase Color Extend.</li>
            <li> Left my washed hair limp, heavy, borderline greasy appearing.</li>
            <li> Not worth expense.</li>
            <li> I usually mix two pumps of Color Extend and one pump of Extreme and use twice a month.</li>
            <li> YOU CAN MIX OTHER SHOT PHASES WITH THIS, SO ITS NOT SO HARSH!</li>
            <li> This is soapy and does not work because it made my hair hard and rough.</li>
            <li> Always start with towel dried hair.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what to think about this product.  </li>
            <li> immediately felt hard</li>
            <li> so I thought I would respond to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product or this bottle does not contain the correct product.  </li>
            <li> If it looks bad after 3 days, repeat the process of 3 times for 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> When I received my bottle I was slightly disappointed by the size, but not by the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product, along with the Shot Phase, as an intensive moisturizing treatment. It definitely did not live up to the name &#x27;Extreme Moisture.&#x27; My dry hair remained...dry...after treatment. I even attempted the treatment again, about three days after the initial treatment, and followed this treatment with the moisture mask. I received the same benefits as when I used the moisture mask alone. When I told my hairdresser of my disappointment in this product, she claimed that the &#x27;Extreme&#x27; system possesses little  moisture when compared with the All Soft and Smooth Down treatments. The Extreme Moisture treatment did not provide the moisture advertised; it is not a &#x27;deep treatment,&#x27; &#x27;fortifier,&#x27; or a &#x27;booster&#x27; for distressed hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this treatment a couples times and I love it. I am 26 years old and dye/bleach my hair numerous times til it&#x27;s close to ruined (won&#x27;t hold any dye anymore and it is clearish/gray from having every bit of colored bleached out) then take a break for my hair to recover and then start the dyeing and bleaching all over again. This product does a wonderful job restoring my hair. One thing I would caution people about all of Redken&#x27;s chemistry shot products is to know what your hair needs before you use them. These are very strong products and if you use this protein treatment when your hair doesn&#x27;t need protein then it will become very hard and brittle and will actually cause breaking because it has little flexibility. I overused protein once and when i washed it out my hair immediately felt hard and I had to do a moisturizing treatment to get it nice and soft again (which worked just fine). If protein is what your hair does need then when you use this product it will make your hair softer and stronger. Also it will keep your ends from getting the white tips that happens when your hair breaks off (on darker hair.) And prevent your hair from getting split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you don&#x27;t dye or bleach your hair or seldom use any heat products then this may be too strong for your hair (Redken has other protein product in their extreme line that has the same ingredients only not as strong.) But if you are like me and bleach or dye your hair then this product is a complete hair savior that you will love. I would advise anyone trying this out to explain your hair regiment to your stylist and have them suggest what would be best for your hair. I am not a cosmetologist. I have studied hair chemistry a little, but mostly know what I do about hair from trial and error.</li>
            <li> This works great makes my hair feel healthier each time I use it.</li>
            <li> This is what the salon uses.  I loved the treatments and am thrilled I can now do them at home.  -So much cheaper and easier than going to the salon.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied,made hairs rough and smelled like detergent.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. This is intended to use with Redken Chemistry system 3.5 ( step #2). I used both products and finished it off with Redken Extreme ( used it as hair mask for 5 minutes) left my hair soft and shiny. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I use this every other week and leave it on for 10 minutes and I can really tell a difference in my hair. I love Redken products.</li>
            <li> Too watery...doesn&#x27;t seem to work</li>
            <li> Great product for women&#x27;s hair. They use the same product at the beauty shop and women hair cuttery. My wife loved it.</li>
            <li> Best product ever. I love how smootha dns ilky my hair is, and I love that my salon offers a treatment for 10 dollars and I can just do it at home! This product has already paid for itself numerous times.</li>
            <li> I love al the product of Redken they save my hair from the relaxer and the colors. Now I’m natural and blonde. Everybody ask me about what i did and my answer is this product and all the products Redken. I’m so happy, my hair is shinny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE AS A DEEP CONDITIONER it is also NOT A LEAVE IN. If you are looking for something to moisturize your hair THIS WILL NOT WORK. Hair health is a balancing act between moisture and protein, if you have to much of either your hair will suffer. This product is basically pure protein. Dyeing, bleaching, heat, and over processing can all leave your hair damaged and overly porous. Protein can help to strengthen porous/damaged hair and keep it healthy. This product contains A LOT of protein, if protein is what you hair needs this product will definitely help improve the overall strength and condition of your hair. If you hair is dry and needs moisture then using this product could potentially make your hair even more brittle and prone to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to also note that using this product is step 1 in a 2 step process. All of the Redken Shot Phase products need to be used along with either the Shot Phix 3.5 (for chemically distressed hair) or the Shot Phix 5.5 (for mechanically distressed hair). The Redken Extreme Shot Phase needs to be used with the Shot Phix 3.5. If you do not follow the instructions and do not follow up applying the Shot Phase with the Shot Phix the product will not work as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Shampoo hair thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;2. Towel dry hair&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply 3 pumps of each Shot Phase you would like to use to hair (you can combine up to 3 Shot Phase&#x27;s)&lt;br /&gt;4. Leave on for 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;5. Spray 10 - 15 pumps of the appropriate Shot Phix onto hair (Shot Phix 3.5 for chemically distressed hair or the Shot Phix 5.5 for mechanically distressed hair. The Redken Extreme Shot Phase needs to be used with the Shot Phix 3.5)&lt;br /&gt;6. Rinse hair THOROUGHLY - this product is NOT A LEAVE IN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually follow up this treatment with a deep conditioning masque just to make sure I don&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Shot Phase Extreme both alone and in conjunction with Shot Phase Color Extend. The large amount of protein in this can cause breakage if used too often. I usually mix two pumps of Color Extend and one pump of Extreme and use twice a month. I have used this right before getting my hair highlighted and noticed that there was significantly less damage and hair fall. Keep in mind these are professional products not meant for home use. With that being said, make sure to read all directions and always use with Redken Shot Phix 3.5 or 5.5. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years so here are my instructions:&lt;br /&gt;-Use 3 pumps of Shot Phase- different types can be mixed and I usually mix mine in a little cup or shot glass&lt;br /&gt;-Apply to damp hair- make sure to divide the hair into a couple of sections and spread it evenly onto them&lt;br /&gt;-Leave it in for 5-15 minutes- a shower cap works well for this&lt;br /&gt;-Apply the appropriate Shot Phix (about 10 sprays to cover the hair)&lt;br /&gt;-Rinse&lt;br /&gt;-Apply your own conditioner to hair and rinse</li>
            <li> I used to pay $9 at Best Cuts for these treatments!! I&#x27;ll never pay that much again! My hair is deep fried thanks to Best Cuts, and Redken Chemistry Shot Phase is definitely helping put moisture back in my hair and keep it there. When I received my bottle I was slightly disappointed by the size, but not by the product. My hair went from straw-like texture and a rats nest to smooth, soft, and manageable. I use this in combination with Redken color treatment shampoo and conditioner as well as It&#x27;s A 10.</li>
            <li> Did not know that it was a leave in conditioner that you do not rinse out as it did not indicate this in the details of the product. It also makes my hair look unclean.  I will stick with the Redken Soft Shot Phase next time.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, it doesn&#x27;t do what I was told it would.  My hair is still very course and dry.</li>
            <li> So after reading the reviews that the stuff in here might not be real, I went to the salon and had a session done. It is real but you need the third step which is the extreme deep conditioner. When you add that, this is perfect and will do the best job on your hair.</li>
            <li> great product, my hair is less damaged and going much faster com coloring, Plush Hair Buys is fast and fair</li>
            <li> This product is great even after the first use and when used with Phix Phase 3.5.  Highly recommend for people with damaged hair as I saw immediate results!</li>
            <li> I had my blonde hair dyed black, only to want to go back to blonde.  My stylist recommended this product and it&#x27;s wonderful - helps my naturally curly hair to curl again.  I would recommend to anyone who lightens their hair.</li>
            <li> My Salon Stylist recommended this product to me 7 years ago and I have been using it weekly since.  Great product especially if you color your hair a definite must have product to use.  The first time you use this product follow these instructions: after shampooing hair, towel dry then put the shot phase on and leave it for 20 minutes and put a cap on.  Then rinse out cool water and towel dry again and repeat shot phase for another 20 minutes.  Rinse again and apply the shot phase for the third time for 20 minutes.  This will drive the protein in the the hair shaft especially for real damaged hair.  After you do this initial 3 times treatment, wait to see how many days your hair will look good.  If it looks bad after 3 days, repeat the process of 3 times for 20 minutes.  You will get to the point when you only need a once a week treatment.  Your hair will remain shiny, silky and beautiful!  I will always use this product to keep my hair healthy and looking in top shape.</li>
            <li> The product was great - but it leaked all over the package it came in so only half of it was there.</li>
            <li> I am 45 with straight longish hair touched up with color every several months, no full head of grey, only strands.  My middle aged hair was excited about prospect of body, shine, etc. which I thought I purchased with Redkin Shot Rx.  Nope.  Left my washed hair limp, heavy, borderline greasy appearing. Not returnable after using once.  Not worth expense.</li>
            <li> This is soapy and does not work because it made my hair hard and rough. I am not happy with this product or this bottle does not contain the correct product.  I have had CHEM SHOTS before at beauty salons, and this is definitely not one of them..</li>
            <li> The shot phase is not supposed to be used alone or as a deep conditioner. It is supposed to be used with either the shot phix 3.5 (for chemically distressed hair - bleach, color, relaxers, permed hair) or the shot phix 5.5 (for mechanically distressed hair-heat tools).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t purchased this from this site. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s real or not. I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist so I thought I would respond to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  Just like the treatment in the beauty shop.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it. It seems to do a job. It is large size and hope he will use it up before expiration date</li>
            <li> Works great!!! I love the fact that i can treat my hair at home, Seems to work as well as home as it does in solon</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! FIRST STEP OF A TWO STEPS. MAKE SURE YOU USE A CONDITIONER AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT . THIS IS PURE PROTEIN. 1. USE THIS LEAVE ON 15 MINS. YOU CAN MIX OTHER SHOT PHASES WITH THIS, SO ITS NOT SO HARSH! LIKE CLEAR SHOT OR SOFT SHOT.DO NOT RINSE! AFTER 15 MINS USE THE SECOND STEP. 2.SPRAY ABOUT 15 SPRAYS OF 3.5 IF YOU HAVE CHEMICALLY PROCEEDED HAIR.AND IF NOT CHEMICALLY PROCEED USE 5.5. LEAVE ON 10 MINS AND RINSE. USE A GOOD CONDITIONER AFTER.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think about this product.  I applied three pumps after washing my hair and it lathered like shampoo.  the directions say to leave it on for five minutes, but do not rinse.  What are you supposed to do after the five minutes?  Definitely not the same as my salon treatment.  Will send my questions to Redkin.</li>
            <li> follow with Shot Phix, must be 2 step process.  Always start with towel dried hair.  product does what it says.  Had this done at Salon for $10, saves a lot of time and money doing yourself at home.  I use about every 2 wks</li>
            <li> I get a deep conditioner treatments all the  time.but  this  reminds  me  off  soap.  doesn&#x27;t  smell  our  feel  like  what I  get  at  the  salon.  we  even  compared  wasnt  the  same. I  don&#x27;t  know  what. they  put  in  the  bottle  but  it  wasn&#x27;t  the  product I  purchased.</li>
