            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has no appreciable odor and rinses off well with warm water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It freshens your skin and leaves skin smooth and smelling good.</li>
            <li>The grit is very fine, the consistency is like toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>exfoliating is very important no matter your skin type.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I tend to break out on my face if I don&#x27;t use an appropriate face wash.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great to exfoliate gently and smells divine.</li>
            <li>I love the way this scrub makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>In addition, this scrub doesn&#x27;t wash off easily and leaves residue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used St. Ives products and was looking something on a cheap to help reduce redness.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliation is great because it is not too rough, just perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect that it would do anything special but to my surprise...</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean and it reduces pimples.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face just feels clean and fresh after I wash it with this product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll do the same great job as the other products.</li>
            <li>I notably use it on a washcloth without working it into the wash cloth rather than use my hands, which probably provides a bit more abrasiveness without the extreme abrasiveness of a product like an apricot scrub.</li>

            <li>If you use harsh scrubs and maul at your face, sure, it&#x27;ll do more harm than good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suggest this twice a week before a foam based wash (or your regular one, I like foam washes more).</li>
            <li>I used it at my mom&#x27;s for the first time and had to purchase it after.</li>

            <li>A coworker recommended the St Ives Natural Tea scrub and she swore it really worked for here sensitive skin which most cleansers irritate.</li>
            <li>The exfoliate is like a very fine sand, which is much nicer than the coarse exfoliate in the apricot scrub, it has a lower concentration of salicylic acid than the medicated apricot scrub, which I find very drying, and the fragrance is lighter than many other face washes out there.  </li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s worth noting that I have always had extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Gentle, yet thorough.  </li>
            <li>Most other &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; are just micro sized beads that do absolutely nothing.</li>

            <li>My skin has really improved with my new skincare routine, which includes this scrub every morning.  </li>
            <li>I tried Freeman&#x27;s Black Sugar scrub (no hate to Freeman&#x27;s Beauty products, I ADORE them!)</li>
            <li>My skin is fair and super sensitive (if you even look at me wrong, I&#x27;ll probably break out).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been trying for a while to get my acne under control using only gentle, natural products, but after nearly a year of attempting this and failing, I&#x27;m back on a more traditional skincare regimen.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll burn like a mofo if you do it too early.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve bought two now and my face always feels soft after using it.</li>
            <li>It seems that no matter how much I rinse, those beads remain stuck in my lashes where they inevitably fall out and into my eyes where they cause irritation.</li>

            <li>I was told by numerous people (who did not have or never had acne) to stay clear of scrubs because it could be damaging to your skin if you&#x27;re acne prone (by scraping the swollen skin and spreading the bacteria).</li>

            <li> but it was much too rough for me.</li>
            <li> Or like a regular granulated sugar scrub (just not oily)-- the scrub is enough to actually qualify as an exfoliating wash, but not coarse or rough at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better nor no worse than others in it&#x27;s class, but have been using it a while and does the job.</li>
            <li> I have monthly small breakouts but since using this, my skin is usually clear with an occasional 1 to 2 tiny monsters.</li>
            <li> I only wish the bottles were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> In addition, to using this as a scrub, whenever I feel a pimple coming I place it on the area and the next day it is gone and the area has calmed down.</li>
            <li> Less red, softer, and brighter.</li>
            <li> Because this product has salicylic acid and the green tea extract; it is helpful for pimples and heals them at the same time.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh - just abrasive enough.</li>
            <li> But so is every other product on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only half way through the bottle and already ordering another!!</li>
            <li> When i was a freshman i started getting super bad acne and then decided to walk to walgreens to buy a acne cream</li>
            <li> After every use i rub a little coconut oil on my face tho, just cuz this scrub is a little drying.</li>
            <li> for now, I think I&#x27;ll stick with Body Shop Green Tea products.  </li>
            <li> Never gave me as much trouble as this one.</li>
            <li> Its not as harsh as apricot scrub, i was with it everyday.</li>
            <li> There are very few products that I can use, regardless of the price or guarantees.  </li>
            <li> The exfoliant is very small.  </li>
            <li> I have bad facial reddness, just all around.</li>
            <li> made it worse.  </li>
            <li> im at again and probably worse.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with saint Ives.</li>
            <li> This is very wrong.</li>
            <li> I hate</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product. I didn&#x27;t expect that it would do anything special but to my surprise... IT DID. Because this product has salicylic acid and the green tea extract; it is helpful for pimples and heals them at the same time. In addition, to using this as a scrub, whenever I feel a pimple coming I place it on the area and the next day it is gone and the area has calmed down. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> The grit is very fine, the consistency is like toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no appreciable odor and rinses off well with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use in the shower and like the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for ~10ish years and I&#x27;ve tried everything. My skin is fair and super sensitive (if you even look at me wrong, I&#x27;ll probably break out). I was told by numerous people (who did not have or never had acne) to stay clear of scrubs because it could be damaging to your skin if you&#x27;re acne prone (by scraping the swollen skin and spreading the bacteria). This is very wrong. If you use harsh scrubs and maul at your face, sure, it&#x27;ll do more harm than good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, St. Ives Naturally Clear Green Tea Scrub is the perfect texture to exfoliate acne prone skin-- exfoliating is very important no matter your skin type. I tried Freeman&#x27;s Black Sugar scrub (no hate to Freeman&#x27;s Beauty products, I ADORE them!) but it was much too rough for me. Most other &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; are just micro sized beads that do absolutely nothing. This product invigorates my skin and does not irritate it at all. The texture is grainy and creamy, sort of like &amp;#34;fake sand&amp;#34; if you&#x27;ve ever played with that toy. Or like a regular granulated sugar scrub (just not oily)-- the scrub is enough to actually qualify as an exfoliating wash, but not coarse or rough at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: it is not recommended to use any scrub on a daily basis. Use this only once or twice a week. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed an improvement with my skin. Less red, softer, and brighter. No flakes! It only becomes over drying if it is the *only* wash you use. I suggest this twice a week before a foam based wash (or your regular one, I like foam washes more).</li>
            <li> I have used St. Ives products and was looking something on a cheap to help reduce redness.  Well, I can&#x27;t say it reduced anything but rather made it worse.  My skin felt like it was burned.  In addition, this scrub doesn&#x27;t wash off easily and leaves residue.&lt;br /&gt;So for now, I think I&#x27;ll stick with Body Shop Green Tea products.  Never gave me as much trouble as this one.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this scrub at walmart and my commissary but now, neither of the stores carry it! I hate that.&lt;br /&gt;But I love this product. I have bad facial reddness, just all around. This clears that up in just two uses. I mostly use this everyday because of my skin type, (rather normal but oily more often now.) I never want to run out of this. I think I&#x27;ll continue buying it off amazon! (:&lt;br /&gt;Also! Anyone who has gotten their eyebrows waxed, wait two to three days before using this... It&#x27;ll burn like a mofo if you do it too early.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!!! It leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean and it reduces pimples. I&#x27;m only half way through the bottle and already ordering another!!</li>
            <li> I tend to break out on my face if I don&#x27;t use an appropriate face wash. I have tried numerous different products before trying this one, which I only use on my face. It has the perfect amount of abrasiveness for scrubbing off the oil without damaging my skin. The skin on my face just feels clean and fresh after I wash it with this product. I don&#x27;t have any more problems with breakouts these days. I notably use it on a washcloth without working it into the wash cloth rather than use my hands, which probably provides a bit more abrasiveness without the extreme abrasiveness of a product like an apricot scrub. Wonderful stuff! I only wish the bottles were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several weeks now and I find it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.  And, it&#x27;s worth noting that I have always had extremely sensitive skin.  There are very few products that I can use, regardless of the price or guarantees.  For me to be using this I have to give it four stars.</li>
            <li> I like St. Ives products, have yet to try this one. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll do the same great job as the other products.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Bought it from my local cvs and when I was using it by the second bottle is when I started to really see a lot of clarity in my skin. The exfoliation is great because it is not too rough, just perfect for everyday use. Smells super awesome too!</li>
            <li> I have very sensative dry skin and iv been useing Apricot scrub for years but i switched to this and i buy bottle after bottle. Its not as harsh as apricot scrub, i was with it everyday. After every use i rub a little coconut oil on my face tho, just cuz this scrub is a little drying. But so is every other product on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It freshens your skin and leaves skin smooth and smelling good. Hope you like. You can never go wrong with saint Ives. AND they don&#x27;t test on animals</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used it at my mom&#x27;s for the first time and had to purchase it after. I&#x27;ve bought two now and my face always feels soft after using it. I have monthly small breakouts but since using this, my skin is usually clear with an occasional 1 to 2 tiny monsters. (tiny) I have combination skin and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Not too harsh - just abrasive enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been trying for a while to get my acne under control using only gentle, natural products, but after nearly a year of attempting this and failing, I&#x27;m back on a more traditional skincare regimen.  I think the name of this product is a bit misleading, if you look at the ingredients you&#x27;ll see it isn&#x27;t \\&quot;natural\\&quot; in any way, and I don&#x27;t know how effective the small amounts of plant extracts really are.  But I still like this scrub because it seems to be more gentle on my skin than most of the other scrubs out there.  The exfoliate is like a very fine sand, which is much nicer than the coarse exfoliate in the apricot scrub, it has a lower concentration of salicylic acid than the medicated apricot scrub, which I find very drying, and the fragrance is lighter than many other face washes out there.  My skin has really improved with my new skincare routine, which includes this scrub every morning.  This is no miracle product, but it has helped my skin and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> A coworker recommended the St Ives Natural Tea scrub and she swore it really worked for here sensitive skin which most cleansers irritate.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s not too abrasive but it&#x27;s great to exfoliate gently and smells divine.</li>
            <li> Smells great without being overwhelming.  Gentle, yet thorough.  My face is very oily and builds up dead cells fast.  This takes it all away without drying my face out. The exfoliant is very small.  Also, I&#x27;ve read St. Ives doesn&#x27;t test on animals which is why I bought it in the first place!</li>
            <li> I love the way this scrub makes my skin feel. The smell is heavenly as well. I have a big problem though. I always seem to get the silica beads stuck in my eyelashes. It seems that no matter how much I rinse, those beads remain stuck in my lashes where they inevitably fall out and into my eyes where they cause irritation.</li>
            <li> When i was a freshman i started getting super bad acne and then decided to walk to walgreens to buy a acne cream so i baught this one and went threw 3 bottles after about 2 months i had finally my normal skin back, now im a junior ive been searching everywhere for that one cream that helped me get rid of my acne becouse im at again and probably worse. And BOOM the secound i saw this i tottaly recognized the bottle and have no doubt it will help me again the same way!!!</li>
            <li> This product serves the intended purpose, as described on the labels. It&#x27;s no better nor no worse than others in it&#x27;s class, but have been using it a while and does the job.</li>
