            <li>Good scent, good price - not over powering.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Its one of my favorite colognes, and one that receives good compliments wherever I go.</li>
            <li>Now I have to buy him something that really smells good!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I have been using it for two years, love the smell.</li>
            <li>I was looking for the 1MILLION (wish is my favorite) and a seller told me about this fragrance.</li>
            <li>its sophisticated yet playful.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how nice it smelled and read reviews online in comparison to the famous One Million.</li>
            <li>The difference between both is that 1MILLION is more alcohol on it,  MILLIONAIRE is more smooth fragrance and is high in oil, so it last more time in your body.</li>
            <li>package came quickly with no dents, scratches, or damage.</li>
            <li>Worth buying, recommended.</li>
            <li>This scent is identical to Paco Rabanne&#x27;s Million and is a good substitute for anyone who wants to smell like a million but also save a few dollars.</li>
            <li>And it lasts long,  what more can I ask?</li>
            <li>thanks you</li>
            <li>It really does make you feel like a million bucks.</li>
            <li>Apparently, this has more oil, which will make it last longer and is cheaper!</li>
            <li>there are better products available in Amazon like sun Java .. just lasting for few minutes only</li>
            <li>It works well with your body chemistry...not over powering but not very subtle either, it&#x27;s a nose grabber....</li>
            <li>Next time I will go into a store and try it out first.</li>
            <li>He said it smelled like an old mans cologne.</li>
            <li>Smells ok- not nearly as good as 1 Million in my opinion</li>

            <li> I love it! it&#x27;s a great perfume. The fragrance lasts long, for daily use, parties, meetings! the best? It is a good price !!</li>
            <li> I had a good experience why 100% recommended</li>
            <li> OMG, it was as if my nose hairs were on fire. I bought this for my son. He was complaining he wanted me to buy him cologne. He said it smelled like an old mans cologne. It does not smell expensive. It smells at just the price I paid for it. I went by the reviews.Next time I will go into a store and try it out first. Now I have to buy him something that really smells good! YUK</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT</li>
            <li> there are better products available in Amazon like sun Java .. just lasting for few minutes only</li>
            <li> Good scent, good price - not over powering.  My friend loves I would recommend this product I bought it as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two years, love the smell. And it lasts long,  what more can I ask?</li>
            <li> I was looking for the 1MILLION (wish is my favorite) and a seller told me about this fragrance. I have to say, its great! If you like 1MILLION you have to try MILLIONAIRE. The difference between both is that 1MILLION is more alcohol on it,  MILLIONAIRE is more smooth fragrance and is high in oil, so it last more time in your body.</li>
            <li> This scent is identical to Paco Rabanne&#x27;s Million and is a good substitute for anyone who wants to smell like a million but also save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> Great cologne. Gets the ladies!!!</li>
            <li> I stopped by a cologne shop in CT to try out some colognes and the associate recommended this to me. I was surprised by how nice it smelled and read reviews online in comparison to the famous One Million. Apparently, this has more oil, which will make it last longer and is cheaper! Great scent for a great price.</li>
            <li> Everywhere I go I always get compliments from the ladies on how great I smell :and the fellas want to know what brand? and where to get it?. It works well with your body chemistry...not over powering but not very subtle either, it&#x27;s a nose grabber....and it lasts all day too. If you want a great smelling cologne then millionaire by lomani is the scent for you. its sophisticated yet playful. Will be ordering from this seller again...package came quickly with no dents, scratches, or damage.</li>
            <li> Very good items thanks you</li>
            <li> smells great - just does not last very long at all.  Cannot smell it on someone unless you are extremely close up.</li>
            <li> It really does make you feel like a million bucks. Its one of my favorite colognes, and one that receives good compliments wherever I go. Duration is pretty long and its not condensed type of smell that would make others uncomfortable after a while. Worth buying, recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells ok- not nearly as good as 1 Million in my opinion</li>
