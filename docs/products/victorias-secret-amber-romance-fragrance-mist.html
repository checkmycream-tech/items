            <li>It has a lovely scent for mind, body &amp; soul.</li>
            <li>A long-lasting scent that receives many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I have Burberry Britt that I love too</li>
            <li>It is a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>A couple weeks ago the love of my life went to be with our Lord.</li>
            <li>So yes I am more than pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>The essense its very sweet to smell.</li>
            <li>but if you spray it on your clothing, it lasts a long time and has a very pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>This is my go-to fragrance, not too strong, and very pretty and most importantly, doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze...</li>
            <li>therefore it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>it arrived earlier than it had said which was great.</li>
            <li>great smell wish I could have gotten it back from her.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance, very feminine but not too sweet!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>fishermen and golfers clean the shelves....</li>
            <li>I came to Amazon and found a whole community of people who still had it in stock!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and came in at expected date</li>
            <li>love was always enough).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, sweet, subtle and yet still spicy scent that&#x27;s not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>Since this is much cheaper I spray alittle Burberry and layer it with this.</li>
            <li>I really like this body mist</li>
            <li>this body mist leaves a long lasting fresh scent, I love this product.</li>
            <li>I usually go for a fruity scent or a really bold, strong scent and this is neither.  </li>
            <li>Shipping time was decent as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every VS Garden Collection scent and this is my absolute least favorite.  </li>
            <li>I get more compliments when I wear this then my super expensive designer perfume.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put it on my skin as we shouldn&#x27;t be putting chemicals directly on us</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>and I am 69 yrs old.</li>
            <li>This is very nice, a bit woodsy to me, however, I was disappointed that it was a large spray bottle of body spray, not toilet water or perfume.</li>
            <li>my stupid allergies keep me limited to this pretty much, so good thing I like it.</li>
            <li>It has such a strange smell and it is just too soft for me.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I fell in love with VS &#x27;Secret Garden&#x27; line when I was thirteen and have never loved them any less since.    Amber Romance is seductive but not overpowering. A long-lasting scent that receives many compliments.</li>

            <li> Jack, my soulmate for 41yrs. ordered 2 bottles of Amber Romance a about a month or so ago. A couple weeks ago the love of my life went to be with our Lord. He always tried to give me anything he thought would make me happy(his love was always enough). I really like this body mist and I like when people ask me what perfume are you wearing. To close this was the last gift I received from him. He was 73 yrs. old and I am 69 yrs old. So yes I am more than pleased with the product. Loretta</li>
