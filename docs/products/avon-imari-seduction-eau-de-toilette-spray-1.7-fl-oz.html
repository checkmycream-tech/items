            <li>I really love how this smells, however I wish the scent lasted longer</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite scent, light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Always loved this perfume and I am happy to find it on amazon for way less then what Avon sells it for</li>
            <li>Not a bad buy tho!</li>
            <li>It does smell good, like sweet berry musk, strong when you first spray it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to it</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m perfectly fine with that.</li>
            <li>Smells super lovely.</li>
            <li>I would not be buying again,it was cheap though compared to the Avon site.</li>
            <li>If you like a light scent and want to give something else a try, give this a shot.</li>
            <li>I love to spray it on right before bedtime</li>
            <li>It smells so clean, and I got compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Good smell, moderate lasting power, best use for evenings, upper note is plum, great purchase for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume but it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>It is very tantalizing and sexual.  </li>
            <li>Many Avon perfumes tend to be very linear, however this is not one of them.</li>
            <li>The Imari Seduction shower gel and body lotion are also super.</li>
            <li>Got here super quick.</li>
            <li>Avon does a great job with their perfumes, though they can be heavy.</li>
            <li>Certainly a very strong juice initially, the longevity just isn&#x27;t there with this one.</li>
            <li>You know how natural deoderants stink if your own natural body odors don&#x27;t mix well with it?</li>
            <li>i love the smell, its really nice, but it doesnt last too long ...</li>
            <li>and I like it very much</li>
            <li>Amazon is very reasonably prices</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love it, just wish the scent would last longer</li>
            <li>and I actually don&#x27;t know many people that do like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this one a lot.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, would purchase again.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a very seductive smell</li>
            <li>but this was the perfume that just really stuck to me.  </li>
            <li>I dont particularly care for it</li>
            <li>This scent is very provocative and definitely recommended for evening use.</li>
            <li>* only use, but this was definitely the first one that will ALWAYS be the scent that reminds me of me.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; fragrance with its plum and vanilla accords, the initial spray and dry down are just lovely.</li>
            <li>Imari seduction is a soft, spicy floral fragrance that&#x27;s lighter than its big sister Imari.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last long</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have saved a little empty bottle of it from 5 years ago</li>

            <li> I pick up notes of patchouli, woody musk and some delicate fruit layered throughout.</li>
            <li> At least not on my skin</li>
            <li> It sits close to the skin and therefore could be worn at the office without causing negative reactions from those in close quarters.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly not for everyone</li>
            <li> This product stinks what a waste</li>
            <li> That sounds weird</li>
            <li> The day they stop making this scent is the day i&#x27;ll be a very sad panda.  </li>

            <li> I did not like the smell very strong and over powering.but it is a personal choice.I would not be buying again,it was cheap though compared to the Avon site.</li>
            <li> Great deal and very pretty scent.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.  I get many compliments when I use it.</li>
            <li> Great product and price.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased an avon perfume before, but I took a chance on this fragrance.  I read the descriptions and decided for the price to give it a try.  This is such a beautiful fragrance.  It has the perfect balance between strong and gentle in fragrance.  I love to spray it on right before bedtime so my sheets smell like it!</li>
            <li> Hi! I love this perfume, the price is really good and tell you what? I&#x27;ve worn it 2 times now, outside, it lasted 4 hours, which is perfect for the price. It smells so clean, and I got compliments on it. I would definitely be buying again and I recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Mom and it is just as described, came quickly and was perfect for a CHRISTmas gift....</li>
            <li> My favorite scent, light and refreshing.  Excellent price at amazon.com</li>
            <li> Im lovin this perfume, its truly seducing people! the smell is so so good, i wanna purchase more of this product</li>
            <li> Always loved this perfume and I am happy to find it on amazon for way less then what Avon sells it for</li>
            <li> This scent smelled so good and I like it very much and I will buy from this person again. I will tell my friends</li>
            <li> I oredered the Imari Seduction spray form amazon and it was flawless. The box was in perfect condition , it was not opened , it smelled exactly like it did when I ordered it from Avon , it was SUPER-CHEAP , and it is a must buy , I would definately tell anyone this is the way to go when ordering Imari Seduction . !</li>
            <li> This scent is very provocative and definitely recommended for evening use. It is slightly reminiscent to Mademoiselle. Thing is it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I ordered it per her request . She likes the smell and I suppose thats all that matters. I dont particularly care for it but others seem to like it</li>
            <li> I love this perfume but it doesn&#x27;t take much. I have saved a little empty bottle of it from 5 years ago so I could get it again. Amazon is very reasonably prices so I decided to look on here for it.</li>
            <li> Imari seduction is a soft, spicy floral fragrance that&#x27;s lighter than its big sister Imari. It last a long time, but is not cloying. And a little goes a long way. I sprayed one or two spritzes on my wrists in the morning, and I could smell the fragrance all day. Avon does a great job with their perfumes, though they can be heavy. I really like this one a lot. The Imari Seduction shower gel and body lotion are also super.</li>
            <li> Good price and good smell.  I would purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I cannot stress how lovely this smells. I used to order this from an Avon lady who came into my work and when she quit selling, I turned to Amazon. The price on here is even lower than I was getting them for. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> This product stinks what a waste</li>
            <li> Got here super quick. Smells super lovely.😊💓</li>
            <li> It does smell good, like sweet berry musk, strong when you first spray it but it doesn&#x27;t last long..good perfume for nighttime..going out or something</li>
            <li> i love the smell, its really nice, but it doesnt last too long ... but i will still buy more lol the smell is amazing</li>
            <li> love this fragrance.  It is very tantalizing and sexual.  Will recommend this product . will order some more when i run out.</li>
            <li> Good smell, moderate lasting power, best use for evenings, upper note is plum, great purchase for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I Can&#x27;t Get Enough Of This Perfume!!!!</li>
            <li> Great scent for a cheap price! Wish it would last longer though.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  A friend purchased it as a birthday present for me a couple of years ago and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I like to wear this at night. I love it, just wish the scent would last longer</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance! Many Avon perfumes tend to be very linear, however this is not one of them. Definitely a &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; fragrance with its plum and vanilla accords, the initial spray and dry down are just lovely. I pick up notes of patchouli, woody musk and some delicate fruit layered throughout. Certainly a very strong juice initially, the longevity just isn&#x27;t there with this one. At least not on my skin and I&#x27;m perfectly fine with that. I would recommend Imari Seduction for anyone who likes to wear perfume for themselves and not to intentionally get compliments all day. This is perfect for Fall/Winter and I could see myself wearing this strictly in the evening during Spring and Summer. It sits close to the skin and therefore could be worn at the office without causing negative reactions from those in close quarters. Absolutely lovely!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance. Great price!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really love how this smells, however I wish the scent lasted longer I find myself needing to reapply about every hour. Not a bad buy tho!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. Product was a described on sellers site. I love this perfume. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last long but it&#x27;s a very seductive smell and I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted my own scent for perfume, like everyone else has.  I have a couple now that are something that *I* only use, but this was definitely the first one that will ALWAYS be the scent that reminds me of me.  That sounds weird but this was the perfume that just really stuck to me.  You know how natural deoderants stink if your own natural body odors don&#x27;t mix well with it? But the moment you find one it just flows oh so nicely?  Yeah that&#x27;s what I felt with this perfume.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to it but it&#x27;s still there and noticeable, I feel.  It has a hint of vanilla and  something else I can&#x27;t remember.  I found out about it in one of my girly magazines I used to collect, it said ot try it out for the summer and I fell in love with it.  The day they stop making this scent is the day i&#x27;ll be a very sad panda.  It&#x27;s honestly not for everyone and I actually don&#x27;t know many people that do like it.  Others do like a stronger scent which is totally understandable.  If you like a light scent and want to give something else a try, give this a shot.</li>
