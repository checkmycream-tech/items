            <li>love it and works great</li>
            <li>I have this great glow to my face also which I love.</li>
            <li>My face feels so healthy after using this serum and it looks great too.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li>Refreshing!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>First of all, the shipping and handling was great, no spills!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and we had the most pleasant conversation</li>
            <li>This is a really nice vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs nicely into my face and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky feeling to my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked this quite a bit.</li>
            <li>The product went on nicely and my skin seemed to drink it up.</li>
            <li>It imparts a nice color to the complexion (as it excites circulation for a while) and I do think it helps with skin texture, and even to help stave off breakouts.</li>
            <li>Again, the product is still effective in spite of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Protege Vitamin C-rum for about three weeks now and it is a remarkably effective product for my sun damaged skin.  </li>
            <li>Bummed because there are so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a nice gray drawstring bag.</li>
            <li>I especially love vitamin C for my face, as I live in the desert and get a lot of sun.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very easy.</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter, softer, and more even when using this serum-absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Exfoliate before using it for an amazing tingle and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>A wonderful antiaging product that works well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s easy to get that kind of a result at home</li>
            <li>I just think I look a bit better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK .</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily or greasy all day.</li>
            <li>i will use twice a day i love it</li>
            <li>This serum is just okay, and I don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more liquidy than I was expecting, but I like it nonetheless.</li>
            <li>I enjoy reviewing products that may help my skin, so I was pleased to accept this product for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You dispense it with a dropper which I really love.</li>
            <li>I also love how my face has a citrus smell.</li>
            <li>I think the combination of both these products will improve my skin and keep my skin healthy and nourished.  </li>
            <li>I love this product my skin is glowing and that hasn&#x27;t happened in years.  </li>
            <li>I routinely make my own C Serum at home (many ingredients are available here on Amazon)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a bit more time-consuming than my schedule allows when work demands increase.</li>
            <li>as many contain *</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see an improvement in the skin</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My review is I love the packaging of the product.</li>
            <li>In fact give to a friend to try she said and maybe they will like it more.</li>
            <li>I really love this vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>They really do seem to genuinely care about promoting a good, effective line of truly healthy skin care products to help people.</li>
            <li>I found a great new product that I love and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>I have had no side effects and have experienced a more natural glow in my face.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to look their best!</li>
            <li>Lovely smooth and silky serum.  </li>
            <li>My new addiction - thank you for this amazing product!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it since after listening to two of the top skin</li>
            <li>Glides on easily, non greasy, dries in minutes.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>You dispense it with a dropper, so it&#x27;s easy to use just 4 to 5</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, and I&#x27;ve had no side effects at all -- no redness, no dryness, nothing.</li>
            <li>When you purchase the product it comes with a dropper which makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know specifically what this product is doing because I&#x27;ve used it in conjunction with their other products, but my face looks great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to smooth on your face and neck and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li>I see brightness of my skin, reduction in the appearance of fine lines, and increased softness.  </li>
            <li>Creates a smooth finish to the skin.</li>
            <li>I felt comfortable with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling smooth and silky as well.  </li>
            <li>that you really only need two things for great skin Vit C 20% and Vit A.  </li>
            <li>The Pomegranate seed oil in this serum is just one thing that is different but great about this serum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and bright and youthful.</li>
            <li>and I definitely see ____________(great results).\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling incredibly soft and bright looking.</li>
            <li>I can report, so far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>This serum leaves skin with a very nice tightening, moisturizing feeling, and has a better texture once applied than any other serum I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>thank you for such good product</li>
            <li>, she guaranteed a full refund and told me not to bother with returning the products.</li>
            <li>i am happy with this product and need to get their other products as well.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great serum but can be a bit oily if you use too much.</li>
            <li>it smells like grapefruit which I enjoy very much.</li>
            <li>It does not dry nicely on my face - it feels tacky afterwards.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really comment on the fine lines.</li>
            <li>I really love this product so far.</li>
            <li>I noticed a distinct improvement in the texture of my skin within a week.</li>
            <li>I am trying different ways to effectively use the C-Rum in these areas.</li>
            <li>laugh doctors have commented that I do not look it.  </li>
            <li>and so far I have been enjoying this serum.</li>
            <li>This leaves your skin with a soft, healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Oz has highly recommended applying vitamin c directly on your face for amazing results, because it helps produce collagen.</li>

            <li>Oz has highly recommended applying Vitamin C directly on your face for amazing results, because it produces collagen.</li>
            <li>and i see visible improvement in my face right after one week.</li>
            <li>Progege&#x27;s this serum also has a higher concentration of vitamin C, which I&#x27;m happier with - albeit the higher concentration, doesn&#x27;t sting at all!</li>
            <li>I saw a difference right from the from first use.</li>
            <li>Instantly I noticed my skin was very smooth and had an even tone.</li>
            <li>Thank You so Very Much Katie H Henderson</li>
            <li>It also contains ferulic acid (excellent natural antioxidant and sun protector) and hyaluronic acid (attracts moisture from the air and retains it in the skin) and glycerine, another natural, plant based humectant (also why the product might feel a little tacky on application).  </li>
            <li>My skin is definitely brighter and more even toned.</li>
            <li>after afew uses of this serum my skin glowed also i had never heard of exfoliatining at first (felt kinda weird)my</li>
            <li>4 stars because I&#x27;m only 3 weeks in to using it... who knows what else I&#x27;ll love about it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am 3/4 the way through my first bottle - I use one dropper 1-2 times a day, and decided to store the bottle in the fridge after the first couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it twice every day, pretty generously.</li>
            <li>My face is really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using only for about a month now, mostly at night.</li>
            <li>put it on the back on my hand, rub it all over my face and neck, and then I rub the leftover into the top of my hand.</li>
            <li>Sure enough she called me</li>
            <li>So, indeed this is exactly what I will do.  </li>
            <li>A tiny bit goes a long way so this bottle is a great value.</li>
            <li>got a good result after few weeks.</li>
            <li>There is nothing in it that isn&#x27;t safe to eat, so it is pure nourishment for my formerly abused skin.  </li>
            <li>I would assume that it might last about 6-8 months depending on how much you use and how many time a day you use it.</li>
            <li>i have to say, this is the first thing that not only works but is easy and not time consuming hype..</li>
            <li>Excellent product and much less in price than other products!  </li>
            <li>Am almost out of my first bottle and getting ready to order another one.</li>
            <li>My husband told me I did have a slight glow, one that he had not seen before; that was nice to hear.</li>
            <li>Second, it is easy to apply and use.</li>
            <li>I have added this great serum to my daily routine and already see changes less than a month of use.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  </li>
            <li>It seems to really reduce the redness in my face.</li>
            <li>I also use their eye cream and both work really well together.</li>
            <li>Everything I&#x27;ve read says that it can take up to 6-8 weeks to see real results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see much difference...</li>
            <li>it has no odor at all and really makes you glow.  </li>
            <li>It is very watery, and my skin soaks it up like water.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping by the time the bottle is empty, I&#x27;ll be able to see a difference.</li>
            <li>Everything I&#x27;ve read says that it can take up to 6-8 weeks to see real results.</li>
            <li>Everything I&#x27;ve read says that it can take 6 to 8 weeks to see real results.  </li>
            <li>My face has become much lighter, smoother and even toned since using Protege Vitamin C-rum, with NO adverse reactions.  </li>
            <li>The color is light orange and consistency is similar to orange juice.  </li>
            <li>Stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Even though the product did not work as well for me as maybe for others.the customer service I received was absolutely outstanding and will forever serve as the barometer for how I want to be dealt with by other companies.</li>
            <li>Nice light serum, absorbs in quickly with no sticky residue left behind.</li>
            <li>Certainly makes your face feeling very soft, while reducing pore size.  </li>
            <li>I look better rested and less puffy first thing in the morning, and my fine lines seem less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Can be drying in already prone areas so use a time or two to determine if you should use less C-Rum and more moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I started using Vitamin C on my hands  (4-5/week) because with all the sun exposure they have had, they look older than the rest of me.</li>
            <li>It makes my face smooth and soft but leaving a glow to my face that helps me look younger.</li>
            <li>tried before more expensive products and couldnt be satisfied like this one</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Serum as part of your beauty ritual.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in my dark spots, I have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin&#x27;s overall tone and texture.</li>
            <li>I did add a little  more as the</li>
            <li>This C-rum is loaded with antioxidants and just FEELS natural, which is probably why my skin accepts it and responds so readily.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth all day long.</li>
            <li>, no hassle return nothing just try it for a few more days.</li>
            <li>Gonna buy a few more.</li>
            <li>My skin definitely does not appear as dry, but more supple.</li>
            <li>I noticed when using, it went on nicely, with no overpowering smell, Actually it smells a little like lemon juice.</li>
            <li>During the use of this NEW Serum</li>
            <li>My fine lines are smoother, the dark circles around my eyes are gone and my skin looks and feels tighter than it has in years.</li>
            <li>High quality Vitamin C to keep my skin soft and supple and resist aging as I head towards 40.</li>
            <li>But my skin definitely feels better and looks brighter after only 10 days so I am looking forward to continued improvement and plan on using this daily.</li>
            <li>I am actually considering trying other products from Protege because I have been so pleased with this one.</li>
            <li>It says to use 2 to 4 drops, but I used two at first, that seemed to be enough.</li>
            <li>I use this  serum twice daily on clean skin followed by my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Now, I have seen some very fine lines around my eyes slowly start disappearing.</li>
            <li>It was mild though, did not last very long and was not irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li>The product itself is clear and has an almost mint smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have done reading on the natural benefits from applying this to the face.  </li>
            <li>In all honesty I started with one of their products and found that it worked very well and then purchased another and found the same, so then I bought all of the products made by this company.</li>
            <li>(I use a mortar and pestle to pulverize the crystals), it&#x27;s a bit unusual for a commercial product.</li>
            <li>As a result, I get very shiny in short order.</li>
            <li>After a couple days I noticed my skin getting brighter and healthier look while continuing to feel soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my face glowing, so radiant and soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t refrigerate it for storage, but I do keep in in a cool dark drawer in a closet</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t necessarily noticed wrinkle reduction, but I definitely think this is worth buying a bottle to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe I will find that applying to these areas only once daily will be the answer since it already seems to be having the right result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, but I need to order more soon, since I have started to apply it to my arms, hands and decolette, with noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>serum is not clear, and has a little bit of a smell (more so after it is applied - I can smell it on my face and fingers).</li>
            <li>I love the dropper and subtle scent.</li>
            <li>exactly* the same wording from one review to the next</li>
            <li>so I notice that if I do get a blemish it appears more &#x27;red&#x27; on my skin than usual as it heals, but my face does look brighter, and tighter, than before.</li>
            <li>This serum does a nice job, and worthy of at least four stars, but I suspect some serious fishiness with the reviews here,</li>
            <li>I use it twice daily after washing my face and directly after derma rolling.</li>
            <li>The skin near my mouth and neck actually  seems firmer as well.</li>
            <li>Even using it generously I have barely made a dent in this bottle.</li>
            <li>Living in Florida with the sun always beating down on you can lead to dry skin quite quickly, I think this is helping.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I used to be one of those people who spent as much time as possible on the beach, soaking up the rays, but as a reformed sun junkie, I paid the price with collagen cross linkage and sun spots...</li>
            <li>I have noticed a slight wrinkle reduction but not that much.</li>
            <li>It is not a quick miracle cure( and aren&#x27;t we all looking for that really?</li>

            <li> I have this great glow to my face also which I love.</li>
            <li> My face feels so healthy after using this serum and it looks great too.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li> Refreshing!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> First of all, the shipping and handling was great, no spills!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and we had the most pleasant conversation</li>
            <li> This is a really nice vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs nicely into my face and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky feeling to my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked this quite a bit.</li>
            <li> The product went on nicely and my skin seemed to drink it up.</li>
            <li> It imparts a nice color to the complexion (as it excites circulation for a while) and I do think it helps with skin texture, and even to help stave off breakouts.</li>
            <li> Again, the product is still effective in spite of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Protege Vitamin C-rum for about three weeks now and it is a remarkably effective product for my sun damaged skin.  </li>
            <li> Bummed because there are so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a nice gray drawstring bag.</li>
            <li> I especially love vitamin C for my face, as I live in the desert and get a lot of sun.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very easy.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, softer, and more even when using this serum-absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Exfoliate before using it for an amazing tingle and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> A wonderful antiaging product that works well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s easy to get that kind of a result at home</li>
            <li> I just think I look a bit better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK .</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily or greasy all day.</li>
            <li> i will use twice a day i love it</li>
            <li> This serum is just okay, and I don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more liquidy than I was expecting, but I like it nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I enjoy reviewing products that may help my skin, so I was pleased to accept this product for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You dispense it with a dropper which I really love.</li>
            <li> I also love how my face has a citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I think the combination of both these products will improve my skin and keep my skin healthy and nourished.  </li>
            <li> I love this product my skin is glowing and that hasn&#x27;t happened in years.  </li>
            <li> I routinely make my own C Serum at home (many ingredients are available here on Amazon)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit more time-consuming than my schedule allows when work demands increase.</li>
            <li> as many contain *</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to see an improvement in the skin</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> My review is I love the packaging of the product.</li>
            <li> In fact give to a friend to try she said and maybe they will like it more.</li>
            <li> I really love this vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> They really do seem to genuinely care about promoting a good, effective line of truly healthy skin care products to help people.</li>
            <li> I found a great new product that I love and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I have had no side effects and have experienced a more natural glow in my face.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to look their best!</li>
            <li> Lovely smooth and silky serum.  </li>
            <li> My new addiction - thank you for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it since after listening to two of the top skin</li>
            <li> Glides on easily, non greasy, dries in minutes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> You dispense it with a dropper, so it&#x27;s easy to use just 4 to 5</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, and I&#x27;ve had no side effects at all -- no redness, no dryness, nothing.</li>
            <li> When you purchase the product it comes with a dropper which makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know specifically what this product is doing because I&#x27;ve used it in conjunction with their other products, but my face looks great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to smooth on your face and neck and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I see brightness of my skin, reduction in the appearance of fine lines, and increased softness.  </li>
            <li> Creates a smooth finish to the skin.</li>
            <li> I felt comfortable with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling smooth and silky as well.  </li>
            <li> that you really only need two things for great skin Vit C 20% and Vit A.  </li>
            <li> The Pomegranate seed oil in this serum is just one thing that is different but great about this serum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and bright and youthful.</li>
            <li> and I definitely see ____________(great results).\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling incredibly soft and bright looking.</li>
            <li> I can report, so far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> This serum leaves skin with a very nice tightening, moisturizing feeling, and has a better texture once applied than any other serum I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> thank you for such good product</li>
            <li> , she guaranteed a full refund and told me not to bother with returning the products.</li>
            <li> i am happy with this product and need to get their other products as well.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great serum but can be a bit oily if you use too much.</li>
            <li> it smells like grapefruit which I enjoy very much.</li>
            <li> It does not dry nicely on my face - it feels tacky afterwards.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really comment on the fine lines.</li>
            <li> I really love this product so far.</li>
            <li> I noticed a distinct improvement in the texture of my skin within a week.</li>
            <li> I am trying different ways to effectively use the C-Rum in these areas.</li>
            <li> laugh doctors have commented that I do not look it.  </li>
            <li> and so far I have been enjoying this serum.</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin with a soft, healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Oz has highly recommended applying vitamin c directly on your face for amazing results, because it helps produce collagen.</li>

            <li> Oz has highly recommended applying Vitamin C directly on your face for amazing results, because it produces collagen.</li>
            <li> and i see visible improvement in my face right after one week.</li>
            <li> Progege&#x27;s this serum also has a higher concentration of vitamin C, which I&#x27;m happier with - albeit the higher concentration, doesn&#x27;t sting at all!</li>
            <li> I saw a difference right from the from first use.</li>
            <li> Instantly I noticed my skin was very smooth and had an even tone.</li>
            <li> Thank You so Very Much Katie H Henderson</li>
            <li> It also contains ferulic acid (excellent natural antioxidant and sun protector) and hyaluronic acid (attracts moisture from the air and retains it in the skin) and glycerine, another natural, plant based humectant (also why the product might feel a little tacky on application).  </li>
            <li> My skin is definitely brighter and more even toned.</li>
            <li> after afew uses of this serum my skin glowed also i had never heard of exfoliatining at first (felt kinda weird)my</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I&#x27;m only 3 weeks in to using it... who knows what else I&#x27;ll love about it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am 3/4 the way through my first bottle - I use one dropper 1-2 times a day, and decided to store the bottle in the fridge after the first couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice every day, pretty generously.</li>
            <li> My face is really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using only for about a month now, mostly at night.</li>
            <li> put it on the back on my hand, rub it all over my face and neck, and then I rub the leftover into the top of my hand.</li>
            <li> Sure enough she called me</li>
            <li> So, indeed this is exactly what I will do.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way so this bottle is a great value.</li>
            <li> got a good result after few weeks.</li>
            <li> There is nothing in it that isn&#x27;t safe to eat, so it is pure nourishment for my formerly abused skin.  </li>
            <li> I would assume that it might last about 6-8 months depending on how much you use and how many time a day you use it.</li>
            <li> i have to say, this is the first thing that not only works but is easy and not time consuming hype..</li>
            <li> Excellent product and much less in price than other products!  </li>
            <li> Am almost out of my first bottle and getting ready to order another one.</li>
            <li> My husband told me I did have a slight glow, one that he had not seen before; that was nice to hear.</li>
            <li> Second, it is easy to apply and use.</li>
            <li> I have added this great serum to my daily routine and already see changes less than a month of use.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  </li>
            <li> It seems to really reduce the redness in my face.</li>
            <li> I also use their eye cream and both work really well together.</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve read says that it can take up to 6-8 weeks to see real results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see much difference...</li>
            <li> it has no odor at all and really makes you glow.  </li>
            <li> It is very watery, and my skin soaks it up like water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping by the time the bottle is empty, I&#x27;ll be able to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve read says that it can take up to 6-8 weeks to see real results.</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve read says that it can take 6 to 8 weeks to see real results.  </li>
            <li> My face has become much lighter, smoother and even toned since using Protege Vitamin C-rum, with NO adverse reactions.  </li>
            <li> The color is light orange and consistency is similar to orange juice.  </li>
            <li> Stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Even though the product did not work as well for me as maybe for others.the customer service I received was absolutely outstanding and will forever serve as the barometer for how I want to be dealt with by other companies.</li>
            <li> Nice light serum, absorbs in quickly with no sticky residue left behind.</li>
            <li> Certainly makes your face feeling very soft, while reducing pore size.  </li>
            <li> I look better rested and less puffy first thing in the morning, and my fine lines seem less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Can be drying in already prone areas so use a time or two to determine if you should use less C-Rum and more moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I started using Vitamin C on my hands  (4-5/week) because with all the sun exposure they have had, they look older than the rest of me.</li>
            <li> It makes my face smooth and soft but leaving a glow to my face that helps me look younger.</li>
            <li> tried before more expensive products and couldnt be satisfied like this one</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Serum as part of your beauty ritual.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in my dark spots, I have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin&#x27;s overall tone and texture.</li>
            <li> I did add a little  more as the</li>
            <li> This C-rum is loaded with antioxidants and just FEELS natural, which is probably why my skin accepts it and responds so readily.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth all day long.</li>
            <li> , no hassle return nothing just try it for a few more days.</li>
            <li> Gonna buy a few more.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely does not appear as dry, but more supple.</li>
            <li> I noticed when using, it went on nicely, with no overpowering smell, Actually it smells a little like lemon juice.</li>
            <li> During the use of this NEW Serum</li>
            <li> My fine lines are smoother, the dark circles around my eyes are gone and my skin looks and feels tighter than it has in years.</li>
            <li> High quality Vitamin C to keep my skin soft and supple and resist aging as I head towards 40.</li>
            <li> But my skin definitely feels better and looks brighter after only 10 days so I am looking forward to continued improvement and plan on using this daily.</li>
            <li> I am actually considering trying other products from Protege because I have been so pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> It says to use 2 to 4 drops, but I used two at first, that seemed to be enough.</li>
            <li> I use this  serum twice daily on clean skin followed by my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Now, I have seen some very fine lines around my eyes slowly start disappearing.</li>
            <li> It was mild though, did not last very long and was not irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> The product itself is clear and has an almost mint smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have done reading on the natural benefits from applying this to the face.  </li>
            <li> In all honesty I started with one of their products and found that it worked very well and then purchased another and found the same, so then I bought all of the products made by this company.</li>
            <li> (I use a mortar and pestle to pulverize the crystals), it&#x27;s a bit unusual for a commercial product.</li>
            <li> As a result, I get very shiny in short order.</li>
            <li> After a couple days I noticed my skin getting brighter and healthier look while continuing to feel soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my face glowing, so radiant and soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t refrigerate it for storage, but I do keep in in a cool dark drawer in a closet</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t necessarily noticed wrinkle reduction, but I definitely think this is worth buying a bottle to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe I will find that applying to these areas only once daily will be the answer since it already seems to be having the right result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but I need to order more soon, since I have started to apply it to my arms, hands and decolette, with noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> serum is not clear, and has a little bit of a smell (more so after it is applied - I can smell it on my face and fingers).</li>
            <li> I love the dropper and subtle scent.</li>
            <li> exactly* the same wording from one review to the next</li>
            <li> so I notice that if I do get a blemish it appears more &#x27;red&#x27; on my skin than usual as it heals, but my face does look brighter, and tighter, than before.</li>
            <li> This serum does a nice job, and worthy of at least four stars, but I suspect some serious fishiness with the reviews here,</li>
            <li> I use it twice daily after washing my face and directly after derma rolling.</li>
            <li> The skin near my mouth and neck actually  seems firmer as well.</li>
            <li> Even using it generously I have barely made a dent in this bottle.</li>
            <li> Living in Florida with the sun always beating down on you can lead to dry skin quite quickly, I think this is helping.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I used to be one of those people who spent as much time as possible on the beach, soaking up the rays, but as a reformed sun junkie, I paid the price with collagen cross linkage and sun spots...</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight wrinkle reduction but not that much.</li>
            <li> It is not a quick miracle cure( and aren&#x27;t we all looking for that really?</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to help diminish dark spots on my face, but so far it has not helped.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t LOVE the scent (it seems not highly scented, but faintly metallic)</li>
            <li> I use vitamin c regularly for dry, aging skin.</li>
            <li> I like less is that there is a very slight waxy after-effect--some of which seems inevitable with Vitamin C in higher concentrates, but I tend to think the hyaluronic acid is also contributing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it once or twice every day, pretty generously, and there is not much of a dent made in this small bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a very clear serum with no fragrance or harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for several weeks and have not really noticed any difference at this point.</li>
            <li> in comparison to other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this serum and the OZ Naturals vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> Too greasy compared to same product from other manufactures.</li>
            <li> I only noticed it when I was looking very carefully.</li>
            <li> but where I tend to be dry</li>
            <li> , I do tend to breakout in my dry areas when they get too dry.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it that long but have noticed slight improvements already in overall skin tone and am eager to see results after extended use.</li>
            <li> I apply about 5 to 6 drops and still have about half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> The only way I can manage it is to use about a half dropperful.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days</li>
            <li> Benefits I have seen are tone, firmness, on my face and hands with only a few drops.  </li>
            <li> That is not a very stable vitamin C...</li>
            <li> I had tried several vitamin C products in the distant past, then gave up on them because my very sensitive skin reacted negatively to added ingredients.  </li>
            <li> better than my previous stinging serum with unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Does anyone have any ideas other than using wet hands or other dilution methods?</li>
            <li> This is ascorbic acid, not some derivative thereof that other brands use.  </li>
            <li> I will also be trying out some of their other products.</li>
            <li> i have literally tried everything coming down the pike...</li>
            <li> Vitamin C helps to keep the damage down.  </li>
            <li> My face is smoother and some of the wrinkles are getting less visible.</li>
            <li> am 43, Caucasian, no fine lines or wrinkles but some slight creping under my eyes</li>
            <li> It does tingle a little bit after application.</li>
            <li> , just takes a little bit, and my face is soothed and smoothed.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling moisturized yet tight and firm.</li>
            <li> and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky nor stiff.</li>
            <li> I relayed I was not very happy</li>
            <li> or I get seriously reflective by the afternoon.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I look younger each and every day. Thanks</li>
            <li> I see a difference (about 2 weeks in).  I look better rested and less puffy first thing in the morning, and my fine lines seem less noticeable.  I just think I look a bit better.  I don&#x27;t LOVE the scent (it seems not highly scented, but faintly metallic) but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  I really love this product so far.</li>
            <li> i am using this serum about two weeks and i see visible improvement in my face right after one week. My friends also notice that. i am happy with this product and need to get their other products as well.&lt;br /&gt;thanks Protege</li>
            <li> i have literally tried everything coming down the pike...i have to say, this is the first thing that not only works but is easy and not time consuming hype..this is my second bottle... great price too.</li>
            <li> I started using Vitamin C on my hands  (4-5/week) because with all the sun exposure they have had, they look older than the rest of me. (Sunscreen people!) I noticed a distinct improvement in the texture of my skin within a week. Because of this, I started using it on my face once a week, same thing. I have been very happy. I don&#x27;t refrigerate it for storage, but I do keep in in a cool dark drawer in a closet and it seems to be keeping well.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice vitamin c serum. It makes my face smooth and soft but leaving a glow to my face that helps me look younger. The serum absorbs nicely into my face and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky feeling to my face. It leaves my face feeling moisturized yet tight and firm. I received this to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
            <li> This is suppose to be an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; it&#x27;s basically water and leaves my skin sticky. Not like serum is suppose to act.</li>
            <li> This is a WONDERFUL product! I have tried every thing in the market and nothing works. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to look their best! Best of all it is fragrance free. you can apply it anywhere on your face and don&#x27;t worry about  a thing. Am almost out of my first bottle and getting ready to order another one. Its the best of the best and for that price and free shipping? nothing can be compared to it. Keep up the good work Protege</li>
            <li> Excellent product and much less in price than other products!  Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Great serum! Creates a smooth finish to the skin. It seems to really reduce the redness in my face. I have only used it for a few days so I can&#x27;t really comment on the fine lines. This serum is replacing my Prevage MD. I will definitely continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK . just started using it so can&#x27;t tell as yet. Too soon to see any results</li>
            <li> Another great product from Protege! Glides on easily, non greasy, dries in minutes. I do apply a day cream just to ensure SPF coverage.</li>
            <li> love it and works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using your. Vitamin C-RUM for about 10 days now. After years of abusing my skin I did not expect immediate results and have not seen any improvement on my wrinkles. But my skin definitely feels better and looks brighter after only 10 days so I am looking forward to continued improvement and plan on using this daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for several weeks and have not really noticed any difference at this point.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this Vitamin C Serum! I use vitamin c regularly for dry, aging skin. It has alot of benifits! Vitamin C is probably the best product you can use for your skin but alot of them are sticky or gooey. This Vitamin C serum has a wonderful silky texture. It&#x27;s easy to smooth on your face and neck and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. This is a very clear serum with no fragrance or harsh chemicals. It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth all day long. I use it twice daily after washing my face and directly after derma rolling. My fine lines are smoother, the dark circles around my eyes are gone and my skin looks and feels tighter than it has in years. I am so very happy to have recieved this product for my review. I found a great new product that I love and will continue to buy. I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily or greasy all day. My skin is definitely brighter and more even toned.</li>
            <li> i have t save vitamin c has chaged my life i ave herd of it berore but never used it.I ave extreamly drie skin on my face frohead andn kneck area after afew uses of this serum my skin glowed also i had never heard of exfoliatining at first (felt kinda weird)my skin care out feelngsuper sauce this is definalty i will use twice a day i love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum now for three weeks. I am very impressed with the increased brightness and smoothness of the skin on my face and neck. The skin near my mouth and neck actually  seems firmer as well. I use this  serum twice daily on clean skin followed by my regular moisturizer. I am actually considering trying other products from Protege because I have been so pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> After using another brand for a while I was contacted by Protege to try their C-Rum. I find that my skin is smoother, calmer, tighter since switching to this product. I use it around my eyes as well as over my entire face, neck and chest. I also use their eye cream and both work really well together. 4 stars because I&#x27;m only 3 weeks in to using it... who knows what else I&#x27;ll love about it. Exfoliate before using it for an amazing tingle and refreshing scent. Can be drying in already prone areas so use a time or two to determine if you should use less C-Rum and more moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Love the citrus scent, to me it smells like grapefruit which I enjoy very much. I&#x27;m going through an adjustment period with this because I have combination skin so where I have oily skin is smoother than it&#x27;s been since I was a teen but where I tend to be dry it&#x27;s still a balancing act. I am trying different ways to effectively use the C-Rum in these areas. I believe I will find that applying to these areas only once daily will be the answer since it already seems to be having the right result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 43, Caucasian, no fine lines or wrinkles but some slight creping under my eyes and I have medium-fair skin. I tend to breakout hormonally but do not have acne as a norm. Combo skin with &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone oily skin with dryness at the jaw line, I do tend to breakout in my dry areas when they get too dry.</li>
            <li> This serum is just okay, and I don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 3/4 the way through my first bottle - I use one dropper 1-2 times a day, and decided to store the bottle in the fridge after the first couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is not clear, and has a little bit of a smell (more so after it is applied - I can smell it on my face and fingers). It does tingle a little bit after application. It was mild though, did not last very long and was not irritating to my skin. It does not dry nicely on my face - it feels tacky afterwards. Trying to apply makeup over this (even an hour later) does not bode well. Also, I have not noticed any changes in my skin tone/texture etc. in comparison to other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this serum and the OZ Naturals vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked this quite a bit. It&#x27;s more liquidy than I was expecting, but I like it nonetheless. If you&#x27;re looking for something with a thicker, oil-like consistency, this is probably not the product for you.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I used in my face every day and is great my skin feel softer and bright thank you for such good product&lt;br /&gt;Exelente producto  para la cara te la deja tersa</li>
            <li> I am ever so thankful I tried Protégé 20% Vitamin C Serum for your face.  I have done reading on the natural benefits from applying this to the face.  Benefits I have seen are tone, firmness, on my face and hands with only a few drops.  I have had no side effects and have experienced a more natural glow in my face.  Thank you Protégé for great product.</li>
            <li> I have to say at the age I am now I enjoy reviewing products that may help my skin, so I was pleased to accept this product for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now, before I started using this product I had been using another that seemed to be helping. However, I stopped for a week before starting  this product. I noticed when using, it went on nicely, with no overpowering smell, Actually it smells a little like lemon juice. Refreshing! There was no stinging, or allergic reactions, which is always something I look for. I was happy about that.  It says to use 2 to 4 drops, but I used two at first, that seemed to be enough. I did add a little  more as the I felt comfortable with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The product went on nicely and my skin seemed to drink it up. The bottle said that it helps to put on the companies Daily Defense Cream, but I didn&#x27;t have any, so of course I didn&#x27;t.  I continued on using the product for several weeks. Did it help?  Actually it is helping. My skin definitely does not appear as dry, but more supple. Living in Florida with the sun always beating down on you can lead to dry skin quite quickly, I think this is helping.  My husband told me I did have a slight glow, one that he had not seen before; that was nice to hear. I can report, so far, so good. A product that works. I like it. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Got Cyst like Acne Bumps back on my Face!!! Horrible Ladies with Cyst or Acne prone Skin Please avoid this Serum. I used it twice for a week and within this time I started to get Cyst like bumps on my face. During the use of this NEW Serum I did not change my diet or my Cleanser. Only this Serum was the change. Even on my face after applying I felt irritation and itching like feeling.</li>
            <li> better than my previous stinging serum with unpleasant scent. Progege&#x27;s this serum also has a higher concentration of vitamin C, which I&#x27;m happier with - albeit the higher concentration, doesn&#x27;t sting at all! and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky nor stiff.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to help diminish dark spots on my face, but so far it has not helped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice every day, pretty generously. Even using it generously I have barely made a dent in this bottle. I would assume that it might last about 6-8 months depending on how much you use and how many time a day you use it. You dispense it with a dropper which I really love. I use about 5 drops in the morning and 5 drops in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the dropper and put the drops in my palm and rub it all over my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is a thin liquid with a citrus scent. It goes on very easy. There was no redness, dryness, or stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr.Oz has highly recommended applying vitamin c directly on your face for amazing results, because it helps produce collagen. Everything I&#x27;ve read says that it can take up to 6-8 weeks to see real results. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and I definitely notice an increase in firmness and tone. My face is really soft and smooth. I have this great glow to my face also which I love. I also love how my face has a citrus smell. I have noticed a slight wrinkle reduction but not that much. I&#x27;m still using the product to see if it will help reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see much difference... Of course I am 79...,don&#x27;t laugh doctors have commented that I do not look it.  My daughter who is 50 loves it...I have tried Much more expensive creams but like this...</li>
            <li> Lovely smooth and silky serum.  It leaves my face feeling smooth and silky as well.  I especially love vitamin C for my face, as I live in the desert and get a lot of sun.  Vitamin C helps to keep the damage down.  This serum is just superb.  Easy to use, just takes a little bit, and my face is soothed and smoothed.  Good product!  You should get some!</li>
            <li> I have only been using Vitamin C-RUM since August 30th and I do think I will continue using it.  I see brightness of my skin, reduction in the appearance of fine lines, and increased softness.  I use this product in the morning under my makeup and the Protégé Collage at bedtime.  I think the combination of both these products will improve my skin and keep my skin healthy and nourished.  Thank you Protégé for giving us good quality products at a price we can afford.</li>
            <li> My package of Vit C arrived in great condition.  I was excited to try it since after listening to two of the top skin Doctors in NY that you really only need two things for great skin Vit C 20% and Vit A.  I love this product my skin is glowing and that hasn&#x27;t happened in years.  A Friend asked why my skin looked so great so I had to share and she has now ordered the Vit C.  Don&#x27;t worry about the smell of the Vit C since as soon as it hits your skin it has no odor at all and really makes you glow.  Love the Protege line!!!</li>
            <li> The Pomegranate seed oil in this serum is just one thing that is different but great about this serum. My face feels so healthy after using this serum and it looks great too. My skin is brighter, softer, and more even when using this serum-absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> High quality Vitamin C to keep my skin soft and supple and resist aging as I head towards 40. I love the dropper and subtle scent. I have added this great serum to my daily routine and already see changes less than a month of use. A wonderful antiaging product that works well for my sensitive skin.I highly recommend this Serum as part of your beauty ritual.</li>
            <li> In all honesty I started with one of their products and found that it worked very well and then purchased another and found the same, so then I bought all of the products made by this company. I honestly don&#x27;t know specifically what this product is doing because I&#x27;ve used it in conjunction with their other products, but my face looks great. It&#x27;s clear and bright and youthful.</li>
            <li> My new addiction - thank you for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve religiously used this product now for two weeks.  I&#x27;ve used 1/3 of the bottle, and I haven&#x27;t seen any changes at all.  It is very watery, and my skin soaks it up like water.  I&#x27;m hoping by the time the bottle is empty, I&#x27;ll be able to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. Stings a bit when I apply, so I believe it to be concentrated. I&#x27;ve been using only for about a month now, mostly at night. It seems to help with tone. I apply about 5 to 6 drops and still have about half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> I routinely make my own C Serum at home (many ingredients are available here on Amazon) but it&#x27;s a bit more time-consuming than my schedule allows when work demands increase. This serum does a nice job, and worthy of at least four stars, but I suspect some serious fishiness with the reviews here, as many contain *exactly* the same wording from one review to the next (look for this paragraph):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------&lt;br /&gt;Dr.Oz has highly recommended applying vitamin c directly on your face for amazing results, because it produces collagen. Everything I&#x27;ve read says that it can take up to 6-8 weeks to see real results. I&#x27;ve been using it for ________ (time span) and I definitely see ____________(great results).\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it definitely produces the same temporary glowing effect I get from whipping up a batch of L-Ascorbic Acid, glycerin and hyaluronic acid in a brown bottle at home. It imparts a nice color to the complexion (as it excites circulation for a while) and I do think it helps with skin texture, and even to help stave off breakouts. The emulsion itself is not well integrated--you&#x27;ll need to shake it to disperse the powdered Vitamin C, which collects at the bottom. While it&#x27;s easy to get that kind of a result at home (I use a mortar and pestle to pulverize the crystals), it&#x27;s a bit unusual for a commercial product. Again, the product is still effective in spite of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like less is that there is a very slight waxy after-effect--some of which seems inevitable with Vitamin C in higher concentrates, but I tend to think the hyaluronic acid is also contributing. As a result, I get very shiny in short order. If I want to use this serum before going out into the day, I need to wear a mineral powder makeup afterwards (with repeat applications) or I get seriously reflective by the afternoon.</li>
            <li> It works, It took 2 weeks for me to start seeing results, but my skin is brighter, smoother..</li>
            <li> This is a good serum. I&#x27;m sure will purchase it again. I love it</li>
            <li> I was sent a bottle of this for review, but my opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Oz has highly recommended applying Vitamin C directly on your face for amazing results, because it produces collagen. Everything I&#x27;ve read says that it can take 6 to 8 weeks to see real results.  I&#x27;ve been been using it for almost 3 weeks, and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed an increase in tone and firmness. I haven&#x27;t necessarily noticed wrinkle reduction, but I definitely think this is worth buying a bottle to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it once or twice every day, pretty generously, and there is not much of a dent made in this small bottle. I&#x27;d assume that this is maybe a 6 month supply. You dispense it with a dropper, so it&#x27;s easy to use just 4 to 5 drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on the back on my hand, rub it all over my face and neck, and then I rub the leftover into the top of my hand. I don&#x27;t know about you, but my hands are one place I notice my age setting in now that I&#x27;m into my 40&#x27;s. I&#x27;d love to see an improvement in the skin there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is a thin liquid with a citrusy scent. It goes on easily, and I&#x27;ve had no side effects at all -- no redness, no dryness, nothing.</li>
            <li> I have been using Protege Vitamin C-rum for about three weeks now and it is a remarkably effective product for my sun damaged skin.  Yes, I used to be one of those people who spent as much time as possible on the beach, soaking up the rays, but as a reformed sun junkie, I paid the price with collagen cross linkage and sun spots...yuck!  I had tried several vitamin C products in the distant past, then gave up on them because my very sensitive skin reacted negatively to added ingredients.  Recently, I decided to give vitamin C serum another try and this time I found the winner!  My face has become much lighter, smoother and even toned since using Protege Vitamin C-rum, with NO adverse reactions.  A little goes a long way, but I need to order more soon, since I have started to apply it to my arms, hands and decolette, with noticeable results.  This is ascorbic acid, not some derivative thereof that other brands use.  I keep mine in the refrigerator, to prevent oxidation.  The color is light orange and consistency is similar to orange juice.  It also contains ferulic acid (excellent natural antioxidant and sun protector) and hyaluronic acid (attracts moisture from the air and retains it in the skin) and glycerine, another natural, plant based humectant (also why the product might feel a little tacky on application).  This C-rum is loaded with antioxidants and just FEELS natural, which is probably why my skin accepts it and responds so readily.  There is nothing in it that isn&#x27;t safe to eat, so it is pure nourishment for my formerly abused skin.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about a week and so far I have been enjoying this serum. First of all, the shipping and handling was great, no spills! Second, it is easy to apply and use. When you purchase the product it comes with a dropper which makes it easy to apply. Third, after only a week of use I have noticed changes. Instantly I noticed my skin was very smooth and had an even tone. After a couple days I noticed my skin getting brighter and healthier look while continuing to feel soft. Now, I have seen some very fine lines around my eyes slowly start disappearing. However, this is not &amp;#34;a lot&amp;#34; of a difference. I only noticed it when I was looking very carefully. Overall, this is a great serum but can be a bit oily if you use too much.</li>
            <li> Would not purchase this item again.  Too greasy compared to same product from other manufactures.</li>
            <li> Initially Cloudy white, then oxidized to yellow in one week. That is not a very stable vitamin C... Good moisture: but that&#x27;s not why you buy antioxidant serums, so kind of disappointing. Bummed because there are so many good reviews.  Maybe I just got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> This serum leaves skin with a very nice tightening, moisturizing feeling, and has a better texture once applied than any other serum I&#x27;ve tried. I haven&#x27;t used it that long but have noticed slight improvements already in overall skin tone and am eager to see results after extended use. Also, my interaction with the company who makes the product was very pleasant and the customer service was wonderful. They really do seem to genuinely care about promoting a good, effective line of truly healthy skin care products to help people. I will also be trying out some of their other products.</li>
            <li> The vitamin C sits on the bottom of the bottle and I have to shake it up each time I use it.  It should already be dissolved, plus it has a very thin consistency.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any skin change as of yet.</li>
            <li> U should try it its a unique and a perfect product&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried before more expensive products and couldnt be satisfied like this one</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My face looks brighter when I use it.</li>
            <li> My review is I love the packaging of the product. It comes in a nice gray drawstring bag. The product itself is clear and has an almost mint smell to it. You don&#x27;t have to use but a couple of drops and consequently the bottle will last you a while. My face feels smoother already. It is not a quick miracle cure( and aren&#x27;t we all looking for that really? lol) but with time, the lines are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> As a man I prefer fewer steps to my skin care routine. This is great stuff - packed with all the right ingredients for the perfect night time skin treatment, all in one product. While I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in my dark spots, I have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin&#x27;s overall tone and texture. I teeter on having a bit of rosacea so I notice that if I do get a blemish it appears more &#x27;red&#x27; on my skin than usual as it heals, but my face does look brighter, and tighter, than before. Stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I simply adored working with this company.  Even though the product did not work as well for me as maybe for others.the customer service I received was absolutely outstanding and will forever serve as the barometer for how I want to be dealt with by other companies. Stephanie called me several times to see how I was doing, how it was going with the product.  I relayed I was not very happy and she assured me that would be no problem, no hassle return nothing just try it for a few more days. I did and still didnt see any improvement. Sure enough she called me and we had the most pleasant conversation, she guaranteed a full refund and told me not to bother with returning the products. In fact give to a friend to try she said and maybe they will like it more. So, indeed this is exactly what I will do.  I look forward to working with this company again and again and again in the future. Thank You so Very Much Katie H Henderson</li>
            <li> got a good result after few weeks. Gonna buy a few more.</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin with a soft, healthy glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.I&#x27;m using it in the morning before make up and also in the night.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week. So far, so good. I do have a problem... Suggested usage is two to four drops applied to the face. I&#x27;ve found it impossible to cover my face with so little. The only way I can manage it is to use about a half dropperful. Does anyone have any ideas other than using wet hands or other dilution methods?</li>
            <li> Nice light serum, absorbs in quickly with no sticky residue left behind. Leaves skin feeling incredibly soft and bright looking. I saw a difference right from the from first use. My face is smoother and some of the wrinkles are getting less visible. A tiny bit goes a long way so this bottle is a great value.</li>
            <li> I really love this vitamin C serum. It makes my face glowing, so radiant and soft. Great quality great buy! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife and I are using this and it seems to be working great!  Certainly makes your face feeling very soft, while reducing pore size.  Has also helped with my razor burn.</li>
            <li> this lightweight product is great it feels so on breezy going on it brightens your skin tighten your skin and makes you feel and look great</li>
