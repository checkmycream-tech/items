            <li>It smells good, was good on natural curly hair, good value price and have already passed it along to my cousin to find it here.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask?</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I figured this should be safe because it had argan oil in it.</li>
            <li>I love Dove products and thought I would try this out.  </li>
            <li>I love Dove and use their products exclusively on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love Dove products and this shampoo is no exception.</li>

            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>

            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Just found the price is even better then grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if I will be able to tolerate it.</li>
            <li>Dove&#x27;s Nourishing Oil Shampoo is a great oil infused shampoo that makes my fine, straight hair very easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>smells great, a little bit lathers great, does not leave hair oily.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly as an indulgence for time with my boyfriend and for going out, and then use cheap stuff for like work.</li>
            <li>It made my hair shiny and soft with great body and curl.</li>
            <li>it was perfect as amazon shipped it later the same price... and the shampoo as always great and leaves hair silky</li>
            <li>It has a good scent and comes in a large container that&#x27;s easy to dispense.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because for the first week or so it made my hair look and feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>I knew going in that it was not fragrance free, but since my stylist recommended it, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>you will be surprised how good it is</li>
            <li>My beautiful curls take a lot more product to tame.  </li>
            <li>it looks great and feels clean and light all day long!!</li>
            <li>No build up...... rinsed clean and smellswonderful.</li>
            <li>Before I didn&#x27;t really have a favorite line from Dove, I would just grab anything that&#x27;s available when I&#x27;m at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>this is a great shampoo...Makes your hair super shiny and doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy after 1 or 2 days which is very important for me since I don&#x27;t shampoo everyday.</li>
            <li>I use it only once and feel good.</li>
            <li>I guess that &amp;#34;You get what you pay for ...&amp;#34; is so true in this case.</li>
            <li>Good stuff only dispensing bottle needs to be moe ridged and firmer.</li>
            <li>I originally left the dove shampoo because my hair wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought it should be.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and came fast wrapped great ,gonna buy  more saves me from going to the store besides not many stores have his</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a loyal customer of Dove when it comes to hair products.</li>
            <li>I am sure this might be a great shampoo for other people, but clearly, I have a severe allergy to one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>its a tad pricey, but my hair smells like the most wonderfully clean, fresh fragrance and it is soft and bouncy too.</li>
            <li>Used together with the Dove Nourishing Oil Conditioner, my hair is the most soft and manageable that its been in years.  </li>
            <li>I have curly dry hair since I dye them often, my hair was so soft and beautiful after the wash I could not believe ..</li>
            <li>Good shampoo just makes my hair a little too oily.</li>
            <li>only issue is that I cannot use this shampoo for more than a week at a time or my hair starts to get oily quicker.</li>
            <li>After the first use of the shampoo and conditioner my hair was noticeably softer and over time I have seen a reduction in hair loss.</li>
            <li>I love dove its the only shampoo I use.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner, especially when used with the matching shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful shampoo - it does wonders with my hair which I frequently (but not daily) blow dry and curl leaving it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo worked really well at first.  </li>
            <li>It feels nice in your hands and while you are washing your hair, but when your hair dries, it just weighs it down and makes it look droopy.  </li>
            <li>hair dandruff started after using shampoo :) I thought it will help to rebuild some oil portion on dry scalp</li>
            <li>and then I do nothing more than let my hair dry -</li>
            <li>and I was sustaining a large amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li>Love the small amount it takes to do such amazing job.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it would be sodium laurel sulfate free...</li>
            <li>I have medium/thick straight hair by the way</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and detangled and very easy to blow dry.</li>
            <li>For some reason Dove shampoo and conditioner together always work best for my thin, dry and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Last week I bought the Daily Moisture shampoo&amp;conditioner (also from Dove) and in just a couple of days my hair got a lot drier and started to fall out a lot more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I tried Dove shampoo years ago back when it first came out, and didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>its a reasonable price for the quality, but i have long hair and dont want to use it up so fast at around $7 a bottle...</li>
            <li>Within a couple uses, my fine hair was so greasy, it actually appeared several shades darker and would not dry with a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry or damaged hair, I can see where this would be perfect, but for me trying it on my hair to get through the cold winter months...</li>
            <li>Not a bad product just not right for my hair type.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft, frizzfree, and manageable.</li>
            <li>I think the oils in this stuff just become too much with regular use.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair soft, shiny, and the oil makes my hair not frizzy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Furthermore its formula does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My shiny soft hair.</li>
            <li>I have dark thick asian hair and it works beautifully for me.  </li>
            <li>though it just became too heavy and didn&#x27;t feel like it was getting my hair clean.  </li>
            <li>Other shampoos like this over condition, but this one has the right balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I tried it again thinking the oil formula would be better but still not a good shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>By week three I was in the store looking for something to calm my scalp down and to get my hair to stop falling out.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is not recommend for people with tiny or silky straight hair as it will make them flat , but if you have curly hair go for it</li>
            <li>For anyone wanting a comparison to their own hair, I have very thick, long hair.</li>
            <li>No regrets.  </li>
            <li>The bigger problem is it took about a week to get my hair back to normal.  </li>
            <li>have long, thick hair that can be difficult to manage - but this product is perfect to use</li>
            <li>Ordering it online was less expensive and came right to my house.  :-)</li>
            <li>The only problem is, with time, I noticed my hair slowly became more weighed down and greasy looking.</li>
            <li>well it just leaves a tangled waxy mess, similar to Herbal Essences Hello Hydration very waxy.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this stuff daily if you have thin, fine hair like I do.</li>

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this stuff daily if you have thin, fine hair like I do.</li>
            <li> My hair smoothed down when I used this, while keeping the natural shape of my hair.</li>
            <li> It is hard to come by a combination that works as well on my hair and is gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Every time I ever used it, my face would get dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> noticed after a couple of washes that my hair was softer and did not seem as dry.  </li>
            <li> And dry.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why but the product I received in my order does not perform anywhere near as well as the product I purchased at CVS.  </li>
            <li> used it at my parents place when i spent the night one time and was HOOKED.</li>
            <li> I have long dark hair and do a lot of curling/straightening etc.  </li>
            <li> When dried, the hair did not escape in ten directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thicker shampoo,so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> During this time, an oil slick appeared on my shower floor which had to be cleaned daily as it was so slippery with this product&#x27;s oil.  </li>
            <li> That had a little frizz and ran to dry became EXTREMELY frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really find anything wrong with this shampoo for my thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Anything that takes a week of washing to remove from your hair is a big failure in my book.</li>
            <li> However, I am trying to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair realtively lifeless in less than a 24 hour period, I.E my search goes on.</li>
            <li> and I also noticed less hair loss.</li>
            <li> and sadly they ran out of the one that I normally purchase, so</li>
            <li> My hair was beginning to get dried out  at the ends</li>
            <li> I suggest you don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Whew!  Heavy, heavy fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing maybe I really do need intensive treatment since my hair is so dry :(</li>
            <li> For the past few mouths I&#x27;ve been using the nourishing oil one and my hair just felt so silky</li>
            <li> The Suave shampoo seems to work well at removing the excessive oils and balancing out the heaviness of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties and my hair is fairly dark and thick (strand size as well as quantity) and tends to be on the dryer side.  </li>
            <li> I tend to get stuck using a product for a long time because I am used to it and am afraid to try something that will not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But some how this made my hair worse.  </li>
            <li> and what felt like dirty hair to go away.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of shampoos and conditioners that I have tried that just don&#x27;t rinse out, leaving my hair looking horrible all day.</li>
            <li> It was horrible.  </li>

            <li> This shampoo has been great for summers in a humid climate. My hair smoothed down when I used this, while keeping the natural shape of my hair. Other shampoos like this over condition, but this one has the right balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that I cannot use this shampoo for more than a week at a time or my hair starts to get oily quicker.</li>
            <li> I had never tried this shampoo before and decided to get it because it was a good deal with free shipping!  I was happy with my purchse, this made my hair feel smoother and I like the scent.</li>
            <li> As described, shipped promptly, packed well, lowest price I could find on the Internet plus had the Amazon guarantee. What more could you ask? However, I am trying to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair realtively lifeless in less than a 24 hour period, I.E my search goes on. The purchase itself met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is ahhhhmaazziinggg....i love it. used it at my parents place when i spent the night one time and was HOOKED. its a tad pricey, but my hair smells like the most wonderfully clean, fresh fragrance and it is soft and bouncy too. ahh i loooovvveee it. I use it mostly as an indulgence for time with my boyfriend and for going out, and then use cheap stuff for like work. its a reasonable price for the quality, but i have long hair and dont want to use it up so fast at around $7 a bottle...its the best though. &lt;3</li>
            <li> I am not sure why but the product I received in my order does not perform anywhere near as well as the product I purchased at CVS.  I was very disappointed. I wonder what the reason is. It almost feels &amp;#34;generic.&amp;#34; what is up with that?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use Dove soap. Every time I ever used it, my face would get dry and flaky. I figured this should be safe because it had argan oil in it. I washed my hair twice a week and after a week it was itchy. After two weeks my hair began to fall out. By week three I was in the store looking for something to calm my scalp down and to get my hair to stop falling out. I am sure this might be a great shampoo for other people, but clearly, I have a severe allergy to one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing for my hair. Leaves it soft, frizzfree, and manageable. Love the small amount it takes to do such amazing job. It&#x27;s a thicker shampoo,so a little goes a long way. No build up...... rinsed clean and smellswonderful. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked really well at first.  After a while (week or so) though it just became too heavy and didn&#x27;t feel like it was getting my hair clean.  I&#x27;ve had to purchase another set of shampoo and conditioner and a clarifying shampoo just to get the build up and what felt like dirty hair to go away.  I gave it 3 stars because for the first week or so it made my hair look and feel amazing.  I am going to use this as a once a week shampoo.  For anyone wanting a comparison to their own hair, I have very thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> I love Dove products and thought I would try this out.  Within a couple uses, my fine hair was so greasy, it actually appeared several shades darker and would not dry with a hair dryer.  The bigger problem is it took about a week to get my hair back to normal.  During this time, an oil slick appeared on my shower floor which had to be cleaned daily as it was so slippery with this product&#x27;s oil.  It leaves a yellow residue all over your bathtub.  My hair brush was ruined.  Anything that takes a week of washing to remove from your hair is a big failure in my book.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo just makes my hair a little too oily. Not a bad product just not right for my hair type. Smells good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It smells like heaven and ALWAYS leaves my hair feeling silky.</li>
            <li> I use it only once and feel good.</li>
            <li> I love Dove and use their products exclusively on my hair.  I had purchased a different Dove shampoo via Amazon Subscribe and Save and sadly they ran out of the one that I normally purchase, so I decided to try this.  It feels nice in your hands and while you are washing your hair, but when your hair dries, it just weighs it down and makes it look droopy.  If you have dry or damaged hair, I can see where this would be perfect, but for me trying it on my hair to get through the cold winter months...I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
            <li> I love Dove products and this shampoo is no exception. It made my hair shiny and soft with great body and curl. The only problem is, with time, I noticed my hair slowly became more weighed down and greasy looking. I think the oils in this stuff just become too much with regular use. I now rotate back and forth between this shampoo and Suave. The Suave shampoo seems to work well at removing the excessive oils and balancing out the heaviness of this shampoo. I wouldn&#x27;t use this stuff daily if you have thin, fine hair like I do.</li>
            <li> I guess that &amp;#34;You get what you pay for ...&amp;#34; is so true in this case. I hope that they could improve on the quality a bit.</li>
            <li> Good stuff only dispensing bottle needs to be moe ridged and firmer.</li>
            <li> My sister visited me and left a bottle of this shampoo and conditioner in my shower.  her loss. I love this stuff.  I have long dark hair and do a lot of curling/straightening etc.  this is like silk.  Ordering it online was less expensive and came right to my house.  :-)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I have dark thick asian hair and it works beautifully for me.  It makes my hair silky and almost do not need conditioner.</li>
            <li> this is great! the shampoo and conditioner is amazing. it makes my hair soft, shiny, and the oil makes my hair not frizzy. i will buy this shampoo and conditioners until they stop selling it! &lt;3</li>
            <li> hair dandruff started after using shampoo :) I thought it will help to rebuild some oil portion on dry scalp but it didnt!</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it would be sodium laurel sulfate free...otherwise a very nice shampoo and got a great deal</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo when visiting my mother.  I tend to get stuck using a product for a long time because I am used to it and am afraid to try something that will not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had the most wonderful, mildly flowery fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed after a couple of washes that my hair was softer and did not seem as dry.  It was easier to brush.  When dried, the hair did not escape in ten directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I splurged and bought a bottle when I got home.  No regrets.  A great shampoo for all hair types.  My teenager uses it too and loves it as well.</li>
            <li> smells great, a little bit lathers great, does not leave hair oily. my hair styles great afterwards. recommend using with conditioner and serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties and my hair is fairly dark and thick (strand size as well as quantity) and tends to be on the dryer side.  This is a wonderful shampoo - it does wonders with my hair which I frequently (but not daily) blow dry and curl leaving it soft and shiny.  My hair actually feels softer as I&#x27;m rinsing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore its formula does not irritate my sensitive skin.  It is hard to come by a combination that works as well on my hair and is gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love the ways it smells and I always get compliments on both how great my hair looks and how it smells!  I use a lot of Dove products and this is another great one!</li>
            <li> I switched to this product after using the same shampoo and conditioner for years. My hair was beginning to get dried out  at the ends and I was sustaining a large amount of hair loss. After the first use of the shampoo and conditioner my hair was noticeably softer and over time I have seen a reduction in hair loss. I even colored and highlighted my hair since purchasing this product and I still feel a softening of my hair. The Shampoo also smells delicious! I am very happy with the switch!</li>
            <li> I love the Dove Nourishing Oil Shampoo and Conditioner! It is a perfect balance between moisturized, perfect looking hair and frizz control without looking &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;. There are a lot of shampoos and conditioners that I have tried that just don&#x27;t rinse out, leaving my hair looking horrible all day. This is NOT the case with this combination! I highly recommend both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick hair that can be difficult to manage - but this product is perfect to use and then I do nothing more than let my hair dry - it looks great and feels clean and light all day long!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this dove shampoo because if the oil factor and it was supposed to nourish my hair.  But some how this made my hair worse.  I originally left the dove shampoo because my hair wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought it should be. But I tried this one.  It was horrible.  My shiny soft hair. That had a little frizz and ran to dry became EXTREMELY frizzy.  And dry.  My beautiful curls take a lot more product to tame.  And after one use I saw the difference.  I will never use this again.  I suggest you don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> this is a great shampoo...Makes your hair super shiny and doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy after 1 or 2 days which is very important for me since I don&#x27;t shampoo everyday. I have medium/thick straight hair by the way</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and came fast wrapped great ,gonna buy  more saves me from going to the store besides not many stores have his</li>
            <li> I tried Dove shampoo years ago back when it first came out, and didn&#x27;t like it. Now I tried it again thinking the oil formula would be better but still not a good shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel that it cleans well it just leaves a tangled waxy mess, similar to Herbal Essences Hello Hydration very waxy.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It leaves my hair with the perfect amount of moisture!! It smells great as well. I love dove its the only shampoo I use.</li>
            <li> Dove&#x27;s Nourishing Oil Shampoo is a great oil infused shampoo that makes my fine, straight hair very easy to manage.  Used together with the Dove Nourishing Oil Conditioner, my hair is the most soft and manageable that its been in years.  I would highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> this Shampoo is amazing ..I have curly dry hair since I dye them often, my hair was so soft and beautiful after the wash I could not believe .. even before I used the conditioner .. so for me a great deal and going to order again&lt;br /&gt;it is not recommend for people with tiny or silky straight hair as it will make them flat , but if you have curly hair go for it you will be surprised how good it is</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, especially when used with the matching shampoo. It keeps my hair soft and detangled and very easy to blow dry.</li>
            <li> I use this product for years. Just found the price is even better then grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a loyal customer of Dove when it comes to hair products. For some reason Dove shampoo and conditioner together always work best for my thin, dry and frizzy hair. Before I didn&#x27;t really have a favorite line from Dove, I would just grab anything that&#x27;s available when I&#x27;m at the grocery store. For the past few mouths I&#x27;ve been using the nourishing oil one and my hair just felt so silky and I also noticed less hair loss. Last week I bought the Daily Moisture shampoo&amp;conditioner (also from Dove) and in just a couple of days my hair got a lot drier and started to fall out a lot more. I&#x27;m guessing maybe I really do need intensive treatment since my hair is so dry :( Anyway I&#x27;m trying to use up them and I can&#x27;t wait to go back to this shampoo!!</li>
            <li> It smells good, was good on natural curly hair, good value price and have already passed it along to my cousin to find it here.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo by Dove a lot.  It has a good scent and comes in a large container that&#x27;s easy to dispense.  Can&#x27;t really find anything wrong with this shampoo for my thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I got a great deal on this one and though it was out of stock when i ordered and went into the que it was perfect as amazon shipped it later the same price... and the shampoo as always great and leaves hair silky</li>
            <li> I knew going in that it was not fragrance free, but since my stylist recommended it, I decided to try it.  Whew!  Heavy, heavy fragrance.  Don&#x27;t know if I will be able to tolerate it.</li>
