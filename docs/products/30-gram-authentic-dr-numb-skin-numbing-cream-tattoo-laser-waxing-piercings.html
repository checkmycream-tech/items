    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
            <li>The best way I&#x27;ve found to use this is to put it on, then put it on again and cover the area with plastic wrap and leave it sit for about an hour.</li>
            <li>Great for bikini sugaring as well!</li>
            <li>Works amazing !!!</li>
            <li>I think this product is great!</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li>Just keep breathing best thing you can do.</li>
            <li>When I allow it to sit for the thirty or so minutes before getting threaded, I am in happy land.</li>
            <li>What is also great for me is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Works great numbs the area.</li>
            <li>i was so happy you know, so</li>
            <li>and it worked great.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>This stuff would be great if you are a whimper and have zero pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>Great for large/painful tattoos.</li>
            <li>Leave on 60mins or more for more numbing in the area!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Good to use in those unbarable or sensation areas</li>
            <li>I think waiting the full 2 hrs is the best way to go</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>really works amazing!!</li>
            <li>It works pretty great.  </li>
            <li>Worked great for the first hour.</li>
            <li>I love getting my eyebrows threaded.</li>
            <li>So all in all, if used properly, it works great!</li>
            <li>So it took longer and hurt more.</li>
            <li>Some sessions, it seems to work better than others and</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by a friend and works great , really helps take out the feeling of the needle.</li>
            <li>make sure to put it on 1 hour before your tattoo appointment</li>
            <li>I love this alot i want more</li>
            <li>I can best describe the sensation as a topical novacaine.  </li>
            <li>I am not too sure I even got Dr.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and even applied more</li>
            <li>another sitting without the cream to make sure the colors withheld.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m suppose to be getting some ink done so just to make sure the product would work, I took a generous amount and applied it to my wrist, wrapped it for two hours and then took it off.</li>
            <li>If you think you need it don&#x27;t rub it excally where your want to get inked, because when it wakes up it will hurt woo much more.</li>
            <li>Customer service pretty good</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant when I ordered this product, and for good reasons.</li>
            <li>Ok so I ordered this originally to pierce my wrists.</li>
            <li>The honest truth is I first went to the DR.</li>
            <li>Not a 5, because I have had some others that were better, but this is really good stuff and gets a better than average rating from me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t leave the cream on very long so it wasn&#x27;t great when it soar off.</li>
            <li>just follow the simple rules apply it 2 hours before the procedure and apply a good amount and then wrap it with plastic wrap</li>
            <li>I received this product a good week after ordering it, it was packaged in a white envelope surrounded by bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>The client does have to sit for at least 30 mins with it wrapped before getting in the tattoo chair for best results.</li>
            <li>So before i did the other side i ordered this product and it works great, lasted about 2 hours</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>This product is great for small areas but do not use it on huge areas.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m certain this was in fact a cheap knock-off and not Dr.</li>
            <li>it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>With reapplication, mid-procedure, I found this stuff somewhat useful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but soooo worth it.</li>
            <li>remove right before session</li>
            <li>If you do it right</li>
            <li>Someone who has used it before told me to apply it 3 hours before my tattoo to make sure it absorbs; since it was my first tattoo I went with it since the product itself offers no directions.</li>
            <li>and since I&#x27;m a major wimp I decided to play it safe and get some numbing cream.</li>
            <li>and I have to say from the first use</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and am purchasing this larger tube after I write this review.</li>
            <li>I am reordering this after having used up the first tube I purchased.</li>
            <li>but if I had used more and left it in longer it might of lasted longer.</li>
            <li>Wish I had used it the first two sessions.</li>
            <li>Granted, my tattoo was very large but it took a whole hour of pain away.</li>
            <li>It  didn&#x60; t penetrate very well only worked on top layer of skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 43 and was getting my first tattoo,  and was very nervous.</li>
            <li>I felt the the out line also this stuff shipped pretty fast to</li>
            <li>I had to get threaded once before it could really work</li>
            <li>It took it awhile for it to really start working</li>
            <li>and I guess if you really needed to your anus....</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>But it really took reapplication.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m another skeptic who analyzes feedbacks, wondering if they were entered by the company affiliates or if from real users of the products.</li>
            <li>Seller (FAST FASHION TATTOO) promised delivery between Sept. 6 - 10th, but seller did not send item to shipper until the 6th and item did not leave shipper in California (for my Florida home) until the 10th.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice a whole lot of numbing at all.</li>
            <li>If to much gets in your bloodstream it will really affect you and trust me you will know it.</li>
            <li>Far better than waxing for me since threading is much more precise, but the pain on my upper lip was too much and worse since I don&#x27;t need to get threaded as often anymore.</li>
            <li>So it gets 3 stars for the first hour of complete numbness.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel a thing for the 1st hour with my new tattoo!</li>
            <li>I love this cream I had a half sleeve tatt done in two sessions</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this stuff to anyone.</li>
            <li>I still had high hopes for it and gave it a shot</li>
            <li>Very far.</li>
            <li>I found the fact that the product couldn&#x27;t properly closed right very sketchy.</li>
            <li>It numbed my ear enough to make it bearable and that&#x27;s exactly what I was aiming for.</li>
            <li>I tried it on the back of my hand and it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>THis product works ok but be warned it won&#x27;t last long enough to complete a tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it works as far as numbing the area</li>
            <li>It really numbs the skin and not only needed to use for tattooing.  </li>
            <li>I used a whole tube of cream and wrapped the area in Saran wrap for 2 hrs prior to getting tattooed.</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s very far from general anesthesia.  </li>
            <li>Its okay, It did work for a few not as long as I had wanted it too</li>
            <li>It doesnt work on normal skin, but with further research and experimentation I found out it works on mucus membrane.</li>
            <li>It was hard to tell which rates were from sincere buyers and which were fabricated by the sellers of this product.</li>
            <li>I definitely should&#x27;ve given the negative comments more attention.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good...varies with different people on how long but still numbs for about 30 mins to an hour.  </li>
            <li>If you are getting some work done and are feeling the pain, I say give it a try, if it helps even a little, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Be careful or ask a doctor how much you should use.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, the pain was reduced immensely, I had about 45-60 minutes of minimal pain, where I could have fallen asleep.  </li>
            <li>I researched the Dr. Numb product and it had good reviews</li>
            <li>I used it and it really worked but did not last very long</li>
            <li>I have tried various brands of numbing creams, and this is the only one that completely numbs me for bikini waxing.</li>
            <li>this will make it so the cream does not dry..</li>
            <li>This Dr. Numb is so good for numbing , that was used for male circumcision.</li>
            <li>The negative ratings are true..</li>

            <li> This Dr. Numb is so good for numbing , that was used for male circumcision.</li>
            <li> The negative ratings are true..</li>
            <li> The first thing that caught my attention was the fact that the seal on the tube was very loose and remained that way regardless of the &amp;#34;push down and turn to close tightly&amp;#34; message that was written on the seal.</li>
            <li> It just don&#x27;t last very long when you getting tattoos because the artist has to constantly wipe to see the skin.</li>
            <li> how long I had it on prior to getting the tattoo.  </li>
            <li> Once the product started wearing off, I started to feel pain again but nowhere near my previous appointments without it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 30 gram AUTHENTIC Dr Numb Skin Numbing Cream Tattoo Laser Waxing Piercing</li>
            <li> This stuff is authentic, i verified it through the dr. numb website!&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s you rub a whole lot on at least 2hours before whimper.</li>
            <li> Ok here is the truth I got a hold of dr numb</li>
            <li> it was strange</li>
            <li> I will likely purchase this again to pierce other areas.</li>
            <li> For parts of the tattoo I didn&#x27;t feel a thing, and for other areas there was only the slightest sensation.</li>
            <li> Product made me dizzy and the wait for it to kick in took very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned there are several factors which can affect the discomfort level of those treatments i.e. avoiding caffeine and drinking a lot of water a few days prior to the sessions, diet, hormones/menstrual cycle</li>
            <li> Which means I felt the next hour and a half of my rib cage tattoo.</li>
            <li> So I bought 1 tube from living essential on amazon for less then $10.</li>
            <li> It made it harder for my artist to get the ink to set.</li>
            <li> As per my artist it made the skin harder to absorb the ink so they have to go deeper and go over area</li>
            <li> Although a few people who also tried it said it didn&#x27;t work efficiently, personally, I think it works fantastically.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for tattoos for no pain to minimal pain.</li>
            <li> this person has bin getting the stuff from them now sec</li>
            <li> I put a lot on and left it as the directions said waste of money</li>
            <li> Please be careful.</li>
            <li> but I think all those other factors I mentioned might have something to do with that.  </li>
            <li> but that is to be expected!</li>
            <li> but in this area I only completed one side and the pain was pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> i also bleed alot, which was scary, the doctor said i was allgeric to Dr.numb of the course of bleed so much and hpyerfenltering during getting the tattoo done</li>
            <li> /&gt;In order for this product to work you will need to generously apply it to the area at least an hour prior to the tattoo and wrap it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> It started wearing off slowly after the 3rd hour.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other than that it worked for its purpose!</li>
            <li> I got a half sleeve yesterday and was in the hospital by night time over dosing on it.</li>
            <li> You little Sissy girl.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and decided to buy this product because it was much cheaper than the product sold on Dr. Numb&#x27;s website..</li>
            <li> Came fast in the mail and will COMPLETELY numb you.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes, this cream numbed the area sufficiently to pierce.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted $13</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> so I have a few tricks up my sleeve.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to relieve the discomfort from my sensitive areas and decided to browse the web, took the risk and ordered 2 tubes.</li>
            <li> to the item itself it began to wear off during my tattoo --- not sure if that was a result of the product itself or</li>
            <li> This product was so unsuccessful that it is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my artist ran late and by the time we got started, the cream had been on for over 3 hours and since it only has a 4 hour window</li>
            <li> I can say without a doubt - these sessions would not be possible without Dr NUMB.</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> apply a generously and put saran wrap over it for at least 2 to 4 hours before tattoo session.</li>
            <li> Numb because the packaging was COMPLETELY different and read USA Numbing Cream</li>
            <li> + minutes before it starts wearing off, but slowly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stuff and was skeptical due to the variation in reviews.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it (sorry guys!)</li>
            <li> I did numb me but not nearly as much as it should have.</li>
            <li> i used dr.numb for sum tattoos,like on the knee and behind the knee.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t get the area completely numb but it will dull the pain.</li>
            <li> I have tons of tattoos but finally decided to get my ribs done (very painful area).  </li>
            <li> They sent me the wrong product.</li>
            <li> They made me skeptical but I promise it works.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t numb my skin even after 3hrs of application according to the instructions.</li>
            <li> and they sent me Dr. Numb for hemorrhoids , for itching.</li>
            <li> and it will be completley numb for about 3 hours</li>
            <li> I used dr. Numb</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t numb when applied as directed.</li>
            <li> but it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Numb.</li>
            <li> NUMB website and paid $90 for two tube with express shipping.</li>
            <li> and while it did numb a bit of the pain, it was still rather painful to me.</li>
            <li> if u gettin a tattoo in a bad spot that u think is gonna hurt bad.</li>
            <li> That being said if one rubs it above&amp;below purposed area it wont hurt as bad.</li>
            <li> Trust me when I say Dr. Numb worked well for me!</li>
            <li> It was crazy!!</li>

            <li> i used dr.numb for sum tattoos,like on the knee and behind the knee.&#x27;&#x27;it works&#x27;&#x27; if u gettin a tattoo in a bad spot that u think is gonna hurt bad. get dr.numb!!</li>
            <li> I am currently having the largest Tattoo you could possibly imagine put on my ribcage. (Can you say OUCH???) I can say without a doubt - these sessions would not be possible without Dr NUMB. If you have a dream of finally getting that piece you&#x27;ve always dreamed of getting, don&#x27;t even THINK about doing it without this cream.&lt;br /&gt;Next stop.....watercolor Tattoo.....I got three tubes with my last purchase.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t numb my skin even after 3hrs of application according to the instructions. I am not happy with this product</li>
            <li> I love getting my eyebrows threaded. Far better than waxing for me since threading is much more precise, but the pain on my upper lip was too much and worse since I don&#x27;t need to get threaded as often anymore. I purchased this cream as a trial and I have to say from the first use, I&#x27;ve been hooked. I had to get threaded once before it could really work and while it did numb a bit of the pain, it was still rather painful to me. When I allow it to sit for the thirty or so minutes before getting threaded, I am in happy land. You would never know that I just got threaded. What is also great for me is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I absolutely love it and am purchasing this larger tube after I write this review.</li>
            <li> Got my hand tattooed didint fill anything thing for about 20 min but if I left it on longer it would of lasted longer I think waiting the full 2 hrs is the best way to go</li>
            <li> I recently had to repierce one of my ears so I could start gauging them and since I&#x27;m a major wimp I decided to play it safe and get some numbing cream. It took it awhile for it to really start working but it did its job. It numbed my ear enough to make it bearable and that&#x27;s exactly what I was aiming for. It won&#x27;t get the area completely numb but it will dull the pain.</li>
            <li> Ok so I ordered this originally to pierce my wrists. It doesnt work on normal skin, but with further research and experimentation I found out it works on mucus membrane. So like your mouth, your tongue, the inside of your nose and female genitals....and I guess if you really needed to your anus....but I used in to pierce my Medusa (the upper lip in the philtrum) I also used it to pierce my hood (the skin.above the clitoris)  and I honestly only felt pressure. It wore off in about an hour. I plan on doing my cheeks as well.</li>
            <li> Product made me dizzy and the wait for it to kick in took very long. Get it if you have time to wait</li>
            <li> It works pretty great.  Not a 5, because I have had some others that were better, but this is really good stuff and gets a better than average rating from me.</li>
            <li> It sucks. This product doesn&#x27;t work.  They sent me the wrong product. I ordered 30 gram AUTHENTIC Dr Numb Skin Numbing Cream Tattoo Laser Waxing Piercing and they sent me Dr. Numb for hemorrhoids , for itching. The product I received didn&#x27;t say anything for Waxing or tattoo, or piercing. They need to edit the picture on the add</li>
            <li> I tried it on the back of my hand and it worked pretty well.  However, it did not work so well on my lips for permanent lip liner.  It felt like she was slicing them with razor blades.  Ouch!</li>
            <li> once you use this you will never want to go through another tattoo session without  it again. if you use it like you would lotion it won&#x27;t work at all though. apply a generously and put saran wrap over it for at least 2 to 4 hours before tattoo session. this will make it so the cream does not dry.. remove right before session and it will be completley numb for about 3 hours</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use with a dermaroller. Works great numbs the area. I&#x27;m very happy with this product it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes, this cream numbed the area sufficiently to pierce. I will likely purchase this again to pierce other areas.</li>
            <li> The best way I&#x27;ve found to use this is to put it on, then put it on again and cover the area with plastic wrap and leave it sit for about an hour. Then remove the plastic wrap, wipe the cream off, and do what you intended. I purchased the to use with the Derma roller. You have around 20+ minutes before it starts wearing off, but slowly. So all in all, if used properly, it works great!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all.  No difference in feel whatsoever.  Customer service pretty good, so I may buy from them again, but not this product.</li>
            <li> Great for bikini sugaring as well! Used as recommended by others, put on 2 hours before your session. It makes the session tolerable. It definitely minimizes the pain for those who can&#x27;t tolerate it!</li>
            <li> when i got it i was so happy you know, so i followed the dections, when i got the tattoo done i of course didnt feel anything but after 25 mins i felt the needles. i also bleed alot, which was scary, the doctor said i was allgeric to Dr.numb of the course of bleed so much and hpyerfenltering during getting the tattoo done</li>
            <li> bought this for brazilian waxing. it works as far as numbing the area but there was a downfall. when applying the wax, i felt a load of sensitivity on the surface of the skin. but it does take the sting out of the tugging.</li>
            <li> This worked well. I used for tattoo, piercing, pimples when they hurt. This numbs and does the job for about 3 hours</li>
            <li> I love this cream I had a half sleeve tatt done in two sessions didnt feel a thing just follow the simple rules apply it 2 hours before the procedure and apply a good amount and then wrap it with plastic wrap</li>
            <li> It made it harder for my artist to get the ink to set. So it took longer and hurt more. totally a no go!! Go with Hush anesthetic tattoo numbing</li>
            <li> I am reordering this after having used up the first tube I purchased. I have tried various brands of numbing creams, and this is the only one that completely numbs me for bikini waxing. I tried using all of them the same way: Leave on for two hours pre-waxing, covered in plastic. With the others, I was still in a lot of paid during the waxing. With this product, I did not feel a thing! Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is authentic, i verified it through the dr. numb website!&lt;br /&gt;and it worked for about 3 hours on my back tattoo!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. You must use as directed to get the proper effect. I wont go without it. And neither will my girl.</li>
            <li> With reapplication, mid-procedure, I found this stuff somewhat useful.  The client could keep going.  But it really took reapplication.  It was also somewhat helpful as a placebo.  That said, it&#x27;s very far from general anesthesia.  Very far.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to alleviate some of the discomfort from my electrolysis sessions.  I&#x27;ve learned there are several factors which can affect the discomfort level of those treatments i.e. avoiding caffeine and drinking a lot of water a few days prior to the sessions, diet, hormones/menstrual cycle, stress level...  Anyway, this product helps but does not get rid of all the discomfort.  Some sessions, it seems to work better than others and some sessions it seems to not be working at all -- but I think all those other factors I mentioned might have something to do with that.  Maybe there is a bit of a placebo affect going on here...I don&#x27;t really know.  Bottom line: I will keep using this for my sessions.</li>
            <li> THis product works ok but be warned it won&#x27;t last long enough to complete a tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order for this product to work you will need to generously apply it to the area at least an hour prior to the tattoo and wrap it.  The numbing will last for about 30 minutes before wearing off.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a friend and works great , really helps take out the feeling of the needle. ITS A MUST HAVE !! make sure to put it on 1 hour before your tattoo appointment</li>
            <li> This Dr. Numb is so good for numbing , that was used for male circumcision.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 and was getting my first tattoo,  and was very nervous. I used dr. Numb and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Works amazing !!! Leave on 60mins or more for more numbing in the area!!!!!  I love this alot i want more</li>
            <li> I think this product is great! It really numbs the skin and not only needed to use for tattooing.  Great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m another skeptic who analyzes feedbacks, wondering if they were entered by the company affiliates or if from real users of the products. Trust me when I say Dr. Numb worked well for me! It was recommended by my electrologist  who heard about this during a convention. I was desperate to relieve the discomfort from my sensitive areas and decided to browse the web, took the risk and ordered 2 tubes. I can best describe the sensation as a topical novacaine.  I followed the instructions thoroughly, leaving a generous amount on the areas, 2 hours before treatment time. There was no discomfort at all. It started wearing off slowly after the 3rd hour.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I purchased this stuff and was skeptical due to the variation in reviews. I had a 2.5 hr tattoo done yesterday on my ribcage and let me tell you...this stuff WORKS!!! I used a whole tube of cream and wrapped the area in Saran wrap for 2 hrs prior to getting tattooed. I had to ask the tattoo artist if he was tattooing me because I couldn&#x27;t feel ANYTHING, I just heard the machine lol. It was crazy!! However, it only lasted about an hour. Granted, my tattoo was very large but it took a whole hour of pain away. I would HIGHLY recommend this stuff to anyone. It&#x27;s pricey but soooo worth it. If you do it right (like how I mentioned above), it will work wonders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my face, 2 hours before home-waxing.  I&#x27;ve used this 2 hours prior to brazilian waxing (just as directions say) - and it did NOTHING.  I tried it several different times and there was ZERO difference in sensitivity/pain.  Won&#x27;t be buying this again.  I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Doesn&#x27;t numb when applied as directed. Just a waste of money. Never ever buy this product. May be a scam.</li>
            <li> Seller (FAST FASHION TATTOO) promised delivery between Sept. 6 - 10th, but seller did not send item to shipper until the 6th and item did not leave shipper in California (for my Florida home) until the 10th.  Amazon contacted shipper who then contacted me to tell me item will arrive on the 12th then the next day advised no, arrival will be the 13th, notwithstanding the fact that I told them I needed it absolutely no later than end of the 12th because I planned to get a tattoo out of town and I leave on the 13th.  Shipper offered no apology and was only magnanimous enough to tell me to refuse the item when it arrived (in my mailbox).&lt;br /&gt;As to the item itself it began to wear off during my tattoo --- not sure if that was a result of the product itself or how long I had it on prior to getting the tattoo.  Someone who has used it before told me to apply it 3 hours before my tattoo to make sure it absorbs; since it was my first tattoo I went with it since the product itself offers no directions.</li>
            <li> It works! It just don&#x27;t last very long when you getting tattoos because the artist has to constantly wipe to see the skin.</li>
            <li> I have 9 tattoos that im removing and the numbing cream that the office has didnt work for me. Someone told me about this cream and i tried it. I apply 2 hours before my seccion and wrap my self. it reduces pain for me by 75%!!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a whole lot of numbing at all. Not worth the money</li>
            <li> really works amazing!!</li>
            <li> Worked great for the first hour. Which means I felt the next hour and a half of my rib cage tattoo. So it gets 3 stars for the first hour of complete numbness.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I am not too sure I even got Dr.Numb because the packaging was COMPLETELY different and read USA Numbing Cream (although it came from China), not to mention the directions on the packaging had several grammatical errors as if it was put through a Google translator and you know those things don&#x27;t always translate well. I still had high hopes for it and gave it a shot but it was a disappointment. I did numb me but not nearly as much as it should have. I followed the directions and even applied more but it didn&#x27;t seem to matter. I researched the Dr. Numb product and it had good reviews so I&#x27;m certain this was in fact a cheap knock-off and not Dr.Numb.</li>
            <li> ❤️❤️❤️❤️It I didn&#x27;t feel a thing for the 1st hour with my new tattoo! Will use again for the next</li>
            <li> the product only worked once in a while . It  didn&#x60; t penetrate very well only worked on top layer of skin</li>
            <li> Surveys its purpose. Good to use in those unbarable or sensation areas but it must be applied 2 hours prior and covered so air doesn&#x27;t hit the area ... As per my artist it made the skin harder to absorb the ink so they have to go deeper and go over area another sitting without the cream to make sure the colors withheld.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all not even after 2 hours like it says it does. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant when I ordered this product, and for good reasons. I read the reviews and they were to two different extremes. Some people claimed it worked like a charm, and others claimed it didn&#x27;t work at all. It was hard to tell which rates were from sincere buyers and which were fabricated by the sellers of this product. I took a chance and decided to buy this product because it was much cheaper than the product sold on Dr. Numb&#x27;s website.. I received this product a good week after ordering it, it was packaged in a white envelope surrounded by bubble wrap. The box looked like the one pictured and inside was a white tube. The first thing that caught my attention was the fact that the seal on the tube was very loose and remained that way regardless of the &amp;#34;push down and turn to close tightly&amp;#34; message that was written on the seal. I found the fact that the product couldn&#x27;t properly closed right very sketchy. I&#x27;m suppose to be getting some ink done so just to make sure the product would work, I took a generous amount and applied it to my wrist, wrapped it for two hours and then took it off. The product left a tingling sensation on my wrist but that was it. I could still feel every test pinch, stab with a thumbtack, and pull I applied to my wrist. I remember telling my roommate that it felt like Bengay... My tattoo artist said that this product is trash... I can&#x27;t believe I wasted $13+ on this.. This product was so unsuccessful that it is unbelievable. I would not encourage anybody to buy this. It is a waste of money and time. PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your money. The negative ratings are true.. Think twice. I definitely should&#x27;ve given the negative comments more attention. SAVE YOURSELVES</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good...varies with different people on how long but still numbs for about 30 mins to an hour.  The client does have to sit for at least 30 mins with it wrapped before getting in the tattoo chair for best results.</li>
            <li> I got this just to test and see how well it would work while getting some extensive tattooing done. Although a few people who also tried it said it didn&#x27;t work efficiently, personally, I think it works fantastically. For parts of the tattoo I didn&#x27;t feel a thing, and for other areas there was only the slightest sensation. Definitely pick some up and give it a try.</li>
            <li> It works so well and it isn&#x27;t too pricey! 2 hours and plastic wrap and I feel nothing when I get a wax.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff before a 5hour sitting. I have a  tiger on the outside of my thigh. I didn&#x27;t leave the cream on very long so it wasn&#x27;t great when it soar off. Lucky for me I study massage so I have a few tricks up my sleeve. These are my tips wyn useing this stuff. If your tattoo is big you knows what your getting into. Don&#x27;t be a whimper just keep breathing. This stuff would be great if you are a whimper and have zero pain tolerance. If that&#x27;s you rub a whole lot on at least 2hours before whimper. If you think you need it don&#x27;t rub it excally where your want to get inked, because when it wakes up it will hurt woo much more. That being said if one rubs it above&amp;below purposed area it wont hurt as bad. You little Sissy girl. Just keep breathing best thing you can do.</li>
            <li> The honest truth is I first went to the DR. NUMB website and paid $90 for two tube with express shipping. I demanded a refund after a week of not receiving this item, I was pissed because I paid $22 for express shipping. So I bought 1 tube from living essential on amazon for less then $10. I used it and it really worked but did not last very long but if I had used more and left it in longer it might of lasted longer. I would recommend it for tattoos for no pain to minimal pain. I used it on my third session on a chest and shoulder and it made a big difference. Wish I had used it the first two sessions.</li>
            <li> I have tons of tattoos but finally decided to get my ribs done (very painful area).  I kinda like the pain but in this area I only completed one side and the pain was pretty bad.  So before i did the other side i ordered this product and it works great, lasted about 2 hours and i didnt feel anything.</li>
            <li> Its okay, It did work for a few not as long as I had wanted it too but that is to be expected! Other than that it worked for its purpose!</li>
            <li> I tried this product three times while finishing a back piece.  The first time I used this, the pain was reduced immensely, I had about 45-60 minutes of minimal pain, where I could have fallen asleep.  Once the product started wearing off, I started to feel pain again but nowhere near my previous appointments without it.  The second time I used it (sorry guys!) I was PMS&#x27;ing and while to touch it felt like it was working, once we started the tattoo, it seemed to have no effect on the pain at all.  I felt everything.  Today I used it for the third time to finish up.  Unfortunately my artist ran late and by the time we got started, the cream had been on for over 3 hours and since it only has a 4 hour window, I felt everything.  If you are getting some work done and are feeling the pain, I say give it a try, if it helps even a little, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Came fast in the mail and will COMPLETELY numb you. Dont listen to people that say it doesn&#x27;t. They made me skeptical but I promise it works. You just have to leave it on for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Ok here is the truth I got a hold of dr numb this person has bin getting the stuff from them now sec this stuff worked about 70% on my outline of my tattoo it was strange I felt it work in some spots and some spots I felt the the out line also this stuff shipped pretty fast to so I give it a B for everything</li>
            <li> Worked for about 5 minutes then went away I put a lot on and left it as the directions said waste of money 👎</li>
            <li> This product is great for small areas but do not use it on huge areas. I got a half sleeve yesterday and was in the hospital by night time over dosing on it. My heart rate was 167 a minute.  Please be careful. If to much gets in your bloodstream it will really affect you and trust me you will know it. Be careful or ask a doctor how much you should use. I&#x27;ll never use that again</li>
            <li> Great for large/painful tattoos. Follow directions and Bob&#x27;s your uncle!</li>
