            <li>I did receive this product free for the purpose of reviewing it and giving my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product free for the purpose of reviewing it and giving my honest feedback.</li>

            <li>After using the product ONCE I was able to tell a difference and have already recommended it to 4-5 friends.</li>
            <li>I really love how my skin feels and the appearance of my skin is improving.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few Argan oils and this one seems to be the best, particularly because it is organic, is the largest size (4 oz.) of the others,  AND is the best price.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>Great value for the size, and has that classic Argan Oil smell and texture.</li>
            <li>and I have pretty good skin to begin with.  </li>
            <li>bottom lie is that this product is fairly priced and works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin and am always searching for something to moisturizes my skin, this the best I have found.</li>
            <li>Awesome for menopausal skin getting dry.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m incredibly happy with how soft and healthy my skin looks.</li>
            <li>great product, i use it on my sclerodermic hands and feet and it helps keep them soft and smooth!  </li>

            <li>It is a great product you can use on all parts of your body, and leaves it soft</li>
            <li>It does a great job at keeping my kinky curls hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>oil which is a good description b/c it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all (unless you use too much).  </li>
            <li>This product is wonderful, it tames my very curly hair nicely and cuts way back on the frizz</li>
            <li>The bottle was very full it has a pump and not a dropper the instructions are easy to read and follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love, love, love Can&#x27;t say enough good things About It.</li>
            <li>I can tell that the nuts were not roasted before extracting the oils because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong nutty smell to it.</li>
            <li>The soles of my feet and my feet in general are happy campers.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent brand of Virgin Argan Oil in a 4 oz dark bottle.  </li>
            <li>Had minor issues and questions for this item upon delivery but the seller was more than happy to offer immediate solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, so I have a lot of fly-away hair.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs easily, has the light, roasted nutty aroma that it should have.</li>
            <li>Very light weight, absorbs fast with a nice mild nutty smell.  </li>
            <li>Use this product as a beard softener - simple, easy to use, with great results for softening your beard.</li>
            <li>This brightens and gives the skin a certain kind of glow.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the oil is not greasy and is absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth and silky</li>
            <li>Leaves bears much softer and manageable, than the Honest Amish Beard Balm I had been using.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO folks you need not look further for a great product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy the cheap stuff.</li>

            <li>Love this will buy again soon as i need more thanks</li>
            <li>This has a very mild, almost unnoticeable nutty smell that disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>This seems  to be much more pure than the oil available in stores.</li>
            <li>Absorbs into hair - great for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product for dry hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff is cheaper, you get way more, and it&#x27;s worked far better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Also using as a night time moisturizer on my face, and it is very smooth and non greasy, absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li>matters most with Argan oil is that it is 100% pure with no filler oils included.</li>
            <li>When I rubbed my hands together it warmed right up!</li>
            <li>They mash up the nuts and this amazing natural oil</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great on my skin – soaks right in and keeps it moisturized for a long time without making it greasy.</li>
            <li>fresh clean smelling product.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in my skin quickly and feels hydrating on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not allowed to say, but I&#x27;m sure glad to have this by my bed as my back heals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My doctors at Mayo are amazed at how quickly the scar is minimizing.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs super quickly, which I love!&lt;br /&gt;Face</li>
            <li>This works great without weighing her hair down.  </li>
            <li>It is very silky and absorbs very quickly so it does not feel oily.  </li>
            <li>My skin was once very oily and broke out easily.</li>
            <li>I really like the brand since its product is organic and pure, without any additives which I think is very important.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the NorthCoast Products offers an amazing quality of 100% pure organic Argan oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the NorthCoast Products offers an amazing quality of 100% pure organic Argan oil.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is truly worth it.</li>
            <li>For some reason my head has gotten more sensitive with with age.</li>
            <li>The 4 oz size is a nice big bottle, and I was pleasantly surprised that it came with a pump top, though the dropper style is shown in the pictures.</li>
            <li>So far I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>It eliminates dryness and leaves my skin so soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>This oil is as good as the other one, but the price is about 40% lower.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>It was delivered super fast, two days right after I had placed my order.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, makes your hair soft and manageble, easily absorbed on a facial skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs super fast and is working wonders for my hair nails and face.</li>
            <li>Clear and easy to read</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that this time it has an eye dropper top rather than the pump top, as this makes it easier to get just the right amount, since you need only a few drops per use.</li>
            <li>It is also very reasonably priced...</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who wants a HEALTHY, ORGANIC, NATURAL, &amp; PURE product that will transform the look of their skin and nails.</li>
            <li>This oil feels like the real deal !</li>
            <li>The bottle came in the mail hot, and I hope that the heat does not alter the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to get it Friday evening because my back had started to spasm again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will keep an eye out for more products from them in the future.</li>
            <li>I mix a couple of drops with my regular moisturizer for an even better smoothness and glow.</li>
            <li>I feel like if you know nothing about using organic oils Argan Oil should be first on your list to learn about.</li>
            <li>Another benefit is that you&#x27;ll see results upon using it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried this on my hair and find that it adds necessary oils and makes it look a lot healthier and provides significantly more shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Argan oil is a staple in my beauty care - I use it on my face, body, hair and nails, sometimes on its own, sometimes ading 2-3 drops into other products (face and body moisturizer, hair conditioner etc.).</li>
            <li>He contacted me promptly and also encouraged me to give him honest feedback - he really wants to hear what his buyers think!&lt;br /&gt;It shipped faster than I expected, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am a professional blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs so quickly and leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It absorbs so quickly and leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Its pure with no chemicals.</li>
            <li>It is 100% pure organic without a smell.</li>
            <li>Since it is pure argan oil and organic</li>
            <li>NorthCoast Products have claims on the bottle that it is 100% pure organic Argan oil, Fragrance-free, No preservatives, and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>This is 100% pure argon oil.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling great, but the odor is a little less pleasant than other brands.</li>
            <li>Large bottle reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I was so worried when I first wanted to try Argan oils from my dry and frizzy hair that broke easily.</li>
            <li>Straight from the bottle on our face.</li>
            <li>Ditch the cheap, chemical, watered-down stuff you&#x27;ve been using and buy this product for the same price.</li>
            <li>Surely, it was not what I had expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Non greasy but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write Amazon reviews very often, but I didn&#x27;t see any mentioning muscle pain</li>
            <li>It also works very well on my husband&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li>Reasonably price and works well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I use them for my hair and it makes me hair so much shinier and smoother.</li>
            <li>Now my whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>I really take care of my skin</li>
            <li>, so it amaze me how it really works.</li>
            <li>You will be amazed at how fast this absorbs into your hair.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have too much of a scent so no battle of the smells going on in the nose which is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>Much better than a couple other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It does has a very, very faint &amp; wonderful earthy odor if you really sniff it otherwise</li>
            <li>Great results for my dry hair using surprisingly little of this product.</li>
            <li>It was packaged nicely for the use of a small quantity at a time.</li>
            <li>Many argan oils now sold have additives or are combined with other seed or plant oils to reduce the cost; I prefer the purity of this product, and it&#x27;s inexpensive!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this 100% pure Argan oil for a few weeks now, and I must admit I really love it.  </li>
            <li>According to one website, it should have 100% organic argan oil (no other ingredients), a dark colored glass bottle (no plastic or clear bottles), a light nutty smell, and not be too cheap since it takes so much manual labor to make.  </li>
            <li>Easy to order, product arrived before expected.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the results on my hair.</li>
            <li>I mainly use this for hair care needs.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>high quality oil, but the bottle is not leak-proof, and lost 10 % of the oil content during shipment ( oil stain on the cartoon box attested to this leakage), need to improve your bottle cap system</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High quality Aryan oil.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>NorthCoast Products offers a 100% pure organic Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I use it on my acne-prone face with no breakouts, on my hair as a leave in and heat protector, and on any areas that need a little more TLC (elbows, cuticles, etc).</li>
            <li>So far haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>And now that I also apply it to my hair, instead of biosilk, before I flat iron my hair, I&#x27;m able to flat iron my hair as often as I like without worrying about damaging my hair!</li>
            <li>The 4 oz bottle is very large compared to others on the market and will easily last for 6-9 months or longer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells just slightly nutty, but it&#x27;s a very mild odor.</li>
            <li>it let my hair stay silky, tangle free, and straight (I flat iron it) all day long.</li>
            <li>all natural 100% organic oil can also be a LOT healthier than exposing our skin to all the chemicals in the normal creams we&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>local health store was out of argan oil, so I found this on Amazon and was able to receive it the same day, for about a third of the cost including delivery!</li>
            <li>It seems to be helping so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about this one - the ends of my hair are not any softer and if I use more then my hair looks greasy.  </li>
            <li>ON MY 61 yr old skin!</li>
            <li>WOW !</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin areas and a little drop goes a long away.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, it may be because my skin is so dry, but this was absorbed almost immediately and did not feel greasy.</li>
            <li>This is not even pure Argan oil, it is fluidy, it is transparent, it is oily, and you can smell the sunflower oil as soon as you open the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Your face feels so soft and also your hair has no split ends .</li>
            <li>that I bought a bottle for each of my adult daughters for Christmas.</li>
            <li>o far.</li>
            <li>However, my cuticles are soft and have a youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only product she wants to use on her hair now.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised.</li>
            <li>Using the oil on my hair gave it some shine and made it soft.</li>
            <li>So far the virgin argan oil doesn&#x27;t make my head break out.</li>
            <li>NorthCoast Products is definitely the real deal.</li>
            <li>I put a few drops on my hands and rub them through my hair after a shower, and it leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I use it along with a silicone-free styling gel on my naturally curly hair and it keeps my curls soft, shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no reaction thus far.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it as well for the same purposes and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the oil because it really works.</li>
            <li>it is a natural part of the process and does not affect the quality at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking to go natural for a moisturizer, both men, and women.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking to go natural for a moisturizer, both men, and women.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Argan oil because I wanted to try something natural</li>
            <li>but I just added a few drops essential oils :-)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and scalp and have had no sensitivity issues whatsoever with this product and it has really helped my dry scalp (and nails).</li>
            <li>This winter was colder than most, and my wife and I suffered from dry skin worse than usual.&lt;br /&gt;After trying many other things, we started using this Argan oil and our skin showed immediate improvements.&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes</li>
            <li>Fine lines are starting to become less apparent.</li>
            <li>product also works exceptionally well on my face and body to assist in keeping my skin soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;Although this product is used daily, it seems to last for a long time as only a small amount is needed to achieve desired results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>of the things that I like the most about this Argan oil, is that it only requires a very small amount each time you use it.</li>
            <li>It has even helped to clear up some patches of psoriasis and has softened and diminished some scarring that my husband and I have from recent surgeries.</li>
            <li>I also used it on my hair to smooth the ends, you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li>I ordered another bottle in case the price was going to rise in the near future.  </li>
            <li>- I spread a tiny amount on my face after washing, and since it absorbs so quickly it didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>but it is not dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li>- I massaged a little into my damp hair at the ends, it calmed flyways and made it feel pretty</li>
            <li>I have been using it fairly consistently for a few months now and am already seeing results with regard to my facial acne.  </li>
            <li>But, really, though it seems odd, I know, I caution you in regard to potential ant problems with (again, perhaps all) argan oil.</li>
            <li>The results have been very encouraging, as the product definitely works extremely well to alleviate dry skin and</li>

            <li> After using the product ONCE I was able to tell a difference and have already recommended it to 4-5 friends.</li>
            <li> I really love how my skin feels and the appearance of my skin is improving.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few Argan oils and this one seems to be the best, particularly because it is organic, is the largest size (4 oz.) of the others,  AND is the best price.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  </li>
            <li> Great value for the size, and has that classic Argan Oil smell and texture.</li>
            <li> and I have pretty good skin to begin with.  </li>
            <li> bottom lie is that this product is fairly priced and works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and am always searching for something to moisturizes my skin, this the best I have found.</li>
            <li> Awesome for menopausal skin getting dry.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m incredibly happy with how soft and healthy my skin looks.</li>

            <li> oil which is a good description b/c it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all (unless you use too much).  </li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, it tames my very curly hair nicely and cuts way back on the frizz</li>
            <li> The bottle was very full it has a pump and not a dropper the instructions are easy to read and follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love, love, love Can&#x27;t say enough good things About It.</li>
            <li> I can tell that the nuts were not roasted before extracting the oils because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong nutty smell to it.</li>
            <li> The soles of my feet and my feet in general are happy campers.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brand of Virgin Argan Oil in a 4 oz dark bottle.  </li>

            <li> My hair is fine, so I have a lot of fly-away hair.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs easily, has the light, roasted nutty aroma that it should have.</li>
            <li> Very light weight, absorbs fast with a nice mild nutty smell.  </li>
            <li> Use this product as a beard softener - simple, easy to use, with great results for softening your beard.</li>
            <li> This brightens and gives the skin a certain kind of glow.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the oil is not greasy and is absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth and silky</li>
            <li> Leaves bears much softer and manageable, than the Honest Amish Beard Balm I had been using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO folks you need not look further for a great product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> I liked too much...</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and silky</li>
            <li> This stuff is a fabulous skin moisturizer for all over.</li>
            <li> shipping (literally arrived the next day) and great packaging-</li>
            <li> did get this product free for review.</li>
            <li> was great, for North Coast, I would just say tighten the bottles more, 2 leaked, not much but</li>
            <li> Love this will buy again soon as i need more thanks</li>
            <li> This has a very mild, almost unnoticeable nutty smell that disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> This seems  to be much more pure than the oil available in stores.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into hair - great for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Great product for dry hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is cheaper, you get way more, and it&#x27;s worked far better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Also using as a night time moisturizer on my face, and it is very smooth and non greasy, absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li> matters most with Argan oil is that it is 100% pure with no filler oils included.</li>
            <li> When I rubbed my hands together it warmed right up!</li>
            <li> They mash up the nuts and this amazing natural oil</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great on my skin – soaks right in and keeps it moisturized for a long time without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> fresh clean smelling product.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in my skin quickly and feels hydrating on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not allowed to say, but I&#x27;m sure glad to have this by my bed as my back heals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My doctors at Mayo are amazed at how quickly the scar is minimizing.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs super quickly, which I love!&lt;br /&gt;Face</li>
            <li> This works great without weighing her hair down.  </li>
            <li> It is very silky and absorbs very quickly so it does not feel oily.  </li>
            <li> My skin was once very oily and broke out easily.</li>
            <li> I really like the brand since its product is organic and pure, without any additives which I think is very important.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the NorthCoast Products offers an amazing quality of 100% pure organic Argan oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the NorthCoast Products offers an amazing quality of 100% pure organic Argan oil.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is truly worth it.</li>
            <li> For some reason my head has gotten more sensitive with with age.</li>
            <li> The 4 oz size is a nice big bottle, and I was pleasantly surprised that it came with a pump top, though the dropper style is shown in the pictures.</li>
            <li> So far I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> It eliminates dryness and leaves my skin so soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> This oil is as good as the other one, but the price is about 40% lower.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> It was delivered super fast, two days right after I had placed my order.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, makes your hair soft and manageble, easily absorbed on a facial skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs super fast and is working wonders for my hair nails and face.</li>
            <li> Clear and easy to read</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that this time it has an eye dropper top rather than the pump top, as this makes it easier to get just the right amount, since you need only a few drops per use.</li>
            <li> It is also very reasonably priced...</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who wants a HEALTHY, ORGANIC, NATURAL, &amp; PURE product that will transform the look of their skin and nails.</li>
            <li> This oil feels like the real deal !</li>
            <li> The bottle came in the mail hot, and I hope that the heat does not alter the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to get it Friday evening because my back had started to spasm again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will keep an eye out for more products from them in the future.</li>
            <li> I mix a couple of drops with my regular moisturizer for an even better smoothness and glow.</li>
            <li> I feel like if you know nothing about using organic oils Argan Oil should be first on your list to learn about.</li>
            <li> Another benefit is that you&#x27;ll see results upon using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried this on my hair and find that it adds necessary oils and makes it look a lot healthier and provides significantly more shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Argan oil is a staple in my beauty care - I use it on my face, body, hair and nails, sometimes on its own, sometimes ading 2-3 drops into other products (face and body moisturizer, hair conditioner etc.).</li>
            <li> He contacted me promptly and also encouraged me to give him honest feedback - he really wants to hear what his buyers think!&lt;br /&gt;It shipped faster than I expected, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a professional blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs so quickly and leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It absorbs so quickly and leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Its pure with no chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is 100% pure organic without a smell.</li>
            <li> Since it is pure argan oil and organic</li>
            <li> NorthCoast Products have claims on the bottle that it is 100% pure organic Argan oil, Fragrance-free, No preservatives, and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> This is 100% pure argon oil.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling great, but the odor is a little less pleasant than other brands.</li>
            <li> Large bottle reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I was so worried when I first wanted to try Argan oils from my dry and frizzy hair that broke easily.</li>
            <li> Straight from the bottle on our face.</li>
            <li> Ditch the cheap, chemical, watered-down stuff you&#x27;ve been using and buy this product for the same price.</li>
            <li> Surely, it was not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Non greasy but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write Amazon reviews very often, but I didn&#x27;t see any mentioning muscle pain</li>
            <li> It also works very well on my husband&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> Reasonably price and works well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use them for my hair and it makes me hair so much shinier and smoother.</li>
            <li> Now my whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> I really take care of my skin</li>
            <li> , so it amaze me how it really works.</li>
            <li> You will be amazed at how fast this absorbs into your hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have too much of a scent so no battle of the smells going on in the nose which is a bonus.  </li>
            <li> Much better than a couple other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It does has a very, very faint &amp; wonderful earthy odor if you really sniff it otherwise</li>
            <li> Great results for my dry hair using surprisingly little of this product.</li>
            <li> It was packaged nicely for the use of a small quantity at a time.</li>
            <li> Many argan oils now sold have additives or are combined with other seed or plant oils to reduce the cost; I prefer the purity of this product, and it&#x27;s inexpensive!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 100% pure Argan oil for a few weeks now, and I must admit I really love it.  </li>
            <li> According to one website, it should have 100% organic argan oil (no other ingredients), a dark colored glass bottle (no plastic or clear bottles), a light nutty smell, and not be too cheap since it takes so much manual labor to make.  </li>
            <li> Easy to order, product arrived before expected.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the results on my hair.</li>
            <li> I mainly use this for hair care needs.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> high quality oil, but the bottle is not leak-proof, and lost 10 % of the oil content during shipment ( oil stain on the cartoon box attested to this leakage), need to improve your bottle cap system</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High quality Aryan oil.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> NorthCoast Products offers a 100% pure organic Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I use it on my acne-prone face with no breakouts, on my hair as a leave in and heat protector, and on any areas that need a little more TLC (elbows, cuticles, etc).</li>
            <li> So far haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> And now that I also apply it to my hair, instead of biosilk, before I flat iron my hair, I&#x27;m able to flat iron my hair as often as I like without worrying about damaging my hair!</li>
            <li> The 4 oz bottle is very large compared to others on the market and will easily last for 6-9 months or longer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells just slightly nutty, but it&#x27;s a very mild odor.</li>
            <li> it let my hair stay silky, tangle free, and straight (I flat iron it) all day long.</li>
            <li> all natural 100% organic oil can also be a LOT healthier than exposing our skin to all the chemicals in the normal creams we&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> local health store was out of argan oil, so I found this on Amazon and was able to receive it the same day, for about a third of the cost including delivery!</li>
            <li> It seems to be helping so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this one - the ends of my hair are not any softer and if I use more then my hair looks greasy.  </li>
            <li> ON MY 61 yr old skin!</li>
            <li> WOW !</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin areas and a little drop goes a long away.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, it may be because my skin is so dry, but this was absorbed almost immediately and did not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This is not even pure Argan oil, it is fluidy, it is transparent, it is oily, and you can smell the sunflower oil as soon as you open the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Your face feels so soft and also your hair has no split ends .</li>
            <li> that I bought a bottle for each of my adult daughters for Christmas.</li>
            <li> o far.</li>
            <li> However, my cuticles are soft and have a youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the only product she wants to use on her hair now.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised.</li>
            <li> Using the oil on my hair gave it some shine and made it soft.</li>
            <li> So far the virgin argan oil doesn&#x27;t make my head break out.</li>
            <li> NorthCoast Products is definitely the real deal.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my hands and rub them through my hair after a shower, and it leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I use it along with a silicone-free styling gel on my naturally curly hair and it keeps my curls soft, shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no reaction thus far.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it as well for the same purposes and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the oil because it really works.</li>
            <li> it is a natural part of the process and does not affect the quality at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone looking to go natural for a moisturizer, both men, and women.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone looking to go natural for a moisturizer, both men, and women.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Argan oil because I wanted to try something natural</li>
            <li> but I just added a few drops essential oils :-)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and scalp and have had no sensitivity issues whatsoever with this product and it has really helped my dry scalp (and nails).</li>
            <li> This winter was colder than most, and my wife and I suffered from dry skin worse than usual.&lt;br /&gt;After trying many other things, we started using this Argan oil and our skin showed immediate improvements.&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes</li>
            <li> Fine lines are starting to become less apparent.</li>
            <li> product also works exceptionally well on my face and body to assist in keeping my skin soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;Although this product is used daily, it seems to last for a long time as only a small amount is needed to achieve desired results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> of the things that I like the most about this Argan oil, is that it only requires a very small amount each time you use it.</li>
            <li> It has even helped to clear up some patches of psoriasis and has softened and diminished some scarring that my husband and I have from recent surgeries.</li>
            <li> I also used it on my hair to smooth the ends, you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> I ordered another bottle in case the price was going to rise in the near future.  </li>
            <li> - I spread a tiny amount on my face after washing, and since it absorbs so quickly it didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> but it is not dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> - I massaged a little into my damp hair at the ends, it calmed flyways and made it feel pretty</li>
            <li> I have been using it fairly consistently for a few months now and am already seeing results with regard to my facial acne.  </li>
            <li> But, really, though it seems odd, I know, I caution you in regard to potential ant problems with (again, perhaps all) argan oil.</li>
            <li> The results have been very encouraging, as the product definitely works extremely well to alleviate dry skin and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not grease, no fragrant, and with just a few drop (8 to be exact, I have a waist long hair)</li>
            <li> the oil does take a little while to be absorbed, but prefer it to lotions with other ingredients i can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> when applying at bedtime, the next morning, although the surface of my hands feel soft, the knuckles feel dry and rough.  </li>
            <li> It really helps my dry and brittle nails and ugly cuticles look much better.  </li>
            <li> And it certainly didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin like argan oil usually does.</li>
            <li> I noticed that with lotion my hands would feel dry hours later, but with this stuff I could still feel the oil in my skin 24 hours later.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give a review.</li>
            <li> My hair dried normally.</li>
            <li> I could see a clear and immediate difference - that hand that I used the Argan Oil on no longer had dry cuticles and was softer than the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the particular oil I received had gone rancid, or this is just the smell of the oil.  </li>
            <li> It goes on well, soaks in nicely, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and I have no complaints from the kids about it hurting their hands afterwards like I do with some lotions.  </li>
            <li> Use sparingly, goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use organ oil on my daughter long hair it keeps it beautyful.</li>
            <li> I thought it would look greasy and be weighed down, with hair like mine which is to the middle of my back it can be a nightmare</li>
            <li> /&gt;It adds luster to my hair and does not permit dry patches on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;As far as using it for fingernails, I am not sure as I recently had my acrylics removed.  </li>
            <li> I use a few drops on my damp freshly washed hair before blow drying it and a few drops on my face about every other night as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I tested this on my hands/cuticles shortly after getting it by putting it on one hand and not the other.</li>
            <li> I am using this for my kids&#x27; dry and cracked hands which bother them every winter.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my legs after shaving as I get eczema in the winter when my skin is particularly dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I get a really dry forehead and hands in the winter.</li>
            <li> I bought Virgin Argan Oil hoping that it could help to moist my dry, processed hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face to clear up the dried spots from winter and this cold spring, and in my hair before I wash it to add moisture to it and to make it snarl free.  </li>
            <li> like the natural very slight aroma that it has too, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy like other oils</li>
            <li> It helps to diminish wrinkles and dry skin!  </li>
            <li> I have previously used argan oil from a different company, but their prices went up, so I wanted to try a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> I also have very dry skin on my shins to the point where my skin has vertical lines from tanning.  </li>
            <li> As an elderly woman, my skin is very dry</li>
            <li> , he&#x27;s a diabetic and his skin gets very dry.  </li>
            <li> I use it to help tame my daughters half curly and half straight hair twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I can rub a few drops in my hands and run through my hair the next day and renew the softness and shine.</li>
            <li> And just remember, a little bit goes a long way…I used it everywhere, and I think when I was trying it on my hair</li>
            <li> and I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain the perfumes other &amp;#34;argan oil treatments&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t contain silicones as other argan oil treatments do, it soaks into my hair and helps it hold moisture without building up.</li>
            <li> I also use it for my face every other night instead of night cream</li>
            <li> All the store brands I found contained a lot of other junk products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this issue with any other argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of Argan Oil</li>
            <li> In addition, unlike a lot of other products that I&#x27;ve used, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s hard with oils, and then when being shipped by planes the pressure can open them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This oil does not clog my pores and seems to be minimizing my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Its does have a scent, it smells like dried jackfruit chips but that goes away after the oil sinks in.</li>
            <li> I reside in a dry climate and although I have used a quality hair conditioner in the past, nothing</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time on other &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; oils.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair for about half an hour before I wash it.  </li>
            <li> My hair breaks less since I started using</li>
            <li> My hair breaks less since I started using</li>
            <li> I would not have bought this product if it were not organic, and first cold press...</li>
            <li> I introduced it to my granddaughter who has long thick hair</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan oil for a little over two weeks</li>
            <li> I tried leaving in olive oil in my hair an hour before I wash my hair and that had helped a little.</li>
            <li> Until I tried it and was amazed at how little of an amount you need to use of the oil to get results.</li>
            <li> Until I tried it and was amazed at how little of an amount you need to use of the oil to get results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been reading about the health benefits, and I was amped to try some out on my skin, especially my cuticles, face, and tough summer-hardened</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think sensitive people would find it difficult at all.</li>
            <li> this quality!&lt;br /&gt;Totally a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using this, I noticed changes in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It is not quite as thick as some other Argan oils I&#x27;ve used before, and I think that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> It does everything, and no strong smell, don&#x27;t like smells in products.  </li>
            <li> After spending the day with my kids outside with these cold spring days with the wind blowing, on my face and skin it creates dry cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> The product has no scent and comes in a small plain box.</li>
            <li> My entire morning was solving that extremely unsettling situation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this bottle, but it didn&#x27;t have the nutty smell of argan oil.</li>
            <li> Using just one pump every other day after washing my (thin) hair, and it is stronger and silkier.  </li>
            <li> In the case of mine, it became extremely dry and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard because my skin hates everything I put on it including lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too thick and makes your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;bought some for my husband whose hands crack in winter, serious cracks in the fingertips.  </li>
            <li> This time of year is awful for your skin, at least if you live in the north.</li>
            <li> broken out,</li>
            <li> Well, sorry to say</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to return.</li>
            <li> You wont&#x27; go wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m not an aragon oil fan.  </li>
            <li> but it stinks.</li>
            <li> It was so bad I ended up in the emergency room.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any particles in the oil, which probably means it was filtered for them, but this isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product three times and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate greasy oils on my hands.</li>
            <li> Awful!!!</li>
            <li> It smells terrible!  </li>
            <li> This oil smells AWFUL.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is an awesome product. Your face feels so soft and also your hair has no split ends . It is a great product you can use on all parts of your body, and leaves it soft</li>
            <li> This is the best. I have really dry skin and am always searching for something to moisturizes my skin, this the best I have found. Love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Quality product!! We put it in lotion and use it as a body lotion. Straight from the bottle on our face.</li>
            <li> The product has no scent and comes in a small plain box.</li>
            <li> What a bargain, loving it for my hands, skin and hair! Great seller, will buy again!</li>
            <li> Pretty good, makes your hair soft and manageble, easily absorbed on a facial skin. Could be greasy if applied more than 2-3 drops on a hair.</li>
            <li> Had minor issues and questions for this item upon delivery but the seller was more than happy to offer immediate solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the oil itself, it works great!! It absorbs super fast and is working wonders for my hair nails and face.</li>
            <li> skin type: combination&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;haven&#x27;t broken out, face feels moisturized, pores look smaller, and skin feels smoother. the oil does take a little while to be absorbed, but prefer it to lotions with other ingredients i can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible!  I have been using it fairly consistently for a few months now and am already seeing results with regard to my facial acne.  I also know one of the co-founders of North Coast Products personally.  He is an excellent businessman who would not be investing and selling a product that he didn&#x27;t believe would be super beneficial and effective.  Go Virgin Argan Oil!  This stuff is the bomb-diggity!  Yes!  Awesome!  Rocks the house!</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan oil for a little over two weeks and I have noticed it has reduced the bumps on my upper arms. I also have very dry skin on my shins to the point where my skin has vertical lines from tanning.  The lines are still there but it is not dry and flaky.  I love the fact that the oil is not greasy and is absorbed into the skin.  I only use it on my hair before bed because my hair looks greasy. I am still waiting on the results on my hair.</li>
            <li> This oil feels like the real deal !&lt;br /&gt;No complaints it&#x27;s smooth and silky</li>
            <li> Love, love, love Can&#x27;t say enough good things About It. I use  everywhere!</li>
            <li> Works well, loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 100% pure Argan oil for a few weeks now, and I must admit I really love it.  Ditch the cheap, chemical, watered-down stuff you&#x27;ve been using and buy this product for the same price.</li>
            <li> Leaves bears much softer and manageable, than the Honest Amish Beard Balm I had been using.</li>
            <li> Very good, the product arriven on time we are going to try the oil but we&#x27;ve heard excelent reviews so i think it will work perfectly</li>
            <li> It was delivered super fast, two days right after I had placed my order. IT CAME SEALED 😊. I was a bit mislead, the product came with a pump,not a dropper so I can not control the amount that come out. The bottle came in the mail hot, and I hope that the heat does not alter the product.Its does have a scent, it smells like dried jackfruit chips but that goes away after the oil sinks in.</li>
            <li> A great product that I use as beard oil!</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second bottle of this product. I&#x27;m glad that this time it has an eye dropper top rather than the pump top, as this makes it easier to get just the right amount, since you need only a few drops per use. I have very sensitive skin and scalp and have had no sensitivity issues whatsoever with this product and it has really helped my dry scalp (and nails). Argan oil is sometimes called a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil which is a good description b/c it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all (unless you use too much).  I use a few drops on my damp freshly washed hair before blow drying it and a few drops on my face about every other night as a moisturizer. I like it enough that I bought a bottle for each of my adult daughters for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, it tames my very curly hair nicely and cuts way back on the frizz</li>
            <li> fresh clean smelling product.  a pleasure to use...all the good results you expect from argan oil.</li>
            <li> Like some others who have posted reviews, I had a sense that the oil I received was rancid. Surely, it was not what I had expected. HOWEVER, though this is not the fault of the seller, be forewarned that this stuff--perhaps, all argan oil--will bring ants to places you had never seen ants before. Truly.&lt;br /&gt;Some oil got on the outside of the bottle, I guess, before I used it and placed it in the medicine cabinet. The next morning the sink and the wall, with a trail leading up to the cabinet was &amp;#34;crazy with&amp;#34; ants. Where were these ants going? You guessed it. To the argan oil bottle, which was also covered with ants.My entire morning was solving that extremely unsettling situation. But, really, though it seems odd, I know, I caution you in regard to potential ant problems with (again, perhaps all) argan oil.</li>
            <li> I love the oils I think is good quality.</li>
            <li> Initially it seems like it&#x27;s going to hydrate the skin.  Take the hands, for instance ... when applying at bedtime, the next morning, although the surface of my hands feel soft, the knuckles feel dry and rough.  So the following night I concentrated the oil on my knuckles.  Same result.  I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m not an aragon oil fan.  I had such high hopes - they just didn&#x27;t pan out.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this Argan Oil. For the price, it is truly worth it. Since I&#x27;m on a budget, I use this a lot all over my body. Please dont&#x27; go up in price because this is really an excellent buy and the product is very good on your skin, hair, nails, including face. I wish I could afford to purchase 5 bottles at a time but for now, I can only afford one at a time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS OIL!  It does everything, and no strong smell, don&#x27;t like smells in products.  Also it&#x27;s 100% which you can&#x27;t find for this price.&lt;br /&gt;Service was great, for North Coast, I would just say tighten the bottles more, 2 leaked, not much but the did.  I know it&#x27;s hard with oils, and then when being shipped by planes the pressure can open them.&lt;br /&gt;SO folks you need not look further for a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil for your hair and skin.  I use it on my hair for about half an hour before I wash it.  Use it on your body after a shower.  Its pure with no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am using this oil for my hair and it&#x27;s too thick and makes your hair look greasy. Awful!!!</li>
            <li> Afghan oil is truly liquid gold. And this brand is more than perfect. I Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Will definitely order my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works as advertised. I use this oil on my beard/face. Works just as well as products 4 times the price.</li>
            <li> I love it o far. I&#x27;m going to be ordering more in the future. Thanks</li>
            <li> Works great for the price, would buy again.</li>
            <li> great produce, as an Esthetician I have already recommended this product to my clients.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it is muti-purpose.&lt;br /&gt;My hair absorbs the oil and I use the oil daily.  I reside in a dry climate and although I have used a quality hair conditioner in the past, nothing&lt;br /&gt;works as well as the Virgin Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;This product also works exceptionally well on my face and body to assist in keeping my skin soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;Although this product is used daily, it seems to last for a long time as only a small amount is needed to achieve desired results.&lt;br /&gt;It adds luster to my hair and does not permit dry patches on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;As far as using it for fingernails, I am not sure as I recently had my acrylics removed.  However, my cuticles are soft and have a youthful appearance.  The soles of my feet and my feet in general are happy campers.</li>
            <li> Easy to order, product arrived before expected.  Large bottle reasonably priced.  Use it every day and night.</li>
            <li> Great product! I introduced it to my granddaughter who has long thick hair and it&#x27;s the only product she wants to use on her hair now. The oil gives a beautiful shine and I believe my hair has started growing at a faster rate. I&#x27;ve purchased this product three times and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> After spending the day with my kids outside with these cold spring days with the wind blowing, on my face and skin it creates dry cracked skin.  This is where I turn to NorthCoast Argan Oil.  It is 100% pure organic without a smell. I use it on my face to clear up the dried spots from winter and this cold spring, and in my hair before I wash it to add moisture to it and to make it snarl free.  This has become my go to product for any problems that me and my family have when it comes to our hair and skin.  Not only that my husband wants to use it on his face after he shaves and on his dried out work hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years and love it.  It does has a very, very faint &amp; wonderful earthy odor if you really sniff it otherwise I don&#x27;t notice a smell.  It soaks in my skin quickly and feels hydrating on the skin.</li>
            <li> Love love love this Argan oil! It does wonders to my frizzy hair and also I use it as a mosteriser at night. Very good.</li>
            <li> This winter was colder than most, and my wife and I suffered from dry skin worse than usual.&lt;br /&gt;After trying many other things, we started using this Argan oil and our skin showed immediate improvements.&lt;br /&gt;Using all natural 100% organic oil can also be a LOT healthier than exposing our skin to all the chemicals in the normal creams we&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I like the natural very slight aroma that it has too, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy like other oils I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also is great to put in your hair.  It keeps it from getting frizzy and gives a nice, healthy sheen to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way to go NorthCoast!  Thanks for a great product!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. My skin loves this oil. Non greasy but very moisturizing. Don&#x27;t buy the cheap stuff. Get this brand. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I felt it was a very good value. It was packaged nicely for the use of a small quantity at a time. I would have preferred an appropriate fragrance versus none..</li>
            <li> Virgin Argan Oil Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy to receive this Aragan Oil The bottle was very full it has a pump and not a dropper the instructions are easy to read and follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features&lt;br /&gt;Get softer more healthy hair, nails and skin&lt;br /&gt;Works for anyone any age&lt;br /&gt;Cold pressed,&lt;br /&gt;Certified organic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked most is how my body, skin and nails are looking and feeling healthy</li>
            <li> I recently slipped on ice and threw out my lower back. It was so bad I ended up in the emergency room. This oil was recommended to me by a friend from India while I was healing. She told me to rub some in my hands and over the area that hurt and then rub it into the soles of my feet. That way it makes a connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My local health store was out of argan oil, so I found this on Amazon and was able to receive it the same day, for about a third of the cost including delivery! I was so glad to get it Friday evening because my back had started to spasm again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells just slightly nutty, but it&#x27;s a very mild odor. I don&#x27;t think sensitive people would find it difficult at all. When I rubbed my hands together it warmed right up! I was so surprised. I rubbed it on my lower back and the soles of my feet and what can I say? I felt nice relief almost immediately and the warming sensation was so healing. Was it the oil? I&#x27;m not allowed to say, but I&#x27;m sure glad to have this by my bed as my back heals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suffer from eczema during these winters and this helped with that as well. I hate greasy oils on my hands. Let me tell you, it may be because my skin is so dry, but this was absorbed almost immediately and did not feel greasy. I woke up with no scent on my hands. Believe me, I love shea butter and it works wonderfully but it stinks. So I&#x27;m glad to have this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller also provided an ebook to help me learn more about this fascinating oil. Check it out online to see how they use it in Morocco! I don&#x27;t write Amazon reviews very often, but I didn&#x27;t see any mentioning muscle pain so I wanted to add one for that.</li>
            <li> Argan is called liquid gold and I can see why it is so called  Your skin will love it  Best beauty regime without the chemicals of other products&lt;br /&gt;worth every penny</li>
            <li> It is AMAZING! This Argan oil is wonderful AND versatile.  I use it every night around my eyes, lips, neck and chest.  I even put it on my hands and heels.  It is very silky and absorbs very quickly so it does not feel oily.  It has even helped to clear up some patches of psoriasis and has softened and diminished some scarring that my husband and I have from recent surgeries. The 4 oz bottle is very large compared to others on the market and will easily last for 6-9 months or longer.  I am VERY pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great product from a great seller!</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  As an elderly woman, my skin is very dry and I use this product after bathing to moisturize  my skin.  I have also used it on my hair to add moisture and shine.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good skin and hair treatment.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is the perfect beauty product for your hair and skin.  It helps to diminish wrinkles and dry skin!  My hair is fine, so I have a lot of fly-away hair.  I put 3-4 drops of Argan Oil in my hands, rub them together and rub my hands through my hair and I don&#x27;t have anymore fly-aways!  It&#x27;s great for re-hydrating your hair, as well as your skin.  It also works very well on my husband&#x27;s skin, he&#x27;s a diabetic and his skin gets very dry.  Argan Oil is an AWESOME product and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try Argan oil on my skin and hair to see how well it works.  Since it&#x27;s the latest greatest thing there tends to be people selling fakes to rip people off so I researched how to find the ones that were legit.  According to one website, it should have 100% organic argan oil (no other ingredients), a dark colored glass bottle (no plastic or clear bottles), a light nutty smell, and not be too cheap since it takes so much manual labor to make.  This stuff matched all of those criteria so I am sure I wasn&#x27;t spending a ton of money to buy a bottle vegetable oil labeled argan oil.  I was impressed with how non-greasy the oil is and how well it absorbs into your skin. I noticed that with lotion my hands would feel dry hours later, but with this stuff I could still feel the oil in my skin 24 hours later.  Using the oil on my hair gave it some shine and made it soft.</li>
            <li> I liked too much...I feeling my skin change. ...it&#x27;s so good. ..thank</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product and results.</li>
            <li> Awesome for menopausal skin getting dry. My skin was once very oily and broke out easily. This oil does not clog my pores and seems to be minimizing my dark spots. I would never expect these results! I use it on my hair and hands as well. Use sparingly, goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using the oil on a 20 inch surgical scar.  My doctors at Mayo are amazed at how quickly the scar is minimizing.  They have said they are recommending it to all their surgery patients.  Also, I mix it with my nighttime face moisturizer.  My chronic acne is gone and my complexion is clearer than it has been in decades.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Much better than a couple other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  Reasonably price and works well.  Very light weight, absorbs fast with a nice mild nutty smell.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is not even pure Argan oil, it is fluidy, it is transparent, it is oily, and you can smell the sunflower oil as soon as you open the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Argan oil  for almost 6 years now and have no clue how ecocert certified this quality!&lt;br /&gt;Totally a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am using this for my kids&#x27; dry and cracked hands which bother them every winter.  It goes on well, soaks in nicely, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and I have no complaints from the kids about it hurting their hands afterwards like I do with some lotions.  It seems to be helping so far!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! I started to see a difference in my skin on the third day. It&#x27;s been a week now and I&#x27;m incredibly happy with how soft and healthy my skin looks. My cosmetics last longer throughout the day and I even apply them lighter now. I&#x27;m purchasing this for my mother and daughter. This product is a must have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few Argan oils and this one seems to be the best, particularly because it is organic, is the largest size (4 oz.) of the others,  AND is the best price.</li>
            <li> This seems  to be much more pure than the oil available in stores. For some reason my head has gotten more sensitive with with age. So far the virgin argan oil doesn&#x27;t make my head break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this one - the ends of my hair are not any softer and if I use more then my hair looks greasy.  To me this means it isn&#x27;t soaking in like it should.  I have mixed it with my body lotion and will continue to do that to use it up.</li>
            <li> Nice feel not too oily, perfect for our Idaho winters. Love it !!</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m growing my hair longer, I realized that I need to condition it more. I tried leaving in olive oil in my hair an hour before I wash my hair and that had helped a little. But when I switched to this argan oil, the result was visible by the second use! And it takes just 5-6 drops each time! My hair is fuller, shinier, and stronger. And now that I also apply it to my hair, instead of biosilk, before I flat iron my hair, I&#x27;m able to flat iron my hair as often as I like without worrying about damaging my hair!</li>
            <li> Since it is pure argan oil and organic the smell is not fancy but I just added a few drops essential oils :-)</li>
            <li> Using just one pump every other day after washing my (thin) hair, and it is stronger and silkier.  Also using as a night time moisturizer on my face, and it is very smooth and non greasy, absorbs very well.  Will purchase again and also give as a gift!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Will be replenishing our supply soon. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love the oil and the way it goes on and love the price.</li>
            <li> Great product!  With the winter days setting in, my hair often gets more brittle and coarse and this product is the perfect solution to add softness and shine.  It truly brightens my days, improves the overall health of my hair, and gives my hair the boost I am looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing oil and I love it.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil.  It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel so soft.  I will definitely continue using it.  I would not have bought this product if it were not organic, and first cold press...</li>
            <li> Best Argan oil I have used.  Absorbs into hair - great for dry hair.  I will buy again</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling great, but the odor is a little less pleasant than other brands.</li>
            <li> high quality oil, but the bottle is not leak-proof, and lost 10 % of the oil content during shipment ( oil stain on the cartoon box attested to this leakage), need to improve your bottle cap system</li>
            <li> Great product for dry hair. Feel the difference in two days. Odorless oil.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. My wife and daughter both love it. It&#x27;s the purest my wife has found as well. NorthCoast Products is definitely the real deal. It was shipped and received almost immediately. I will keep an eye out for more products from them in the future.</li>
            <li> This product was amazing.  I did not know what to expect and I was blown away.  My skin felt immediate results.  My hands and face were silkier and smoother in 1-2 applications and I have pretty good skin to begin with.  However I am 60 and my hands are beginning to show their age but they will NOT now that I have found this product.  All my female friends and family will be getting some for Christmas.  I have never written a product review before but this definitely deserved one.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to love this. The price was too good to be true for the quantity. The reviews were raving about it. I use argan oil for everything. My face, hair and all over skincare. Well, sorry to say but this stuff smells ROTTEN. Spoiled rotten. It&#x27;s so off putting. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this bottle, but it didn&#x27;t have the nutty smell of argan oil. And it certainly didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin like argan oil usually does. It just sits on top. I didn&#x27;t even bother test it on my hair.</li>
            <li> I tested this on my hands/cuticles shortly after getting it by putting it on one hand and not the other. I could see a clear and immediate difference - that hand that I used the Argan Oil on no longer had dry cuticles and was softer than the other. And that difference remained throughout the day. I will be using this often in the winter. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Great value for the size, and has that classic Argan Oil smell and texture. I put a few drops on my hands and rub them through my hair after a shower, and it leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny. It&#x27;s also great on my skin – soaks right in and keeps it moisturized for a long time without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product! Good use for your hair and skin. I use them for my hair and it makes me hair so much shinier and smoother. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! Never again will I spend more on this miracle oil! I have nothing but great things to say. I use it all over from head to toe and hydrates like nothing else.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible!  Like rotten tree bark.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Don&#x27;t waste time on other &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; oils. This stuff is cheaper, you get way more, and it&#x27;s worked far better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. Not to mention I no longer use face moisturizer. This stuff is great!!</li>
            <li> I use organ oil on my daughter long hair it keeps it beautyful.</li>
            <li> product came in perfect and I even received a follow up email with instructions to get the best benefit possible. Clear and easy to read</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!  IT JUST GLIDES ON SO NICE ON MY 61 yr old skin!</li>
            <li> Love this product! My family&#x27;s hair and skin never looked this amazing. Quality product and outstanding company. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality argan oil. I have previously used argan oil from a different company, but their prices went up, so I wanted to try a cheaper alternative. This oil is as good as the other one, but the price is about 40% lower. I&#x27;ll continue using this product. Argan oil is a staple in my beauty care - I use it on my face, body, hair and nails, sometimes on its own, sometimes ading 2-3 drops into other products (face and body moisturizer, hair conditioner etc.).</li>
            <li> So far haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using this, I noticed changes in my skin tone.  This brightens and gives the skin a certain kind of glow. Now my whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> High quality Aryan oil.  Great results for my dry hair using surprisingly little of this product. I have only used for 2 weeks and I am very impressed. Arrived 3 days after order.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the Virgin Argan Oil.  Leaves skin smooth and silky</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase of this pure argan oil. The 4 oz size is a nice big bottle, and I was pleasantly surprised that it came with a pump top, though the dropper style is shown in the pictures. It is very light and non-greasy and I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain the perfumes other &amp;#34;argan oil treatments&amp;#34; do. This has a very mild, almost unnoticeable nutty smell that disappears quickly. I use this on my face after washing as a moisturizer and wrinkle treatment. I also use it on my legs after shaving as I get eczema in the winter when my skin is particularly dry and itchy. This stuff is a fabulous skin moisturizer for all over. I particularly like the results on my hair. Since it doesn&#x27;t contain silicones as other argan oil treatments do, it soaks into my hair and helps it hold moisture without building up. I use it along with a silicone-free styling gel on my naturally curly hair and it keeps my curls soft, shiny and bouncy. I can rub a few drops in my hands and run through my hair the next day and renew the softness and shine. I would recommend and will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, silky oil! I use it on my acne-prone face with no breakouts, on my hair as a leave in and heat protector, and on any areas that need a little more TLC (elbows, cuticles, etc). I am very picky about the products I use, and this is a wonderful addition to my beauty routine!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! It&#x27;s the perfect moisturizer for my skin and hair. This weekend I received two compliments on my skin after I began using this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping (literally arrived the next day) and great packaging- the dispenser on this bottle is amazing.</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  I mix a couple of drops with my regular moisturizer for an even better smoothness and glow.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil! I&#x27;d been reading about the health benefits, and I was amped to try some out on my skin, especially my cuticles, face, and tough summer-hardened heels!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I chose to buy from North Coast - the quality is what I was looking for and the seller, Justin, was very courteous. He contacted me promptly and also encouraged me to give him honest feedback - he really wants to hear what his buyers think!&lt;br /&gt;It shipped faster than I expected, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a good size, and has a convenient eyedropper built in for easy application. No spills! And just remember, a little bit goes a long way…I used it everywhere, and I think when I was trying it on my hair I used a touch too much…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuticles - I used it on my cuticles to soften, and I think it made my nails smoother too! It absorbs super quickly, which I love!&lt;br /&gt;Face - I spread a tiny amount on my face after washing, and since it absorbs so quickly it didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy. I have also read that it has anti-sebum qualities! My skin feels softer and it looked brighter after 2 days of use too!&lt;br /&gt;Sunburn - I applied it twice to my sunburned shoulders, and the skin actually feels silkier instead of scaly! I think my shoulders actually might be the softest part of my body now! What?? Haha…&lt;br /&gt;Heels - I started using it on my cracked heels. After just one use, they feel smoother and the flakiness has gone away. I think with two more uses they&#x27;ll be baby soft!&lt;br /&gt;Hair - I massaged a little into my damp hair at the ends, it calmed flyways and made it feel pretty silky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it! I&#x27;ll definitely buy from North Coast again!</li>
            <li> One of the best product I ever used. It&#x27;s not grease, no fragrant, and with just a few drop (8 to be exact, I have a waist long hair) it let my hair stay silky, tangle free, and straight (I flat iron it) all day long. Will buy again when I run out of it.</li>
            <li> They are great product.</li>
            <li> WOW ! This Virgin ARGON OIL is  great..My hair feels like silk and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> Good quality Argan oil. Nice size bottle as well.</li>
            <li> Great product, good value.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  I use argan oil as a makeup remover and body moisturizer (I add it to my lotion). I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no reaction thus far. My skin feels nourished and hydrated after use. Many argan oils now sold have additives or are combined with other seed or plant oils to reduce the cost; I prefer the purity of this product, and it&#x27;s inexpensive!  I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> So far I am satisfied with the product. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give a review. Will do another review after I have used it awhile.</li>
            <li> I love how this oil absorbs into your skin without it appearing greasy or oily looking. I get a really dry forehead and hands in the winter. I&#x27;ve also used this on my scalp, while my hair is damp. My hair dried normally. This product has helped me a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this product free for review. I am a professional blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought Virgin Argan Oil hoping that it could help to moist my dry, processed hair. I have been using it for 3 weeks and my hair condition visibly improved. I massage it through all my hair, leave it for overnight and wash my hair in the morning. I also use it for my face every other night instead of night cream and my skin is glowing in the morning. I really take care of my skin and I am quite picky when it comes to cosmetics, so it amaze me how it really works. My husband uses it as well for the same purposes and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the oil because it really works. I really like the brand since its product is organic and pure, without any additives which I think is very important.</li>
            <li> We use it every day - excellent results!</li>
            <li> I feel like if you know nothing about using organic oils Argan Oil should be first on your list to learn about. Argan Oil, sometimes people refer to it as Moroccan Oil as its derived from Morocco is incredibly good for your skin, hair and nails. It actually can be used as an all over moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil comes from Moroccan Argan tree fruit. Inside the fruit, there are nuts and inside those nuts are kernels, the kernels are where the oils come from. They mash up the nuts and this amazing natural oil we can use as a moisturizer comes out. Depending on the grade you are using, sometimes there are particles still in the oils. NorthCoast Products offers a 100% pure organic Argan oil. I didn&#x27;t notice any particles in the oil, which probably means it was filtered for them, but this isn&#x27;t a bad thing. When Argan oil is filtered for particles/sediments it is a natural part of the process and does not affect the quality at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What matters most with Argan oil is that it is 100% pure with no filler oils included. NorthCoast Products have claims on the bottle that it is 100% pure organic Argan oil, Fragrance-free, No preservatives, and not tested on animals. The color and clarity of the oil is amazing. I can tell that the nuts were not roasted before extracting the oils because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong nutty smell to it. Men and women can use this oil for many purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my husbands beard as a conditioner and He also uses it as an after shave moisturizer. He has issues with his facial hair that cause him to get ingrown hairs, this helped with that as well as with acne. I use this oil on my eczema patches, hair and nails. You will be amazed at how fast this absorbs into your hair. I was so worried when I first wanted to try Argan oils from my dry and frizzy hair that broke easily. I thought it would look greasy and be weighed down, with hair like mine which is to the middle of my back it can be a nightmare and I just didn&#x27;t want to deal with it. Until I tried it and was amazed at how little of an amount you need to use of the oil to get results. It absorbs so quickly and leaves your hair soft and shiny. My hair breaks less since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the NorthCoast Products offers an amazing quality of 100% pure organic Argan oil. I would recommend it to anyone looking to go natural for a moisturizer, both men, and women. It is just a great product that you will use day in and day out  for more healthy looking hair skin and nails. I did receive this product free for the purpose of reviewing it and giving my honest feedback. I hope you found this review to be helpful.deal with it.

            <li> Impressed by the quality of the product! Absorbs easily, has the light, roasted nutty aroma that it should have. I think we have a winner!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I use it to help tame my daughters half curly and half straight hair twice a week.  This works great without weighing her hair down.  A dime size is all I need for her hair.  It didn&#x27;t have too much of a scent so no battle of the smells going on in the nose which is a bonus.  Check this stuff out for yourself!</li>
            <li> Love this Argan oil. I use it for my face and hair. It is not quite as thick as some other Argan oils I&#x27;ve used before, and I think that&#x27;s a plus. I don&#x27;t feel like it takes an hour to sink into my face or that it&#x27;ll stain anything I touch. Definitely worth the price and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My skin has been horrendous from my teens until now. I&#x27;m almost 40. I have acne and I&#x27;m starting to get wrinkles. It&#x27;s hard because my skin hates everything I put on it including lotion. I decided to try Argan oil because I wanted to try something natural and I figured I could still use it on my body if my face didn&#x27;t like it. My face loves it! It soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. It doesn&#x27;t break me out and actually calms my skin. I even wear it under make up and my face doesn&#x27;t get oily as the day wears on. It&#x27;s like my face knows it&#x27;s properly moisturized and stops over producing sebum. It&#x27;s hard to explain. I rub it on my face and neck. Fine lines are starting to become less apparent. I rub the excess on my nails and hands. My husband has been sneaking into my bottle and using it, too. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil and a delightful company! And, you get plenty of product for the money</li>
            <li> This is amazing oil. Great for dry skin areas and a little drop goes a long away.</li>
            <li> This is 100% pure argon oil.  All the store brands I found contained a lot of other junk products. I keep it by my work station and I use this on my feet, legs, arms, face, nails and hair.  It is lovely, non sticky and  I love it!  It is also very reasonably priced...</li>
            <li> One of the best Argan oil&#x27;s I have come across.  Worked well softening my hands and feet.  I also used it on my hair to smooth the ends, you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> This oil smells AWFUL.  I&#x27;m not sure if the particular oil I received had gone rancid, or this is just the smell of the oil.  I&#x27;ve never had this issue with any other argan oil.  Unfortunately, I had to return.</li>
            <li> I totally LOVE this product because of how it makes my hands and nails look and feel! After using the product ONCE I was able to tell a difference and have already recommended it to 4-5 friends. It eliminates dryness and leaves my skin so soft and healthy looking. Love it!!! I recommend it to anyone who wants a HEALTHY, ORGANIC, NATURAL, &amp; PURE product that will transform the look of their skin and nails.</li>
            <li> great product, i use it on my sclerodermic hands and feet and it helps keep them soft and smooth!  i&#x27;ll buy it again soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought some for my husband whose hands crack in winter, serious cracks in the fingertips.  this winter, no cracks.  Northcoast makes an excellent product and has this family as loyal customers.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brand of Virgin Argan Oil in a 4 oz dark bottle.  I ordered another bottle in case the price was going to rise in the near future.  I use it on my acne prone skin that is aging since I&#x27;ve reach the age of 60.  I really love how my skin feels and the appearance of my skin is improving.  It really helps my dry and brittle nails and ugly cuticles look much better.  You wont&#x27; go wrong. I&#x27;ve tried other brands of Argan Oil but I am totally pleased with this affordable but excellent oil.  It truly is amazing...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This time of year is awful for your skin, at least if you live in the north. In the case of mine, it became extremely dry and uncomfortable. After doing some research on Amazon, I came across this product and decided to give it a try. The results have been very encouraging, as the product definitely works extremely well to alleviate dry skin and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things that I like the most about this Argan oil, is that it only requires a very small amount each time you use it. In addition, unlike a lot of other products that I&#x27;ve used, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy. Another benefit is that you&#x27;ll see results upon using it for the first time. I&#x27;ve even tried this on my hair and find that it adds necessary oils and makes it look a lot healthier and provides significantly more shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom lie is that this product is fairly priced and works exactly as advertised. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i have just used it for a short time so i am still checking it out</li>
            <li> Fellow Bearded Brethren!  Use this product as a beard softener - simple, easy to use, with great results for softening your beard.</li>
            <li> Love this will buy again soon as i need more thanks</li>
            <li> love it and the bottle it came in!</li>
            <li> I received a sample to test and review from the merchant for my blog. I mainly use this for hair care needs. It does a great job at keeping my kinky curls hydrated and soft. I also use it as part of an oil blend I made with fractionated coconut oil and lavender essential oil. My scalp loves it! I can&#x27;t wit to create more hair care recipes using it!</li>
