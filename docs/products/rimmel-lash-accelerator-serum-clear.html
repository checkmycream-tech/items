            <li>It truly is incredible.</li>
            <li>I loved this lash accelerator!</li>
            <li>They look great according to him.  </li>
            <li>and I am happy I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m posting a review because it worked great</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve never looked so great.</li>
            <li>I saw the reviews on this and the great price and decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li>Also I am growing in my eyebrows and am having great results too.</li>
            <li>So so happy.</li>
            <li>But since it did make my eye lashes longer I feel it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>so glad I did!!</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product and am glad to get it as it is always sold out at the store.</li>
            <li>Idk how people said it was so good??</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>This is so good for moisturizing and protecting lashes.  </li>
            <li>Since the reviews were so good on this product I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rubbing into lash line got good result.</li>
            <li>It took a week for my results to show, very pleased.</li>
            <li>In love!</li>
            <li>I prefer the liberal product better!</li>
            <li>It turns out to be amazing.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are longer as well, but the amount of lashes is the amazing difference.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li>and it is really amazing.</li>
            <li>Thought I would try the RIMMEL LASH ACCELERATOR after seeing ads for the product, and it REALLY WORKS THE BEST for me.</li>
            <li>A nice surprise.</li>
            <li>Great product for a great price that really really works.</li>
            <li>However, despite some reviews, I think it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and no irritation!</li>
            <li>I hope they grow more, but for the price, who can complain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for more fullness and length for what I already had.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The Rimmel applicator works much better than the L&#x27;Oreal wand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to start wearing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works for me :&gt;</li>
            <li>and I know there can&#x27;t be more lashes</li>
            <li>but it sure looks that way.</li>
            <li>I will, however, continue to use for my brows because they are a bit more sparse than I would like.  </li>
            <li>I will post an update when I try it one more time.  </li>
            <li>Trying it on my eyebrows, we shall see!:-)</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite purchases from this site.</li>
            <li>Love ittttt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no odor, color, or anything associated with this which I love.</li>
            <li>Just brushing them with the applicator and trying to make sure I get the excess goo off.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, but I would like it better if the applicator were a eyelash brush.</li>
            <li>I love this item.</li>
            <li>Then, again, I use the wand to swipe on the top and bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>As for the lashes I noticed the biggest change on the outer corner of the top lashes and the lower lashes.</li>
            <li>The top lashes now sweep out and hit my brow when they have had mascara added.</li>
            <li>I noticed my lashes on top and bottom are longer.  </li>
            <li>Like this more than the mascara.</li>
            <li>Better then the Mac version in my opinion</li>
            <li>Creates a great natural look !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of nice to wear on non-mascara says because it still emphasizes my lashes which are pretty fine and light.</li>
            <li>and they are now filled in pretty good.</li>
            <li>My package also came with a free kohl eyeliner, which I think a Crayola crayon would have worked better.</li>
            <li>The Rimmel Lash Accelerator Mascara smudges easily</li>
            <li>I saw results very quickly, it stopped my brittle lashes from breaking off.  </li>
            <li>It wipes off easily in the morning.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it since it&#x27;s cheap and easy.</li>
            <li>so I was fine with that)</li>
            <li>I had medium to nice lashes to begin with, maybe the people with great results has little to no lashes?</li>
            <li>In just two weeks I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>The las &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; make it go on clumpy, but I&#x27;ve found that lightly running my fingers over</li>
            <li>I agree with others that you really can&#x27;t wear it on your lashes and then add mascara as it kind of clumps your lashes together.</li>
            <li>The spot has already filled in after about two weeks</li>
            <li>And most of these enhances are just a nourishing conditioner, as far as I can tell, but it&#x27;s working pretty good</li>
            <li>absolutely love this product, I haven&#x27;t used it consistently day and night by any means</li>
            <li>They were so sparse, but now I have nice normal eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this to help expedite growth for an oops on my eyebrows after waxing.</li>
            <li>Then I do the eyelashes by first using the brush to swipe along the lash line of both the top and bottom as close to the lash line as I can get without getting into the eye.</li>
            <li>I was watching Youtube and saw a video about this product and her lashes were super long and looked great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product, and it&#x27;s cheap and has decent reviews for those who use it twice a day, but I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
            <li>At something like $6 a tube, I figured it would not hurt to try this product, especially after reading the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I only apply the product at night, so I don&#x27;t really care if all of my lashes are perfectly separated and ready for mascara.</li>
            <li>I always had sparse eye brows and now have full eye brows that frame my eyes.</li>
            <li>Probably others have loved it, but I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really figured out if it&#x27;s better for me to wear it during the day, or during the night.  </li>
            <li>I have two bathrooms and a hall closet full of beauty products.</li>
            <li>My lashes are super full</li>
            <li>I have never had any product work this well or so quickly.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference in both my eyebrows and eyelashes within the first week.</li>
            <li>It works very well!!</li>
            <li>For this price its worth a try.</li>
            <li>eye lashes are long and beautiful and my eye brows have filled in almost completely,actually enough that I need to get them groomed.</li>
            <li>the thin brush is perfect.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted them to be fuller, longer, and more lush looking.</li>
            <li>But when it goes on your lashes they become stiff, but all around great product.</li>
            <li>Now, more than 2 months later, my lashes have grown so much and have filled in as well.</li>
            <li>I used a different product that worked a lot quicker and produced great results, but a week after running out, all my lashes fell out, became thinner and took forever to grow back.</li>
            <li>I like using this better with a different brand of mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used it enough to notice that after ( 3 ) three weeks of use my top and bottom eyelashes appear to be fuller.</li>
            <li>WILL.lll - FALL.lll OUT FIRST</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I haven&#x27;t used it consistently twice a day as recommended, however my eyelashes do seem to appear fuller &amp; lengthier since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I even applied twice a day at first.</li>
            <li>The applicator is tricky at first.</li>
            <li>I am interested to see what happens in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li>They do feel more conditioned but length-wise they are the same.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this product 1 year ago from the cvs pharmacy</li>
            <li>I have had this product exactly 3 days.</li>
            <li>However, I decided I might as well use on the lashes too as they are pretty skimpy.</li>
            <li>Try it and use consistently.</li>
            <li>did notice at first my left eyelashes took off first and were more curly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for about a month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ok with that though since my lashes are so sparse and short.</li>
            <li>omg long and have a healthy shine to them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it is possible but within just 3 days I saw a huge difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>he doesn&#x27;t notice much so</li>
            <li>Zero irritation which is the real bonus for me.  </li>
            <li>Nothing works as well as the real deal.</li>
            <li>It really hasn&#x27;t shown any difference to my lashes.</li>
            <li>This absolutely did nothing for me at all.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Also it is important not to put lotion on those area, it can actually prevent growth.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; they should  really rethink it.</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t say if it works to grow lashes or not</li>
            <li>Perhaps I used too much and it got where it wasn&#x27;t supposed to go, perhaps it reacted adversely with the moisturizer used on my eyes.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much luck with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have very sparse eyebrows</li>
            <li>I started out using Rapid Lash and it was working very well.</li>
            <li>They are much thicker.</li>
            <li>While this was shipped fast, it&#x27;s flakey and I haven&#x27;t seen results after two months.</li>
            <li>the applicator takes out too much product that creates too much glob when applied to your lashes</li>
            <li>the serum starts drying too fast.</li>
            <li>I use it on my lashes and brows and it really helps them grow</li>
            <li>It is safe enough to use on sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Due to my many years of over plucking my eyelashes&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is in my medicine cabinet with my other favorite beauty items.</li>
            <li>I purchased at a local store but felt it was worth sharing the positive experience for anyone thinking of buying it.</li>
            <li>My brows look so dark and healthy.</li>
            <li>UPDATE: I&#x27;ve now been using this at least 5 nights a week for 2.5 months and my results really are amazing.</li>
            <li>The main thing I do not like about this serum is how it hardens on the lashes like glue.  </li>
            <li>This is your little miracle at your at home drugstore or even better cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Is it not like a normal mascara wand or tip of loreal serum wand.</li>
            <li>I have blonde skimpy lashes, and regularly using the L&#x27;Oreal was helping to keep my lashes looking better than usual - and I was moderately satisfied with it for a couple of years.</li>
            <li>I think it helped, since even my eye without the missing lashes looks better.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t noticed any lash change, except maybe a few more coming out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for the last three nights with success.</li>
            <li>They are so long and full</li>
            <li>If you apply an abundance it will look a little flaky later in that area, Most of it will soak in but a bit will dry on top.  </li>
            <li>, then the right one grew out about 2-3 weeks later and straightened</li>
            <li>and then the NEW eyelashes will begin to grow in/out if you</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely cheaper than Latisse ($120-$200/mo depending on where you live)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and eyes and have had no problem.</li>
            <li>My lashes look exactly the same as I started.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s version actually worked better for me than the much more expensive Lipocils.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to forewarn anyone with sensitive eyes, this might cause more problems than it is supposed to solve if you use on your lashes so use carefully with the potential irritation factor in mind.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not like a mascara wand exactly, but the same idea.</li>
            <li>So I first use the brush and run it along the brows, especially focusing on the sparse spots.</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this because of all of the other positive reviews, however....</li>
            <li>I have not even used up half of the product and I am expecting better improvement in the next 2 months.</li>
            <li>NOTICE THAT THE OLD EYELASHES</li>
            <li>But I think using the soft brush to apply to the roots of the lash line is all that matters anyway.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any extra length on my lashes when using this product.</li>
            <li>I had the brow mange look going on  (old lady brows)  </li>
            <li>This had really helped grow them back, and I use a brow &#x27;mascara&#x27; to color the greys.</li>
            <li>but it really does I do only use it before bed at night</li>
            <li>so I disperse the product with another old mascara&#x27;s wand ( which has been cleaned).</li>
            <li>You have to let it dry first though.</li>
            <li>to mentioning I prefer the Rimmel London Serum so much better and have become very pleased; I like the soft tip brush to outline the base of my eyelashes and the brush that it is smaller</li>
            <li>I did try the serum again, this time putting the product on my ring finger and applying to my lash line right after cleansing and before I put on any other product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my lashes were this long 40 years ago when I was in high school!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m afraid to ever stop using this now because I&#x27;m loving my eyelashes!      </li>
            <li>within that 2  months it completely grew out my eyebrows made them extra thick which I love and iy also strengthened and grew my lashes.</li>
            <li>So full and thick from outer corners all the way to inner corners, where they&#x27;ve always been short and sparse right near the tear duct.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes definitely look longer to me, and on the bottom where they are quite sparse, I see new lashes growing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always tweezed my brows myself, and I recently got a new pair of prescription sunglasses</li>
            <li>It especially has given my eyebrows a new life.</li>
            <li>My lashes have actually grown much longer and thicker with this product than I thought possible.</li>
            <li>If I leave my waterproof mascara on too long or take a nap without removing the mascara I will get lash breakage of or fall out more then usual.  </li>
            <li>I would still be cautious if your eyes are normally sensitive and definitely not apply directly to the lash line using the wand or brush.</li>
            <li>They look longer, darker, and there are even some on the bottom lid now (which there barely were before)!</li>
            <li>If i rub it into my eyes it stings a lot so just be careful not to use too much product.</li>
            <li>works great and is a lot less expensive than others.</li>
            <li>I had a few lashes on my right eye that were shorter</li>
            <li>You put it on when you have no makeup on, let it mostly dry, and then curl or put mascara as normal.</li>
            <li>I think it also helps to apply the product early enough to give it time to dry completely before going to sleep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a few months and my lashes still look full and long.</li>
            <li>Before my lashes were sparse, short and straight (sparse mostly due to overuse of mascara, though)</li>
            <li>Now they are long and soft.  </li>
            <li>havent really noticed a major change, and it makes my lashes white if I dont put black masscara over it..</li>
            <li>*Trichotillomania*)&lt;br /&gt;which has left bawled spots right dead in the (center of my eyelashes &amp; eyelids) worse and more noticeable on my LEFT eye.</li>
            <li>In this case, less may truly mean more.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Thought I would try the RIMMEL LASH ACCELERATOR after seeing ads for the product, and it REALLY WORKS THE BEST for me.</li>
            <li> A nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price that really really works.</li>
            <li> However, despite some reviews, I think it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and no irritation!</li>
            <li> I hope they grow more, but for the price, who can complain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for more fullness and length for what I already had.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The Rimmel applicator works much better than the L&#x27;Oreal wand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to start wearing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works for me :&gt;</li>
            <li> and I know there can&#x27;t be more lashes</li>
            <li> but it sure looks that way.</li>
            <li> I will, however, continue to use for my brows because they are a bit more sparse than I would like.  </li>
            <li> I will post an update when I try it one more time.  </li>
            <li> Trying it on my eyebrows, we shall see!:-)</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite purchases from this site.</li>
            <li> Love ittttt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no odor, color, or anything associated with this which I love.</li>
            <li> Just brushing them with the applicator and trying to make sure I get the excess goo off.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, but I would like it better if the applicator were a eyelash brush.</li>
            <li> I love this item.</li>
            <li> Then, again, I use the wand to swipe on the top and bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> As for the lashes I noticed the biggest change on the outer corner of the top lashes and the lower lashes.</li>
            <li> The top lashes now sweep out and hit my brow when they have had mascara added.</li>
            <li> I noticed my lashes on top and bottom are longer.  </li>
            <li> Like this more than the mascara.</li>
            <li> Better then the Mac version in my opinion</li>
            <li> Creates a great natural look !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of nice to wear on non-mascara says because it still emphasizes my lashes which are pretty fine and light.</li>
            <li> and they are now filled in pretty good.</li>
            <li> My package also came with a free kohl eyeliner, which I think a Crayola crayon would have worked better.</li>
            <li> The Rimmel Lash Accelerator Mascara smudges easily</li>
            <li> I saw results very quickly, it stopped my brittle lashes from breaking off.  </li>
            <li> It wipes off easily in the morning.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it since it&#x27;s cheap and easy.</li>
            <li> so I was fine with that)</li>
            <li> I had medium to nice lashes to begin with, maybe the people with great results has little to no lashes?</li>
            <li> In just two weeks I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The las &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; make it go on clumpy, but I&#x27;ve found that lightly running my fingers over</li>
            <li> I agree with others that you really can&#x27;t wear it on your lashes and then add mascara as it kind of clumps your lashes together.</li>
            <li> The spot has already filled in after about two weeks</li>
            <li> And most of these enhances are just a nourishing conditioner, as far as I can tell, but it&#x27;s working pretty good</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product, I haven&#x27;t used it consistently day and night by any means</li>
            <li> They were so sparse, but now I have nice normal eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to help expedite growth for an oops on my eyebrows after waxing.</li>
            <li> Then I do the eyelashes by first using the brush to swipe along the lash line of both the top and bottom as close to the lash line as I can get without getting into the eye.</li>
            <li> I was watching Youtube and saw a video about this product and her lashes were super long and looked great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product, and it&#x27;s cheap and has decent reviews for those who use it twice a day, but I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
            <li> At something like $6 a tube, I figured it would not hurt to try this product, especially after reading the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I only apply the product at night, so I don&#x27;t really care if all of my lashes are perfectly separated and ready for mascara.</li>
            <li> I always had sparse eye brows and now have full eye brows that frame my eyes.</li>
            <li> Probably others have loved it, but I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really figured out if it&#x27;s better for me to wear it during the day, or during the night.  </li>
            <li> I have two bathrooms and a hall closet full of beauty products.</li>
            <li> My lashes are super full</li>
            <li> I have never had any product work this well or so quickly.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference in both my eyebrows and eyelashes within the first week.</li>
            <li> It works very well!!</li>
            <li> For this price its worth a try.</li>
            <li> eye lashes are long and beautiful and my eye brows have filled in almost completely,actually enough that I need to get them groomed.</li>
            <li> the thin brush is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted them to be fuller, longer, and more lush looking.</li>
            <li> But when it goes on your lashes they become stiff, but all around great product.</li>
            <li> Now, more than 2 months later, my lashes have grown so much and have filled in as well.</li>
            <li> I used a different product that worked a lot quicker and produced great results, but a week after running out, all my lashes fell out, became thinner and took forever to grow back.</li>
            <li> I like using this better with a different brand of mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used it enough to notice that after ( 3 ) three weeks of use my top and bottom eyelashes appear to be fuller.</li>
            <li> WILL.lll - FALL.lll OUT FIRST</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I haven&#x27;t used it consistently twice a day as recommended, however my eyelashes do seem to appear fuller &amp; lengthier since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I even applied twice a day at first.</li>
            <li> The applicator is tricky at first.</li>
            <li> I am interested to see what happens in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li> They do feel more conditioned but length-wise they are the same.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this product 1 year ago from the cvs pharmacy</li>
            <li> I have had this product exactly 3 days.</li>
            <li> However, I decided I might as well use on the lashes too as they are pretty skimpy.</li>
            <li> Try it and use consistently.</li>
            <li> did notice at first my left eyelashes took off first and were more curly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for about a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with that though since my lashes are so sparse and short.</li>
            <li> omg long and have a healthy shine to them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it is possible but within just 3 days I saw a huge difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> he doesn&#x27;t notice much so</li>
            <li> Zero irritation which is the real bonus for me.  </li>
            <li> Nothing works as well as the real deal.</li>
            <li> It really hasn&#x27;t shown any difference to my lashes.</li>
            <li> This absolutely did nothing for me at all.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Also it is important not to put lotion on those area, it can actually prevent growth.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; they should  really rethink it.</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t say if it works to grow lashes or not</li>
            <li> Perhaps I used too much and it got where it wasn&#x27;t supposed to go, perhaps it reacted adversely with the moisturizer used on my eyes.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much luck with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyebrows</li>
            <li> I started out using Rapid Lash and it was working very well.</li>
            <li> They are much thicker.</li>
            <li> While this was shipped fast, it&#x27;s flakey and I haven&#x27;t seen results after two months.</li>
            <li> the applicator takes out too much product that creates too much glob when applied to your lashes</li>
            <li> the serum starts drying too fast.</li>
            <li> I use it on my lashes and brows and it really helps them grow</li>
            <li> It is safe enough to use on sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Due to my many years of over plucking my eyelashes&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is in my medicine cabinet with my other favorite beauty items.</li>
            <li> I purchased at a local store but felt it was worth sharing the positive experience for anyone thinking of buying it.</li>
            <li> My brows look so dark and healthy.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;ve now been using this at least 5 nights a week for 2.5 months and my results really are amazing.</li>
            <li> The main thing I do not like about this serum is how it hardens on the lashes like glue.  </li>
            <li> This is your little miracle at your at home drugstore or even better cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Is it not like a normal mascara wand or tip of loreal serum wand.</li>
            <li> I have blonde skimpy lashes, and regularly using the L&#x27;Oreal was helping to keep my lashes looking better than usual - and I was moderately satisfied with it for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I think it helped, since even my eye without the missing lashes looks better.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t noticed any lash change, except maybe a few more coming out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the last three nights with success.</li>
            <li> They are so long and full</li>
            <li> If you apply an abundance it will look a little flaky later in that area, Most of it will soak in but a bit will dry on top.  </li>
            <li> , then the right one grew out about 2-3 weeks later and straightened</li>
            <li> and then the NEW eyelashes will begin to grow in/out if you</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely cheaper than Latisse ($120-$200/mo depending on where you live)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and eyes and have had no problem.</li>
            <li> My lashes look exactly the same as I started.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s version actually worked better for me than the much more expensive Lipocils.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to forewarn anyone with sensitive eyes, this might cause more problems than it is supposed to solve if you use on your lashes so use carefully with the potential irritation factor in mind.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not like a mascara wand exactly, but the same idea.</li>
            <li> So I first use the brush and run it along the brows, especially focusing on the sparse spots.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this because of all of the other positive reviews, however....</li>
            <li> I have not even used up half of the product and I am expecting better improvement in the next 2 months.</li>
            <li> NOTICE THAT THE OLD EYELASHES</li>
            <li> But I think using the soft brush to apply to the roots of the lash line is all that matters anyway.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any extra length on my lashes when using this product.</li>
            <li> I had the brow mange look going on  (old lady brows)  </li>
            <li> This had really helped grow them back, and I use a brow &#x27;mascara&#x27; to color the greys.</li>
            <li> but it really does I do only use it before bed at night</li>
            <li> so I disperse the product with another old mascara&#x27;s wand ( which has been cleaned).</li>
            <li> You have to let it dry first though.</li>
            <li> to mentioning I prefer the Rimmel London Serum so much better and have become very pleased; I like the soft tip brush to outline the base of my eyelashes and the brush that it is smaller</li>
            <li> I did try the serum again, this time putting the product on my ring finger and applying to my lash line right after cleansing and before I put on any other product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my lashes were this long 40 years ago when I was in high school!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to ever stop using this now because I&#x27;m loving my eyelashes!      </li>
            <li> within that 2  months it completely grew out my eyebrows made them extra thick which I love and iy also strengthened and grew my lashes.</li>
            <li> So full and thick from outer corners all the way to inner corners, where they&#x27;ve always been short and sparse right near the tear duct.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes definitely look longer to me, and on the bottom where they are quite sparse, I see new lashes growing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always tweezed my brows myself, and I recently got a new pair of prescription sunglasses</li>
            <li> It especially has given my eyebrows a new life.</li>
            <li> My lashes have actually grown much longer and thicker with this product than I thought possible.</li>
            <li> If I leave my waterproof mascara on too long or take a nap without removing the mascara I will get lash breakage of or fall out more then usual.  </li>
            <li> I would still be cautious if your eyes are normally sensitive and definitely not apply directly to the lash line using the wand or brush.</li>
            <li> They look longer, darker, and there are even some on the bottom lid now (which there barely were before)!</li>
            <li> If i rub it into my eyes it stings a lot so just be careful not to use too much product.</li>
            <li> works great and is a lot less expensive than others.</li>
            <li> I had a few lashes on my right eye that were shorter</li>
            <li> You put it on when you have no makeup on, let it mostly dry, and then curl or put mascara as normal.</li>
            <li> I think it also helps to apply the product early enough to give it time to dry completely before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months and my lashes still look full and long.</li>
            <li> Before my lashes were sparse, short and straight (sparse mostly due to overuse of mascara, though)</li>
            <li> Now they are long and soft.  </li>
            <li> havent really noticed a major change, and it makes my lashes white if I dont put black masscara over it..</li>
            <li> *Trichotillomania*)&lt;br /&gt;which has left bawled spots right dead in the (center of my eyelashes &amp; eyelids) worse and more noticeable on my LEFT eye.</li>
            <li> In this case, less may truly mean more.</li>
            <li> I think it made my lashes slightly thicker than normal, but not longer.</li>
            <li> Folks with glaucoma were using the medicine and people started noticing that the medicine made eyelashes grow insanely long and lush, dark, thick and full.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t clearly state if that&#x27;s due to this product.</li>
            <li> I now have really long lashes towards the inner corners of my eyes that used to just fizzle out into nothing.</li>
            <li> is my new Fav and go to for everyday use even days without any mascara i use this serum.</li>
            <li> I started seeing slight results within the first few days.</li>
            <li> (My lashes are naturally long</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with them coming out during washing the stuff out, though...</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone wanting long lashes with volume.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t know what genius decided to print the instructions in pale gold, on a clear tube.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about a month and a half and not really noticing any results so far.  </li>
            <li> I am still checking out this product , I used it before on my eyelashes, had to stop though, my lashes were about to get too long, they would go in my eyes!</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> apply at night, since they dry quite clumpy and goopy.</li>
            <li> ~ I put it on every night and let it dry before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> However,  I use it overnight only because it creates a white film after a few hours.</li>
            <li> My short &amp; thin eyelashes seems as thought that they are really and truly</li>
            <li> Actually seeing longer length in a few lashes after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Noticeable new hair growth in eyebrows and my lashes which are little and thin normally look longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> To soon to tell as I have not been consistent with the application as it is a little thick and can&#x27;t apply when I wear mascara.</li>
            <li> I noticed a big change in the length of my lashes in less than a month.</li>
            <li> But they arent as big as my previous glasses</li>
            <li> Also, my eyebrows had thinned out terribly and this helped them grow back in nicely!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a very short time, so I&#x27;m not sure if it will work with making the lashes grow.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of my latisse, and was too cash poor to pay the $$ for the real deal again.</li>
            <li> it immediately and stop using all the expensive ones that aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product everyday for the last 2 1/2 months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last few weeks.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t got the results I expected.</li>
            <li> Not very official</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this a few times a day for about a week, and there&#x27;s already a big change in my lashes!</li>
            <li> I also use Rapid Lash, which works very well, but seems to go in cycles, because sometimes I get a very thin patch of lashes on my left eye.  </li>
            <li> if I wear it at night, I&#x27;ll rub my eyes in the middle of the night and cause some lashes to come out because they&#x27;re so stiff.  </li>
            <li> I had a stupid, on my part, eyelash curler accident that tore a pretty large clump of lashes out of one eye.</li>
            <li> All of my eyelashes broke using a bad mascara, and this helped them grow back quickly.</li>
            <li> Not good if your sensitive.</li>
            <li> I subscribe to it and get it every other month</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that it is gloppy.</li>
            <li> The combination works very well for me; the thin patch hasn&#x27;t returned -- and, I credit the Rimmel for that!</li>
            <li> It does weigh down your lashes if you put in on, so I don&#x27;t recommend using this if you have activity though out the day.</li>
            <li> Use during down time or sleep.</li>
            <li> Once my eye rims settle down, I will try again using that method.</li>
            <li> Previously I have tried the L&#x27;Oreal and Lipocil lash growth products.</li>
            <li> I would use the Rimmel mascara also if it came in a brown shade instead of black.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am using the Rimmel product in-conjunction with the ARDELL Brow &amp; Lash growth accelerator, I have written a previous review regarding the Ardell Brow &amp; Lash but that&#x27;s another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> though not noticeably thicker or less sparse.</li>
            <li> and I have way less lash loss.</li>
            <li> The downsides are it dries like Elmer&#x27;s glue looking peely, and if you apply to the length of your lashes, they clump like a gel into long hard spikes.</li>
            <li> This did make my eye lashes long but it also got too thick and sticky after prolong usage..</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have little to no lashes.</li>
            <li> The tip of wand is like a lip gloss wand but little hairs.</li>
            <li> the little brush is supposed to be for eyebrow application.  </li>
            <li> I put a little on my lashes and then rub it with my finger to get it all over.</li>
            <li> It also has a little brush at the end if you want to use it on your eyebrows, or lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> now they&#x27;re looking average (after a week!)</li>
            <li> I applied everyday under mascara.</li>
            <li> and it feels heavy.</li>

            <li> didn&#x27;t really notice a difference. i would just try anything nourishing on lashes...</li>
            <li> Clumpy to put on and when it dries, it flakes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 or 5 weeks now, and I must say I do see a little bit of growth! My eyelashes definitely look longer to me, and on the bottom where they are quite sparse, I see new lashes growing. I hope they grow more, but for the price, who can complain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply at night, since they dry quite clumpy and goopy.</li>
            <li> This has increased my lash length within 6 weeks,  but not the volume.  However,  I use it overnight only because it creates a white film after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with excellent results! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have tried the very expensive Latisse &amp; Lashipix.  They worked but the eye irritation and redness was unbearable.  This product was so inexpensive that I had \\&quot;zero\\&quot; expectation of it working.  It turns out to be amazing.  My eyelashes disappeared during menopause and this is the only product that I can use.  My husband asked me what I had done to my eyes.  They look great according to him.  Trust me he doesn&#x27;t notice much so this was a big surprise and kudos for this product.  Zero irritation which is the real bonus for me.  I am sold and my pocketbook appreciates it!</li>
            <li> I ran out of my latisse, and was too cash poor to pay the $$ for the real deal again. At something like $6 a tube, I figured it would not hurt to try this product, especially after reading the good reviews. Well. It&#x27;s been a few months and my lashes still look full and long. My mother asked me if I still had lash extensions. Nope. This cannot be the same formula as latisse, which was a medicine for glaucoma. Folks with glaucoma were using the medicine and people started noticing that the medicine made eyelashes grow insanely long and lush, dark, thick and full. They took the glaucoma medicine and slapped a &amp;#34;latisse&amp;#34; label on it, and voilia! Lash enhancer was born! Nothing works as well as the real deal. And most of these enhances are just a nourishing conditioner, as far as I can tell, but it&#x27;s working pretty good and you can&#x27;t beat the price point.</li>
            <li> The product worked to help grow back my eyebrows after a waxing mishap. However, I would avoid putting it close to the lashline as I have ended up with irritation.</li>
            <li> One thing I don&#x27;t like is the brush for the eyebrows is in the way when you try to apply it to the lashes. It really hasn&#x27;t shown any difference to my lashes. I did however read the reviews on this product before I bought it. I am going to still try and use it for 2 weeks and if nothing I will not buy it again. It does not cause any irritation to my eyes, there is not itching, redness, or break out. It is safe enough to use on sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I used this for one month. I used every night or almost every night before bed and left through out night. Sometimes I even used it during the day if I had nothing to do. This absolutely did nothing for me at all. Not upper or lower lash line. My lashes look exactly the same as I started. The product stings slightly if it gets in eyes, which is weird for a eye product used so closely to the eyes? Not good if your sensitive. It does weigh down your lashes if you put in on, so I don&#x27;t recommend using this if you have activity though out the day. Use during down time or sleep. NOT RECCOMENDED! Idk how people said it was so good?? NOTICE: I had medium to nice lashes to begin with, maybe the people with great results has little to no lashes? Maybe that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work for me. I was looking for more fullness and length for what I already had. It&#x27;s not good if your like me. Maybe if you have little to no lashes. Hope this helps. Will update after I finish the product tube. BRUSH: SUCKS! The tip of wand is like a lip gloss wand but little hairs. How am I supposed to apply that to lashes? Is it not like a normal mascara wand or tip of loreal serum wand. It&#x27;s like eye liner brush!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day, but I am still expecting results. Keep on trying. For this price its worth a try.</li>
            <li> After using it 4 times I noticed my eyelashes falling out!  I wanted longer lashes, not to have no lashes. Will not be using again</li>
            <li> In love! Saw a change in a week and I now use it daily! I subscribe to it and get it every other month and I am happy I did. My eye lashes and eyebrows are fuller. I love it. Wish I had found it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it immediately and stop using all the expensive ones that aren&#x27;t worth it. This is your little miracle at your at home drugstore or even better cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this product everyday for the last 2 1/2 months. I applied everyday under mascara. I have used with different brands of Mascara including Rimmel Lash Accelerator Mascara. The Rimmel Lash Accelerator Mascara smudges easily that is the only downfall. I like using this better with a different brand of mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had very short sparse lashes. I have noticed a small amount of growth. The length of my lashes are longer, however I am still waiting for them to start growing in thicker.</li>
            <li> Previously I have tried the L&#x27;Oreal and Lipocil lash growth products. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s version actually worked better for me than the much more expensive Lipocils. I have blonde skimpy lashes, and regularly using the L&#x27;Oreal was helping to keep my lashes looking better than usual - and I was moderately satisfied with it for a couple of years. Thought I would try the RIMMEL LASH ACCELERATOR after seeing ads for the product, and it REALLY WORKS THE BEST for me. My lashes have actually grown much longer and thicker with this product than I thought possible. I noticed a big change in the length of my lashes in less than a month. I don&#x27;t think my lashes were this long 40 years ago when I was in high school! My lashes look longer and thicker even without mascara! The Rimmel applicator works much better than the L&#x27;Oreal wand. I only apply the product at night, so I don&#x27;t really care if all of my lashes are perfectly separated and ready for mascara. I would use the Rimmel mascara also if it came in a brown shade instead of black.</li>
            <li> This did not help at all with length , strength . I will not buy again</li>
            <li> 07/23/13 @ 10:00pm MT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;46 B/F&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product, I haven&#x27;t used it consistently day and night by any means but I&#x27;ve used it enough to notice that after ( 3 ) three weeks of use my top and bottom eyelashes appear to be fuller. Due to my many years of over plucking my eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;(a disorder called: *Trichotillomania*)&lt;br /&gt;which has left bawled spots right dead in the (center of my eyelashes &amp; eyelids) worse and more noticeable on my LEFT eye. My short &amp; thin eyelashes seems as thought that they are really and truly growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TAKE NOTICE THAT THE OLD EYELASHES WILL.lll - FALL.lll OUT FIRST and then the NEW eyelashes will begin to grow in/out if you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I haven&#x27;t used it consistently twice a day as recommended, however my eyelashes do seem to appear fuller &amp; lengthier since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;When I apply the RIMMEL LONDON eyelash serum my eyelashes becomes plumper and when I put on my mascara my eyelashes seem to also appear longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using the Rimmel product in-conjunction with the ARDELL Brow &amp; Lash growth accelerator, I have written a previous review regarding the Ardell Brow &amp; Lash but that&#x27;s another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to mentioning I prefer the Rimmel London Serum so much better and have become very pleased; I like the soft tip brush to outline the base of my eyelashes and the brush that it is smaller and I can grip my my upper and lower eyelashes which is a PLUS&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Rimmel on Amazon for a $1.00 and YES I WILL PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN AND YES RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.</li>
            <li> works great and is a lot less expensive than others. if it gets in ypour eyes it does sting. just be careful..will continue to order!</li>
            <li> Good product. Good price. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product works as well as prescription &amp;#34;lash extenders&amp;#34; but at a fraction of the cost, and I have not seen any change in color either</li>
            <li> It works very well!! But when it goes on your lashes they become stiff, but all around great product.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;ve now been using this at least 5 nights a week for 2.5 months and my results really are amazing. I guess it just takes awhile to get maximum results. I now have really long lashes towards the inner corners of my eyes that used to just fizzle out into nothing. My lashes are longer as well, but the amount of lashes is the amazing difference. So full and thick from outer corners all the way to inner corners, where they&#x27;ve always been short and sparse right near the tear duct. I&#x27;m afraid to ever stop using this now because I&#x27;m loving my eyelashes!      I had a stupid, on my part, eyelash curler accident that tore a pretty large clump of lashes out of one eye. I came across this product on clearance at the store, so I gave it a try. I&#x27;ve used it every night and some days for 30 days. I think it helped, since even my eye without the missing lashes looks better. The downsides are it dries like Elmer&#x27;s glue looking peely, and if you apply to the length of your lashes, they clump like a gel into long hard spikes. Definitely can&#x27;t be worn out of the house like that and it feels heavy. But I think using the soft brush to apply to the roots of the lash line is all that matters anyway. Doing that carefully, I can wear during daytime too, although by the end of the day it will peel and look bad. Best way to use it is overnight when it won&#x27;t matter how it looks. I will continue to use it since it&#x27;s cheap and easy.</li>
            <li> Just blah. I didn&#x27;t like this product. I ended up throwing it away! I prefer the liberal product better!</li>
            <li> negative 2. did nothing. just wasted money.</li>
            <li> This is so good for moisturizing and protecting lashes.  I saw results very quickly, it stopped my brittle lashes from breaking off.  Now they are long and soft.  I apply as a liner and mascara at night, and extra coats on the eye that rests on the pillow.  Usually women rub their lashes off in their sleep and have less on that eye.  These extra coats will protect lashes from this.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for at least a month now, and I cant tell a difference. I&#x27;m hoping thats because I dont always apply it twice a day. I plan on strictly applying it twice a day, and fingers crossed my brow hair grows back. I&#x27;ve always tweezed my brows myself, and I recently got a new pair of prescription sunglasses I&#x27;d love to start wearing. But they arent as big as my previous glasses so they dont cover my brows. You can really tell how uneven they are and I hate it!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few weeks and I think the stuff works. My lashes and brows seem heavier (not more plentiful) and longer. However, the applicator is horrible.  It is a plastic stick with some grooves in it for your eyelashes (not a brush like mascara) and a tiny brush that sticks out the end.  the little brush is supposed to be for eyebrow application.  It is just a bad idea and very awkward.</li>
            <li> I have not bought it from Amazon yet but this price is great,so before I run out I&#x27;ll be buying it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a gas stove blow up in my face it burnt off all my eye lashes and eye brows. I was told it would never grow back but I saw Rimmel Lash Acc. Serum and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. My eye brows and eye lashes which would not grow for 15 years ,began to grow. I will let you know this ~ I put it on every night and let it dry before I go to sleep. Also it is important not to put lotion on those area, it can actually prevent growth.&lt;br /&gt;My eye lashes are long and beautiful and my eye brows have filled in almost completely,actually enough that I need to get them groomed.It&#x27;s works for me :&gt;</li>
            <li> Since the reviews were so good on this product I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now on both my lashes and brows and there is no noticeable difference in the length or thickness of my lashes and brows. I even applied twice a day at first. I&#x27;ll keep using it until the tube is gone and update my review if I see any changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh.</li>
            <li> The applicator is tricky at first. The las &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; make it go on clumpy, but I&#x27;ve found that lightly running my fingers over it gets rid of the excess (unfortunately you&#x27;re wasting product doing that). I haven&#x27;t been using it religiously so I haven&#x27;t noticed any lash change, except maybe a few more coming out but I can&#x27;t clearly state if that&#x27;s due to this product. It&#x27;s kind of nice to wear on non-mascara says because it still emphasizes my lashes which are pretty fine and light. It&#x27;s not a bad product, and it&#x27;s cheap and has decent reviews for those who use it twice a day, but I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
            <li> It works! My eyebrows are thick but sparse, if you know what I mean. I used it for about two weeks and even missed a few days and they are now filled in pretty good. I don&#x27;t have to fill them in with products! I also used them on my lashes and it helped them grow about two or three mm. (My lashes are naturally long so I was fine with that) the only con was the serum makes your lashes stick together, so I just applied at night and then in the morning washed my faced and my lashes as well. Over all, I would recommend and buy again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any changes after using this for three weeks, disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used faithfully every night for two months, nada. Also, I don&#x27;t know what genius decided to print the instructions in pale gold, on a clear tube. My package also came with a free kohl eyeliner, which I think a Crayola crayon would have worked better. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this.</li>
            <li> This is applied at night and in the AM - I think my lashes look healthier but time will tell.  I don&#x27;t really like the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; they should  really rethink it.</li>
            <li> It works. My eyelashes started falling out 2 years ago I was prescribed latisse and it worked but was too expensive.I tried the arebonne serum but that didn&#x27;t help. I was about to suck it up and go back to Latisse but I thought I would read some reviews on Amazon which lead me to this product. I bought this and the mascara (the thick brush was too clumpy for me but my daughter likes it) the thin brush is perfect. In just two weeks I notice a huge difference. My lashes are longer and fuller and in just two weeks I don&#x27;t have to fill the holes with liner. Awesome.. I&#x27;m posting a review because it worked great and it was a review that helped me to find it.</li>
            <li> I am completely impressed with this product. I don&#x27;t know how it is possible but within just 3 days I saw a huge difference in my lashes. They are definitely noticeably longer and I know there can&#x27;t be more lashes but it sure looks that way. I have never had any product work this well or so quickly. I am interested to see what happens in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product and am glad to get it as it is always sold out at the store. I have used this on my eyebrows,  lashes and temple.  My eyebrows grow quite a lot faster using this.  I noticed that I will have about a 10th of them just go crazy a few are stubborn and the rest just grow a bit faster.  Now on my lashes it works but slower then my eyebrows.  If I leave my waterproof mascara on too long or take a nap without removing the mascara I will get lash breakage of or fall out more then usual.  This helps them and gives them a boost.  A wile back I had a stressful job situation along with sick family members so I had some hair fall out with a noticeable receding hairline on my upper side temples.  I applied this for a couple of months in that area and my hair came back.  So just as a added help just in case I also have a separate one that I apply to that area every so often.  No noticeable bad smell and does not irritate my eyes at all.  If you apply an abundance it will look a little flaky later in that area, Most of it will soak in but a bit will dry on top.  Very happy camper and luv this product.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this because of all of the other positive reviews, however....I have only used this once so I really can&#x27;t say if it works to grow lashes or not but I can say that it did irritate the inner rims of my lids. I woke up with itchy eyes and red rims. Perhaps I used too much and it got where it wasn&#x27;t supposed to go, perhaps it reacted adversely with the moisturizer used on my eyes. I don&#x27;t know.  It does come out rather gloopy. Another reviewer said she puts some on the back of her hand and rubs the product into her lash line with a finger. Once my eye rims settle down, I will try again using that method. I will, however, continue to use for my brows because they are a bit more sparse than I would like.  I just wanted to forewarn anyone with sensitive eyes, this might cause more problems than it is supposed to solve if you use on your lashes so use carefully with the potential irritation factor in mind. I will post an update when I try it one more time.  Update 070215: I did try the serum again, this time putting the product on my ring finger and applying to my lash line right after cleansing and before I put on any other product and I am no longer experiencing any irritation. Yay! I think it also helps to apply the product early enough to give it time to dry completely before going to sleep. I&#x27;ve used it for the last three nights with success. I have not yet tried it under mascara. Not sure I will.  I would still be cautious if your eyes are normally sensitive and definitely not apply directly to the lash line using the wand or brush. A lot of the serum comes out of the tube on that wand and it does get drippy. In this case, less may truly mean more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last few weeks.  I can&#x27;t say I have seen a difference in my lashes.  They do feel more conditioned but length-wise they are the same.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes but I haven&#x27;t got the results I expected.</li>
            <li> I decided to switch from my regular lash enhancer to this one and am very disappointed. This stuff is too thin and runs into my eyes which burns. I hate the applicator. It is impossible not to apply too much so again, it burns.</li>
            <li> I imagine everyone is different, but it works for me. All of my eyelashes broke using a bad mascara, and this helped them grow back quickly. Also, my eyebrows had thinned out terribly and this helped them grow back in nicely! They were so sparse, but now I have nice normal eyelashes. I will continue to use this (this will be my 3rd tube).</li>
            <li> I am still checking out this product , I used it before on my eyelashes, had to stop though, my lashes were about to get too long, they would go in my eyes! I hate that! Very annoying! But great product! Trying it on my eyebrows, we shall see!:-)</li>
            <li> This really works. I always had sparse eye brows and now have full eye brows that frame my eyes. Makes lashes fill in also.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much luck with this product.  Probably others have loved it, but I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li> I loved this lash accelerator! I have used a few products and nothing worked until I used this. I started seeing slight results within the first few days. Now, more than 2 months later, my lashes have grown so much and have filled in as well. I put this product on once every day before I go to sleep. I wear it throughout the night and wash it off when I wake up in the morning. I can&#x27;t recommend this product strongly enough. It truly is incredible. It will make your lashes longer and fuller in no time. It is one of my favorite purchases from this site. Love ittttt.</li>
            <li> brush is horrible, will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product 1 year ago from the cvs pharmacy and I used it for about 2 months and within that 2  months it completely grew out my eyebrows made them extra thick which I love and iy also strengthened and grew my lashes. Im def. gonna continue to using this product</li>
            <li> Started using this because my eye lashes were breaking drastically when I wore mascara. Hoped they would be stronger. Didn&#x27;t read about it. In a month my lashes were longer. A nice surprise. Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my eyebrows. I have very sensitive skin and eyes and have had no problem. I put a little on my lashes and then rub it with my finger to get it all over. Not very official but it works.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any difference on my eyelashes at all.  I will not be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t really notice any extra length on my lashes when using this product.</li>
            <li> I have longish, thin lashes. I have always wanted them to be fuller, longer, and more lush looking. I like Rimmel Mascara, so I decided to give this a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner. I have had this product exactly 3 days. I like the applicator- it&#x27;s not like a mascara wand exactly, but the same idea. You put it on when you have no makeup on, let it mostly dry, and then curl or put mascara as normal. It also has a little brush at the end if you want to use it on your eyebrows, or lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no odor, color, or anything associated with this which I love. I was worried it might irritate my skin or eyes, but it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;ll update my review if/when I see results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve already seen a bit of growth so that&#x27;s awesome! I&#x27;ll continue to use it and I hopes it gets my lashes where I want them.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a very short time, so I&#x27;m not sure if it will work with making the lashes grow.  These days, when a make up company says their product will make your lashes grow, they simply mean it will plump them with collagen and oils.  Plumping is not the same as actually growing.  The main thing I do not like about this serum is how it hardens on the lashes like glue.  That is setting them up to break off when they get that hard.  And it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m covering them.  Just brushing them with the applicator and trying to make sure I get the excess goo off.  Haven&#x27;t really figured out if it&#x27;s better for me to wear it during the day, or during the night.  I&#x27;m afraid if I wear it at night, I&#x27;ll rub my eyes in the middle of the night and cause some lashes to come out because they&#x27;re so stiff.  So far, I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with them coming out during washing the stuff out, though...</li>
            <li> Easy to use and no irritation! What a product.  I can tell a change in my lashes too.</li>
            <li> It does work! Noticeable new hair growth in eyebrows and my lashes which are little and thin normally look longer and thicker. My only dislike is after applying at night in the am it appears as tho it&#x27;s peeling off.</li>
            <li> I had the brow mange look going on  (old lady brows)  This had really helped grow them back, and I use a brow &#x27;mascara&#x27; to color the greys.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about a month and a half and not really noticing any results so far.  However, despite some reviews, I think it is very easy to use.  Will probably stick with EVOO in the future.</li>
            <li> havent really noticed a major change, and it makes my lashes white if I dont put black masscara over it..</li>
            <li> Creates a great natural look !</li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyebrows and this is the only serum that&#x27;s worked for me! I&#x27;ve tried RapidLash, Rogaine and Billion Dollar Brows serums and those still don&#x27;t work as well. One thing that helps this serum to work is if you rub it into your eyebrows and don&#x27;t just let it sit there. It also lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I like this product, but I would like it better if the applicator were a eyelash brush. I use it as a primer before I put on my mascara.</li>
            <li> I tried this product about 5 months ago.  I also use Rapid Lash, which works very well, but seems to go in cycles, because sometimes I get a very thin patch of lashes on my left eye.  I use the Rimmel in the morning, the Rapid Lash at night.  The combination works very well for me; the thin patch hasn&#x27;t returned -- and, I credit the Rimmel for that!</li>
            <li> I like this product. it gets the job done on lashes and brows.&lt;br /&gt;It gives the illusion that my lashes are longer and thicker. Brows stay in place,but no more growth than usual.&lt;br /&gt;This is my new Fav and go to for everyday use even days without any mascara i use this serum.</li>
            <li> I love this item. I purchased at a local store but felt it was worth sharing the positive experience for anyone thinking of buying it. I originally bought this to help expedite growth for an oops on my eyebrows after waxing. However, I decided I might as well use on the lashes too as they are pretty skimpy. I noticed a huge difference in both my eyebrows and eyelashes within the first week. I usually apply twice a day morning and evening. I agree with others that you really can&#x27;t wear it on your lashes and then add mascara as it kind of clumps your lashes together. I have had no problem though putting on my brows and then styling them as usual (pencil and brow gel). So I first use the brush and run it along the brows, especially focusing on the sparse spots. Then I use the wand part and swipe it across. Then I do the eyelashes by first using the brush to swipe along the lash line of both the top and bottom as close to the lash line as I can get without getting into the eye. Then, again, I use the wand to swipe on the top and bottom lashes. My brows look so dark and healthy. They&#x27;ve never looked so great. The spot has already filled in after about two weeks and I&#x27;m now focusing on the inner area for the overtweezing in between over the years that has gotten them further and further spaced apart. As for the lashes I noticed the biggest change on the outer corner of the top lashes and the lower lashes. My lower lashes look completely different. They are so long and full it&#x27;s just amazing. The top lashes now sweep out and hit my brow when they have had mascara added. Try it and use consistently. You won&#x27;t be disappointed imo.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and applied every morning under mascara for 2 months and saw no change. Would not recommend or purchase again. It works as a mascara primer however.</li>
            <li> I was watching Youtube and saw a video about this product and her lashes were super long and looked great. I just had to have it. I put this on before my mascara. You have to let it dry first though. It coats the lashes and when you put your mascara on your eyelashes will look volumized. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve lived without this. I recommend it to anyone wanting long lashes with volume.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but tried this product and it works!  I noticed my lashes on top and bottom are longer.  I put a dab on the back of my hand and rub it into my lash line at night when I take my makeup off.  No fuss and I see the results!  Did not like swiping it on like mascara.  Rubbing into lash line got good result.</li>
            <li> I had a few lashes on my right eye that were shorter then the rest bothered me a lot so I bought this and my lashes have grow out and are actually longer. Did not think it would work but it really does I do only use it before bed at night I dont see how people could put this on and then mascara during the day seems like it would look clumpy but using it just at night works wonders!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this a few times a day for about a week, and there&#x27;s already a big change in my lashes! They look longer, darker, and there are even some on the bottom lid now (which there barely were before)! Before my lashes were sparse, short and straight (sparse mostly due to overuse of mascara, though) now they&#x27;re looking average (after a week!) though not noticeably thicker or less sparse.</li>
            <li> Ok I waited for three weeks to write this review!!! I can&#x27;t believe it this works!!! I started out using Rapid Lash and it was working very well. I saw the reviews on this and the great price and decided to take a chance. I.am so glad I did!! I agree with other reviews that it is gloppy. It does leave a residue on your eyebrows and lashes but who cares. It wipes off easily in the morning. My lashes are super full omg long and have a healthy shine to them. Also I am growing in my eyebrows and am having great results too. I can&#x27;t believe this costs only 7 dollars!! I am a make up lotion and potion woman. I have two bathrooms and a hall closet full of beauty products. This is in my medicine cabinet with my other favorite beauty items. I will be purchasing this again!! Great product for a great price that really really works. I have two friends that have bought this and are getting results as well. So so happy.</li>
            <li> Like this more than the mascara. The mascara runs and smears while this does the job under my waterproof mascara and at night while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice at first my left eyelashes took off first and were more curly, then the right one grew out about 2-3 weeks later and straightened out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely cheaper than Latisse ($120-$200/mo depending on where you live) and no doctor&#x27;s visit required.</li>
            <li> Works, but you have to use it everyday. It especially has given my eyebrows a new life. They are much thicker. Takes about 3 weeks to notice. Be patient.</li>
            <li> Actually seeing longer length in a few lashes after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> While this was shipped fast, it&#x27;s flakey and I haven&#x27;t seen results after two months. It might make my lashes a tiny bit thicker but they aren&#x27;t longer at all. I used a different product that worked a lot quicker and produced great results, but a week after running out, all my lashes fell out, became thinner and took forever to grow back.</li>
            <li> To soon to tell as I have not been consistent with the application as it is a little thick and can&#x27;t apply when I wear mascara.</li>
            <li> I use this serum every night and when there is no need to put on make up during the day for a month now. the applicator takes out too much product that creates too much glob when applied to your lashes so I disperse the product with another old mascara&#x27;s wand ( which has been cleaned). This  product along with the lash accelerator made my lashes grow 60% longer and it is really amazing. some lashes fell out but the replacement were thicker fuller and grew out faster. I have not even used up half of the product and I am expecting better improvement in the next 2 months.</li>
            <li> I feel serum is useless. Doesnt work.</li>
            <li> If i rub it into my eyes it stings a lot so just be careful not to use too much product. I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for about a month. I think it made my lashes slightly thicker than normal, but not longer. I&#x27;m ok with that though since my lashes are so sparse and short.</li>
            <li> It works to grow my brows and lashes.</li>
            <li> This did make my eye lashes long but it also got too thick and sticky after prolong usage..sometimes there&#x27;s dried up serum that looks like skin being peeled off when you put too much or the serum starts drying too fast. But since it did make my eye lashes longer I feel it&#x27;s a great product. My eyelashes did not however get thicker and some were longer than others for a month. It took a week for my results to show, very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it on my lashes and brows and it really helps them grow and I have way less lash loss. Better then the Mac version in my opinion</li>
