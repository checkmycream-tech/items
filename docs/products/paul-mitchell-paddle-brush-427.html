            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Received in time, love it.  </li>
            <li>Really glad they still make it.</li>
            <li>I am on my 4th one and it arrived fast and at a great price too.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the good service.</li>
            <li>Fabulous for blow drying your hair.</li>
            <li>It glides thru your hair smoothly without pulling it.</li>
            <li>feel comfortable when using it</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest washing this product with dawn safe the planet soap just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>I lose my original or want to have one for my purse.</li>
            <li>I have long curly hair and this brush is great for both brushing and straightening.</li>
            <li>and I am pretty sure they just added the \\&quot;Paul Mitchell\\&quot; brand tag after.</li>
            <li>I was finally gifted one of the older versions of this brush and it lasted for five years!</li>
            <li>My hair is so fine it slips right through</li>
            <li>I opened the package and realized how LIGHTWEIGHT the brush was... perfect (because who wants a heavy brush when blow drying?).</li>
            <li>The older one was a much better quality.</li>
            <li>Had this brush and loved it for so long that some of the bristles were gone.  </li>
            <li>I retired my first brush that I originally purchased at a salon and bought this.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>This is a quality hair brush, however it is not quite as good as the previous Super Brush.</li>
            <li>right when I got this, I was dissatisfied and determined to return it...</li>
            <li>The Super Brush 427 seemed to have more cushion and it last me for Y-E-A-R-S.</li>
            <li>To be fair that brush might have been stiffer initially, but I definitely miss the softness of the original.  </li>
            <li>This Paddle Brush made by Paul Mitchell takes the place of the older brush called the Paul Mitchell Super Brush 427.</li>
            <li>USING THIS BRUSH HELPS KEEP MY HAIR SMOOTH AND SOFT AFTER BLOW DRYING IT.</li>
            <li>Plus, I much prefer how the bristles feel!</li>
            <li>I ended up buying the same brush but much better quality from the salon.</li>
            <li>Gave the first to my mum and she absolutely loves it too!</li>
            <li>I have had this exact brush for twenty years.</li>
            <li>My ultimate favorite brush.</li>
            <li>Is there a possibility we can get the original PAUL MITCHELL SUPER BRUSH 427 back on the market?</li>
            <li>Husband loves this brush, he&#x27;s VERY particular.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it makes a squeaky sound when air escapes from the holes in the air cushion when you press the brush against your head.</li>
            <li>Tried others but just didn&#x27;t like them much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty well made but also lacks the curve of the old brush.  </li>
            <li>I had the super brush 427 for years, but could only get this one as a replacement.</li>
            <li>I wish they would make the older style again, but I guess companies have to trim costs somehow.</li>
            <li>It still looks brand new.</li>
            <li>My second brush of this exact make and model.</li>
            <li>Bought a new one and found the old one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bristles are also a bit far apart...</li>
            <li>It seems to work as well as my 15 year old 427 brush.</li>
            <li>I had an old one - must be 20+ years old and finally rubber is coming undone, bristles falling out.  </li>
            <li>This one just isn&#x27;t the same as the old one.</li>
            <li>I bought this as replacement, but the brush is not nearly as soft as the old one.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I had broken the handles of mine, so I knew I had to invest more in one if I expected it to last.  </li>
            <li> Really annoyed I have to type so many words before you will take my rating! :-/</li>
            <li> The old one had a white plastic paddle and was curved slightly however the brush itself seems the same.</li>
            <li> I think this brush will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my third and have no plans to buy any other brush for daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Paul Mitchell paddle brushes for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I can only hope this one lasts half as long.  </li>
            <li> I only wish it had some way of holding on to my hair, just a little.  </li>
            <li> This is not a real Paul Mitchell brush.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at a salon a few years ago and it&#x27;s wooden, where this one isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Bristles are extremely sturdy and are STUCK in the plastic -- I tried pulling one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had my other one for years, from the time I was 16 until I was 28.</li>
            <li> They do not fall apart like the majority of the other brushes I have tried.</li>
            <li> know it is a little more expensive than the drug store brushes, but it is less expensive in the long run.</li>
            <li> The onlllyyy probably I had was before it was used one of the brush numbs where missing other than</li>
            <li> When I got this brush in the mail, it had black hairs in it.</li>
            <li> Was missing it a lot.</li>
            <li> It helps me a lot in managing hair everyday.</li>
            <li> A brush that the bristle pad wouldn&#x27;t detach when I used it was unbelievable.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to get a grip when styling.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair, so before my Paul Mitchell brush, I would break store bought brushes maybe twice a year.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair</li>
            <li> Also, it was such bad quality.</li>
            <li> It survived being thrown (very hard)</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t prefer a wooden base and handle.</li>
            <li> The price wasnt bad either.</li>
            <li> DISGUSTING!!</li>
            <li> This can brush through even the worst of tangles and doesn&#x27;t tear the hair out of my head because of its flexibility.  </li>

            <li> I bought this brush as a gift because I absolutely love mine! In fact, I have purchased several Paul Mitchell Paddle Brushes over the years only after I used them to death. They are made of quality material and great construction.</li>
            <li> Had this brush and loved it for so long that some of the bristles were gone.  So happy to have found a replacement.</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic!</li>

            <li> I have been using Paul Mitchell paddle brushes for as long as I can remember. I have thick, wavy hair, so before my Paul Mitchell brush, I would break store bought brushes maybe twice a year. I was finally gifted one of the older versions of this brush and it lasted for five years! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! A brush that the bristle pad wouldn&#x27;t detach when I used it was unbelievable. I thought it could be a fluke, but bought another just like this and it lasted for 4 years! I just purchased my third and have no plans to buy any other brush for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it is a little more expensive than the drug store brushes, but it is less expensive in the long run. Plus, I much prefer how the bristles feel!</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> I like this brush.  The brush is well made.  I only wish it had some way of holding on to my hair, just a little.  When styling or blow drying my hair.  My hair is so fine it slips right through and it is hard to get a grip when styling.</li>
            <li> This is not a real Paul Mitchell brush. I purchased the brush and when I got it and noticed the lack of quality I went to a verified Paul Mitchell salon and compared. I ended up buying the same brush but much better quality from the salon. Do your homework before you buy.</li>
            <li> Would prefer a smaller version of his brush, but it does the job!</li>
            <li> Good product recommended by hair designer in my neighbor. FYI, one hole in the middle is the area for air-out.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush. Recommended by my hairdresser. Fabulous for blow drying your hair.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell if this was a legitimate brush. IN FACT... right when I got this, I was dissatisfied and determined to return it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However! I opened the package and realized how LIGHTWEIGHT the brush was... perfect (because who wants a heavy brush when blow drying?). Bristles are extremely sturdy and are STUCK in the plastic -- I tried pulling one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are also a bit far apart... I wonder what could happen with my hair &amp; the control I have if I used a brush with tighter bristles.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush. It&#x27;s my second one. I had my other one for years, from the time I was 16 until I was 28. It survived being thrown (very hard) lol at my ex husband and dropped. It eventually cracked, but it still worked great. Never pulled my hair the needles stayed in. I retired my first brush that I originally purchased at a salon and bought this. I can&#x27;t tell the difference in the quality of that one and this one. If you like paddle brushes this one is legit. It glides thru your hair smoothly without pulling it. It feels good.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t prefer a wooden base and handle. I had the super brush 427 for years, but could only get this one as a replacement. The older one was a much better quality. This one just isn&#x27;t the same as the old one. I wish they would make the older style again, but I guess companies have to trim costs somehow. Oh well, maybe I&#x27;ll check and see what Aveda has...</li>
            <li> Product is very good to use, does not comb the hair knotted, very comfortable</li>
            <li> My second pair. Gave the first to my mum and she absolutely loves it too!</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  I have had several of them.  They do not fall apart like the majority of the other brushes I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have had this exact brush for twenty years. It is all I use and will continue to use it. It still looks brand new. I bought a second one just in case I lose my original or want to have one for my purse.</li>
            <li> Would like a grey/silver one. I love this brush.</li>
            <li> It works well! Thanks for the good service.</li>
            <li> feel comfortable when using it</li>
            <li> I had this brush for several years and after traveling this summer could not locate it. Was missing it a lot. I have long curly hair and this brush is great for both brushing and straightening. Bought a new one and found the old one. Very happy with both  Would definitely recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> Received in time, love it.  Really annoyed I have to type so many words before you will take my rating! :-/</li>
            <li> Awesome hairbrush. It helps me a lot in managing hair everyday.</li>

It&#x27;s pretty well made but also lacks the curve of the old brush.  For me, with this product, it&#x27;s definitely a case of they don&#x27;t make me like they used to!!</li>
            <li> I think this brush will last a long time.It is good quality.It also makes my hair smooth and silky.The price wasnt bad either.</li>
            <li> My ultimate favorite brush. I have owned several of these and given them to friends/sisters as gifts.</li>
            <li> Like the brush, but have lost tons of bristles in a short time.</li>
            <li> bought this for my fiance who was constantly using mine. He loves it! I bought mine at a salon a few years ago and it&#x27;s wooden, where this one isn&#x27;t. But it&#x27;s still great.</li>
            <li> It seems to work as well as my 15 year old 427 brush. The old one had a white plastic paddle and was curved slightly however the brush itself seems the same. The only downside is that it makes a squeaky sound when air escapes from the holes in the air cushion when you press the brush against your head. Maybe that will go away over time.</li>
            <li> When I got this brush in the mail, it had black hairs in it. DISGUSTING!! Also, it was such bad quality. It looked and felt like a $2 brush and I am pretty sure they just added the \\&quot;Paul Mitchell\\&quot; brand tag after. RIP OFF!! I am getting my money back.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever! I had one of these brushes for about 15 years until finally the rubber started tearing. Tried others but just didn&#x27;t like them much. Finally ordered this one again. Really glad they still make it. Happily using it again :-)</li>
            <li> I cannot be without this brush! It is the best one I have ever owned. I am on my 4th one and it arrived fast and at a great price too.</li>
            <li> Love this paddle brush!  Saw a video of a girl blow drying her bob in 3 minutes with a paddle brush and I just had to have this one when I read the reviews on it!  I had broken the handles of mine, so I knew I had to invest more in one if I expected it to last.  I am so happy with it and love the 3 min. blow drys!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush... need to order another one!</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair and I don&#x27;t know what I would do without my Paul Mitchell paddle brush.  This can brush through even the worst of tangles and doesn&#x27;t tear the hair out of my head because of its flexibility.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable on the scalp</li>
            <li> Brush was damaged, packaging was not.</li>
