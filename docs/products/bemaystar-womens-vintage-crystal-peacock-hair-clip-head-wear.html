            <li>Obviously cheaply made!</li>
            <li>I really love it</li>
            <li>Perhaps with thinner hair it will hold up better.</li>
            <li>Any woman would love it.</li>
            <li>I love the shiny stones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I can find a way to make it look cute.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear this hair clip.</li>
            <li>You mostly get what you pay for online.</li>
            <li>but it is cute.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>For the amount of money I paid was satisfied with the product that I received.</li>
            <li>I love wearing it.</li>
            <li>The clip holds a lot better than most</li>

            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Look even better in person.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I ordered this initially because the price was excellent and I already had another hair clip from this brand</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would buy more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will surely look forward to putting this hair piece on when I go out.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting three of these clips because I love the design.</li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>Not my favorite pieces of jewelery</li>
            <li>She love it.</li>
            <li>For the price it is okay, but not what I was wanting.</li>
            <li>It looks even better than the picture.</li>
            <li>Glad that I will not purchase from this company ever again.</li>
            <li>and i love it in my hair</li>
            <li>plus free shipping!)</li>
            <li>I got plenty of compliments &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>That said, it looks lovely and stays in my hair well.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love them.</li>
            <li>They are so cute &amp; sparkly.</li>
            <li>This is an ok hair clip I guess what do you expect for the price.</li>
            <li>Love the colors and the size.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the switch out.</li>
            <li>The stones sparkle and makes it much better.</li>
            <li>They are cute.  </li>
            <li>I would like it better if it had a silver or metal colored clip</li>
            <li>most of my jewelry is not gold colored.</li>
            <li>might order some more for gifts for others.</li>
            <li>and I just love them and shipping</li>
            <li>thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>most of us females love.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to make it into a necklace or perhaps attach a better quality clip to the peacock.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>SO cute :)</li>
            <li>and I love the color</li>
            <li>And as it turned out, her favorite Auntie (who loves Peacock&#x27;s) has one just like it.</li>
            <li>Oddly enough the package said it was a toy, that is about the best description of the piece.  </li>
            <li>Better used as a side hair clip.  </li>
            <li>it was lot better quality</li>
            <li>It looks way better in the photo than in reality.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this clip.</li>
            <li>SO I PUT IT IN MY GARDEN :)</li>

            <li>I really love it</li>
            <li>This shiny peacock barrette is so cute.  </li>
            <li>It is a great accessory to an outfit and definitely makes you stand out in a good way.  </li>
            <li>Just needs to be secured better to the peacock.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It was a lovely piece.</li>

            <li>And am hoping to buy more soon.  </li>

            <li>It is adorable and the gems do not fall off.</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful hair clip!</li>
            <li>my mom is going to love it for Christmas :-)</li>
            <li>but I think it is cute.</li>
            <li>In the picture, the tail has mostly turquoise stones.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I wanted because it&#x27;s my favorite color</li>

            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this barret.  </li>
            <li>It is lovely and well made.</li>
            <li>but it feels sturdy and the gems look nice, not too gaudy or cheap</li>
            <li>for the sturdiness of the hinge/clip, i&#x27;m sure like the Conair clips i get from CVS, one day it will snap....</li>
            <li>In fact, I wish I had purchased more.  </li>
            <li>this is my most favorite hair clip at this time</li>
            <li>This looks similar to the piece i bought for myself, but I feel like it&#x27;s a perfect complement.</li>
            <li>was a more mono-toned greenish-blue.  </li>
            <li>I wont be buying more.</li>
            <li>Looks really cute in my grandaughters hair.</li>

            <li>lovely.  </li>
            <li>It is cute for the price  </li>
            <li>I wish it would have worked and lasted more than the one time I attempted to put it in my hair.</li>
            <li>but it will do, what more can you ask for for the price</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice but too cheap quality.</li>

            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;barrette&amp;#34; size than a hair clip.</li>

            <li>but I love it and its super adorable</li>
            <li>got it and love it to wear them when i go out or around the house they are very pretty and people love them also ask where i got them</li>
            <li>The crystal color is lovely but it will not be worn as much as originally planned.</li>
            <li>I say for the price its more than worth buying it!</li>
            <li>I was impressed by the quality of this cute little hair clip.</li>
            <li>I have two they are so sparkly cute and unique.</li>
            <li>much more unique.</li>
            <li>but it was easy to fix.</li>
            <li>Ok so the pin is worth the money that you pay for but it isn&#x27;t something that grand.</li>
            <li>easy fix, just bend the two prongs holding the piece that goes into your hair.</li>
            <li>does not close easily</li>
            <li>Breaks easily. .</li>
            <li>Easy on / off as well.</li>
            <li>Even tho they aren&#x27;t like the first one I liked so much that I ordered more, they&#x27;re quite nice for the price.</li>
            <li>Bought it for someone special and they absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The bright turquoise stones are super sparkly and pretty.</li>
            <li>This was beautiful, the price was unbelievably low and it came very, very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty and at an amazing price.</li>
            <li>really cute, holds well, beautiful color, a nice small size.</li>
            <li>it has a beautiful shade of blue</li>
            <li>Crystals are very pretty and clear, and beautiful color, set neatly.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I thought it would be beautiful in her blonde hair</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful piece of hair jewelry, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily repairable but you won&#x27;t be able to use it to do more than just look pretty.</li>
            <li>I wore it out and about all day and evening yesterday and it held just fine.</li>
            <li>and i can easily pull it off as a genuine vintage hair clip</li>
            <li>Not too impressed with the slightly padded envelope it arrived in.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to work just fine.  </li>
            <li>The stones in this are fine.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine, I can work with it.</li>
            <li>Transaction went fine and the item came on time.</li>
            <li>all in all a fine product</li>
            <li>Does not work for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to receive this hair pin in a good condition (like the picture shows).</li>
            <li>This clip is very pretty but the clasp is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>This shipped super fast, and is so gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>It is fine, but cheap looking.</li>
            <li>The one that wasn&#x27;t broke was very pretty!</li>
            <li>The little peacock was perfect.</li>
            <li>Appreciate it very much!!</li>
            <li>This is very pretty!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect little accessory .</li>
            <li>Very pretty!</li>
            <li>Anyhow, they&#x27;re great little clips and will add a nice touch to a bun.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just great and made a nice little gift.</li>
            <li>Products sold on the internet should have an accurate picture.  </li>
            <li>I will still use it......and would have still purchased it with an accurate measurement given.  </li>
            <li>I would not have bought it if an accurate label for the product had been used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it made her Happy until the 3rd time she put it in her hair and it broke.she called me at work upset and said it broke.so i sent a email to the seller and still no reply e-mail</li>
            <li>Based on the price it was a great deal, not made to last though.</li>
            <li>AT A FANTASTIC PRICE.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically plastic and cheap metal, and wouldn&#x27;t clasp.</li>
            <li>Still, 99-cents and free shipping?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to fix the cheaply made clasp but it won&#x27;t close.</li>
            <li>Cheap sprayed on gold that peels off</li>
            <li>it fits perfect on the side of a messy bun.</li>
            <li>but they are cheap, aren&#x27;t they?</li>
            <li>The stones look cheap close up.</li>
            <li>the price was great overall</li>
            <li>but it was just so cheap.</li>
            <li>It looks cheap and it feels too chunky.  </li>
            <li>since it is having free shipping.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the clip that is intended to hold the piece in your hair is horrendously cheap.  </li>
            <li>I had ordered it when it was .87 cents with free shipping, and I thought, what&#x27;s to lose.</li>
            <li>The gems are a bright turquoise (much brighter than in the picture) and the metal is a bright yellow gold color.</li>
            <li>I will enjoy wearing it.  </li>
            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and made in metal.</li>
            <li>The price was cheap but the clip doesn&#x27;t look cheap.  </li>
            <li>at all and definitely cheap looking -</li>
            <li>comfortably on ones head.</li>
            <li>This is cheap: in price and in quality.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and doesn&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li>It looks great in my hair and actually stays in place.</li>
            <li>May even remove the barrette and secure it to an alligator clip.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I had to buy another one.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect gems since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>Was cheap but, does not look it.</li>
            <li>Was so cheap that she wouldn&#x27;t wear it.  </li>
            <li>The price was too cheap</li>
            <li>and looks cheap.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>i ordered several, i have already worn mine to great compliments and gave one as a gift.</li>
            <li>Beautiful,but stones aren&#x27;t secure.</li>
            <li>I have very only hair, and this clip is great for a side swept look.  </li>
            <li>I am sure I will get my moneys worth out of it</li>
            <li>So if you want a barrette, this is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I think the recipient will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>This was $0.65 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>thank goodness it was cheap.</li>
            <li>they hold securely in your hair</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s really cheap in all</li>
            <li>the stones are bright and clear.  </li>
            <li>Colors are great and will go with several outfits.</li>
            <li>Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li>Looks beyond cheap, couldn&#x27;t even wear it.</li>
            <li>good for 4 year old...</li>
            <li>Which is good because I&#x27;m getting too old to have anything huge in my hair .</li>
            <li>They look good and so far no problems on the stones or the snap parts.</li>
            <li>This hair clip is adorable and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>That said, the price was right and I have had many compliments on the hairclip.</li>
            <li>This hair clip is so pretty!!</li>
            <li>I love peacock design jewelry, and this hair clip is beautiful, so much so that I bought a second one.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely beautiful, I received it in good enough time, there wasn&#x27;t a need for a rush, it&#x27;s a wee bit smaller than I had hoped it would be,  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most sturdy accessory (you&#x27;re paying less than a dollar for it!), but it&#x27;s really pretty and looks awesome in my hair.</li>
            <li>this clip broke right away very cheap its a cute clip just wish it wouldn&#x27;t have broke so fast</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so feminine and unique.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>was a lot faster then originally stated by a month.</li>
            <li>but I received a pink one instead - while it is beautiful and the color I probably should have ordered for my skin tone it..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a fun hair clip to wear for the heck of it!</li>
            <li>the the original picture of it.</li>
            <li>These will make such a nice gift!</li>
            <li>She got rather excited about this hair clip when we received it.  </li>
            <li>it is very pretty and such a great deal.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a dollar!</li>
            <li>Thanks for everything!  :)</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful little Barrette and since I have fine hair it would have worked fine.  </li>
            <li>Love this hair clips because is the perfect size, not too big and not too small, the color is nice and the price is great, they are very expensive everywhere, so it&#x27;s a great saver and looks really cute on the hair...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not what I expected but its nice to Indiany for my taste but its nice because color wasn&#x27;t what was on the site</li>
            <li>bought it as a gift for someone who has a lot of hair and worried she wouldn&#x27;t be able to fit much in it</li>
            <li>Clip doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of hair, but it was cheap, and cute, so I can&#x27;t really complain here.</li>
            <li>Found these super cheap for someone that loves peacocks.  </li>
            <li>was super cheap, so I rolled the dice.  </li>
            <li>These pieces are nice, amazingly low in pricing and make lovely gifts.</li>
            <li>super pretty...not cheap looking at all.  </li>
            <li>So for the price I would have been happy eve if it was a one time wear, but I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth out of this one</li>
            <li>it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services</li>
            <li>Colors not exactly as pictures, but still beautiful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and hold her hair pretty well, better then most of the ones she has bought from stores, they delivered it within the time given.</li>
            <li>Very sparkly and a lovely blue and rose gold color!  </li>
            <li>I dont think I will wait til I have something special to wear it to</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn it yet because I am waiting for a special occasion</li>
            <li>It broke right when I took it out of the package!</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive, had free shipping, is pretty, and will be worn!  </li>
            <li>I still love it, they look realistic, not like cheap plastic you may see in the stores sometimes.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive it so quickly.</li>
            <li>The item I received was bright brass and only teal</li>
            <li>as do all hair clips under $10 but for the price and the fun, pretty design, and how well it matches my dress :) can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li>I really thought I was going to be able to wear this too the wedding, but I guess not.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fair enough to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought two because one will not hold up much hair.</li>
            <li>I got the full refund.</li>
            <li>It was a barrette which is good and the coloring is obviously different then the picture</li>
            <li>while it wasn&#x27;t expensive,it also wasn&#x27;t worth ordering.it&#x27;s just too cheaply made</li>
            <li>I love these hair clips soo much, I bought two of these and use them all of the time.  </li>
            <li>Good enough quality for the price.</li>
            <li>not a silver 1 with blue but its all good</li>
            <li>It really took over a month to receive, but now that I have the three items I am satisfied withmy purcahse.</li>
            <li>Good for just maybe a side pull up of hair or for someone younger.</li>
            <li>Good quality ESPECIALLY for the price.</li>
            <li>Of course it is not 100% as neat as the picture but for the price, not bad.</li>
            <li>not bad for price</li>
            <li>This was a gift for a very special young woman on a very special occasion...</li>
            <li>Peacock hair clip is bright blue and very pretty.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit dissatisfied with how easily it broke the first time I put it in.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty barrette with a strong clasp.  </li>
            <li>This is very pretty, but in real life you see a lot more of the gold setting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute little thing, and I think it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and took a shot at this because I&#x27;ve been lucky on this type of cheapy jewelry here on Amazon before.</li>
            <li>Was delivered quickly and unharmed.</li>
            <li>Ddliverh is quick.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>much smaller than I thought the jewelry was nice the clip for the hair was cheap again</li>
            <li>This is a decent quality barrette with a perfectly lovely peacock on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely more yellow gold than the picture shows, but I&#x27;m still glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Cute, but doesn&#x27;t really sit well or look right in my hair.</li>
            <li>this is a beautiful clip, although cheap, it seems to be pretty sturdy, but is a little troublesome to close</li>
            <li>It was a little smaller than I thought it would be, but I&#x27;m still able to get great use out of it!</li>
            <li>Clip is SUPER cheap and broke within the first hour of wearing it.  </li>
            <li>quality at a high level, this seller quickly sent the goods, the idea is very original position</li>
            <li>These are very pretty.</li>
            <li>But its very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty though.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>but if you do wear gold it is very pretty.</li>
            <li>ITS LIGHT AND PRETTY.</li>
            <li>Very pretty accent for your hair</li>
            <li>this hair clip is very pretty but does not stay in my hair at all.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, but it is one of those snap/clasp closures.  </li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty clip.</li>
            <li>This was actually very pretty</li>
            <li>The peacock itself with all the stones is very pretty.</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li>The picture looks pretty but the time itself looks cheap.  </li>
            <li>This is not vintage, though it is very pretty and made to look vintage.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>but very pretty</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>but it is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty hair clip</li>
            <li>very cute addition to any outfit, especially in darker colored hair.</li>
            <li>its very pretty.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty in person.</li>
            <li>Beautiful but heavy.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect size, not too large, not too small.  </li>
            <li>But I really wanted 4 more like the first one.</li>
            <li>very sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li>It is not huge - it is dainty and pretty.</li>
            <li>I LIKE IT VERY MUCH AND WILL SURELY ORDER MORE IN THE FUTURE.  </li>
            <li>However, it broke the first time I wore it!</li>
            <li>These are SO pretty!  </li>
            <li>Pretty clip!  </li>
            <li>This is really pretty!</li>
            <li>Pretty!</li>
            <li>Very pretty hairclip well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty just sitting on my bureau!</li>
            <li>Pretty!</li>
            <li>Bright and blingy and  just the right color for a grey headed do.  </li>
            <li>Unbelievable quick delivery for a beautiful piece of ornamental jewelry.</li>
            <li>This is so pretty and unique, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Too pretty and will be lovely on my new scarf!</li>
            <li>and really you wouldn&#x27;t want them to be huge if it&#x27;s something to wear in your hair.</li>
            <li>Cannot fit much hair in the barrette.  </li>
            <li>It is sparkly and shine (not too much to be indecent) and  doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and thought the blue would look great in my red hair, but instead I got the light pastel barrette.</li>
            <li>I bought a colorful one of these for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so well that I bought this blue one for myself.</li>
            <li>In my order I actually received two of this clip which I wasn&#x27;t expecting, so that was nice.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice smaller hair clip that I bought to enhance updo styles it works well</li>
            <li>its worth....</li>
            <li>It is worth the dollar I paid for it.</li>
            <li>and I was totally surprised at how cute it is.  </li>
            <li>I liked these clips but only a couple of stones came off.</li>
            <li>so it was worth the purchase</li>
            <li>The peacock is smaller than I expected, but still very beautiful.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for the lovely barrette.</li>
            <li>I bought this for young child and it surely would not work.  </li>
            <li>Such a nice hair accessory.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful barrette but too small to hold a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>Fantastic price on this, have passed up very similar items in stores for 10 time more $$</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get my $1 worth</li>
            <li>:) So far I have used it a couple of times and have not had any issues with it opening and falling out.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant &amp; easy to take off without ruining your hairdo.</li>
            <li>I was not handling it in a rough fashion, I was taking good care of it and hadn&#x27;t worn it as soon as I had gotten it.</li>
            <li>Colorful piece.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s def worth waiting for.</li>
            <li>so I put in a glass vase and it looks nice enough.</li>
            <li>I truly have gotten my monies worth</li>
            <li>This is not very heavy, great quality nor very big.</li>
            <li>Super pretty.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>but if you need it right away or if you are buying it as a gift you will need to order it waaay in advance.  </li>
            <li>I notified this seller and they said they would send one right out.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s right, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Right size for her size.</li>
            <li>Then of course the price is right.</li>
            <li>So if you need this right away don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li>right just a warning</li>
            <li>Just the right size, Stays on well .</li>
            <li>however it doesn&#x27;t clip right.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice piece with great color and you can&#x27;t beat the price, however not sellers fault it is a little small for my taste.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these 4 as gifts for 10 year old girls, expecting to get 4 more like the first one.</li>
            <li>This hair clip is a beautiful piece, the only thing that I would change about it is that it needs to have a bigger clip.</li>
            <li>I can hardly wait for an occasion to wear this beautiful piece in my hair.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a very large sturdy clip.</li>
            <li>FOR MY hair look SPECTACULAR IN ANY MODERN AND SOCIAL EVENT ..</li>
            <li>Bought for my young daughter because it was super cheap.  </li>
            <li>but it is beautiful enough that I ordered a second one just like the first.  </li>
            <li>Not as pretty as the pic, but still worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth the gamble though it was pretty</li>
            <li>metal is such a bright cheap yellow color.</li>
            <li>This clip would work wonderful on a child and be absolutely adorable, or if you have thin hair it could possibly work for you as well.</li>
            <li>Cute, flashy in a elegant way, and stays in hair quite nicely.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty piece, it just does not stay in my hair very well, worth the price tho.</li>
            <li>The original picture showed an alligator style clip, which is much easier to use, and 2: The clip broke the first time I opened it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a very pretty blue peacock hair clip and love it.</li>
            <li>Some said that it&#x27;s more appropriate for little girls or dress up.  </li>
            <li>You only get one, but it sure is pretty!</li>
            <li>this is so pretty and just the right size for a childs head or an adults head...</li>
            <li>It is so pretty  and just the right size.</li>
            <li>Appropriate for a child, not so much for an adult.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok enough, but I couldn&#x27;t use it and it didn&#x27;t seem worth trying to return.</li>
            <li>then my order is complete thanks again....:)</li>
            <li>The clip mechanism is of good quality &amp; the overall quality is more than I expected for the price...certainly better than anything I have found in local stores &amp;</li>
            <li>I really like this hair clip, it is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but it looks great and has a very secure hold.</li>
            <li>the weight for me is just right, it&#x27;s not heavy or light to put on your head.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>If anyone where to purchase this I think it would be good for a little girl.</li>
            <li>gave it 4 stars because it really is pretty and it was so very, very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very elegant and the price was great, so one can afford to get a few different colours to match different things.</li>
            <li>This is so pretty</li>
            <li>Pretty piece.</li>
            <li>It is pretty</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The color is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>It is so pretty.</li>
            <li>Women at work are always commenting on how pretty it is.</li>
            <li>At this unbelievably low price (one dollar, free shipping!)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re still pretty for 89 cents.</li>
            <li>Broke the first time i tried to use it.</li>
            <li>Its really pretty</li>
            <li>I would have preferred purple to blue, but did love the barrette.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so pretty and diverse to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not those colors and clip broke in first use.. dont buy this product</li>
            <li>It broke the first time I clipped it in my hair.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Still pretty but not as showed.&lt;br /&gt;Ok quality.</li>
            <li>and now I have to hot glue the bead onto it.</li>
            <li>Its not as pretty as it was in the picture.</li>
            <li>This is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>Pretty</li>
            <li>I only wish it held more hair, and I don&#x27;t have a lot like I did as a teenager, but it won&#x27;t hold all my hair, so I put it in a ponytail holder first.</li>
            <li>pretty Got as gift for someone.</li>
            <li>The clip was smaller than I imagined so all in all this was an ok purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a decoration only.</li>
            <li>many compliments; bought extra for gifts.</li>
            <li>It broke the first time I tried to wear it.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty and I like the design.</li>
            <li>They shine and gleam in that pretty way</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li>her first prom.</li>
            <li>, I will wear it when Ever its so pretty it will dress up any day .</li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME I WORE IT</li>
            <li>I will glue it back in to place, but it would have been better if it kept in tact to begin with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty though, unusable.</li>
            <li>Broke on the first day.</li>
            <li>This is just as pretty in person as on the picture.</li>
            <li>This clip is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>This pretty peacock barrette fell apart the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Will go with many different types of clothing.</li>
            <li>The product was pretty but the hair clip part of it was flimsy.  </li>
            <li>so I thought it would be pretty for her.</li>
            <li>I definitely order again if I need more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty but the clip was a spring/release clip that never worked.  </li>
            <li>This barrett is so pretty.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t have your heart set on it matching the picture exactly</li>
            <li>I could solder it back on myself, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get lots of use out of it.</li>
            <li>It is  a perfect size, not too small and not too big.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty, but there is no grip in the claps</li>
            <li>but mine was pretty close</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s such a lovely hair clip that before I could even wear it once my mother took it and decided I have given it to her.</li>
            <li>, I DO know how much hair to put into a clip (I didn&#x27;t overload the clip with hair), and it literally broke before I had even finished with my hair!</li>
            <li>Definitely a must-have :)</li>
            <li>Great for ladies with thick hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter-in -law just got married &amp; I bought these for all the bridesmaides &amp; flower girls to wear in the wedding.</li>
            <li>It is sparkly and pretty</li>
            <li>This is a pretty hair barrette.  </li>
            <li>but it was pretty as the picture show.</li>
            <li>I have wore this clip in the front and back of my hair, and people love it.</li>
            <li>It is really pretty.</li>
            <li>It broke the first time I tried to clip it into my hair.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it would work better on short hair or for a child.</li>
            <li>Thank you, I received my item and it as pretty</li>
            <li>This is a really pretty hair barrette, both my daughter and I will wear it.  </li>
            <li>The barrette looks as pretty as the photo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, it holds well and its is a pretty color.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty.</li>
            <li>Mine came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>It broke the first time I tried to wear it...</li>
            <li>First, if you&#x27;ve been browsing hair pieces from this vendor, note that this is not a clip, but rather a barette.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it because it is shiny and pretty</li>
            <li>Pretty hair bow.</li>
            <li>really pretty.</li>
            <li>I am thinking of buying a third brooch because these are so stylish and bedazzled.</li>
            <li>It is pretty.</li>
            <li>This clip is pretty, but it didn&#x27;t come in silver, it was gold tone.</li>
            <li>Still gonna wear it in my wedding but wish it looked exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>It was pretty though.</li>
            <li>Will be looking for a couple more in different colors.</li>
            <li>The first day I wore it, a couple hours of school, I had problems getting it to stay it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sparkly and pretty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to get some more of these form the same shipper.</li>
            <li>This is very pretty, It is better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>a positive note, the shipping was extremely quick and considering the item is a dollar we really don&#x27;t have much to complain about.  </li>
            <li>Something flat for decoration in the hair would be better.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I liked it.</li>
            <li>I am good at fixing things, soldering, and everything, but this is a very delicate piece of cheap material.</li>
            <li>One of the stones was loose when I received it, but it glued right in :)</li>
            <li>It was brand new and it cam quick so that was a plus.</li>
            <li>It is really a good purchase for such a low price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My ten year old daughter (this was specifically for her) liked the coloring regardless.  </li>
            <li>It looked pretty nice in my dark hair, buuuuutttttt...</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t worth getting though, because this is a seriously good deal on it.</li>
            <li>Nice design at good price, but a little too heavy as it&#x27;s made of molded alloy</li>
            <li>It came all in one piece, no loose crystals, with the barrette mechanism working fine.</li>
            <li>Lots of positive comments.</li>
            <li>perfect size barrette for a half up-half down hair style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price, but not good quality.</li>
            <li>but I really really like the first one.</li>
            <li>Its  very small and the stones are set cheaply ,but the color is nice .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty much holds my hair in tack.</li>
            <li>i still think its pretty and mine has not broken</li>
            <li>This lovely hair clip is about 2.5 inches long and looks just like the picture.  </li>
            <li>Very sparkly and pretty.  </li>
            <li>I suppose as long as you&#x27;re not abusing the barrette, it will fit you well!</li>
            <li>It is small, but a good hair clip.</li>
            <li>It does have good qualities just really small.</li>
            <li>If you want a small barette this is good for you</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S BEAUTIFUL AND BROKEN....</li>
            <li>not as large as I thought it would be</li>
            <li>Its almost a rose gold color the stones are light are dark blue.</li>
            <li>It is not really appropriate for much more than costume, dress-up pretend or 6 year old gifting :)  </li>
            <li>Its a bit smaller than I thought but still very pretty and useful.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for someone with fine short hair.  </li>
            <li>Smaller is fine.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty, the fastener appears stable, and decently made.</li>
            <li>Nice little hair clip</li>
            <li>Quality seem s a little on the cheap side, but, then again it was cheap</li>
            <li>Picture is fairly accurate to the actual product, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>Please post an accurate picture next time.</li>
            <li>Very smaall tho.</li>
            <li>I know the item did not cost much.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>and I realized I didn&#x27;t read the whole thing or details.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much.</li>
            <li>Much prettier in the picture.</li>
            <li>The clip doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair very well though.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>but again it is VERY inexpensive</li>
            <li>Additionally, it is very flimsy and the clip keeps popping out.</li>
            <li>Because it is very cheap,so i decide to discard it not return it.</li>
            <li>We really enjoy the extra touch they add to our hair.</li>
            <li>Really I sent them the messages from my Amazon account.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t stand up to much damage.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>If it wasnt so cheap I would have sent it back..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not meant to really hold hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for this clip.</li>
            <li>I really really like it.  </li>
            <li>and it really stays in place.</li>
            <li>The stones are really shiny.</li>
            <li>Much Prettier than the photograph.</li>
            <li>Be ready to wait a while for shipping</li>
            <li>so much I gave it to my granddaughter and I am going to get me another one.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear it very often</li>
            <li>but when I do this hair clip stands out and people notice it and tell me how much they like it in my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Very eye-catching.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really sturdy to keep my hair up</li>
            <li>Much blunt.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold much hair, but it&#x27;s not meant to.  </li>
            <li>The picture is much nicer than the product.</li>
            <li>.it would make it much easier  thanks</li>
            <li>They are also much cheaper on Ebay.</li>
            <li>The design is very elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>VERY CHEEP</li>
            <li>AND IT BROKE SO FAST</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really a matter of taste.  </li>
            <li>very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>Sort of wish I had purxhased two, as I have very thixk hair.</li>
            <li>Really you should just save your couple bucks</li>
            <li>I have very think curly hair that is almost to my waist</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>so much it really stands out</li>
            <li>All stones are in-tact &amp; very shiny and the clip is not broken.</li>
            <li>Really looked nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li>I really shouldn&#x27;t complain for what I paid for this.  </li>
            <li>I thought that this was adorable - but it arrived and was not at ALL what I expected...</li>
            <li>It was such a cheap product, I probably won&#x27;t take the time to return it, but I would not recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>I really like it just wish it worked.</li>
            <li>I dont wear it that much</li>
            <li>Made very well.</li>
            <li>Very pretty-pretty fast shipping.</li>
            <li>very flimsy and fell apart in 2 days.</li>
            <li>goldtone is very brassy</li>
            <li>The pricing is extemely reasonable.</li>
            <li>Seems very durable.</li>
            <li>While the real thing does look &#x27;cheaper&#x27; than the photo presented, for the price</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a spring barrette, which I like because it really helps keep it in her hair.</li>
            <li>It was just as it appears on the website &amp; is even prettier in real life.</li>
            <li>So cute and classy and simple to dress up any outfit!</li>
            <li>I liked the look of it because of the different color blue that is on the picture</li>
            <li>It is just as described, and the crystals are nice and sparkly, in two different shades of blue.</li>
            <li>A cute little bit of kitch in the right circumstances.</li>
            <li>Not a good product looks cheap and very light weight.</li>
            <li>Although it was late, it is very cute and it certainly does not look like it cost $.99.</li>
            <li>This is small but cute!</li>
            <li>This hair clip is small but so cute!</li>
            <li>My hair is not really thick and still couldn&#x27;t get the clasp to stay closed to be able to wear it.</li>
            <li>This is pretty, the plating isn&#x27;t quite as bright cheap yellow as the blue or the pink ones, and done a bit more delicately than either of those two.</li>
            <li>as long as you don&#x27;t need it right away, it was totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>lolol as expected for such a low price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about 3 inches long, if that, and secure well with</li>
            <li>and if I want to wear it, I have to use other pins and barrettes first to secure my hair</li>
            <li>Also, the woman suggesting that this item is better sized for a child must wear enormous clips because I found the size to be completely acceptable for my adult woman self.</li>
            <li>the pin is quite nice but rather small.</li>
            <li>My hair is short, thick, and curly and this looks very cute on my hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but it doesn&#x27;t look as good as the picture, and the clip is bad.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be a larger piece so that I could wear it above a bun or as a more decorative piece in my hair.</li>
            <li>love it, its tiny and simple and well made!</li>
            <li>The colir is vibrant and the stones are sparkly.</li>
            <li>Looks decent otherwise.</li>
            <li>For what I paid, I will be okay gluing it back on, or changing out the back to a pin.</li>
            <li>so I added it to the above Peacocks on my white mantle to add more sparkle in my Peacock theme.  </li>
            <li>Also, the clasp where you open it is kind of jammed.</li>
            <li>I had to bend it to get it to function even halfway decently.</li>
            <li>If you are older than preteen, you may not be so overwhelmed.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty if it had a clip on the back.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty but not as big as I thought.  </li>
            <li>very pretty but low quality clip.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty blue color.</li>
            <li>So highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Pretty little barrette and received it quickly!  </li>
            <li>Personally I didnt like the back part of the clip, but my mom said it holds on better than the new clips.</li>
            <li>I wish the material quality to be little better...</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t dare tell them how little I paid for it :)</li>
            <li>I can add just a little something and get so many complements.</li>
            <li>Cute little thing.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely little touch to any hairdo.</li>
            <li>This is definately a cute little barrette.</li>
            <li>A little more copper than gold.</li>
            <li>This little clip is adorable.</li>
            <li>It took a little longer than expected for shipping, but the product itself is nice and worth waiting for.</li>
            <li>It was not really my style, the gold is too shiny and adds a cheap feel.</li>
            <li>And not thick hair either.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely order more in the near future.</li>
            <li>If you have your heart set on what is in the picture, you&#x27;ll probably be disappointed, but in my opinion the final product is much more beautiful.</li>
            <li>They are intended as accents to side of French Roll or to pull top layers, long bangs, etc to one side.</li>
            <li>The only reason why this got 4 stars was because it was such a pain trying to snap the barett in my hair and taking it out hurt my fingers but overall nice product.</li>
            <li>At least I can save the stones for my own art work.</li>
            <li>She has a full head of thick, medium-length, wavy hair &amp; the clip holds securely without snarling in the peacock tail (even if she affixes it herself).</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin, silver hair and it rarely falls out.</li>
            <li>The first barrette that I liked so much and reviewed above is 3 3/4 inches long, has very pretty turquoise, lavender and \\&quot;diamond\\&quot; stones, with a black stone for the eye, and is actually prettier than shown in the  picture.</li>
            <li>But when I went to put it in my hair, back clip came right off.  </li>
            <li>I got it in the mail earlier than I expected which is not a bad thing, and it looks exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a quality product for very little money, but it&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
            <li>daughter, the lucky recipient, was thrilled and has worn it pretty much daily without any ill effects to the barrette clip part or the sparkles.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>new.  </li>
            <li>But other than that pretty little hair bow nice and</li>
            <li>Considering that this was only a buck, I really didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li>It is about 3 inches long and very sparkly with all those pretty gems stones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is a pretty clip and looks fantastic in my hair though you should be warned, it is quite small.</li>
            <li>The one we received has only light blue rhinestones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks so much cant wait to get the last one i order</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much smaller than I expected, but I&#x27;m still pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>The jewels are very clear with a well done body and tail.</li>
            <li>I was very much looking forward to the different tones in this clip.</li>
            <li>Very very mature looking.  </li>
            <li>Very classy.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>Plus, it came 2 weeks early!</li>
            <li>For the low price I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be as pretty as it is.</li>
            <li>The teal stones just aren&#x27;t as pretty as a solid.</li>
            <li>The detail to this hair clip is so pretty and is made well the only thing is I wouldn&#x27;t call this a womens</li>
            <li>It is cute but too small.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, she was thrilled with it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too big, it&#x27;s a bit smaller than I thought, which will actually make it more versatile and functional than you may be led to believe by the picture.</li>
            <li>ABOUT TWO INCHES SMALL BUT EXTEMLY CUTE</li>
            <li>The price is simply a steal,you could not find such a unique barrette in the store for this price.....</li>
            <li>Really pretty for a very low price.</li>
            <li>The peacock broke off the barrette part the first time I tried to open it.</li>
            <li>Such a pretty piece ..</li>
            <li>They just take a long time to deliver, but are worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty in my red hair.  </li>
            <li>bought several, some stones fell out the first day worn.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture, except that the aqua blue stones are brighter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The metal of the clip looks a bit fragile, but so far so good, nothing can be complained of</li>
            <li>how nice it is shipping is a little long (overseas)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is much cheaper than excepted for such high quality.</li>
            <li>The colors are a little bit different and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>It was less than $1 and had free shipping</li>
            <li>Was large enough for an adult,but not same color or as pretty as the picture.</li>
            <li>I am not surprised at the quality due to very cheap price.</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ve too fine and little hair for the pin to hold.  </li>
            <li>it was a little too small, but very nice.</li>
            <li>I think the design itself isn&#x27;t too bad, was hoping it would be a little more eye catching,  but its not bad.</li>
            <li>It is too small to pin anything back really, it should be using with a rubber band or larger clip to do any kind of styling.</li>
            <li>very pretty starts to tarnish only wear a couple times if you wanted to look the same</li>
            <li>I was disappointed with this purchase, it&#x27;s beautiful but the barrette part was super cheap and delicate, broke before even arriving.</li>
            <li>It is  a little cheap...</li>
            <li>but a little cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>This clip is super cute, and in previous reviews I read that the clip was small</li>
            <li>It is shipped from Hong Kong &amp; so takes a while to receive for international processing reasons, but the expected delivery date range is accurate.</li>
            <li>very nie, i&#x27;d rather something bigger tho</li>
            <li>I was also pleasantly surprised with the delivery speed.  </li>
            <li>I really thought it was going to be bigger size</li>
            <li>The blue really stands out.</li>
            <li>; gems are sturdy so far.  </li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t want to give my mother so far she loves it</li>
            <li>I looks to like an adult item to give it to kids to put into their hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my 13 year old granddaughter for her Christmas Stocking.  </li>
            <li>It could literarily match any of my clothing</li>
            <li>so won&#x27;t hold an adult ponytail.  </li>
            <li>Totally surprised at the quality when they arrived.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t fixed it yet as I&#x27;m wondering how I&#x27;m going to fix it.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Was a gift for my 8 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>I ear this barrette frequently.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these about 3 years ago, I have used it nearly every day.</li>
            <li>I have handled it with care and was surprised when it broke where it was hinged, but for the price, I did wear it for 3 years.</li>
            <li>state weather its for a kid or adult</li>
            <li>It arrive early which is a plus for me...</li>
            <li>As far as price, I&#x27;ve seen barrettes at drug stores for $10.</li>
            <li>The seller really should but something like a quarter next to it to show scale.</li>
            <li>There is no wear or discoloration so far.  </li>
            <li>Also, the product photo almost appears to show two different colors, light blue and turquoise, but the one that arrived turquoise only.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but it seems to be holding so far.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold much hair back either</li>
            <li>I really thought it was going to have two different color rhinestones in it, according to the picture.</li>
            <li>Also it does ship directly from China, the delivery time took up to a month to receive it.</li>
            <li>This one is smaller than the others, a barette, yet plenty of sparkle without taking over the whole side of your head.</li>
            <li>6 year old son wanted to give this to his &amp;#34;girlfriend&amp;#34;  in class.  </li>
            <li>and she is 6 years old.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, and gems missing.</li>
            <li>These smaller ones are nice and will make nice little gifts for the girls, but they wouldn&#x27;t be big enough to hold my long heavy hair.</li>
            <li>It looks amazing on my dark dark hair!</li>
            <li>Very small, but cute.  </li>
            <li>Not sure what broke as it clips fine.</li>
            <li>It is pretty sturdy and I can see it lasting awhile, although I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever based on the price.</li>
            <li>This BARRETTE design is pretty enough, and unlike a similar one - this one arrived with all of the stones in place.</li>
            <li>Basically, it was a little smaller than expected, but actually looked a lot less cheap than expected as well, which was great.</li>
            <li>If you like gold I would highly recommend it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>These barrettes are priced so high in stores, so when I saw this one at this low price I ordered it...</li>
            <li>It took a while to get to me but at less than $2 I won&#x27;t complain about that especially since it shipped for free from China.  </li>
            <li>I know the barrette portion won&#x27;t hold much (kind of small), especially for long hair.</li>
            <li>everyone jammed in a hot dance hall/ball</li>
            <li>Pretty, what I expected.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this item to be large enough to hold hair back.  </li>
            <li>so isn&#x27;t good for thick hair like mine to hold a lot of hair but with a little playing around</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ll admit, I DO have very thick hair, but being almost 55 years old</li>
            <li>The peacock and little jewels on it are very very pretty.  </li>
            <li>This little clip is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>I will just glue it back in, but you don&#x27;t expect a brand new item to lose stones.</li>
            <li>I recommend; an adult with thin hair could be satisfied with this peice.</li>
            <li>guess what bothers me is that the photograph of the peacock in the product description has both light blue and dark blue colored rhinestones.  </li>
            <li>This little guy is so pretty!</li>
            <li>Pretty enough to wear,but it all turquoise blue gems and brighter yellow gold color than thought.</li>
            <li>This clip is very pretty however, quite heavy too.</li>
            <li>They are more dull, flat and plastic like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is pretty, but it looks a little bit cheap compared to some of the other similar hair clips I purchased recently.</li>
            <li>I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories.</li>
            <li>it is more for a child due to the small size other than that it makes a cute little gift.</li>
            <li>The gold is pretty cheap and flashy.</li>
            <li>The body of the peacock has clear rinestones, not blue.  </li>
            <li>Really pretty for how crazy cheap this clip is!</li>
            <li>It does not hold as much hair as I expected</li>
            <li>This is the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>If you are really careful with it and not try to put to much hair into the clip it probably will not break.</li>
            <li>It holds all of my hair, but just barely.  </li>
            <li>The barrette part barely worked when I took it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>I bought a pair last month and start to use them on each side of my 8 years old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really disappointed because it is beautiful, but will have to contact seller for a return.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better and worse quality in barrettes.  </li>
            <li>Most were broken and bent and un-usable.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even able to use this, the clip was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li>This barrette is very pretty, does not look cheap or tasteless.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re about half the size of the first one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually got a little weight to it, and it&#x27;s really pretty!  </li>
            <li>The clips themselves are exactly as pictured, although smaller than I had thought (maybe 2-3 inches compared to the other she has</li>
            <li>it looks very pretty in my dark auburn long hair.........</li>
            <li>This Iteam is a small clip but very pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, very pretty.</li>
            <li>A little nervous that it&#x27;ll break, but overall it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Be prepared for a very long shipping period if you live in the US.</li>
            <li>Broke down after first use, different color, small.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>This is a pretty little peacock.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty little piece.</li>
            <li>The color of the little gems were exactly as described.</li>
            <li>&quot; wide by 1\\&quot; high.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain because I hardly paid for shipping, but I haven&#x27;t been able to make any use of it either because it just looks too cheap and cheesy.</li>
            <li>the hair clip was blue and very pretty just it was small</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty hair clip,just wish it had a different type of clip...as it too small for allot of hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty and sparkly, and small enough to be modest.</li>
            <li>Came within a decent time packaged along with some other stuff I had ordered.</li>
            <li>They do look super simple and a bit small, but I wanted myself to have the bigger piece than my bridesmaids.</li>
            <li>These are just so small it just didnt look right on me.</li>
            <li>At first i was skeptical about this peacock hair clip, but it turns out to be totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>SUPER slow shipping.</li>
            <li>I have really thin fine hair</li>
            <li>then I expected but works fine even on thick hair.</li>
            <li>The hair clip I received has one color stone used on the entire body of the peacock and one of the large stones is missing.</li>
            <li>I have bought these in several colors they really come faster that predicted and they will hold as much or as little hair as you want them too</li>
            <li>Very flimsy, soft metal, hardly closes at all.</li>
            <li>These clips are high quality, hands down.</li>

            <li> The peacock is beautiful and I often get compliments about how vibrant it is!  </li>
            <li> The clips and the barrettes that I have ordered from Bemaystar are beautiful, very well made, sturdy &amp; the prices cannot be beat.  </li>
            <li> looks like very cheap product ...</li>
            <li> Very cheap item.</li>
            <li> Metal part seems very cheap</li>
            <li> The price was very cheap though.</li>
            <li> Very light duty is required for this one.</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and my middle school age daughter loved it, for all of about 5 days after her birthday.  </li>
            <li> But still very nice and pretty.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!!!</li>
            <li> love the peacock part ...</li>
            <li> It lookks ok.</li>
            <li> Many of the stones have fallen off.</li>
            <li> I really love them &amp; would reglue the stones</li>
            <li> I just love it...</li>
            <li> So glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE WEARING THIS  HAIR CLIP.</li>
            <li> Obviously cheaply made!</li>
            <li> I really love it</li>
            <li> Perhaps with thinner hair it will hold up better.</li>
            <li> Any woman would love it.</li>
            <li> I love the shiny stones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I can find a way to make it look cute.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this hair clip.</li>
            <li> You mostly get what you pay for online.</li>
            <li> but it is cute.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> For the amount of money I paid was satisfied with the product that I received.</li>
            <li> I love wearing it.</li>
            <li> The clip holds a lot better than most</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this piece.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Look even better in person.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I ordered this initially because the price was excellent and I already had another hair clip from this brand</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would buy more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I will surely look forward to putting this hair piece on when I go out.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting three of these clips because I love the design.</li>
            <li> Such a great product!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite pieces of jewelery</li>
            <li> She love it.</li>
            <li> For the price it is okay, but not what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> It looks even better than the picture.</li>
            <li> Glad that I will not purchase from this company ever again.</li>
            <li> and i love it in my hair</li>
            <li> plus free shipping!)</li>
            <li> I got plenty of compliments &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> That said, it looks lovely and stays in my hair well.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love them.</li>
            <li> They are so cute &amp; sparkly.</li>
            <li> This is an ok hair clip I guess what do you expect for the price.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and the size.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the switch out.</li>
            <li> The stones sparkle and makes it much better.</li>
            <li> They are cute.  </li>
            <li> I would like it better if it had a silver or metal colored clip</li>
            <li> most of my jewelry is not gold colored.</li>
            <li> might order some more for gifts for others.</li>
            <li> and I just love them and shipping</li>
            <li> thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> most of us females love.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to make it into a necklace or perhaps attach a better quality clip to the peacock.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> SO cute :)</li>
            <li> and I love the color</li>
            <li> And as it turned out, her favorite Auntie (who loves Peacock&#x27;s) has one just like it.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough the package said it was a toy, that is about the best description of the piece.  </li>
            <li> Better used as a side hair clip.  </li>
            <li> it was lot better quality</li>
            <li> It looks way better in the photo than in reality.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this clip.</li>
            <li> SO I PUT IT IN MY GARDEN :)</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more if they have additional colors.  </li>
            <li> but more of a decorative accent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I simply love this clip.</li>
            <li> I love the look</li>
            <li> My group had a gift exchange and we couldn&#x27;t spend more than $5.00.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clip.</li>
            <li> After wearing it today I received so many  compliments.</li>
            <li> What more could I ask for.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks.  </li>
            <li> Took weeks to arrive to not be able to use.</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> When I got them I was incredibly pleased with their looks</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got 2.  </li>

            <li> I have gotten many compliments while wearing it.  </li>

            <li> but I am sure that she will</li>
            <li> I love to wear with my hair and have gotten a couple compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Love the color but was of no use to me.  </li>
            <li> I really love it</li>
            <li> This shiny peacock barrette is so cute.  </li>
            <li> It is a great accessory to an outfit and definitely makes you stand out in a good way.  </li>
            <li> Just needs to be secured better to the peacock.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It was a lovely piece.</li>
            <li> I would have like to have worn it more than two uses.</li>
            <li> Just wish I had gotten more</li>
            <li> Plus the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I love my vintage crystal peacock hair clip .</li>
            <li> I love the detail .</li>
            <li> My favorite color and bird.  </li>
            <li> And I love the colors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got it for my cousin for Christmas, but I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this item.  </li>
            <li> And am hoping to buy more soon.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> and these are her favorite colors.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> and it looked way better.</li>
            <li> It is adorable and the gems do not fall off.</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful hair clip!</li>
            <li> my mom is going to love it for Christmas :-)</li>
            <li> but I think it is cute.</li>
            <li> In the picture, the tail has mostly turquoise stones.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I wanted because it&#x27;s my favorite color</li>
            <li> or more.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this barret.  </li>
            <li> It is lovely and well made.</li>
            <li> but it feels sturdy and the gems look nice, not too gaudy or cheap</li>
            <li> for the sturdiness of the hinge/clip, i&#x27;m sure like the Conair clips i get from CVS, one day it will snap....</li>
            <li> In fact, I wish I had purchased more.  </li>
            <li> this is my most favorite hair clip at this time</li>
            <li> This looks similar to the piece i bought for myself, but I feel like it&#x27;s a perfect complement.</li>
            <li> was a more mono-toned greenish-blue.  </li>
            <li> I wont be buying more.</li>
            <li> Looks really cute in my grandaughters hair.</li>
            <li> Get yours for cheap!  </li>
            <li> lovely.  </li>
            <li> It is cute for the price  </li>
            <li> I wish it would have worked and lasted more than the one time I attempted to put it in my hair.</li>
            <li> but it will do, what more can you ask for for the price</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice but too cheap quality.</li>
            <li> but looks really cute and sparkly.</li>
            <li> cute , gems, and workmanship</li>

            <li> This review is mostly intended as constructive criticism for the seller.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;barrette&amp;#34; size than a hair clip.</li>
            <li> I thought the metal was more of a subdued color, even silver, but that&#x27;s not what I received.</li>
            <li> Gotten so many compliments from this piece.</li>
            <li> For sure does not look like the amount you paid for. :)</li>
            <li> I will be getting more</li>
            <li> kind cheap looking</li>
            <li> This hair clip is lovely.</li>
            <li> Beware though, like most costume jewelry sometime the beads and &amp;#34;jewels&amp;#34; come out.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with this</li>
            <li> my mom fell in love with them.</li>

            <li> It is classy and beautiful all in one.</li>
            <li> It is about an inch and a half, I love it so much, good for just some bangs up and to keep some hair out of the way, beautifully.</li>
            <li> Once I receive the product I will be able to make a more accurate review</li>
            <li> It is good quality and it was a good price overall</li>

            <li> I have fine hair and most Hair Clips</li>
            <li> I purchase for a gift, will not give till the holidays but know that she will enjoy it for sure.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m ordering more as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 9-3-13: I liked it so much I ordered 4 more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Love how it sparkles in the sun light.</li>
            <li> But the price is cheap, so that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d expect :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for the cheap price.</li>
            <li> cute and cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small clip, perfect as a nice accessory or a clip for a child.</li>
            <li> The metal is beautiful and the blue jewels are just stunning.</li>
            <li> she loved it so much</li>
            <li> the crystals shine and stand out nicely against the golden colored metal works.</li>
            <li> but I love it and its super adorable</li>
            <li> got it and love it to wear them when i go out or around the house they are very pretty and people love them also ask where i got them</li>
            <li> The crystal color is lovely but it will not be worn as much as originally planned.</li>
            <li> I say for the price its more than worth buying it!</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the quality of this cute little hair clip.</li>
            <li> I have two they are so sparkly cute and unique.</li>
            <li> much more unique.</li>
            <li> but it was easy to fix.</li>
            <li> Ok so the pin is worth the money that you pay for but it isn&#x27;t something that grand.</li>
            <li> easy fix, just bend the two prongs holding the piece that goes into your hair.</li>
            <li> does not close easily</li>
            <li> Breaks easily. .</li>
            <li> Easy on / off as well.</li>
            <li> Even tho they aren&#x27;t like the first one I liked so much that I ordered more, they&#x27;re quite nice for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought it for someone special and they absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> The bright turquoise stones are super sparkly and pretty.</li>
            <li> This was beautiful, the price was unbelievably low and it came very, very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty and at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> really cute, holds well, beautiful color, a nice small size.</li>
            <li> it has a beautiful shade of blue</li>
            <li> Crystals are very pretty and clear, and beautiful color, set neatly.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I thought it would be beautiful in her blonde hair</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful piece of hair jewelry, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily repairable but you won&#x27;t be able to use it to do more than just look pretty.</li>
            <li> I wore it out and about all day and evening yesterday and it held just fine.</li>
            <li> and i can easily pull it off as a genuine vintage hair clip</li>
            <li> Not too impressed with the slightly padded envelope it arrived in.  </li>
            <li> but it seems to work just fine.  </li>
            <li> The stones in this are fine.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine, I can work with it.</li>
            <li> Transaction went fine and the item came on time.</li>
            <li> all in all a fine product</li>
            <li> Does not work for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to receive this hair pin in a good condition (like the picture shows).</li>
            <li> This clip is very pretty but the clasp is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> This shipped super fast, and is so gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> It is fine, but cheap looking.</li>
            <li> The one that wasn&#x27;t broke was very pretty!</li>
            <li> The little peacock was perfect.</li>
            <li> Appreciate it very much!!</li>
            <li> This is very pretty!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect little accessory .</li>
            <li> Very pretty!</li>
            <li> Anyhow, they&#x27;re great little clips and will add a nice touch to a bun.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just great and made a nice little gift.</li>
            <li> Products sold on the internet should have an accurate picture.  </li>
            <li> I will still use it......and would have still purchased it with an accurate measurement given.  </li>
            <li> I would not have bought it if an accurate label for the product had been used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it made her Happy until the 3rd time she put it in her hair and it broke.she called me at work upset and said it broke.so i sent a email to the seller and still no reply e-mail</li>
            <li> Based on the price it was a great deal, not made to last though.</li>
            <li> AT A FANTASTIC PRICE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically plastic and cheap metal, and wouldn&#x27;t clasp.</li>
            <li> Still, 99-cents and free shipping?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to fix the cheaply made clasp but it won&#x27;t close.</li>
            <li> Cheap sprayed on gold that peels off</li>
            <li> it fits perfect on the side of a messy bun.</li>
            <li> but they are cheap, aren&#x27;t they?</li>
            <li> The stones look cheap close up.</li>
            <li> the price was great overall</li>
            <li> but it was just so cheap.</li>
            <li> It looks cheap and it feels too chunky.  </li>
            <li> since it is having free shipping.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the clip that is intended to hold the piece in your hair is horrendously cheap.  </li>
            <li> I had ordered it when it was .87 cents with free shipping, and I thought, what&#x27;s to lose.</li>
            <li> The gems are a bright turquoise (much brighter than in the picture) and the metal is a bright yellow gold color.</li>
            <li> I will enjoy wearing it.  </li>
            <li> Cheap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and made in metal.</li>
            <li> The price was cheap but the clip doesn&#x27;t look cheap.  </li>
            <li> at all and definitely cheap looking -</li>
            <li> comfortably on ones head.</li>
            <li> This is cheap: in price and in quality.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and doesn&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li> It looks great in my hair and actually stays in place.</li>
            <li> May even remove the barrette and secure it to an alligator clip.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I had to buy another one.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect gems since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> Was cheap but, does not look it.</li>
            <li> Was so cheap that she wouldn&#x27;t wear it.  </li>
            <li> The price was too cheap</li>
            <li> and looks cheap.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li> i ordered several, i have already worn mine to great compliments and gave one as a gift.</li>
            <li> Beautiful,but stones aren&#x27;t secure.</li>
            <li> I have very only hair, and this clip is great for a side swept look.  </li>
            <li> I am sure I will get my moneys worth out of it</li>
            <li> So if you want a barrette, this is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I think the recipient will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This was $0.65 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> thank goodness it was cheap.</li>
            <li> they hold securely in your hair</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s really cheap in all</li>
            <li> the stones are bright and clear.  </li>
            <li> Colors are great and will go with several outfits.</li>
            <li> Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li> Looks beyond cheap, couldn&#x27;t even wear it.</li>
            <li> good for 4 year old...</li>
            <li> Which is good because I&#x27;m getting too old to have anything huge in my hair .</li>
            <li> They look good and so far no problems on the stones or the snap parts.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is adorable and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> That said, the price was right and I have had many compliments on the hairclip.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is so pretty!!</li>
            <li> I love peacock design jewelry, and this hair clip is beautiful, so much so that I bought a second one.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely beautiful, I received it in good enough time, there wasn&#x27;t a need for a rush, it&#x27;s a wee bit smaller than I had hoped it would be,  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most sturdy accessory (you&#x27;re paying less than a dollar for it!), but it&#x27;s really pretty and looks awesome in my hair.</li>
            <li> this clip broke right away very cheap its a cute clip just wish it wouldn&#x27;t have broke so fast</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so feminine and unique.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> was a lot faster then originally stated by a month.</li>
            <li> but I received a pink one instead - while it is beautiful and the color I probably should have ordered for my skin tone it..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a fun hair clip to wear for the heck of it!</li>
            <li> the the original picture of it.</li>
            <li> These will make such a nice gift!</li>
            <li> She got rather excited about this hair clip when we received it.  </li>
            <li> it is very pretty and such a great deal.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a dollar!</li>
            <li> Thanks for everything!  :)</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful little Barrette and since I have fine hair it would have worked fine.  </li>
            <li> Love this hair clips because is the perfect size, not too big and not too small, the color is nice and the price is great, they are very expensive everywhere, so it&#x27;s a great saver and looks really cute on the hair...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected but its nice to Indiany for my taste but its nice because color wasn&#x27;t what was on the site</li>
            <li> bought it as a gift for someone who has a lot of hair and worried she wouldn&#x27;t be able to fit much in it</li>
            <li> Clip doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of hair, but it was cheap, and cute, so I can&#x27;t really complain here.</li>
            <li> Found these super cheap for someone that loves peacocks.  </li>
            <li> was super cheap, so I rolled the dice.  </li>
            <li> These pieces are nice, amazingly low in pricing and make lovely gifts.</li>
            <li> super pretty...not cheap looking at all.  </li>
            <li> So for the price I would have been happy eve if it was a one time wear, but I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth out of this one</li>
            <li> it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services</li>
            <li> Colors not exactly as pictures, but still beautiful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and hold her hair pretty well, better then most of the ones she has bought from stores, they delivered it within the time given.</li>
            <li> Very sparkly and a lovely blue and rose gold color!  </li>
            <li> I dont think I will wait til I have something special to wear it to</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn it yet because I am waiting for a special occasion</li>
            <li> It broke right when I took it out of the package!</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive, had free shipping, is pretty, and will be worn!  </li>
            <li> I still love it, they look realistic, not like cheap plastic you may see in the stores sometimes.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive it so quickly.</li>
            <li> The item I received was bright brass and only teal</li>
            <li> as do all hair clips under $10 but for the price and the fun, pretty design, and how well it matches my dress :) can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> I really thought I was going to be able to wear this too the wedding, but I guess not.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fair enough to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought two because one will not hold up much hair.</li>
            <li> I got the full refund.</li>
            <li> It was a barrette which is good and the coloring is obviously different then the picture</li>
            <li> while it wasn&#x27;t expensive,it also wasn&#x27;t worth ordering.it&#x27;s just too cheaply made</li>
            <li> I love these hair clips soo much, I bought two of these and use them all of the time.  </li>
            <li> Good enough quality for the price.</li>
            <li> not a silver 1 with blue but its all good</li>
            <li> It really took over a month to receive, but now that I have the three items I am satisfied withmy purcahse.</li>
            <li> Good for just maybe a side pull up of hair or for someone younger.</li>
            <li> Good quality ESPECIALLY for the price.</li>
            <li> Of course it is not 100% as neat as the picture but for the price, not bad.</li>
            <li> not bad for price</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a very special young woman on a very special occasion...</li>
            <li> Peacock hair clip is bright blue and very pretty.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit dissatisfied with how easily it broke the first time I put it in.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty barrette with a strong clasp.  </li>
            <li> This is very pretty, but in real life you see a lot more of the gold setting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute little thing, and I think it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and took a shot at this because I&#x27;ve been lucky on this type of cheapy jewelry here on Amazon before.</li>
            <li> Was delivered quickly and unharmed.</li>
            <li> Ddliverh is quick.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> much smaller than I thought the jewelry was nice the clip for the hair was cheap again</li>
            <li> This is a decent quality barrette with a perfectly lovely peacock on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely more yellow gold than the picture shows, but I&#x27;m still glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Cute, but doesn&#x27;t really sit well or look right in my hair.</li>
            <li> this is a beautiful clip, although cheap, it seems to be pretty sturdy, but is a little troublesome to close</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than I thought it would be, but I&#x27;m still able to get great use out of it!</li>
            <li> Clip is SUPER cheap and broke within the first hour of wearing it.  </li>
            <li> quality at a high level, this seller quickly sent the goods, the idea is very original position</li>
            <li> These are very pretty.</li>
            <li> But its very pretty</li>
            <li> Very pretty though.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> but if you do wear gold it is very pretty.</li>
            <li> ITS LIGHT AND PRETTY.</li>
            <li> Very pretty accent for your hair</li>
            <li> this hair clip is very pretty but does not stay in my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but it is one of those snap/clasp closures.  </li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty clip.</li>
            <li> This was actually very pretty</li>
            <li> The peacock itself with all the stones is very pretty.</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li> The picture looks pretty but the time itself looks cheap.  </li>
            <li> This is not vintage, though it is very pretty and made to look vintage.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> but very pretty</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> but it is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pretty hair clip</li>
            <li> very cute addition to any outfit, especially in darker colored hair.</li>
            <li> its very pretty.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty in person.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but heavy.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size, not too large, not too small.  </li>
            <li> But I really wanted 4 more like the first one.</li>
            <li> very sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li> It is not huge - it is dainty and pretty.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT VERY MUCH AND WILL SURELY ORDER MORE IN THE FUTURE.  </li>
            <li> However, it broke the first time I wore it!</li>
            <li> These are SO pretty!  </li>
            <li> Pretty clip!  </li>
            <li> This is really pretty!</li>
            <li> Pretty!</li>
            <li> Very pretty hairclip well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty just sitting on my bureau!</li>
            <li> Pretty!</li>
            <li> Bright and blingy and  just the right color for a grey headed do.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable quick delivery for a beautiful piece of ornamental jewelry.</li>
            <li> This is so pretty and unique, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Too pretty and will be lovely on my new scarf!</li>
            <li> and really you wouldn&#x27;t want them to be huge if it&#x27;s something to wear in your hair.</li>
            <li> Cannot fit much hair in the barrette.  </li>
            <li> It is sparkly and shine (not too much to be indecent) and  doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and thought the blue would look great in my red hair, but instead I got the light pastel barrette.</li>
            <li> I bought a colorful one of these for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so well that I bought this blue one for myself.</li>
            <li> In my order I actually received two of this clip which I wasn&#x27;t expecting, so that was nice.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice smaller hair clip that I bought to enhance updo styles it works well</li>
            <li> its worth....</li>
            <li> It is worth the dollar I paid for it.</li>
            <li> and I was totally surprised at how cute it is.  </li>
            <li> I liked these clips but only a couple of stones came off.</li>
            <li> so it was worth the purchase</li>
            <li> The peacock is smaller than I expected, but still very beautiful.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for the lovely barrette.</li>
            <li> I bought this for young child and it surely would not work.  </li>
            <li> Such a nice hair accessory.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful barrette but too small to hold a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price on this, have passed up very similar items in stores for 10 time more $$</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get my $1 worth</li>
            <li> :) So far I have used it a couple of times and have not had any issues with it opening and falling out.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant &amp; easy to take off without ruining your hairdo.</li>
            <li> I was not handling it in a rough fashion, I was taking good care of it and hadn&#x27;t worn it as soon as I had gotten it.</li>
            <li> Colorful piece.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s def worth waiting for.</li>
            <li> so I put in a glass vase and it looks nice enough.</li>
            <li> I truly have gotten my monies worth</li>
            <li> This is not very heavy, great quality nor very big.</li>
            <li> Super pretty.</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> but if you need it right away or if you are buying it as a gift you will need to order it waaay in advance.  </li>
            <li> I notified this seller and they said they would send one right out.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s right, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Right size for her size.</li>
            <li> Then of course the price is right.</li>
            <li> So if you need this right away don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> right just a warning</li>
            <li> Just the right size, Stays on well .</li>
            <li> however it doesn&#x27;t clip right.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice piece with great color and you can&#x27;t beat the price, however not sellers fault it is a little small for my taste.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these 4 as gifts for 10 year old girls, expecting to get 4 more like the first one.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is a beautiful piece, the only thing that I would change about it is that it needs to have a bigger clip.</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait for an occasion to wear this beautiful piece in my hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a very large sturdy clip.</li>
            <li> FOR MY hair look SPECTACULAR IN ANY MODERN AND SOCIAL EVENT ..</li>
            <li> Bought for my young daughter because it was super cheap.  </li>
            <li> but it is beautiful enough that I ordered a second one just like the first.  </li>
            <li> Not as pretty as the pic, but still worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth the gamble though it was pretty</li>
            <li> metal is such a bright cheap yellow color.</li>
            <li> This clip would work wonderful on a child and be absolutely adorable, or if you have thin hair it could possibly work for you as well.</li>
            <li> Cute, flashy in a elegant way, and stays in hair quite nicely.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty piece, it just does not stay in my hair very well, worth the price tho.</li>
            <li> The original picture showed an alligator style clip, which is much easier to use, and 2: The clip broke the first time I opened it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a very pretty blue peacock hair clip and love it.</li>
            <li> Some said that it&#x27;s more appropriate for little girls or dress up.  </li>
            <li> You only get one, but it sure is pretty!</li>
            <li> this is so pretty and just the right size for a childs head or an adults head...</li>
            <li> It is so pretty  and just the right size.</li>
            <li> Appropriate for a child, not so much for an adult.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok enough, but I couldn&#x27;t use it and it didn&#x27;t seem worth trying to return.</li>
            <li> then my order is complete thanks again....:)</li>
            <li> The clip mechanism is of good quality &amp; the overall quality is more than I expected for the price...certainly better than anything I have found in local stores &amp;</li>
            <li> I really like this hair clip, it is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but it looks great and has a very secure hold.</li>
            <li> the weight for me is just right, it&#x27;s not heavy or light to put on your head.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> If anyone where to purchase this I think it would be good for a little girl.</li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars because it really is pretty and it was so very, very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very elegant and the price was great, so one can afford to get a few different colours to match different things.</li>
            <li> This is so pretty</li>
            <li> Pretty piece.</li>
            <li> It is pretty</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The color is so pretty.  </li>
            <li> It is so pretty.</li>
            <li> Women at work are always commenting on how pretty it is.</li>
            <li> At this unbelievably low price (one dollar, free shipping!)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re still pretty for 89 cents.</li>

            <li> This is so pretty.  </li>
            <li> Pretty</li>
            <li> I only wish it held more hair, and I don&#x27;t have a lot like I did as a teenager, but it won&#x27;t hold all my hair, so I put it in a ponytail holder first.</li>
            <li> pretty Got as gift for someone.</li>
            <li> The clip was smaller than I imagined so all in all this was an ok purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a decoration only.</li>
            <li> many compliments; bought extra for gifts.</li>

            <li> Broke on the first day.</li>
            <li> This is just as pretty in person as on the picture.</li>
            <li> This clip is so pretty.  </li>
            <li> This pretty peacock barrette fell apart the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Will go with many different types of clothing.</li>
            <li> The product was pretty but the hair clip part of it was flimsy.  </li>
            <li> so I thought it would be pretty for her.</li>
            <li> I definitely order again if I need more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty but the clip was a spring/release clip that never worked.  </li>
            <li> This barrett is so pretty.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t have your heart set on it matching the picture exactly</li>
            <li> I could solder it back on myself, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get lots of use out of it.</li>
            <li> It is  a perfect size, not too small and not too big.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty, but there is no grip in the claps</li>
            <li> but mine was pretty close</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s such a lovely hair clip that before I could even wear it once my mother took it and decided I have given it to her.</li>
            <li> , I DO know how much hair to put into a clip (I didn&#x27;t overload the clip with hair), and it literally broke before I had even finished with my hair!</li>
            <li> Definitely a must-have :)</li>
            <li> Great for ladies with thick hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in -law just got married &amp; I bought these for all the bridesmaides &amp; flower girls to wear in the wedding.</li>
            <li> It is sparkly and pretty</li>
            <li> This is a pretty hair barrette.  </li>
            <li> but it was pretty as the picture show.</li>
            <li> I have wore this clip in the front and back of my hair, and people love it.</li>
            <li> It is really pretty.</li>
            <li> It broke the first time I tried to clip it into my hair.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it would work better on short hair or for a child.</li>
            <li> Thank you, I received my item and it as pretty</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty hair barrette, both my daughter and I will wear it.  </li>
            <li> The barrette looks as pretty as the photo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, it holds well and its is a pretty color.</li>
            <li> but it is pretty.</li>
            <li> Mine came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> It broke the first time I tried to wear it...</li>
            <li> First, if you&#x27;ve been browsing hair pieces from this vendor, note that this is not a clip, but rather a barette.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it because it is shiny and pretty</li>
            <li> Pretty hair bow.</li>
            <li> really pretty.</li>
            <li> I am thinking of buying a third brooch because these are so stylish and bedazzled.</li>
            <li> It is pretty.</li>
            <li> This clip is pretty, but it didn&#x27;t come in silver, it was gold tone.</li>
            <li> Still gonna wear it in my wedding but wish it looked exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> It was pretty though.</li>
            <li> Will be looking for a couple more in different colors.</li>
            <li> The first day I wore it, a couple hours of school, I had problems getting it to stay it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sparkly and pretty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get some more of these form the same shipper.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty, It is better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> a positive note, the shipping was extremely quick and considering the item is a dollar we really don&#x27;t have much to complain about.  </li>
            <li> Something flat for decoration in the hair would be better.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I liked it.</li>
            <li> I am good at fixing things, soldering, and everything, but this is a very delicate piece of cheap material.</li>
            <li> One of the stones was loose when I received it, but it glued right in :)</li>
            <li> It was brand new and it cam quick so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> It is really a good purchase for such a low price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My ten year old daughter (this was specifically for her) liked the coloring regardless.  </li>
            <li> It looked pretty nice in my dark hair, buuuuutttttt...</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t worth getting though, because this is a seriously good deal on it.</li>
            <li> Nice design at good price, but a little too heavy as it&#x27;s made of molded alloy</li>
            <li> It came all in one piece, no loose crystals, with the barrette mechanism working fine.</li>
            <li> Lots of positive comments.</li>
            <li> perfect size barrette for a half up-half down hair style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price, but not good quality.</li>
            <li> but I really really like the first one.</li>
            <li> Its  very small and the stones are set cheaply ,but the color is nice .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty much holds my hair in tack.</li>
            <li> i still think its pretty and mine has not broken</li>
            <li> This lovely hair clip is about 2.5 inches long and looks just like the picture.  </li>
            <li> Very sparkly and pretty.  </li>
            <li> I suppose as long as you&#x27;re not abusing the barrette, it will fit you well!</li>
            <li> It is small, but a good hair clip.</li>
            <li> It does have good qualities just really small.</li>
            <li> If you want a small barette this is good for you</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S BEAUTIFUL AND BROKEN....</li>
            <li> not as large as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Its almost a rose gold color the stones are light are dark blue.</li>
            <li> It is not really appropriate for much more than costume, dress-up pretend or 6 year old gifting :)  </li>
            <li> Its a bit smaller than I thought but still very pretty and useful.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for someone with fine short hair.  </li>
            <li> Smaller is fine.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty, the fastener appears stable, and decently made.</li>
            <li> Nice little hair clip</li>
            <li> Quality seem s a little on the cheap side, but, then again it was cheap</li>
            <li> Picture is fairly accurate to the actual product, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> Please post an accurate picture next time.</li>
            <li> Very smaall tho.</li>
            <li> I know the item did not cost much.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> and I realized I didn&#x27;t read the whole thing or details.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much.</li>
            <li> Much prettier in the picture.</li>
            <li> The clip doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair very well though.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> but again it is VERY inexpensive</li>
            <li> Additionally, it is very flimsy and the clip keeps popping out.</li>
            <li> Because it is very cheap,so i decide to discard it not return it.</li>
            <li> We really enjoy the extra touch they add to our hair.</li>
            <li> Really I sent them the messages from my Amazon account.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t stand up to much damage.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> If it wasnt so cheap I would have sent it back..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not meant to really hold hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for this clip.</li>
            <li> I really really like it.  </li>
            <li> and it really stays in place.</li>
            <li> The stones are really shiny.</li>
            <li> Much Prettier than the photograph.</li>
            <li> Be ready to wait a while for shipping</li>
            <li> so much I gave it to my granddaughter and I am going to get me another one.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it very often</li>
            <li> but when I do this hair clip stands out and people notice it and tell me how much they like it in my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> Very eye-catching.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really sturdy to keep my hair up</li>
            <li> Much blunt.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold much hair, but it&#x27;s not meant to.  </li>
            <li> The picture is much nicer than the product.</li>
            <li> .it would make it much easier  thanks</li>
            <li> They are also much cheaper on Ebay.</li>
            <li> The design is very elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> VERY CHEEP</li>
            <li> AND IT BROKE SO FAST</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really a matter of taste.  </li>
            <li> very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> Sort of wish I had purxhased two, as I have very thixk hair.</li>
            <li> Really you should just save your couple bucks</li>
            <li> I have very think curly hair that is almost to my waist</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> so much it really stands out</li>
            <li> All stones are in-tact &amp; very shiny and the clip is not broken.</li>
            <li> Really looked nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> I really shouldn&#x27;t complain for what I paid for this.  </li>
            <li> I thought that this was adorable - but it arrived and was not at ALL what I expected...</li>
            <li> It was such a cheap product, I probably won&#x27;t take the time to return it, but I would not recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I really like it just wish it worked.</li>
            <li> I dont wear it that much</li>
            <li> Made very well.</li>
            <li> Very pretty-pretty fast shipping.</li>
            <li> very flimsy and fell apart in 2 days.</li>
            <li> goldtone is very brassy</li>
            <li> The pricing is extemely reasonable.</li>
            <li> Seems very durable.</li>
            <li> While the real thing does look &#x27;cheaper&#x27; than the photo presented, for the price</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a spring barrette, which I like because it really helps keep it in her hair.</li>
            <li> It was just as it appears on the website &amp; is even prettier in real life.</li>
            <li> So cute and classy and simple to dress up any outfit!</li>
            <li> I liked the look of it because of the different color blue that is on the picture</li>
            <li> It is just as described, and the crystals are nice and sparkly, in two different shades of blue.</li>
            <li> A cute little bit of kitch in the right circumstances.</li>
            <li> Not a good product looks cheap and very light weight.</li>
            <li> Although it was late, it is very cute and it certainly does not look like it cost $.99.</li>
            <li> This is small but cute!</li>
            <li> This hair clip is small but so cute!</li>
            <li> My hair is not really thick and still couldn&#x27;t get the clasp to stay closed to be able to wear it.</li>
            <li> This is pretty, the plating isn&#x27;t quite as bright cheap yellow as the blue or the pink ones, and done a bit more delicately than either of those two.</li>
            <li> as long as you don&#x27;t need it right away, it was totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> lolol as expected for such a low price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about 3 inches long, if that, and secure well with</li>
            <li> and if I want to wear it, I have to use other pins and barrettes first to secure my hair</li>
            <li> Also, the woman suggesting that this item is better sized for a child must wear enormous clips because I found the size to be completely acceptable for my adult woman self.</li>
            <li> the pin is quite nice but rather small.</li>
            <li> My hair is short, thick, and curly and this looks very cute on my hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but it doesn&#x27;t look as good as the picture, and the clip is bad.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a larger piece so that I could wear it above a bun or as a more decorative piece in my hair.</li>
            <li> love it, its tiny and simple and well made!</li>
            <li> The colir is vibrant and the stones are sparkly.</li>
            <li> Looks decent otherwise.</li>
            <li> For what I paid, I will be okay gluing it back on, or changing out the back to a pin.</li>
            <li> so I added it to the above Peacocks on my white mantle to add more sparkle in my Peacock theme.  </li>
            <li> Also, the clasp where you open it is kind of jammed.</li>
            <li> I had to bend it to get it to function even halfway decently.</li>
            <li> If you are older than preteen, you may not be so overwhelmed.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty if it had a clip on the back.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty but not as big as I thought.  </li>
            <li> very pretty but low quality clip.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty blue color.</li>
            <li> So highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Pretty little barrette and received it quickly!  </li>
            <li> Personally I didnt like the back part of the clip, but my mom said it holds on better than the new clips.</li>
            <li> I wish the material quality to be little better...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t dare tell them how little I paid for it :)</li>
            <li> I can add just a little something and get so many complements.</li>
            <li> Cute little thing.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely little touch to any hairdo.</li>
            <li> This is definately a cute little barrette.</li>
            <li> A little more copper than gold.</li>
            <li> This little clip is adorable.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer than expected for shipping, but the product itself is nice and worth waiting for.</li>
            <li> It was not really my style, the gold is too shiny and adds a cheap feel.</li>
            <li> And not thick hair either.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely order more in the near future.</li>
            <li> If you have your heart set on what is in the picture, you&#x27;ll probably be disappointed, but in my opinion the final product is much more beautiful.</li>
            <li> They are intended as accents to side of French Roll or to pull top layers, long bangs, etc to one side.</li>
            <li> The only reason why this got 4 stars was because it was such a pain trying to snap the barett in my hair and taking it out hurt my fingers but overall nice product.</li>
            <li> At least I can save the stones for my own art work.</li>
            <li> She has a full head of thick, medium-length, wavy hair &amp; the clip holds securely without snarling in the peacock tail (even if she affixes it herself).</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin, silver hair and it rarely falls out.</li>
            <li> The first barrette that I liked so much and reviewed above is 3 3/4 inches long, has very pretty turquoise, lavender and \\&quot;diamond\\&quot; stones, with a black stone for the eye, and is actually prettier than shown in the  picture.</li>
            <li> But when I went to put it in my hair, back clip came right off.  </li>
            <li> I got it in the mail earlier than I expected which is not a bad thing, and it looks exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a quality product for very little money, but it&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
            <li> daughter, the lucky recipient, was thrilled and has worn it pretty much daily without any ill effects to the barrette clip part or the sparkles.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> new.  </li>
            <li> But other than that pretty little hair bow nice and</li>
            <li> Considering that this was only a buck, I really didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li> It is about 3 inches long and very sparkly with all those pretty gems stones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a pretty clip and looks fantastic in my hair though you should be warned, it is quite small.</li>
            <li> The one we received has only light blue rhinestones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks so much cant wait to get the last one i order</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much smaller than I expected, but I&#x27;m still pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The jewels are very clear with a well done body and tail.</li>
            <li> I was very much looking forward to the different tones in this clip.</li>
            <li> Very very mature looking.  </li>
            <li> Very classy.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> Plus, it came 2 weeks early!</li>
            <li> For the low price I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be as pretty as it is.</li>
            <li> The teal stones just aren&#x27;t as pretty as a solid.</li>
            <li> The detail to this hair clip is so pretty and is made well the only thing is I wouldn&#x27;t call this a womens</li>
            <li> It is cute but too small.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, she was thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too big, it&#x27;s a bit smaller than I thought, which will actually make it more versatile and functional than you may be led to believe by the picture.</li>
            <li> ABOUT TWO INCHES SMALL BUT EXTEMLY CUTE</li>
            <li> The price is simply a steal,you could not find such a unique barrette in the store for this price.....</li>
            <li> Really pretty for a very low price.</li>
            <li> The peacock broke off the barrette part the first time I tried to open it.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty piece ..</li>
            <li> They just take a long time to deliver, but are worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty in my red hair.  </li>
            <li> bought several, some stones fell out the first day worn.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the picture, except that the aqua blue stones are brighter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The metal of the clip looks a bit fragile, but so far so good, nothing can be complained of</li>
            <li> how nice it is shipping is a little long (overseas)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is much cheaper than excepted for such high quality.</li>
            <li> The colors are a little bit different and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> It was less than $1 and had free shipping</li>
            <li> Was large enough for an adult,but not same color or as pretty as the picture.</li>
            <li> I am not surprised at the quality due to very cheap price.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ve too fine and little hair for the pin to hold.  </li>
            <li> it was a little too small, but very nice.</li>
            <li> I think the design itself isn&#x27;t too bad, was hoping it would be a little more eye catching,  but its not bad.</li>
            <li> It is too small to pin anything back really, it should be using with a rubber band or larger clip to do any kind of styling.</li>
            <li> very pretty starts to tarnish only wear a couple times if you wanted to look the same</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this purchase, it&#x27;s beautiful but the barrette part was super cheap and delicate, broke before even arriving.</li>
            <li> It is  a little cheap...</li>
            <li> but a little cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> This clip is super cute, and in previous reviews I read that the clip was small</li>
            <li> It is shipped from Hong Kong &amp; so takes a while to receive for international processing reasons, but the expected delivery date range is accurate.</li>
            <li> very nie, i&#x27;d rather something bigger tho</li>
            <li> I was also pleasantly surprised with the delivery speed.  </li>
            <li> I really thought it was going to be bigger size</li>
            <li> The blue really stands out.</li>
            <li> ; gems are sturdy so far.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t want to give my mother so far she loves it</li>
            <li> I looks to like an adult item to give it to kids to put into their hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my 13 year old granddaughter for her Christmas Stocking.  </li>
            <li> It could literarily match any of my clothing</li>
            <li> so won&#x27;t hold an adult ponytail.  </li>
            <li> Totally surprised at the quality when they arrived.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t fixed it yet as I&#x27;m wondering how I&#x27;m going to fix it.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my 8 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> I ear this barrette frequently.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these about 3 years ago, I have used it nearly every day.</li>
            <li> I have handled it with care and was surprised when it broke where it was hinged, but for the price, I did wear it for 3 years.</li>
            <li> state weather its for a kid or adult</li>
            <li> It arrive early which is a plus for me...</li>
            <li> As far as price, I&#x27;ve seen barrettes at drug stores for $10.</li>
            <li> The seller really should but something like a quarter next to it to show scale.</li>
            <li> There is no wear or discoloration so far.  </li>
            <li> Also, the product photo almost appears to show two different colors, light blue and turquoise, but the one that arrived turquoise only.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but it seems to be holding so far.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold much hair back either</li>
            <li> I really thought it was going to have two different color rhinestones in it, according to the picture.</li>
            <li> Also it does ship directly from China, the delivery time took up to a month to receive it.</li>
            <li> This one is smaller than the others, a barette, yet plenty of sparkle without taking over the whole side of your head.</li>
            <li> 6 year old son wanted to give this to his &amp;#34;girlfriend&amp;#34;  in class.  </li>
            <li> and she is 6 years old.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, and gems missing.</li>
            <li> These smaller ones are nice and will make nice little gifts for the girls, but they wouldn&#x27;t be big enough to hold my long heavy hair.</li>
            <li> It looks amazing on my dark dark hair!</li>
            <li> Very small, but cute.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what broke as it clips fine.</li>
            <li> It is pretty sturdy and I can see it lasting awhile, although I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever based on the price.</li>
            <li> This BARRETTE design is pretty enough, and unlike a similar one - this one arrived with all of the stones in place.</li>
            <li> Basically, it was a little smaller than expected, but actually looked a lot less cheap than expected as well, which was great.</li>
            <li> If you like gold I would highly recommend it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> These barrettes are priced so high in stores, so when I saw this one at this low price I ordered it...</li>
            <li> It took a while to get to me but at less than $2 I won&#x27;t complain about that especially since it shipped for free from China.  </li>
            <li> I know the barrette portion won&#x27;t hold much (kind of small), especially for long hair.</li>
            <li> everyone jammed in a hot dance hall/ball</li>
            <li> Pretty, what I expected.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this item to be large enough to hold hair back.  </li>
            <li> so isn&#x27;t good for thick hair like mine to hold a lot of hair but with a little playing around</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll admit, I DO have very thick hair, but being almost 55 years old</li>
            <li> The peacock and little jewels on it are very very pretty.  </li>
            <li> This little clip is very pretty.  </li>
            <li> I will just glue it back in, but you don&#x27;t expect a brand new item to lose stones.</li>
            <li> I recommend; an adult with thin hair could be satisfied with this peice.</li>
            <li> guess what bothers me is that the photograph of the peacock in the product description has both light blue and dark blue colored rhinestones.  </li>
            <li> This little guy is so pretty!</li>
            <li> Pretty enough to wear,but it all turquoise blue gems and brighter yellow gold color than thought.</li>
            <li> This clip is very pretty however, quite heavy too.</li>
            <li> They are more dull, flat and plastic like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is pretty, but it looks a little bit cheap compared to some of the other similar hair clips I purchased recently.</li>
            <li> I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories.</li>
            <li> it is more for a child due to the small size other than that it makes a cute little gift.</li>
            <li> The gold is pretty cheap and flashy.</li>
            <li> The body of the peacock has clear rinestones, not blue.  </li>
            <li> Really pretty for how crazy cheap this clip is!</li>
            <li> It does not hold as much hair as I expected</li>
            <li> This is the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> If you are really careful with it and not try to put to much hair into the clip it probably will not break.</li>
            <li> It holds all of my hair, but just barely.  </li>
            <li> The barrette part barely worked when I took it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> I bought a pair last month and start to use them on each side of my 8 years old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed because it is beautiful, but will have to contact seller for a return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen better and worse quality in barrettes.  </li>
            <li> Most were broken and bent and un-usable.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even able to use this, the clip was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> This barrette is very pretty, does not look cheap or tasteless.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re about half the size of the first one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually got a little weight to it, and it&#x27;s really pretty!  </li>
            <li> The clips themselves are exactly as pictured, although smaller than I had thought (maybe 2-3 inches compared to the other she has</li>
            <li> it looks very pretty in my dark auburn long hair.........</li>
            <li> This Iteam is a small clip but very pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, very pretty.</li>
            <li> A little nervous that it&#x27;ll break, but overall it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Be prepared for a very long shipping period if you live in the US.</li>
            <li> Broke down after first use, different color, small.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> This is a pretty little peacock.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty little piece.</li>
            <li> The color of the little gems were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> &quot; wide by 1\\&quot; high.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain because I hardly paid for shipping, but I haven&#x27;t been able to make any use of it either because it just looks too cheap and cheesy.</li>
            <li> the hair clip was blue and very pretty just it was small</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty hair clip,just wish it had a different type of clip...as it too small for allot of hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty and sparkly, and small enough to be modest.</li>
            <li> Came within a decent time packaged along with some other stuff I had ordered.</li>
            <li> They do look super simple and a bit small, but I wanted myself to have the bigger piece than my bridesmaids.</li>
            <li> These are just so small it just didnt look right on me.</li>
            <li> At first i was skeptical about this peacock hair clip, but it turns out to be totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> SUPER slow shipping.</li>
            <li> I have really thin fine hair</li>
            <li> then I expected but works fine even on thick hair.</li>
            <li> The hair clip I received has one color stone used on the entire body of the peacock and one of the large stones is missing.</li>
            <li> I have bought these in several colors they really come faster that predicted and they will hold as much or as little hair as you want them too</li>
            <li> Very flimsy, soft metal, hardly closes at all.</li>
            <li> These clips are high quality, hands down.</li>
            <li> The tail has large sky blue rinestones with small teal ones.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last for me, the outside is plastic, but the clip itself is metal, so only time can show it.</li>
            <li> I am adding on to my original review since sadly after wearing this pretty hair clip a few times</li>
            <li> It is delicate, yet very showy!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it would be, about two inches long.</li>
            <li> I am hoping it last a long while.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in that, but the quality is good, and you just can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> It actually arrived quicker than some other - local - items I bought at the same time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doing a fantastic job at keeping my wild and crazy hair out of my face while still looking snazzy.</li>
            <li> Crazy glued it back on (along with some others for safe keeping) and...</li>
            <li> The only thing is that I expected it to be bigger.</li>
            <li> It is much smaller than I expected, and is not even the same color as what is shown.  </li>
            <li> It still goes in your hair, and if you&#x27;re confused a quick internet search will show/</li>
            <li> Very pretty clip, but arrived broken.</li>
            <li> The barrette is small (2.5 - 3 inches long), more like for little girls and pale.</li>
            <li> but it was not exactly what I expected it was a little smaller than I thought and very gold.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of this piece but disappointed in the size.</li>
            <li> ITS A CHEAP PRICE WITH AN EXPENSIVE LOOK ABOUT IT.  </li>
            <li> This is small enough for my 6yr old to wear in her hair.</li>
            <li> In the merchant picture the stones are shown as quite multi-colored; a turquoise blue and a dark blue.</li>
            <li> Its smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li> Broke not too long after I got it.</li>
            <li> I will say that it is much smaller than I expected...</li>
            <li> It is a bit different than i expected but It will work.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get to me</li>
            <li> It is much smaller than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> This barrette is actually larger than I had expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> It is also took a long time to arrive.  </li>
            <li> It did take a long time to arrive and is not the highest quality metal</li>
            <li> I had to do some minor repairs to the clip</li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> Note that the size of the barrette limits the amount of hair it will hold; it is not meant to sweep long hair up in one barrette at the crown or nape of your neck.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend with long hair.</li>
            <li> Took too long to arrive (I&#x27;d forgotten I&#x27;d ordered it)</li>
            <li> The only thing that I would have prefered was that the metal was silver-toned rather than gold-toned, but its minimal in the preference department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not surprised.</li>
            <li> I do have long hair and pin it up before I put the clip on.</li>
            <li> If I had seen the pink and the blue ones in person before ordering I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered those ones.</li>
            <li> So long I&#x27;d forgotten about the clip till it came.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not surprised.</li>
            <li> I expected bigger and the color I asked for, but</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well with long hair</li>
            <li> Thanks to my husband for getting it, though it is slow in coming from China.</li>
            <li> It broke so bad and easily that it could not be fixed.</li>
            <li> I was a little concern about my hair being fine somewhat thin if it would hold.</li>
            <li> Its value for the money only problem is one of the Crystal was already off when it arrived (may be due to long journey).</li>
            <li> Wish the barrette would be positioned the other way, or maybe a different type of enclosure all together.</li>
            <li> They were smaller than expected, so pay attention to that detail!</li>
            <li> It is smaller than it looks in the pic and compared to the other clips I found online, it does not match the price point.  </li>
            <li> barely spans my 4 fingers held tightly together.  </li>
            <li> Took a very long time to get it.  </li>
            <li> This piece did not take very long to get to us from China to the eastern US time zone.  </li>
            <li> I ordered several of them; two for myself and a few others to keep on hand as last minute gifts.</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t the same as in the picture, there is no light blue, just the dark blue.</li>
            <li> Mine has turquoise blue feathers with pale blue stones on the body.</li>
            <li> Fell apart before I had used it a single time.</li>
            <li> The clip is a bit small, but the size is clearly disclosed in the product description.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s coming from over seas, so I expected a long wait.  </li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t take as long to arrive as I had expected it to.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s about 3 inches long, 1.5 inches wide.</li>
            <li> I was willing to risk my dollar with no shipping fee in case it arrived broken.</li>
            <li> not high end ,</li>
            <li> Not a single stone was loose or missing.  </li>
            <li> it clip half of my hair only.</li>
            <li> They are so pretty, none of them were missing any stones as some reviews complained of.</li>
            <li> This explains why you only have to pay less then a dollar for this item.</li>
            <li> The barrette/clip on the back is small at only about 1.5\\&quot; of space for hair to slide into.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these several times in several colors as presents and everyone LOVES them, small but makes a statement alone.</li>
            <li> When it arrived all of the rhinestones were the same color with the one exception of the black eye.</li>
            <li> The 4 I received today are much smaller, about about 2 1/2 inches long and smaller all around, and all turquoise stones, small black stone eye.</li>
            <li> A little smaller that I thought but not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> a little smaller then i thought</li>
            <li> It adds a little extra sparkle and holds the hair well.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and it may have just been too much for the clip.</li>
            <li> It is a little smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Its that cheesy bright fake gold tone.</li>
            <li> This thing is so big and cheap and just ugly.</li>
            <li> so much I can&#x27;t close the clip - essentially making this item useless.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> but i hesitate because they are not very well made.</li>
            <li> Hair clip, clip on back missing.</li>
            <li> iT WAS EVERYTHING i EXPECTED IT TO BE.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> It was prettier than what I expected.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, but it was broken.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> came sooner than i expected.  </li>
            <li> not really &#x27;vintage&#x27; as its brand</li>
            <li> It came from China as expected.  </li>
            <li> Not much contrast.</li>
            <li> I was sent a crappy rusty peacock necklace, not the hair pin i expected.</li>
            <li> I will wear it on occasion anyway, but it&#x27;s really not what I thought I was going to be getting.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter to wear in her long dark hair.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered sooner than I expected it.  </li>
            <li> This clip isn&#x27;t to big or to heavy .</li>
            <li> This was everything I expected it to be from seeing the pic when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> It is not nearly as large as one of the pictures makes it look.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about an inch and half long</li>
            <li> Battery is prettier in person than in the picture, but too small, particularly if you have thick or long hair.  </li>
            <li> It can only hold very little hair.</li>
            <li> I have long heavy hair and it works for me.</li>
            <li> Not too big, not too small.</li>
            <li> and it came in the mail faster than I had expected!</li>
            <li> and it is also small enough it could be used in a child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Will use parts for other projects.</li>
            <li> This one is smaller than the hair clips I have purchased in the past</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that this clip is left handed so it&#x27;s weird to put this through with your left hand, it will be no problem if you&#x27;re a lefty.</li>
            <li> One is for myself, the other one is for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Not to big and not to small.</li>
            <li> 1 was slanted to one side and the other was smashed.</li>
            <li> Lovely clip, but unusable at the moment :(</li>
            <li> So, like i said my only problem with the clip is that it is so small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;would buy this and/or other hair clip designs again from this seller</li>
            <li> I like to shop at other countrys for funn</li>
            <li> This would look really sharp clipped up against a bun or chignon twist.</li>
            <li> was small when i received it and the bracket thingy wouldnt open up was stuck..</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because when I opened up the package this horrendous smell filled my house! :(</li>
            <li> The cut of the rhinestones does lend to the sparkly quality like other ornate clips.</li>
            <li> I am keeping it for her to wear at parties and other events.  </li>
            <li> my friend like it a lot that I ending up giving her this precious peacock :(  ♡</li>
            <li> They were packaged with extreme care.</li>
            <li> The photos do them absolutely no justice!</li>
            <li> and this poor little clip really has no hope of trying to hold any of that up.</li>
            <li> The finishing is very rough........</li>
            <li> It is very poorly made and looks like it will break the first time I touch it.</li>
            <li> The metal is weak and I am nervous that the clip will not last long.</li>
            <li> It is so tiny that it will be hidden in thick hair and is not large enough to support thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The clip is hard to open and close.</li>
            <li> I actual had to give it to my sister after Christmas because it was so late.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth shipping junk like this - should be at the Dollar Store</li>
            <li> The color gold was to dark</li>
            <li> not worth it.</li>
            <li> it is quite small for anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that me being a lefty, it clips backward for me.</li>
            <li> (More of a gold base than is shown in the picture.)</li>
            <li> but my hair is too thick to properly wear it.</li>
            <li> Disappointing, arrived broken, very cheap looking.</li>
            <li> (i paid less than a buck, i think).</li>
            <li> But, again, it was less than $1.</li>
            <li> IT SNAPPED IN HALF</li>
            <li> it was less than 1.00</li>
            <li> I ordered them on Black Friday.  </li>
            <li> It just bent at the clip and broke in half.</li>
            <li> The depth/height of the item is also proportionately less.  </li>
            <li> THIS IDEM IS ONLY FOR THE WOMAN WHO DESIRES ATTENTION &amp; SERIOUS BLING FACTORS</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair past my waist and usually wear it all clipped back for teaching.  </li>
            <li> BUT when I went to use them I saw the barrette part was a mess.</li>
            <li> Durable, even for thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> I had to pinch the clip tight to get it to latch.</li>
            <li> and i have very long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought as a gift, so I was a little embarased.</li>
            <li> The metal is a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> I gave it to a little girl for her birthday</li>
            <li> I am a little hesitant to have my daughter wear it, for fear it will break again</li>
            <li> Bought it for my little girl.</li>
            <li> The little latch thingy never opened.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a little while, but they warned about that ahead of time</li>
            <li> Anyway our little girl loves it</li>
            <li> A little heavy but well made and will hold a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake little crystals sparkle wildly, and are all placed where they should</li>
            <li> the barrett parted from the peacock a few days after i got it ...</li>
            <li> I have worn them a few times</li>
            <li> but I am not wearing it with missing anything</li>
            <li> so I can not used waste of money I will tray to fix it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> No stones were missing.  </li>
            <li> You cannot use it to hold hair firmly in place</li>
            <li> and I have received a few compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Came from China, not worth returning. :/</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time or money.</li>
            <li> One problem- it the clip broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> i got a silver 1 with green jewels</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve expected it for it to have been at least $10.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was too heavy as some people described.</li>
            <li> It will take up few weeks to arrive but for the price</li>
            <li> Likes the color of stones, But overall, Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The clip itself is a little small</li>
            <li> It is a little bit small, but is meant for ornamentation rather than, say a ponytail clip.</li>
            <li> Very hard to get tour hair in to and hard to open.</li>
            <li> I was really shocked at how pretty it was</li>
            <li> The color is  this fake blue and the gold is clear fake.</li>
            <li> Very small, it&#x27;s about a little less than 2 inches.</li>
            <li> Looks ugly and cheap, plus it arrived broken.</li>
            <li> My 15-year-old daughter likes to wear her thick, curly hair in buns and loves to have these little clips to give her plain bun a little flair!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that they can offer this for so little money!  </li>
            <li> You would think these are small dinky little hair clips but the picture does not do them justice!</li>
            <li> but they are so small that when they fall off, they are gone.</li>
            <li> It arrived with a missing crystal!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t pass for jewelry but the peacock is very blue and flashy.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s small it holds my hair well.</li>
            <li> but it is small.</li>
            <li> if you like small clip.</li>
            <li> this hair clip was wayyyyyy to small for me to use on my maid of honor&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> The clip is really small.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS A BIT SMALL</li>
            <li> Maybe I missed that in the details, I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I have very short hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small hair clip</li>
            <li> but it is too small</li>
            <li> This item is listed as a hair clip but upon receiving this item it is as small as the size of a tortoise shell button.</li>
            <li> Not sure whoise hair this is supposed to clip.</li>
            <li> The clasp is about 2 inches so not for an excessive amount of hair.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here and was really small</li>
            <li> Much small than it looks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather small, about 2-2.5&amp;#34; in length.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as soon as I had attempted to place the clip in my hair, it broke instantly.</li>
            <li> Its too small for my hair.</li>
            <li> It is small, and not glitzy.  </li>
            <li> The clip arrived in a small, bubble-wrapped envelope.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy duty.</li>
            <li> This is a sad excuse for a hair clip.</li>
            <li> (the gold is VERY gold), but if I had wanted it to match an outfit, I would have been disappointed.</li>
            <li> The clip is very small, and was missing a stone when we opened it!</li>
            <li> The manufacturer may even vary the colors, so it&#x27;s hard to say if you would get one with these colors or not.  </li>
            <li> The part holds your hair is hard to clip together.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and have trouble keeping clips in it.  </li>
            <li> Item doesn&#x27;t have different shades of blues as pictured so it was disappointing.</li>
            <li> it shipped really late, in about a month.</li>
            <li> I didnt get this until I put in a complaint.</li>
            <li> However, its a delicate piece with a touch of class.</li>
            <li> Clasp is delicate use with care when opening and closing,</li>
            <li> It arrived a late, but it could have been because we had a couple of snow days.</li>
            <li> Not for thick hair, and a bit bulky.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t work for really thick hair</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for those that have thick hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair or just a ton of it</li>
            <li> Package also had a few broken pieces in it...</li>
            <li> It was too heavy for my thin hair</li>
            <li> I cant use it in all my hair, just very small portions.</li>
            <li> BUT IT IS VERY SMALL.</li>
            <li> the clip itself is very small</li>
            <li> is very small.</li>
            <li> It was very small.</li>
            <li> I am a grown woman with very small hands and the length of the item</li>
            <li> Seriously??</li>
            <li> I use it as subtle decoration to bring some cheer to my office at work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exceptionally sturdy, but it&#x27;s not flimsy at all.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty when you get it, but turns out to be awful!</li>
            <li> The clip is also a little difficult to deal with and gets stuck over.</li>
            <li> Afraid to wear due to fragility.</li>
            <li> As one might expect from the price, this pin is made out of weak materials.</li>
            <li> The clip is pretty but taking months to get was terrible</li>
            <li> Very hard to get it to unclamp.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> Definately stay in my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with the size</li>
            <li> it is broken when i receive it.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 one came smooshed and broken...</li>
            <li> It has already broken.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair.  </li>

            <li> It came I broken</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t have minded if it hadn&#x27;t arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> I ordered three of them, two were broken when I received them.</li>
            <li> POOR QUALITY</li>
            <li> It came broken in the package.</li>

            <li> though well done and isn&#x27;t still broken))</li>
            <li> but I hate the back</li>
            <li> garbage it all broken poor material keep your money people</li>
            <li> what I find in the stores are so expensive and are just not that sturdy.  </li>
            <li> and it looks like it was a expensive piece</li>
            <li> Looks expensive and fancy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look expensive (who would expect that for $1 anyhow?)</li>
            <li> Sorry for the error.</li>
            <li> btw they did refund my money and said they would send a return package for the two wrong items.</li>
            <li> This would have been a 5 so sad</li>
            <li> Unfortunately did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> Looks expensive, but it is NOT.</li>
            <li> The picture placed with this review is the wrong item.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the item</li>
            <li> Or would be, if it didn&#x27;t arrive broken!</li>
            <li> This is one I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with.</li>
            <li> It looks so expensive and well-made.</li>
            <li> or if you are just dressed casually</li>
            <li> Very thin metal and</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> VERY poor quality and colors were not as pictured.</li>
            <li> And the clip must be for very thin hair.</li>
            <li> Picture online appears that &amp;#34;metal&amp;#34; base is silver toned (hard to tell) - it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> It was disappointing.</li>
            <li> disappointing</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very beautiful! Love it!</li>
            <li> the barrett parted from the peacock a few days after i got it ... love the peacock part ... might turn it into a pin</li>
            <li> I bought a colorful one of these for my daughter.  I liked it so well that I bought this blue one for myself.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bc I&#x27;m going to wedding peacock themed. It&#x27;s not what I expected. Very small, it&#x27;s about a little less than 2 inches. It&#x27;s a great price, but not good quality. The colors aren&#x27;t the same as in the picture, there is no light blue, just the dark blue. I really thought I was going to be able to wear this too the wedding, but I guess not.</li>
            <li> Its smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li> It lookks ok. Very smaall tho. I cant use it in all my hair, just very small portions. very nie, i&#x27;d rather something bigger tho</li>
            <li> Considering that this was only a buck, I really didn&#x27;t expect much.  I was pleasantly surprised!  It&#x27;s actually got a little weight to it, and it&#x27;s really pretty!  I&#x27;m amazed that they can offer this for so little money!  I was also pleasantly surprised with the delivery speed.  It&#x27;s coming from over seas, so I expected a long wait.  It actually arrived quicker than some other - local - items I bought at the same time!</li>
            <li> These are very pretty. I have worn them a few times but i hesitate because they are not very well made. Many of the stones have fallen off. I really love them &amp; would reglue the stones but they are so small that when they fall off, they are gone.</li>
            <li> I loved this item, and was so looking forward to wearing it. However, it broke the first time I wore it! So disappointed. No way of fixing it. I wish it was a clip on, rather than a snap.</li>
            <li> Its that cheesy bright fake gold tone. It looked more of an antique color, not so bright. It was disappointing.</li>
            <li> the clip that holds it in your hair is already bent, but it&#x27;s very pretty, great for the price (i paid less than a buck, i think).</li>
            <li> This hair barrette is different than others I had ordered.  This is smaller and is an actual barrette.  It does not hold as much hair as I expected but it is beautiful enough that I ordered a second one just like the first.  I am constantly looking for hair accessories and what I find in the stores are so expensive and are just not that sturdy.  The clips and the barrettes that I have ordered from Bemaystar are beautiful, very well made, sturdy &amp; the prices cannot be beat.  I have been 110% happy with the business I have had with this company and I will recommend and continue to shop their products.  Thank you also to Amazon for all the great buys and products you have introduced to me.</li>
            <li> I know the item did not cost much. But my wife liked it on f.b. saw I ordered it and it made her Happy until the 3rd time she put it in her hair and it broke.she called me at work upset and said it broke.so i sent a email to the seller and still no reply e-mail Nothing I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is so pretty and it looks like it was a expensive piece...I just love it...So glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I have yet had the opportunity to wear this in my hair.  It appears to be well made.  I look forward to displaying it in my hair.</li>
            <li> This is one beautiful hair clip. My hair Peacock hair clip is gorgeous it&#x27;s so feminine and unique. I was a little concern about my hair being fine somewhat thin if it would hold. When I place the hair clip in my hair, it fasten securely I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Its a sweet hair clip, perfect for work. Plus, it came 2 weeks early! It is small, but a good hair clip.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this clip, she wears it every chance she gets. Based on the price it was a great deal, not made to last though.</li>
            <li> Very hard to get tour hair in to and hard to open. My already broke. But its very pretty</li>
            <li> The finishing is very rough........very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Gave it away as a gift.</li>
            <li> The stones kept falling out. After having only a couple days. I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a larger piece so that I could wear it above a bun or as a more decorative piece in my hair. This is small enough for my 6yr old to wear in her hair. Its light weight and them gems are very securely faceted. I am very pleased with the quality of this piece but disappointed in the size.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is very nice, everyone I have shown it to really seem to like it. I would recommend this item</li>
            <li> I LOVE WEARING THIS  HAIR CLIP. ITS A CLASSICAL BLUE AND CAN BE WORN WITH ANY STYLE. YOU CAN  WEAR WITH JEANS OR YOU CAN GO DRESSY EITHER WAY IT IS AN EYE CATCHER AND EVERY WHERE YOU GO PEOPLE COMMIT HOW  BEAUTIFUL IT IS.  ITS STRONG AND STURDY AND CERTAINLY OF GREAT QUALITY. THE BEST THING IS THAT THE PRICE IS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS. ITS A CHEAP PRICE WITH AN EXPENSIVE LOOK ABOUT IT.  TOTALLY WONDERFUL AND WORTH  BUYING</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected but its nice to Indiany for my taste but its nice because color wasn&#x27;t what was on the site</li>
            <li> Not for thick hair, and a bit bulky. Pretty piece. Wish the barrette would be positioned the other way, or maybe a different type of enclosure all together. Something flat for decoration in the hair would be better.</li>
            <li> It looks beautiful, but when I took it out of the package, the stone in the eye fell out.  I will just glue it back in, but you don&#x27;t expect a brand new item to lose stones.</li>
            <li> Hair clip, clip on back missing. Will not work. It is very pretty if it had a clip on the back.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it....looks like very cheap product ...good for 4 year old... I wish the material quality to be little better...</li>
            <li> Disappointed! It arrived with a missing crystal! Obviously cheaply made! It is pretty but I am not wearing it with missing anything</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF JEWELRY AT A FANTASTIC PRICE. iT WAS EVERYTHING i EXPECTED IT TO BE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> These are SO pretty!  I ordered several of them; two for myself and a few others to keep on hand as last minute gifts.</li>
            <li> I purchase for a gift, will not give till the holidays but know that she will enjoy it for sure.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice piece with great color and you can&#x27;t beat the price, however not sellers fault it is a little small for my taste.  Definately stay in my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I really thought it was going to be bigger size but instead I got 2 of them but they&#x27;re gorgeous! I had to go back to the page and I realized I didn&#x27;t read the whole thing or details. I really love it and I don&#x27;t got any complaints! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s the best my friends like it and my mom? I recommended to my friends because it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it so I am happy.</li>
            <li> Broke before I had a chance to use it</li>
            <li> A cute little bit of kitch in the right circumstances. Won&#x27;t pass for jewelry but the peacock is very blue and flashy. The gold is pretty cheap and flashy.</li>
            <li> Broke not too long after I got it. Gorgeous though. Perhaps with thinner hair it will hold up better.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair clip. This is so pretty and unique, well worth the money. Looks expensive and fancy. Any woman would love it.</li>
            <li> The clip is very small, and was missing a stone when we opened it! Another one fell out when we took the wrapper off.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for... It&#x27;s basically plastic and cheap metal, and wouldn&#x27;t clasp. I was more impressed with the envelope&#x27;s journey from Asia than with the product inside of it. Still, 99-cents and free shipping? I don&#x27;t know how (or why) they do it.</li>
            <li> This item is very beautiful. I love the shiny stones. I will say that it is much smaller than I expected... but that&#x27;s my own fault for not reading the size in the description- I saw prettiness and clicked purchase before reading Lol.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as a gift for someone who has a lot of hair and worried she wouldn&#x27;t be able to fit much in it but she made it work. Looks good on her. I&#x27;m jealous I didn&#x27;t buy it for me now. Lol. :)</li>
            <li> This hair clip is adorable and the price is right.  It is pretty sturdy and I can see it lasting awhile, although I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever based on the price. Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> This product is gorgeous!  I am not one to like the bird type things but I took a gamble on this.  I am very pleased with the way it looks.  The color is so pretty.  The clip itself is a little small so isn&#x27;t good for thick hair like mine to hold a lot of hair but with a little playing around I&#x27;m sure I can find a way to make it look cute.</li>
            <li> I had to glue the crystals back in when I received this. I bought as a gift, so I was a little embarased.</li>
            <li> Broken when it arrived and looked totally cheap. Not at all what I imagined, even for that price. Total waste of money</li>
            <li> a great hair piece. works well. sturdey. durable. does not appear cheep. i am very happy with this purachse and i plan on buying more soon!</li>
            <li> GREAT HAIR PIN, BUT IT IS VERY SMALL.</li>
            <li> It is so pretty. I love it!  The blue really stands out. It looks just like the picture when you open it.</li>
            <li> For the low price I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be as pretty as it is. It&#x27;s a sturdy clip. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very cute hair clip, and for less than a dollar, an awesome deal!  Considering how inexpensive this hair clip is, the quality really isn&#x27;t bad at all!</li>
            <li> The downside of it, is that it pulls your hair  when you try to place in in a different location of your head.</li>
            <li> Clasp will not close. Very pretty though. I&#x27;ve tried to fix the cheaply made clasp but it won&#x27;t close. Sad!</li>
            <li> Bemaystar Women&#x27;s Vintage Crystal Peacock Hair Clip is really beautiful &amp; good quality. I like the brightness of the crystals &amp; the cost of this product. I definitely recommend this hair clip.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this hair clip. Women at work are always commenting on how pretty it is. I wouldn&#x27;t dare tell them how little I paid for it :)</li>
            <li> I like this barrette a lot, it&#x27;s way prettier than the picture. I have long heavy hair and it works for me. I wore it out and about all day and evening yesterday and it held just fine. At this unbelievably low price (one dollar, free shipping!), I&#x27;m ordering more as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 9-3-13: I liked it so much I ordered 4 more for gifts. They arrived today. Surprise surprise they&#x27;re about half the size of the first one. The first barrette that I liked so much and reviewed above is 3 3/4 inches long, has very pretty turquoise, lavender and \\&quot;diamond\\&quot; stones, with a black stone for the eye, and is actually prettier than shown in the  picture. The 4 I received today are much smaller, about about 2 1/2 inches long and smaller all around, and all turquoise stones, small black stone eye. They&#x27;re still pretty for 89 cents. I ordered these 4 as gifts for 10 year old girls, expecting to get 4 more like the first one. These smaller ones are nice and will make nice little gifts for the girls, but they wouldn&#x27;t be big enough to hold my long heavy hair. Even tho they aren&#x27;t like the first one I liked so much that I ordered more, they&#x27;re quite nice for the price. But I really wanted 4 more like the first one. Because of the switch to a lesser item I&#x27;m changing my review from 5 to 4 stars. I&#x27;d change it to 3 stars but I really really like the first one.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s great. Shipping always takes a while but it&#x27;s expected. It feels like it could break if not handled with care but I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much. You mostly get what you pay for online. HOWEVER, this is really cute and eye catching. It doesn&#x27;t look expensive (who would expect that for $1 anyhow?) but it is cute. Not too big, not too small. I know the barrette portion won&#x27;t hold much (kind of small), especially for long hair. But, again, it was less than $1. I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I purchased this since I wear my hair up every day in the summer.  I have received lots of compliments on it.  Very happy with my purchase and it came in the mail faster than I had expected!</li>
            <li> For the amount of money I paid was satisfied with the product that I received. I did like the color of the blue stones.</li>
            <li> It is very poorly made and looks like it will break the first time I touch it. Much prettier in the picture.</li>
            <li> Well I rather if it was silver but it is gold so I like it. It is a bit different than i expected but It will work.Also a bit smaller than I though although it isn&#x27;t a problem. The price was great.</li>
            <li> This Iteam is a small clip but very pretty. I love wearing it. The clip holds a lot better than most</li>
            <li> Love, could have shipped faster!</li>
            <li> My clip was only teal colored stones. Not blue and teal as the pic shows. I wanted it for the blue. The teal stones just aren&#x27;t as pretty as a solid. Pretty disappointed. I was very much looking forward to the different tones in this clip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but it doesn&#x27;t look as good as the picture, and the clip is bad. I thought I was getting a quality product for very little money, but it&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
            <li> A pretty dainty hair accessory. In my order I actually received two of this clip which I wasn&#x27;t expecting, so that was nice. However one of them had a couple stones fall off during shipment.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the cost.  I&#x27;ve worn this clip several times and almost always receive compliments.  It was prettier than what I expected.</li>
            <li> This was beautiful, the price was unbelievably low and it came very, very quickly.  It is slightly smaller than the pictures showed it, but we didn&#x27;t care.  It made a lovely stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> I think the design itself isn&#x27;t too bad, was hoping it would be a little more eye catching,  but its not bad. The clip doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair very well though.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time i tried to use it. Its really pretty but ya get what ya pay for. :(</li>
            <li> Pretty clip!  Ordered 2, 1 for a friend.  I&#x27;m pleased with the items, attractive and stylish.  Recommended for sure!  thanks</li>
            <li> When I received the hair clip, it was much smaller then the picture perceived it to be(in the women&#x27;s hair). It was not upsetting enough for me not to use it, however, the second time using it, the peacock head tangled into my hair and broke off of the hair clip.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred purple to blue, but did love the barrette. Would recommend to those who like blue instead of purple.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smaller hair clip that I bought to enhance updo styles it works well and it is also small enough it could be used in a child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter and it works wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;It is so pretty and diverse to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Price!</li>
            <li> Cheap sprayed on gold that peels off but you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> very  nice  clip, brilliant colors, nice quality for the price; gems are sturdy so far.  I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Its  very small and the stones are set cheaply ,but the color is nice .&lt;br /&gt;If u buy this beware it is smaller than  PIctured  .</li>
            <li> The detail to this hair clip is so pretty and is made well the only thing is I wouldn&#x27;t call this a womens it is more for a child due to the small size other than that it makes a cute little gift.</li>
            <li> Pretty much holds my hair in tack. Love how it sparkles in the sun light. I have ear rings that match the color, so it goes well.</li>
            <li> It was only a dollar and it came from China so what do you expect.  Smaller than pictured and gemstones were all one color.</li>
            <li> Picture is fairly accurate to the actual product, which is always a plus. Clip doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of hair, but it was cheap, and cute, so I can&#x27;t really complain here.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package it was wrapped very nicely. I love this piece. I hope my mom will like it too. The picture does make it look bigger than it is but it also shows the detail in the piece. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice and sparkly. Was hoping it was silver toned, and not the bright brassy gold color. Still gets used, looks great on top of a side braid.</li>
            <li> it is rather tiny for the price. It does have good qualities just really small. Not happy at all with the size</li>
            <li> The photo is misleading. It appears to be silver when not made into a larger image. The crystal color is lovely but it will not be worn as much as originally planned.</li>
            <li> From the picture it looked to me to be silver but was instead gold which I do not wear but if you do wear gold it is very pretty. The peacock and stones are gorgeous, I just thought it was silver. If you like gold I would highly recommend it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> dont buy it. not those colors and clip broke in first use.. dont buy this product was of money okay</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty piece, it just does not stay in my hair very well, worth the price tho.</li>
            <li> Afraid to wear due to fragility. Looks like plastic. Will use parts for other projects. Get what you pay for</li>
            <li> It was what I expected. Look even better in person.</li>
            <li> I love peacock design jewelry, and this hair clip is beautiful, so much so that I bought a second one.</li>
            <li> THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BARRETTE  the first time it was opened it broke. In the review I remarked about it breaking, They sent us another one.FROM HONG KONG  the thing only cost  $0.99. The second one we made into a broach</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Very cheap item. It broke the first time I clipped it in my hair.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the hairclip. It is exactly as pictured. I may order another for a friend .</li>
            <li> love it, its tiny and simple and well made! it fits perfect on the side of a messy bun. great price and arrived immidiately.</li>
            <li> well the only problem with this product is don&#x27;t open so I can not used waste of money I will tray to fix it.</li>
            <li> This one is smaller than the hair clips I have purchased in the past but the stones are very bright.  Love it</li>
            <li> The ones I got, all gems are in one color. Still pretty but not as showed.&lt;br /&gt;Ok quality. Metal part seems very cheap but they are cheap, aren&#x27;t they? You get what you pay for. That&#x27;s fair enough to me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this initially because the price was excellent and I already had another hair clip from this brand and I loved it. This is the complete opposite. I doubt it&#x27;ll even hold a piece of my hair and now I have to hot glue the bead onto it. Seriously??</li>
            <li> It is very pretty but not as big as I thought.  If you want a small barette this is good for you</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t want to give my mother so far she loves it she doesn&#x27;t wanna miss as of yet but she loves peacocks and she says beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty and at an amazing price. I have had several compliments on it.  It is  a little cheap...but again it is VERY inexpensive</li>
            <li> These were smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be but they are very cute and really you wouldn&#x27;t want them to be huge if it&#x27;s something to wear in your hair. The girls at my daughter&#x27;s birthday party (11-12 at the time) loved them. The price was right but you have to plan ahead as they take quite  a while to receive.</li>
            <li> VERY CUTE HAIR CLIP.  I LIKE IT VERY MUCH AND WILL SURELY ORDER MORE IN THE FUTURE.  ITS LIGHT AND PRETTY.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty, but in real life you see a lot more of the gold setting. Additionally, it is very flimsy and the clip keeps popping out. It&#x27;s easily repairable but you won&#x27;t be able to use it to do more than just look pretty. it doesn&#x27;t have the strength to hold clipped hair, so you will have to put your hair up and then put in the clip.</li>
            <li> It broke right when I took it out of the package! It isn&#x27;t fixable. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> This is small but cute! Its almost a rose gold color the stones are light are dark blue. The shipping took awhile but for the price its a deal.</li>
            <li> Very pretty accent for your hair</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this hair barrette, beautiful.</li>
            <li> it is broken when i receive it.Because it is very cheap,so i decide to discard it not return it.</li>
            <li> this hair clip is very pretty but does not stay in my hair at all. I even tried it in my  niece&#x27;s hair and it still would not stay in the hair</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected. It is fine, but cheap looking. I don&#x27;t think I would buy more. The price was very cheap though.</li>
            <li> The stones look cheap close up. That said, the price was right and I have had many compliments on the hairclip.</li>
            <li> This is pretty, but it looks a little bit cheap compared to some of the other similar hair clips I purchased recently. That doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t worth getting though, because this is a seriously good deal on it.</li>
            <li> It was a dollar, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything spectacular. It&#x27;s a cute little thing, and I think it&#x27;s a good price. It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it would be, about two inches long. But hey, it was a buck. I know that some people have said that theirs doesn&#x27;t look like the one in the picture, but mine is the same color. It took a long time to get to me, I actually thought it was lost in the mail, but it did come. So all things considered, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty little peacock. Mine arrived just as pictured. It also didn&#x27;t take as long to arrive as I had expected it to. I love it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair accessory, brilliant colors and no missing jewels. I was excited to receive it so quickly. Its a bit smaller than I thought but still very pretty and useful.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for someone with fine short hair.  It is so tiny that it will be hidden in thick hair and is not large enough to support thick hair.  I looks to like an adult item to give it to kids to put into their hair.  I recommend; an adult with thin hair could be satisfied with this peice.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is absolutely beautiful! I got it in the mail earlier than I expected which is not a bad thing, and it looks exactly like the picture! Although it&#x27;s small it holds my hair well. The only problem I have is that this clip is left handed so it&#x27;s weird to put this through with your left hand, it will be no problem if you&#x27;re a lefty. I will surely look forward to putting this hair piece on when I go out. And I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Used the hairclip only once and it stayed in place.  I am hoping it last a long while. If not :-(, I will  add it to my peacock collection.</li>
            <li> Seems sturdy, all one color rather than the multiple colors shown.  Not as pretty as the pic, but still worth the price.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, but it was broken. Tried to contact seller but no luck. Worth the gamble though it was pretty and I would have loved to have had worn it in my hair but oh well.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a present for my mom, whom she loves clips like this style. She really loved it. Personally I didnt like the back part of the clip, but my mom said it holds on better than the new clips. Thats the only reason im giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting three of these clips because I love the design. You would think these are small dinky little hair clips but the picture does not do them justice! I myself received two and my child also received one. We really enjoy the extra touch they add to our hair. You can dress up your look or look very casual with the clip. Such a great product!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a gold version (not silver) of the image you are in for a treat. I ordered two of these as gifts and once they arrived they were gold. Not my favorite pieces of jewelery but if you are a fan of gold this item is great!</li>
            <li> It was small but pretty. Its for children,  not adults. Its not as pretty as it was in the picture.</li>
            <li> This is so pretty.  I bought it for my 13 year old granddaughter for her Christmas Stocking.  I think she will get a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but it is one of those snap/clasp closures.  I thought it was just a clip, which I prefer.  Pretty but a little cheaply made.  But the price is cheap, so that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d expect :)</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.  Was nicer than I thought it would be .  Was just as pictured.  Very pleased.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> My grandson asked me to bought this for a friend.She was very happy about it.She love it.Very nice size too.</li>
            <li> It is much smaller than I expected it to be. For the price it is okay, but not what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I was disappointed it came broke would&#x27;ve been nice to been able to wear it</li>
            <li> It looks even better than the picture. It is not too big so it works well with my hair style. Shipment was surprisingly timely.</li>
            <li> I give the product 5 stars however, I give the seller about 3.  The product is beautiful but if you need it right away or if you are buying it as a gift you will need to order it waaay in advance.  I ordered the product on October 14th and received it November 25th.  Like I said, the product is gorgeous - but you will be waiting a while.</li>
            <li> I ordered this silver clip. They sent me a gold one. I notified this seller and they said they would send one right out. Sorry for the error. They sent me another and it was gold as well. When I contacted them yet again they said their shipping department said they shipped the correct color...silver...I took a picture of it with a silver chain next too it. They said the see the difference. But they don&#x27;t sell silver. WHAT....they then said I must have bought it somewhere else. Really I sent them the messages from my Amazon account. bait and switch. btw they did refund my money and said they would send a return package for the two wrong items. no they didn&#x27;t send a return package. Glad that I will not purchase from this company ever again.</li>
            <li> i loved the color and it was gorgeous and i put in on as soon i got it. it has a beautiful shade of blue and i love it in my hair the price was great overall it was great.</li>
            <li> it is sparkle and reach too soon. but it is small. it clip half of my hair only. but i like it. if you like small clip. i will recommend this to others</li>
            <li> All of the stones are the same color, but for the price (one dollar?!?! plus free shipping!) It&#x27;s a great barrette. I got plenty of compliments &#x3D;] It&#x27;s a good buy, and a friend is already getting one as well.</li>
            <li> At first i was skeptical about this peacock hair clip, but it turns out to be totally worth the price. It could literarily match any of my clothing and i can easily pull it off as a genuine vintage hair clip lol</li>
            <li> As one might expect from the price, this pin is made out of weak materials. It won&#x27;t stand up to much damage. That said, it looks lovely and stays in my hair well. Be prepared for a very long shipping period if you live in the US.</li>
            <li> This is really pretty! I only wish it held more hair, and I don&#x27;t have a lot like I did as a teenager, but it won&#x27;t hold all my hair, so I put it in a ponytail holder first.</li>
            <li> I bought these as gifts for my flower girls &amp; I love them. They are so cute &amp; sparkly. They will look wonderful in their hair on my wedding day. Very glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> pretty Got as gift for someone.</li>
            <li> This is an ok hair clip I guess what do you expect for the price.It was brand new and it cam quick so that was a plus.If anyone where to purchase this I think it would be good for a little girl.It is cute but too small.The clip was smaller than I imagined so all in all this was an ok purchase.It wasn&#x27;t a horrible purchase.</li>
            <li> The hair clip I received has one color stone used on the entire body of the peacock and one of the large stones is missing. I really hate spending money and having the item ordered arrive NOT as advertised! Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and the size. A little nervous that it&#x27;ll break, but overall it was worth it. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> It looks good though not as elegant as in the picture. Its value for the money only problem is one of the Crystal was already off when it arrived (may be due to long journey). Hope the rest hold in the use.</li>
            <li> I basically tried clipping it in my hair but it was just so cheap. lolol as expected for such a low price. but. i wouldnt buy it unless ur just trying to spend money</li>
            <li> Gave it to my sister as a gift. She says it&#x27;s very pretty. And she likes it a lot! Thanks</li>
            <li> The one that I received is not as it is pictured.  This barrette is actually larger than I had expected it to be.  It looks cheap and it feels too chunky.  It just looks tacky.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these one for me and one for a gift. Both are beautiful and don&#x27;t look cheap at all.</li>
            <li> They were smaller than expected, so pay attention to that detail! But still very nice and pretty. I&#x27;m glad I bought two because one will not hold up much hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this expecting it to look like it does is the picture, silver... I received a very yellow gold hair clip with blue rhinestones in it. I am not a fan of gold so I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the switch out. It was less than $1 and had free shipping so I didn&#x27;t bother with a return.</li>
            <li> this crystal peacock Hair Clip is very beautiful! The stones sparkle and makes it much better. It&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 one came smooshed and broken... If it wasnt so cheap I would have sent it back.. Sometimes u get what u pay for.. The one that wasn&#x27;t broke was very pretty!</li>
            <li> This is not very heavy, great quality nor very big. It&#x27;s about an inch and half long and it&#x27;s not meant to really hold hair. It&#x27;s more of a decoration only. Don&#x27;t depend on this to hold your hair up. You would have to pin it up and add this to &amp;#34;decorate&amp;#34; your hair.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice looking hair clip. I purchased this for my daughter and looks great as an addition to your hair for going out dressed up or if you are just dressed casually</li>
            <li> This is very pretty, It is better than I had expected. I have gotten a bunch of compliments and my daughter loves it too!</li>
            <li> the weight for me is just right, it&#x27;s not heavy or light to put on your head. the only thing is the smell of metal, so I spray it with some perfume to get rid of it.. works great</li>
            <li> They are cute.  Cannot fit much hair in the barrette.  They look as advertised.  They can accentuate a hair do-up.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty and will be a nice accent piece for my wedding.Will definitely be the SOMETHING BLUE I needed.</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece! My granddaughter loves it! Can&#x27;t beat the price. I will definitely order more in the near future. Thanks.</li>
            <li> good buy for the price. when i saw this one in amazon, I was a bit doubt on this one. since it is having free shipping. I thought to give a try. Yesterday, I received my item. Its good looking hair clip. for the lower price its good item.</li>
            <li> Its very lovely.... Stones very nice &amp; bright.... took 2 weeks for delivery..... Size is bit smaller...........its worth....All my friends loved it,</li>
            <li> This looks like the picture and is nice. But it is smaller than I thought it would be. My husband says it looks playful and bright. I do have red hair and sometimes that makes colors look brighter. It is good quality and it was a good price overall I like it. This clip is gold based that’s something to keep in mind when you purchase it. I have a shirt that has a peacock on it that has a turquoise body and this matches it. I would like it better if it had a silver or metal colored clip most of my jewelry is not gold colored.</li>
            <li> this hair clip was wayyyyyy to small for me to use on my maid of honor&#x27;s hair. I had to hurry and buy a different one</li>
            <li> many compliments; bought extra for gifts. hope they hold up. might order some more for gifts for others. great idea.</li>
            <li> I bought four of these to give as Christmas presents and I just love them and shipping was a lot faster then originally stated by a month. thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> It has already broken. Not a good product looks cheap and very light weight. I wouldn&#x27;t say this was one of my better buys online!</li>
            <li> looks good but does not hold hair .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for this clip. It was not really my style, the gold is too shiny and adds a cheap feel. It broke the first time I tried to wear it.</li>
            <li> A little heavy but well made and will hold a lot of hair.  The color is pretty and I like the design.</li>
            <li> The item I received was bright brass and only teal - not as shown in the picture.  When I contacted the seller to receive the item shown i was told \\&quot;it only cost a dollar - so it&#x27;s still a good deal\\&quot;.  Horrible customer service if that is there attitude - I wanted the item pictured - not what they decided to send!!  Beware</li>
            <li> The peacock and little jewels on it are very very pretty.  They shine and gleam in that pretty way most of us females love.  However, I thought I had ordered the blue peacock clip but I received a pink one instead - while it is beautiful and the color I probably should have ordered for my skin tone it.. it isn&#x27;t the one I was expecting.  Additionally, the clip that is intended to hold the piece in your hair is horrendously cheap.  I&#x27;ve worn the item twice and it is now warped so much I can&#x27;t close the clip - essentially making this item useless.  I&#x27;m hoping to make it into a necklace or perhaps attach a better quality clip to the peacock.&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, the shipping was extremely quick and considering the item is a dollar we really don&#x27;t have much to complain about.  Also, the woman suggesting that this item is better sized for a child must wear enormous clips because I found the size to be completely acceptable for my adult woman self.</li>
            <li> It is cute dont get me wrong but it was not exactly what I expected it was a little smaller than I thought and very gold. But it is cute! Came in good time and in good condition. If under 2.00 I would buy it. If under 1.00 I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> A little smaller that I thought but not a problem at all. Looks exactly like the picture.  Very happy here!</li>
            <li> Oh the picture does an injustice to this Pin or Hair clip. It is about 3 inches long and very sparkly with all those pretty gems stones.&lt;br /&gt;It is a beautiful piece of jewelry to own and whether you use it for a hair clip or brooch (pin) I would buy 2, one to keep one to give.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was as promised if not earlier.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in June. I literally just received it today, November 16th. I forgot about it. It is worth the dollar I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair.  This clip does the job well.  Very cute, just like the picture!  I bought two.  One is for myself, the other one is for my daughter.</li>
            <li> SO cute :) It is about an inch and a half, I love it so much, good for just some bangs up and to keep some hair out of the way, beautifully. A great buy.</li>
            <li> Very good quality. I did not give all 5 stars because a couple of the stones were sideways on the clip. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase. Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> this is so pretty and just the right size for a childs head or an adults head...it is sparkly and I love the color</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a very special young woman on a very special occasion... her first prom. The hair clipped matched her outfit perfectly, and looked so lovely in her hair. Needless to say, she was thrilled with it! And as it turned out, her favorite Auntie (who loves Peacock&#x27;s) has one just like it.</li>
            <li> Save your time and your money and don&#x27;t buy this.  The clip is really small.  Oddly enough the package said it was a toy, that is about the best description of the piece.  It is also took a long time to arrive.  I placed Amazon orders after it and they arrived before the clip.</li>
            <li> very pretty but low quality clip.  Very thin metal and the clip itself is very small so won&#x27;t hold an adult ponytail.  Better used as a side hair clip.  I may convert it into a larger clip by gluing a different clip on back or into a magnet for my fridge.  Still like the peacock design and color.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend as a gift... She was always looking to purchase one for herself... These barrettes are priced so high in stores, so when I saw this one at this low price I ordered it...</li>
            <li> This is a blinged out hair clip.  It won&#x27;t work for really thick hair but I do use it for half-up, half-down hairdos.</li>
            <li> Of course it is not 100% as neat as the picture but for the price, not bad. i still think its pretty and mine has not broken and i have very long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> not bad for price just get what you pay for received on time... bought one of the multicolored ones it was lot better quality</li>
            <li> this is a pretty clip and looks fantastic in my hair though you should be warned, it is quite small.</li>
            <li> Appropriate for a child, not so much for an adult. It looks way better in the photo than in reality.</li>
            <li> This is beautiful. It looks amazing on my dark dark hair! I like that I can add just a little something and get so many complements. I am happy with the purchase and will be on the look out for more amazing fun hair accessorizes!</li>
            <li> Cute little thing. Great material. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this clip. It&#x27;s beautiful, I get plenty of compliments and it holds up well. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter, and I think I want one for myself. It&#x27;s not too big, it&#x27;s a bit smaller than I thought, which will actually make it more versatile and functional than you may be led to believe by the picture. It&#x27;s about 3 inches long, if that, and secure well with it&#x27;s barrette closure.</li>
            <li> Broke down after first use, different color, small.&lt;br /&gt;Very cheapy look. metal is such a bright cheap yellow color. and after I tried it on me, button part just fell off. :(</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hair clip. It stays in place and holds your hair where it belongs. I would recommend it to any one.</li>
            <li> I got this hair pin and its so beautiful i love it. I dont think I will wait til I have something special to wear it to , I will wear it when Ever its so pretty it will dress up any day .</li>
            <li> Found these super cheap for someone that loves peacocks.  Totally surprised at the quality when they arrived.  What a great buy!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S BEAUTIFUL AND BROKEN....THE FIRST TIME I WORE IT IT SNAPPED IN HALF (THE BACK)...SO I PUT IT IN MY GARDEN :)</li>
            <li> looks exactly like the picture, it holds up very strong doesn&#x27;t fall out of my hair, absolutely beautiful I love it</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of these in mid October and they arrived in mid November. From Hong Kong I think so they took a while. They are so pretty, none of them were missing any stones as some reviews complained of. The colir is vibrant and the stones are sparkly. Great stocking stuffers! (You gotta plan ahead.)</li>
            <li> So cute and classy and simple to dress up any outfit! (More of a gold base than is shown in the picture.)</li>
            <li> I got this, it came and I was totally surprised at how cute it is.  I would have happily paid much more for this at the store.  It took a while to get to me but at less than $2 I won&#x27;t complain about that especially since it shipped for free from China.  It is the perfect size, not too large, not too small.  No stones were missing.  I really really like it.  I will be ordering more if they have additional colors.  I haven&#x27;t worn it yet because I am waiting for a special occasion but I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> It did take a long time to arrive and is not the highest quality metal but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be for the price. The color was just as the picture and it really stays in place.</li>
            <li> This Peacock Hair Clip is absolutely beautiful. The photo definitely doesn&#x27;t give it justice. I&#x27;m a picky shopper and I recommend this product for everyone.</li>
            <li> Both my daughters liked it and wearing with pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;The metal of the clip looks a bit fragile, but so far so good, nothing can be complained of</li>
            <li> This little clip is very pretty.  Not too impressed with the slightly padded envelope it arrived in.  I had to do some minor repairs to the clip but it seems to work just fine.  You cannot use it to hold hair firmly in place but more of a decorative accent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because it really is pretty and it was so very, very inexpensive. I took one star away because I have to use something to hold my hair and then clip this over it so that it stays in place.  This might be because it broke in transit and I had to glue it back together.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wicked cute , a good size . Which is good because I&#x27;m getting too old to have anything huge in my hair . Love it</li>
            <li> this is a beautiful clip, although cheap, it seems to be pretty sturdy, but is a little troublesome to close</li>
            <li> I loved this head accessory. It is really a good purchase for such a low price. It is sparkly and shine (not too much to be indecent) and  doesn&#x27;t look cheap. So highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, but the pin came off of the piece. I will glue it back in to place, but it would have been better if it kept in tact to begin with.</li>
            <li> This just came today. I had ordered it when it was .87 cents with free shipping, and I thought, what&#x27;s to lose. When it came out of the packaging (good, sturdy packaging) I was amazed. I didn&#x27;t even get it out of the plastic bag before I called everyone over. It is simply gorgeous. I would say it&#x27;s about 3 inches long, 1.5 inches wide. The gems are a bright turquoise (much brighter than in the picture) and the metal is a bright yellow gold color. If you have your heart set on what is in the picture, you&#x27;ll probably be disappointed, but in my opinion the final product is much more beautiful. I simply love this clip.</li>
            <li> This is nice. But way smaller then it looks. Also I was sent the incorrect color. I received multi color and not blue. Also I had to glue some gems on.</li>
            <li> not as pictured! all gems are the same color without any sparkle. it is about 3&amp;#34; long. very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty little piece. The price is a steal. I have not seen anything like it in stores and I have received a few compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This clip is very pretty but the clasp is not my favorite. It is one of this &amp;#34;clicking&amp;#34; clasps rather than a bobby pin style. I love the look but my hair is too thick to properly wear it.</li>
            <li> what a bargain.  how can they make this and ship it and still make a profit with such a low purchase price?</li>
            <li> The color of the little gems were exactly as described. My group had a gift exchange and we couldn&#x27;t spend more than $5.00. The little peacock was perfect.</li>
            <li> I liked the look of it because of the different color blue that is on the picture but it came with the same color &amp;#34;stones&amp;#34;. I am not surprised at the quality due to very cheap price. And also, it is smaller than I imagined it would be looking at the picture.</li>
            <li> VERY CUTE THIS ACCESSORY FOR HAIR .... LIKE ME FOR MY hair look SPECTACULAR IN ANY MODERN AND SOCIAL EVENT ..</li>
            <li> For the price I paid I didn&#x27;t expect the best quality ever, but I never even got to use it, as the clip to close the barrette broke immediately. It&#x27;s pretty though, unusable. Came from China, not worth returning. :/</li>
            <li> BROKE IMMEDIATELY SO IT WAS NEVER WORN BECAUSE AS SOON AS IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE PACKAGE IT BROKE</li>
            <li> I was shorted one of the beautiful hair clips, and I am still waiting for it to arrive. It is a gift for a bride to be</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews. This thing is so big and cheap and just ugly. The picture is way nicer than the actual clip.  Everyone&#x27;s right, you get what you pay for. No wonder it was so inexpensive. Oh well...</li>
            <li> I  Still have not received product. Once I receive the product I will be able to make a more accurate review</li>
            <li> I love this hair clip. It is so pretty  and just the right size. Not to big and not to small. The stones are really shiny. After wearing it today I received so many  compliments. I am adding on to my original review since sadly after wearing this pretty hair clip a few times I went to put it in my hair today and the back of the clip broke off and is now unusable. If you are really careful with it and not try to put to much hair into the clip it probably will not break. It is very pretty</li>
            <li> Too pretty and will be lovely on my new scarf! Can&#x27;t wait to wear it. Much Prettier than the photograph.</li>
            <li> Bright and sparkly. Crystals are very pretty and clear, and beautiful color, set neatly. Gold-tone barrette is bright, as shown, ok quality. Note that the size of the barrette limits the amount of hair it will hold; it is not meant to sweep long hair up in one barrette at the crown or nape of your neck. They are intended as accents to side of French Roll or to pull top layers, long bangs, etc to one side. Holds a good amount of hair well.</li>
            <li> Bright and blingy and  just the right color for a grey headed do.  My sister was delighted. What more could I ask for.</li>
            <li> This lovely hair clip is about 2.5 inches long and looks just like the picture.  Very sparkly and pretty.  I will enjoy wearing it.  Thanks to my husband for getting it, though it is slow in coming from China.</li>
            <li> I liked these clips but only a couple of stones came off. I wear this when I go out.  Purchased a second one in a different color.</li>
            <li> Cheap.  Broke on the first day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, very pretty. Good on my daughter. However, only after 2 days, the clip and the peacock fell apart. I tried to glue them, but the glue did not work. I got the full refund. Customer service is very good.</li>
            <li> I loved it and so did everyone else. The only reason why this got 4 stars was because it was such a pain trying to snap the barett in my hair and taking it out hurt my fingers but overall nice product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for the cheap price. The metal is a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> Colors not exactly as pictures, but still beautiful.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here but I love it and its super adorable</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s so light and made in metal. It looks good too.</li>
            <li> This is just as pretty in person as on the picture. It is very nice on my daughters hair and she loved it!</li>
            <li> This clip is so pretty.  I love the way it looks.  The price was cheap but the clip doesn&#x27;t look cheap.  The metal is weak and I am nervous that the clip will not last long.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Not sparkly at all and definitely cheap looking - I went ahead and took a shot at this because I&#x27;ve been lucky on this type of cheapy jewelry here on Amazon before.</li>
            <li> SO THE CLIP MET MY EXPECTAIONS IT WAS A BIT SMALL ABOUT TWO INCHES SMALL BUT EXTEMLY CUTE AND FOR A GREAT PRICE LOVED IT.</li>
            <li> This is a sad excuse for a hair clip. Could not even use as it would not even open. Don&#x27;t waste time or money. Find something local. Took weeks to arrive to not be able to use.</li>
            <li> not my taste but it came in good condition and my mom likes it so it was worth the purchase</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product for the price. It&#x27;s just a fun hair clip to wear for the heck of it!</li>
            <li> The clip does not open, I plan on contacting them to see if I can get a replacement. Looks decent otherwise.</li>
            <li> This pretty peacock barrette fell apart the first time I used it. I would not recommend this product for those that have thick hair. Very light duty is required for this one. Haven&#x27;t fixed it yet as I&#x27;m wondering how I&#x27;m going to fix it. Would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Very pretty blue color. Very easy to put in hair. Will go with many different types of clothing. Excellent. Pretty!</li>
            <li> Took a very long time to get it.  The product was pretty but the hair clip part of it was flimsy.  It fell apart.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend with long hair. She wears it up a lot so I thought it would be pretty for her. She loved it.</li>
            <li> This is the most beautiful hair accessory I have ever seen!&lt;br /&gt;It is much cheaper than excepted for such high quality.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect accent for my Granddaughter&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality with lots of bling.&lt;br /&gt;Fits comfortably on ones head.</li>
            <li> My 15-year-old daughter likes to wear her thick, curly hair in buns and loves to have these little clips to give her plain bun a little flair!  These arrived much quicker than the stated shipping time from Hong Kong, which was very pleasant.  The clips themselves are exactly as pictured, although smaller than I had thought (maybe 2-3 inches compared to the other she has that are 4-6 inches).  Maybe I missed that in the details, I&#x27;m not sure.  Anyhow, they&#x27;re great little clips and will add a nice touch to a bun.  I definitely order again if I need more.</li>
            <li> Okay So I got the item and it was as described. The only thing is that I expected it to be bigger. It was a barrette which is good and the coloring is obviously different then the picture but it was so like the picture the hair clip was blue and very pretty just it was small</li>
            <li> Basically, it was a little smaller than expected, but actually looked a lot less cheap than expected as well, which was great.</li>
            <li> The 1st time I received these ruined within the shipping process. It took 2 months to return my request for a replacement. When I got them I was incredibly pleased with their looks BUT when I went to use them I saw the barrette part was a mess. I ordered a pair. 1 was slanted to one side and the other was smashed. When I sent a message to them they never responded.  These would be GREAT barrettes if  the barrette mechanism was not so cheap  OR they shipped them in a package where they did not get ruined...............&lt;br /&gt;VERY disappointing and I do not recommend these for anyone</li>
            <li> Item doesn&#x27;t have different shades of blues as pictured so it was disappointing. It was a good size tho. ok</li>
            <li> I just got my hair clip and I love it.  If you have thick hair or just a ton of it this might not be for you.  I have really thin fine hair and it always falls out of every hair clip...until now...it stays in perfect place all day and it&#x27;s super cute!!!  I&#x27;m so glad I got 2.  Be ready to wait a while for shipping but it comes from China so it&#x27;s to be expected.  great buy!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice design and color,are beautiful and of good quality, the package arrived on time and without problems, and I highly recommend</li>
            <li> while it wasn&#x27;t expensive,it also wasn&#x27;t worth ordering.it&#x27;s just too cheaply made and when I opened the clip it feel off in my hand.but it was less than 1.00 so i&#x27;m not bothering to return it.</li>
            <li> The clip is terrible. This hair clip is more like something you pin on your shirt. I want my money back!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this hair clip.  I have gotten many compliments while wearing it.  Well made and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have it and it looks good.  I have very thick hair and have trouble keeping clips in it.  I still have not used it.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful little Barrette and since I have fine hair it would have worked fine.  There were only two problems: 1. The original picture showed an alligator style clip, which is much easier to use, and 2: The clip broke the first time I opened it.  I&#x27;m really disappointed because it is beautiful, but will have to contact seller for a return.</li>
            <li> my sister took it from me beceuse she loved it so much</li>
            <li> I love these hair clips soo much, I bought two of these and use them all of the time.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother... it turned colors after wearing it for a week. Very pretty when you get it, but turns out to be awful!</li>
            <li> The peacock is smaller than I expected, but still very beautiful. I gave it to a little girl for her birthday and she really liked it.</li>
            <li> This is cheap: in price and in quality. I can&#x27;t complain because I hardly paid for shipping, but I haven&#x27;t been able to make any use of it either because it just looks too cheap and cheesy. I wouldn&#x27;t even put it on my toddler.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty but the clip was a spring/release clip that never worked.  I removed it and will replace it with something else.</li>
            <li> Peacocks are of course beautiful and this hair accessory lives up to it inspiration.</li>
            <li> I love my beautiful turquoise peacock hair barrette...it looks very pretty in my dark auburn long hair.........The price is simply a steal,you could not find such a unique barrette in the store for this price.....I am going to visit my parents soon ,and will wear this in my hair on the plane....Thanks so much for the lovely barrette.</li>
            <li> This barrett is so pretty. I like it so much I gave it to my granddaughter and I am going to get me another one.</li>
            <li> For the price, this hair clip is good. Not great quality, but it&#x27;s what I expected. The clip seems to be sturdy, though.</li>
            <li> Wow. These are really really tiny. The clip is also a little difficult to deal with and gets stuck over. It also tugs at my hair when I wear it. It is too small to pin anything back really, it should be using with a rubber band or larger clip to do any kind of styling. I give it a three because of the price, I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> This was a beautiful piece. However it could not close making it unusable. This would have been a 5 so sad</li>
            <li> Of course, this isn&#x27;t going to be great quality given the price, but it&#x27;s just like it looks in the picture. Sparkly and cute.</li>
            <li> Great hair pin.  I have bought it for a Christmas present this year and I am hoping that my friend loves it but I am sure that she will</li>
            <li> a little smaller then i thought</li>
            <li> Cute clip, great for the money. I love to wear with my hair and have gotten a couple compliments on it. I paid cheap price and it is good quality.</li>
            <li> O bought it because of the colors to match my daughters outfit, but it isn&#x27;t quite like the picture. it&#x27;s all one color...blue. I was disappointed in that, but the quality is good, and you just can&#x27;t beat the price. Just don&#x27;t have your heart set on it matching the picture exactly</li>
            <li> Its nice but it shipped really late, in about a month. I actual had to give it to my sister after Christmas because it was so late. Kind of awkward but we are family.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty, the fastener appears stable, and decently made. I bought it as a gift but its so nice that it makes me wish for longer hair to be able to keep it for myself.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ve too fine and little hair for the pin to hold.  Love the color but was of no use to me.  Donated it away.</li>
            <li> Georgeous!  Great buy, I Love It!  The colors are rich and it looks great in your hair. This is a wonderful buy!</li>
            <li> this is so gorgeous. I will purchase it again for my sisters and my neices. Thank you very much!!! I really love it</li>
            <li> Really pretty for a very low price.</li>
            <li> Good quality and pretty. No part dropped after 6 months.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely little touch to any hairdo. The bright turquoise stones are super sparkly and pretty. One of the stones was loose when I received it, but it glued right in :)</li>
            <li> Gorgeous!  Was delivered quickly and unharmed. Appreciate it very much!!</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my 8 year old granddaughter.  She is bird person and loved it.  Right size for her size.</li>
            <li> Got it for my friend and it was gorgeous  I wanted one but unfortunately I have very short hair lol</li>
            <li> This shiny peacock barrette is so cute.  It is a great accessory to an outfit and definitely makes you stand out in a good way.  It is comfortable, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and doesn&#x27;t fall out.  My hair is short, thick, and curly and this looks very cute on my hair!</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty clip. Colors are beautiful. But when it arrived, one side of the peacock was not attached to the clip. It looked as though the solder had come away. After I looked at it closer the second side also broke off. The peacock is now not attached to the clip. I have asked for a replacement or refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could solder it back on myself, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get lots of use out of it. It seems to be a very large sturdy clip. Just needs to be secured better to the peacock.</li>
            <li> Delivered ahead of schedule.  Jewels are nice to look at, not cloudy or cracked.  But when I went to put it in my hair, back clip came right off.  Not just the tension piece - the entire clip.  For what I paid, I will be okay gluing it back on, or changing out the back to a pin.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and great price!</li>
            <li> I ear this barrette frequently. I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful. It came I broken but it was easy to fix. All the stones were in place. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very pretty clip, but arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Took too long to arrive (I&#x27;d forgotten I&#x27;d ordered it) and I wouldn&#x27;t have minded if it hadn&#x27;t arrived broken.  So there you go.  It&#x27;s ok enough, but I couldn&#x27;t use it and it didn&#x27;t seem worth trying to return.</li>
            <li> MY CO-WORKERS LIKE IT SO MUCH THEY WANT TO BORROW IT! I don&#x27;t wear it very often but when I do this hair clip stands out and people notice it and tell me how much they like it in my hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but fell apart after two uses. My hair is very thick and it may have just been too much for the clip. It was a lovely piece. I would have like to have worn it more than two uses.</li>
            <li> I ordered three of them, two were broken when I received them.</li>
            <li> I thought this was so nice that I just had to buy more To give as gifts . Just wish I had gotten more</li>
            <li> This Bemaystar crystal peacock hair clip is beautiful.  They (I ordered 6 of them) took forever and a day to arrive.  I wanted them as Christmas gifts, and they arrived on January 30th.  I ordered them on Black Friday.  I could not pass up the price.  They were practically given away.  They are still well made and just gorgeous!  I recommend them.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It looks great in my hair and actually stays in place. I have fine hair and most Hair Clips don&#x27;t hold.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely Mrs. Rick</li>
            <li> nice colors...very shiny and bright...clip isn&#x27;t the best quality but you get what you pay for...I would buy another one...</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to receive but its beautiful and I always get compliments on it, very nice product for the price.</li>
            <li> A very beautiful Peacock hair clip.  I have received lots of nice compliments on this Peacock hair clip.  Plus the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty but it is really small and a barrette not a clip</li>
            <li> The Hair Clip is Beautiful for the money. A Great Deal</li>
            <li> great piece to have Daughter loved it great and fast service no problems at all....</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Ok so the pin is worth the money that you pay for but it isn&#x27;t something that grand. Kinda tacky.</li>
            <li> This BARRETTE design is pretty enough, and unlike a similar one - this one arrived with all of the stones in place. The goldtone is cheaper looking than anticipated, but for the price, could be overlooked. The review that suggests using these as decorative pieces is onto something. May even remove the barrette and secure it to an alligator clip.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is small but so cute! You&#x27;ll like it too I&#x27;m sure. Then of course the price is right.</li>
            <li> Well made, great price. It&#x27;s doing a fantastic job at keeping my wild and crazy hair out of my face while still looking snazzy. The only thing that I would have prefered was that the metal was silver-toned rather than gold-toned, but its minimal in the preference department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a thing for poppycocks (as my preschooler calls them).</li>
            <li> I love my vintage crystal peacock hair clip . I love the detail . I have gotton many wonderful comments about the details of clip .</li>
            <li> I bought this one before.  I liked it so much I had to buy another one.  It is  a perfect size, not too small and not too big.  Ddliverh is quick.</li>
            <li> My favorite color and bird.  Good enough quality for the price.</li>
            <li> The blue peacock... it&#x27;s elegant and nice!!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly well-made and sturdy.  Very eye-catching.</li>
            <li> The stones in this are fine. I didn&#x27;t expect gems since it was so cheap. But I bought it for my daughter and she has yet to wear it. The peacock broke off the barrette part the first time I tried to open it. I have tried multiple things to glue it back together, and think I have the solution. I am a little hesitant to have my daughter wear it, for fear it will break again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty, but there is no grip in the claps and if I want to wear it, I have to use other pins and barrettes first to secure my hair then I add this clip for flair.</li>
            <li> The color varies from the picture but mine was pretty close the the original picture of it. And I love the colors, it&#x27;s such a lovely hair clip that before I could even wear it once my mother took it and decided I have given it to her. It&#x27;s very sturdy and hold her hair pretty well, better then most of the ones she has bought from stores, they delivered it within the time given.</li>
            <li> Even prettier in person. I use it a lot and it&#x27;s really sturdy to keep my hair up</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these hair clips, and was delighted at how brilliant and beautiful they were when they arrived in the mail.</li>
            <li> I didnt get this until I put in a complaint. The clip is pretty but taking months to get was terrible</li>
            <li> Much blunt. Bought two different colours. Was cheap but, does not look it. I might just get another one too.</li>
            <li> This was actually very pretty but it was way smaller than I thought it would be. The peacock also separated from the clip as soon as I opened it to use it so I never even got the chance to use it :(</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty hair clip,just wish it had a different type of clip...as it too small for allot of hair.</li>
            <li> I was worried it would be kitschy, but it&#x27;s actually not.  I use it as subtle decoration to bring some cheer to my office at work.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The peacock itself with all the stones is very pretty. The clip is crap and will not hold up. This explains why you only have to pay less then a dollar for this item.</li>
            <li> was super cheap, so I rolled the dice.  Clip is SUPER cheap and broke within the first hour of wearing it.  Not surprised.</li>
            <li> it was beautiful but the clip part came off even before I could use it.  I guess it is just meant to look at and not to use as a hair clip.  Very poor quality.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> If I knew that, I would not have ordered. Package also had a few broken pieces in it...Not sure what broke as it clips fine.</li>
            <li> Bought for my young daughter because it was super cheap.  Was so cheap that she wouldn&#x27;t wear it.  Not worth shipping junk like this - should be at the Dollar Store</li>
            <li> It is smaller than it looks in the pic and compared to the other clips I found online, it does not match the price point.  I&#x27;m glad I got it for my cousin for Christmas, but I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Pretty little barrette and received it quickly!  It doesn&#x27;t hold much hair, but it&#x27;s not meant to.  Only a hair jewel and holds in place!</li>
            <li> Fell apart before I had used it a single time.</li>
            <li> Picture online appears that &amp;#34;metal&amp;#34; base is silver toned (hard to tell) - it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s tacky looking shiny gold. The picture is much nicer than the product. SUPER slow shipping. Very cheap quality. Would not have paid 50 cents for at a $Store. Ordered 1/3/2014 and received 2/10/2014.</li>
            <li> Quality seem s a little on the cheap side, but, then again it was cheap so what do you expect. Daughter loves it for playing dress up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small hair clip but it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> I bought one of these about 3 years ago, I have used it nearly every day. I have very fine, thin, silver hair and it rarely falls out. I do have long hair and pin it up before I put the clip on. I have received many compliments on it. I have handled it with care and was surprised when it broke where it was hinged, but for the price, I did wear it for 3 years. I loved the clip and have ordered it again.</li>
            <li> This hair clip broke, literally, within 1 minute of putting it in my hair. Ok, I&#x27;ll admit, I DO have very thick hair, but being almost 55 years old, I DO know how much hair to put into a clip (I didn&#x27;t overload the clip with hair), and it literally broke before I had even finished with my hair! But the seller did reimburse me. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it&#x27;s very pretty. I&#x27;m gonna try to make a pin out of it.</li>
            <li> the clip is very cute but broke after wearing it twice</li>
            <li> Love this ! Great but! Did take a while to receive though..</li>
            <li> i bought 2 of these  one for mom and one for me.like the desein also the color.the only thing i dint care for is these are not for adults hair.more like for kids.please  state weather its for a kid or adult .it would make it much easier  thanks</li>
            <li> I LOVE this item.  All stones are in the turquoise color.  Beautifully made.  And am hoping to buy more soon.  These will make such a nice gift!</li>
            <li> Although smaller than I thought it would be. .it works great and is very pretty</li>
            <li> Nice clip..was very pretty to wear and got complements. One problem- it the clip broke after a few uses. you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is just gorgeous.  It arrive early which is a plus for me... The teals and blues are just awesome.  I cannot wait to get this into my hair tomorrow... :)  The picture does not do it justice at all.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it. I bought it because I thought it would be beautiful in her blonde hair and these are her favorite colors. Turns out her boyfriend&#x27;s last name means Peacock! It came all in one piece, no loose crystals, with the barrette mechanism working fine.</li>
            <li> love it i got a silver 1 with green jewels not a silver 1 with blue but its all good i love it</li>
            <li> Disappointing, arrived broken, very cheap looking.</li>
            <li> Its cheap and doesnt have a  good finish, please move on. The price was too cheap so I tried but i havent worn it even once.</li>
            <li> This is really a nice piece</li>
            <li> is very small. and looks cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty and sparkly, and small enough to be modest. It doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all, and is amazingly beautiful. I would&#x27;ve expected it for it to have been at least $10. It stays in my hair too! Definitely a must-have :)</li>
            <li> This is absolutely beautiful, I received it in good enough time, there wasn&#x27;t a need for a rush, it&#x27;s a wee bit smaller than I had hoped it would be,  but that&#x27;s fine, I can work with it. It&#x27;s very elegant and the price was great, so one can afford to get a few different colours to match different things.</li>
            <li> I bought this for young child and it surely would not work.  Very very mature looking.  The picture looks pretty but the time itself looks cheap.  You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller sent in good timely fashion.  Unfortunately did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> Great for ladies with thick hair. I do not. Never worn.</li>
            <li> These are just so small it just didnt look right on me. I put it on my sisters daugther and it looked way better. They are also much cheaper on Ebay.</li>
            <li> I bought this clip to wear to my school dances next to a bun. It is adorable and the gems do not fall off.</li>
            <li> Love that it is a clip! It really took over a month to receive, but now that I have the three items I am satisfied withmy purcahse. The 4 star was based on the lenght of time it took to receive from order date.</li>
            <li> perfect size barrette for a half up-half down hair style. get complements every time i wear it!</li>
            <li> My daughter-in -law just got married &amp; I bought these for all the bridesmaides &amp; flower girls to wear in the wedding. The were very pretty &amp; matched her theme perfect.</li>
            <li> This took over a month to arrive.  This is not vintage, though it is very pretty and made to look vintage.  It is very heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty piece .. A perfect addition to my peacock jewelry collection .. The stones are a beautiful color and have a brillant sparkle ..</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful hair clip! I was really shocked at how pretty it was and it arrived days before the actually delivery date. I was really happy about that. I say for the price its more than worth buying it! my mom is going to love it for Christmas :-)</li>
            <li> it is elegant and beautiful. the crystals shine and stand out nicely against the golden colored metal works. looks great.</li>
            <li> It was too heavy for my thin hair so I added it to the above Peacocks on my white mantle to add more sparkle in my Peacock theme.  Would recommend it for heavier hair but I could use them as a decoration instead.</li>
            <li> It is sparkly and pretty was thinking I would wear it but it is too small so I am gifting it to my mom who loves sparkles</li>
            <li> This piece did not take very long to get to us from China to the eastern US time zone.  The clip is a bit small, but the size is clearly disclosed in the product description. The design is very elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess what bothers me is that the photograph of the peacock in the product description has both light blue and dark blue colored rhinestones.  The one we received has only light blue rhinestones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ten year old daughter (this was specifically for her) liked the coloring regardless.  She got rather excited about this hair clip when we received it.  She has beautiful hair and this clip will accent her hair nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did knock off a star for the color discrepancy. However, its a delicate piece with a touch of class. Beautiful for any lady&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this clip.  It is much smaller than I expected, and is not even the same color as what is shown.  I will be returning this.</li>
            <li> This item is Walgreens, to bad they dont sell it there.I think they should..Dont be affraid to buy it .Its not high end ,but I think it is cute.</li>
            <li> VERY CHEEP AND IT BROKE SO FAST</li>
            <li> This is a pretty hair barrette.  Overall, I would have given it 4 stars for the quality, design, sparkle and color.  I took off one star because it&#x27;s not as pictured, as others said.  Products sold on the internet should have an accurate picture.  The body of the peacock has clear rinestones, not blue.  The tail has large sky blue rinestones with small teal ones.  In the picture, the tail has mostly turquoise stones.  That&#x27;s what I wanted because it&#x27;s my favorite color and I have a lot of clothing in that color.  The manufacturer may even vary the colors, so it&#x27;s hard to say if you would get one with these colors or not.  I have long thick hair past my waist and usually wear it all clipped back for teaching.  It holds all of my hair, but just barely.  Some might want to use it for just a portion of their hair.  I would say that it&#x27;s medium sized, as barrettes go.  The quality is o.k.  I&#x27;ve seen better and worse quality in barrettes.  Some said that it&#x27;s more appropriate for little girls or dress up.  That&#x27;s really a matter of taste.  I tend to wear clothing, jewelry, hair accessories that are different.  I have my own unique style.  As far as price, I&#x27;ve seen barrettes at drug stores for $10. or more.  I think it&#x27;s a good value.  Please post an accurate picture next time.</li>
            <li> Super pretty. Doesn&#x27;t look cheap. For the price it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s def a statement piece but it&#x27;s not so big it&#x27;ll overwhelm your head.</li>
            <li> Most were broken and bent and un-usable. VERY poor quality and colors were not as pictured. very unsatisfied. POOR QUALITY</li>
            <li> i ordered several, i have already worn mine to great compliments and gave one as a gift. The hair clip is even prettier than the picture.Great price.</li>
            <li> My sister ordered this and she loves it and says &amp;#34;its beautiful my hair . I use it for ponytails and it is so elegant&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Beautiful really enjoyed!</li>
            <li> Very classy. Looks expensive, but it is NOT.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable quick delivery for a beautiful piece of ornamental jewelry. Lots of positive comments. AND I ran it thru my washing machine ( by accident) and NO damage or loss of jewels! Love this. And amazing price.</li>
            <li> Such a nice hair accessory. Sort of wish I had purxhased two, as I have very thixk hair. Still happy!</li>
            <li> Received my beautiful peacock hair clip today! I love it! Very secure, lightweight and gorgeous! The crystals simply sparkle!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!&lt;br /&gt;Candy in VA</li>
            <li> I thoroughly like the clip and Im very excited about it. However, for whatever reason it won&#x27;t open...if anyone else has experienced this issue please respond because I&#x27;ve tried everything, I&#x27;ve had others try to open it, and I&#x27;m not trying to break it. Lovely clip, but unusable at the moment :(</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this barret!  I get so many compliments on this barret.  I think everyone should buy one of these!</li>
            <li> Came within a decent time packaged along with some other stuff I had ordered. This piece is totally beautiful! I can hardly wait for an occasion to wear this beautiful piece in my hair.</li>
            <li> This barrette is very pretty, does not look cheap or tasteless. I bought two to clip my hair on this sides and it is the perfect size for this purpose. I didn&#x27;t think it was too heavy as some people described. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Looks ugly and cheap, plus it arrived broken. What do you expect for the price though...? Really you should just save your couple bucks lol</li>
            <li> This clip is super cute, and in previous reviews I read that the clip was small but i figured that i would take a chance on it anyways. This clip would work wonderful on a child and be absolutely adorable, or if you have thin hair it could possibly work for you as well. I have very think curly hair that is almost to my waist and this poor little clip really has no hope of trying to hold any of that up. So, like i said my only problem with the clip is that it is so small. The seller really should but something like a quarter next to it to show scale.</li>
            <li> The color gold was to dark but it was pretty as the picture show. But I recommend it for any combination with gold.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and thought the blue would look great in my red hair, but instead I got the light pastel barrette.</li>
            <li> I have wore this clip in the front and back of my hair, and people love it. It is really pretty. Stays in my hair.</li>
            <li> These pieces are nice, amazingly low in pricing and make lovely gifts. They just take a long time to deliver, but are worth the wait.</li>
            <li> note that this has a barette backing, rather than a clip.  It is lovely and well made.</li>
            <li> Got this for the Marine Corps Ball to hold my hair back when things get sweaty.... everyone jammed in a hot dance hall/ball room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t worn it yet.... but it feels sturdy and the gems look nice, not too gaudy or cheap looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the sturdiness of the hinge/clip, i&#x27;m sure like the Conair clips i get from CVS, one day it will snap.... as do all hair clips under $10 but for the price and the fun, pretty design, and how well it matches my dress :) can&#x27;t beat it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would buy this and/or other hair clip designs again from this seller</li>
            <li> junk- from China.  The color is  this fake blue and the gold is clear fake.</li>
            <li> Peacock hair clip is bright blue and very pretty.  Constructed with good quality.  Looks pretty in my red hair.  Beautiful clip.</li>
            <li> I  thought this piece was very nice.  In fact, I wish I had purchased more.  It is delicate, yet very showy!  Hope that it will last.  THANKS</li>
            <li> Very pretty hairclip well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece of hair art.  Bought it for someone special and they absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my little girl. She said she loved it!</li>
            <li> this is my most favorite hair clip at this time I didn&#x27;t think I would like it so much it really stands out I like to shop at other countrys for funn</li>
            <li> This item is listed as a hair clip but upon receiving this item it is as small as the size of a tortoise shell button. Not sure whoise hair this is supposed to clip.</li>
            <li> really cute, holds well, beautiful color, a nice small size. I love peacocks, so if you are like me, or know someone who is, this a deff a good buy!</li>
            <li> It broke the first time I tried to clip it into my hair.  And not thick hair either.  It just bent at the clip and broke in half.</li>
            <li> I like this product. quality at a high level, this seller quickly sent the goods, the idea is very original position</li>
            <li> cute and cheap. go for it</li>
            <li> This clip broke after one time wearing it.</li>
            <li> Great colors on the Peacock. Shines brightly in your hair. Clasp is delicate use with care when opening and closing,</li>
            <li> This hair clip is a beautiful piece, the only thing that I would change about it is that it needs to have a bigger clip. The coloring is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Cute, but doesn&#x27;t really sit well or look right in my hair. So I never wear it. Perhaps it would work better on short hair or for a child.</li>
            <li> as long as you don&#x27;t need it right away, it was totally worth the price. They do look super simple and a bit small, but I wanted myself to have the bigger piece than my bridesmaids. This looks similar to the piece i bought for myself, but I feel like it&#x27;s a perfect complement. I do wish it were alligator clip type, but the barette style will do.</li>
            <li> This is pretty, the plating isn&#x27;t quite as bright cheap yellow as the blue or the pink ones, and done a bit more delicately than either of those two. I&#x27;d stick with this one or the bronze color plated one, they look the best out of all of them. If I had seen the pink and the blue ones in person before ordering I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered those ones.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the quality of this cute little hair clip. The clasp is about 2 inches so not for an excessive amount of hair. This would look really sharp clipped up against a bun or chignon twist. The jewels are very clear with a well done body and tail. Exceptional price. Recommended product. The picture placed with this review is the wrong item.</li>
            <li> Shipping took FOREVER. So long I&#x27;d forgotten about the clip till it came. I think it took about a month. So if you need this right away don&#x27;t buy it. Also inexpensively made, rhinestones falling off already but for $1.99 I&#x27;m not surprised. Got it for my daughter&#x27;s hair. The clip it&#x27;s self is nice and sturdy. It&#x27;s a small clip, perfect as a nice accessory or a clip for a child.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this online purchase at such a cheap price! I was willing to risk my dollar with no shipping fee in case it arrived broken. But when the clip arrived (took around a month), it is so pretty &amp; in perfect condition!! All stones are in-tact &amp; very shiny and the clip is not broken. I got a lot of compliments from my female colleagues &amp; they couldn&#x27;t believe the price I paid for it!</li>
            <li> Great, just love it and what a good price. Looks pretty just sitting on my bureau!</li>
            <li> This is not the picture posted that I ordered and received. I ordered a very pretty blue peacock hair clip and love it. It looked a lot prettier in person than the picture I ordered it from (not the one posted).</li>
            <li> Really looked nothing like the picture. Took forever to arrive. Never would have worn it but even if I wanted to I couldn&#x27;t have. It feel on to the carpet and the back fell off.</li>
            <li> So many compliments on this pin when I wear it on my up do! So exotic, I can wear it anytime of the day!</li>
            <li> i only put 1 star to get me to this screen, i have not received this product.  who should i contact about this?</li>
            <li> This really is a great looking barrette.  I also thought it was shipped timely for coming from Hong Kong&lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewer said, mine was not the same color blue and greenish color scheme as it seems in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Mine was a more mono-toned greenish-blue.  I also hesitate to say it has Crystals- they do not sparkle and shine like picture.  They are more dull, flat and plastic like.&lt;br /&gt;I am still happy with the product for paying under Five Bucks.</li>
            <li> bought several, some stones fell out the first day worn. I wont be buying more. Was a gift for Christmas 0:</li>
            <li> Beautiful,but stones aren&#x27;t secure.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this purchase, it&#x27;s beautiful but the barrette part was super cheap and delicate, broke before even arriving. It came broken in the package.</li>
            <li> I ORDER TWO OF THE PINS TO PUT ON MY CARRYALL AND IT LOOKS GREAT. NICE QUALITY PIN FOR THE PRICE. VERY PLEASED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SANDRA PHL</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful barrette but too small to hold a lot of hair. Good for just maybe a side pull up of hair or for someone younger.</li>
            <li> Thank you, I received my item and it as pretty and I was happy :)</li>
            <li> I love this clip! I have very only hair, and this clip is great for a side swept look.  It stays in place all day, without pinching.  Ive gotten a lot of compliments on this clip  it is very pretty and such a great deal.</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Looks really cute in my grandaughters hair.</li>
            <li> Incredible price...super pretty...not cheap looking at all.  Get yours for cheap!  It looks like it was well made.  Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> lovely.  even prettier than the picture.  very nice hair clip.  doesnt have prongs to catch the hair.  came sooner than i expected.  not really &#x27;vintage&#x27; as its brand new.  but very pretty</li>
            <li> It is cute for the price  nothing spectacular I am sure I will get my moneys worth out of it</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful barrette, the price was great and it came faster than I thought it would!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this clip, it was beautiful, but it broke before I ever got to wear it out of the house! I put it in my hair and the clasp broke apart.It broke so bad and easily that it could not be fixed. Unfortunately I had to throw it away. I wanted to buy another one hoping that it was just a fluke, but decided to spend my money on something else instead. I wish it would have worked and lasted more than the one time I attempted to put it in my hair.</li>
            <li> not as large as I thought it would be but it will do, what more can you ask for for the price</li>
            <li> I expected bigger and the color I asked for, but oh well, I can use it on my daughter instead. Transaction went fine and the item came on time.</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty hair barrette, both my daughter and I will wear it.  It isn&#x27;t just a hair clip, it is a barrette that snaps&lt;br /&gt;closed.  Fantastic price on this, have passed up very similar items in stores for 10 time more $$</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice but too cheap quality. when i got it, i try the hair clip on and the clip broke.</li>
            <li> this clip broke right away very cheap its a cute clip just wish it wouldn&#x27;t have broke so fast didn&#x27;t get my $1 worth</li>
            <li> saving this for birthday gift. but looks really cute and sparkly. hope I can keep track of it until spring</li>
            <li> This little guy is so pretty! You only get one, but it sure is pretty! Back clip is made of metal. very sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li> was small when i received it and the bracket thingy wouldnt open up was stuck.. so im disappointed in the product</li>
            <li> Great color, made well and is perfect for botht the costume I need it for and for ongoing future use.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The barrette looks as pretty as the photo.  However, it is not a hair clip, which is what I had wanted.  I recommended this to my client to hold her scarves in place on her vest or blouse.  Obviously, she cannot use a barrette in the same way.  So if you want a barrette, this is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair the perfect bling!  LOVE IT! I will be buying from this person again!  Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I really shouldn&#x27;t complain for what I paid for this.  It&#x27;s pretty, it holds well and its is a pretty color.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter, and she loved it, she is 7.  It is great for a child</li>
            <li> I thought that this was adorable - but it arrived and was not at ALL what I expected... It was very small. Also, I was expecting a clip and this was a barrette - which my hair won&#x27;t hold. It was such a cheap product, I probably won&#x27;t take the time to return it, but I would not recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here and was really small I have thin hair and it still didn&#x27;t wanna clip right just a warning but it is pretty.</li>
            <li> Mine came exactly as pictured. It&#x27;s not the most sturdy accessory (you&#x27;re paying less than a dollar for it!), but it&#x27;s really pretty and looks awesome in my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this in a wedding head piece and it looked very nice and bright, very nice and looked nice</li>
            <li> Much small than it looks. Doesn&#x27;t work well with long hair</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even able to use this, the clip was broken when I received it. Poorly made. I won&#x27;t buy another or bother with sending it back.</li>
            <li> This pin is a beautiful faux gold with very vibrant teal gems.  It sparkles and is a very nice size.  It&#x27;s actually not a clip but a barrette.  It still goes in your hair, and if you&#x27;re confused a quick internet search will show/explain how they work.  The peacock is beautiful and I often get compliments about how vibrant it is!  It&#x27;s not exceptionally sturdy, but it&#x27;s not flimsy at all.  I suppose as long as you&#x27;re not abusing the barrette, it will fit you well! Definitely worth a dollar!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful im mean very beautiful if u r someone that likes to dress up a pony tail or a bun this is so adorable it is amazing how nice it is shipping is a little long (overseas) but if u are not in a run this is too cute!</li>
            <li> I am giving this as a gift, and it looks just like the picture I saw. I think the recipient will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This is even prettier in person! It is the perfect addition to any up do! I plan on wearing mine to weddings and baby/wedding showers! Very sparkly and a lovely blue and rose gold color!  It comes on a french clip which I also like for extra security!</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the item it is just a bit too gaudy for me</li>
            <li> Gorgeous! Great gift! Durable, even for thick, long hair. Again, very beautiful.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair clip! It&#x27;s light, It&#x27;s beautiful, It&#x27;s so shiny! :) So far I have used it a couple of times and have not had any issues with it opening and falling out. I also have not had any of the gems fall out. Can&#x27;t complain for the price!</li>
            <li> Unlike some of you I didn&#x27;t even get the chance to wear my clip. The little latch thingy never opened. I guess you get for what you pay for. Didn&#x27;t even bother to return. I just threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> This is beautiful but I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because when I opened up the package this horrendous smell filled my house! :(</li>
            <li> the peacock fell off after one use</li>
            <li> It broke the first time I tried to wear it...</li>
            <li> cute , gems, and workmanship</li>
            <li> This was $0.65 with free shipping. So how could I not give it a try.  It came from China as expected.  Surprisingly the crystals have stayed In place and my daughter has worn it almost every day for a couple of months.  There is no wear or discoloration so far.  So for the price I would have been happy eve if it was a one time wear, but I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth out of this one</li>
            <li> Came within set time limits, but it was a big time window. The quality is good for costume jewelry. good.</li>
            <li> Item was broken. It would not close. Not happy with purchase. Will not purchase again! Will not recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is definately a cute little barrette. Everything about it says quality. I recommend this product and this seller. Thanks for everything!  :)</li>
            <li> First, if you&#x27;ve been browsing hair pieces from this vendor, note that this is not a clip, but rather a barette. It&#x27;s rather small, about 2-2.5&amp;#34; in length. The cut of the rhinestones does lend to the sparkly quality like other ornate clips. The metal is a bright shiny brass-like material that doesn&#x27;t quite go well with the turquoise. Also, the product photo almost appears to show two different colors, light blue and turquoise, but the one that arrived turquoise only.</li>
            <li> Love it everything is great. I don&#x27;t need all these words to get out what I want to say about this product</li>
            <li> This is beautiful. However it is much bigger than appears, as about 4&amp;#34; across. But a great way to dress up your hair for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty but it broke in just a couple of weeks :( At least I can save the stones for my own art work.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Looks good in my hair. Just the right size, Stays on well . Fancies up a hair do very nicely.</li>
            <li> One star because it did not look like this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this one star because I can&#x27;t wear this. It is cute. Or would be, if it didn&#x27;t arrive broken! The hair clip came not attached to the peacock (looks like it was either shipped or damaged during shipping, the peacock was ripped off the clip part underneath). Also, the clasp where you open it is kind of jammed. If I can figure out how to fix it I will wear it. It&#x27;s really cute and I wish I could wear it.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful pin for you hair. The colors are vibrant &amp; easy to take off without ruining your hairdo. Excellent buy.</li>
            <li> I was drawn to this cute hair clip. I have two they are so sparkly cute and unique. I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen anyone wear one and I like to be different.</li>
            <li> This item is smaller than I thought it would be. Only measures 2.5\\&quot; wide by 1\\&quot; high. The barrette/clip on the back is small at only about 1.5\\&quot; of space for hair to slide into. I have a lot of hair, but it seems to be holding so far. I had to pinch the clip tight to get it to latch. In the merchant picture the stones are shown as quite multi-colored; a turquoise blue and a dark blue. Mine has turquoise blue feathers with pale blue stones on the body. Not much contrast. I&#x27;ll keep it because it is shiny and pretty (the gold is VERY gold), but if I had wanted it to match an outfit, I would have been disappointed.</li>
            <li> this is great product will buy more great all around and great price for the buck I will tell my friends about this product</li>
            <li> It is a bit smaller then I was expecting but I will still use it. all in all a fine product</li>
            <li> I got this as a sale item and was very impressed. It is classy and beautiful all in one. I would like to see more items like this</li>
            <li> The barrette part barely worked when I took it out of the packaging. I had to bend it to get it to function even halfway decently. Ended up throwing it away... thank goodness it was cheap.</li>
            <li> The clip is hard to open and close. It doesn&#x27;t hold much hair back either but it is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as soon as I had attempted to place the clip in my hair, it broke instantly. I was not handling it in a rough fashion, I was taking good care of it and hadn&#x27;t worn it as soon as I had gotten it. I&#x27;m a bit dissatisfied with how easily it broke the first time I put it in.</li>
            <li> the pin is quite nice but rather small. though well done and isn&#x27;t still broken)) both me and my daughter wear it</li>
            <li> I like it it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services and i like to give 5 stares</li>
            <li> I LOVE the look but I hate the back it is impossible to put in and out but if you have nimble fingers it is perfect</li>
            <li> This shipped super fast, and is so gorgeous.  I bought it for my 6yo to play dress up, but it is so nice I am keeping it for her to wear at parties and other events.  Everyone comments on how nice it is. The picture does not capture what it actually looks like in person.</li>
            <li> got it and love it to wear them when i go out or around the house they are very pretty and people love them also ask where i got them i tell them amazon...thanks so much cant wait to get the last one i order then my order is complete thanks again....:)</li>

            <li> Pretty hair bow. Great to wear doesn&#x27;t hold much hair. But other than that pretty little hair bow nice and</li>
            <li> much smaller than I thought the jewelry was nice the clip for the hair was cheap again i making this into a pin though, but if you plan on using it for a hair clip it wont hold up with repeated use...</li>
            <li> my friend like it a lot that I ending up giving her this precious peacock :(  ♡♡&lt;br /&gt;looks really pretty.</li>
            <li> The peacock is beautiful and has great sparkle. It&#x27;s much smaller than I expected, but I&#x27;m still pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the style. It&#x27;s so nice to wear either morning or nice. Color is beautiful. I wish I bough 3 more of these hair clips.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy, soft metal, hardly closes at all. The barrette is small (2.5 - 3 inches long), more like for little girls and pale. Gets lost in the hairdo. And I don&#x27;t think yellow metal compliments the blue in the rhinestones. A waist.</li>
            <li> these are beautiful hair barrettes.. will receive many compliments on them.. they hold securely in your hair</li>
            <li> It arrived a late, but it could have been because we had a couple of snow days. So I filed a claim, and they got back to me within a couple hours. However the next day my hair clip had arrived. Although it was late, it is very cute and it certainly does not look like it cost $.99. It is a little smaller than expected but it&#x27;s the perfect size for my head/hair. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> very nice for give away party gifts</li>
            <li> Colorful piece.  Nice weight.</li>
            <li> I am thinking of buying a third brooch because these are so stylish and bedazzled. The design is amazing and i am always getting compliments.  They make any hair style look polished and finished.</li>
            <li> I bought a pair last month and start to use them on each side of my 8 years old.  They look good and so far no problems on the stones or the snap parts.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful piece of hair jewelry, especially for the price.  I deducted one star for each of the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is not nearly as large as one of the pictures makes it look.  I am a grown woman with very small hands and the length of the item barely spans my 4 fingers held tightly together.  The depth/height of the item is also proportionately less.  The picture shown on Amazon must have utilized a child&#x27;s hand or a very tiny Oriental to make it look larger.  Smaller is fine.....I will still use it......and would have still purchased it with an accurate measurement given.  In fact, the seller needs to add measurements to his descriptions to avoid such mis-perceptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  It is NOT a hair CLIP, which was the reason I bought it.  It is a barrette.  I was specifically NOT looking for barrettes....only for clips.  I would not have bought it if an accurate label for the product had been used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey!  It was inexpensive, had free shipping, is pretty, and will be worn!  This review is mostly intended as constructive criticism for the seller.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty!  I received a lot of compliments on this item. Love it a lot! Petite and great for holding hair out of eyes.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! A bit smaller then I expected but works fine even on thick hair. Gorgeous color and style in this clip.</li>
            <li> Very pretty hair clip however it doesn&#x27;t clip right. Very hard to get it to unclamp. I really like it just wish it worked.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s really cheap in all but it nothing but garbage it all broken poor material keep your money people</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these several times in several colors as presents and everyone LOVES them, small but makes a statement alone.</li>
            <li> Its too small for my hair. I have very thick curly hair and it kinda got lost in it. Its was a great pruce however,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and my middle school age daughter loved it, for all of about 5 days after her birthday.  Part of the clasp broke off.  I am good at fixing things, soldering, and everything, but this is a very delicate piece of cheap material.</li>
            <li> the stones are bright and clear.  The clasp is simple.  i have seen reviews that said the clasp broke.  even if it did I&#x27;d find a way to glue a bobby pin to this, it&#x27;s so beautiful.  A steal at the price.</li>
            <li> Pretty! &#x3D;)  Very bright cyan rhinestones &amp; the gold metal really sets them off!</li>
            <li> Very small, but cute.  A little more copper than gold.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t even want to give it one star to be honest. I was sent a crappy rusty peacock necklace, not the hair pin i expected. And it took about two months to get here. not worth it.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is so pretty!! It was a little smaller than I thought it would be, but I&#x27;m still able to get great use out of it! It&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;barrette&amp;#34; size than a hair clip. I complimented on it all the time...</li>
            <li> very cute addition to any outfit, especially in darker colored hair. the only thing was it took forever to arrive and the back clip was flimsy. easy fix, just bend the two prongs holding the piece that goes into your hair. i would buy again.</li>
            <li> Battery is prettier in person than in the picture, but too small, particularly if you have thick or long hair.  I recommend buying two.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but heavy. Does not work for fine hair.</li>
            <li> it was a little too small, but very nice. got alot of compliments on it. its very pretty. thank you</li>
            <li> The part holds your hair is hard to clip together. It can only hold very little hair. But it looks like the picture. It is pretty.</li>
            <li> Beautiful,  I bought these for my daughters&#x27; hair. The price is cheap but the quality is awesome! Love love love!</li>
            <li> I dont wear it that much becuse I love it so much it is the perfect size no to big so its not gaudy</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a blue Peacock, with different colored rhinestones in it. When it arrived all of the rhinestones were the same color with the one exception of the black eye. I really thought it was going to have two different color rhinestones in it, according to the picture. Also the metal in the clip is a very bright goldtone color which almost overpowers the color of the teal rhinestones. I thought the metal was more of a subdued color, even silver, but that&#x27;s not what I received. The clip on the back is like a standard barrette which snaps shut with a clasp. I will wear it on occasion anyway, but it&#x27;s really not what I thought I was going to be getting. Also it does ship directly from China, the delivery time took up to a month to receive it.</li>
            <li> Gotten so many compliments from this piece. It will take up few weeks to arrive but for the price it&#x27;s def worth waiting for. For sure does not look like the amount you paid for. :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful in person. So worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are a little bit different and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> Broke the same day of delivery</li>
            <li> Made very well.Stays in your hair</li>
            <li> This clip is pretty, but it didn&#x27;t come in silver, it was gold tone. Which I didn&#x27;t like. And the clip must be for very thin hair. My hair is not really thick and still couldn&#x27;t get the clasp to stay closed to be able to wear it. Likes the color of stones, But overall, Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> this Peacock hair clip was beautiful! I bought it for my daughter to wear in her long dark hair. It looked wonderful and sparkled like diamonds!</li>
            <li> I got it for my daughter and she loves it. Cute, flashy in a elegant way, and stays in hair quite nicely. Also none of the rhinestones have fallen out! Im always worried about rhinestone stuff.</li>
            <li> Very pretty-pretty fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought several styles from this vendor.  This one is smaller than the others, a barette, yet plenty of sparkle without taking over the whole side of your head. These are very nice hair clips, great quality.  They were well packaged in protective bubble wrapping. Not a single stone was loose or missing.  No obvious flaws or visable glue. Product was delivered sooner than I expected it.  Excellent price for quality products, these are just perfect.  I will be getting more</li>
            <li> I wear this a lot, get complements on it often</li>
            <li> very flimsy and fell apart in 2 days.</li>
            <li> Nice for price but kind cheap looking</li>
            <li> goldtone is very brassy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;clip does not close easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my 6 year old son wanted to give this to his &amp;#34;girlfriend&amp;#34;  in class.  It is not really appropriate for much more than costume, dress-up pretend or 6 year old gifting :)  The &amp;#34;girlfriend&amp;#34; was delighted and she is 6 years old.  If you are older than preteen, you may not be so overwhelmed.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is lovely. Colors are great and will go with several outfits. Beware though, like most costume jewelry sometime the beads and &amp;#34;jewels&amp;#34; come out. Just save them and reglue them back in. Great clip!</li>
            <li> I have bought these in several colors they really come faster that predicted and they will hold as much or as little hair as you want them too</li>
            <li> Love this hair clips because is the perfect size, not too big and not too small, the color is nice and the price is great, they are very expensive everywhere, so it&#x27;s a great saver and looks really cute on the hair...</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful piece. The metal is beautiful and the blue jewels are just stunning. I was so pleased with this I just can&#x27;t tell you. This is one I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with. Oh, and something we noticed is it is beautiful with every color hair.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to receive this hair pin in a good condition (like the picture shows). Sometimes product doesn&#x27;t match the description, or the pictures deceiving. Though, one thing was different than the picture: the stones aren&#x27;t bicolor, - they&#x27;re all one color, something like turquoise (it&#x27;s shown in the picture). It doesn&#x27;t have white or blue additional stones, but just these. I still love it, they look realistic, not like cheap plastic you may see in the stores sometimes. I don&#x27;t know how long it will last for me, the outside is plastic, but the clip itself is metal, so only time can show it.</li>
            <li> This little clip is adorable. My daughter loves peacocks and really liked this crystal clip. It is just as described, and the crystals are nice and sparkly, in two different shades of blue. It took a little longer than expected for shipping, but the product itself is nice and worth waiting for. This could look great with dressy outfits, or a prom dress, but looks just fine with jeans, too. It adds a little extra sparkle and holds the hair well. It is a little bit small, but is meant for ornamentation rather than, say a ponytail clip. It&#x27;s just great and made a nice little gift.</li>
            <li> beautiful and well made, it stays in place and I have received many compliments</li>
            <li> Well made an beautiful.</li>
            <li> was gorgeous with her prom dress.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Breaks easily. . Not made for adults hair.</li>
            <li> very pretty starts to tarnish only wear a couple times if you wanted to look the same took a month to get here</li>
            <li> Nice little hair clip</li>
            <li> I bought two of them so I could have on on each side.  They are smaller barettes, so they work well on thinning hair.</li>
            <li> This is a decent quality barrette with a perfectly lovely peacock on it. I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I would never actually use this in my hair. but our house is decorate with peacock stuff so I put in a glass vase and it looks nice enough.</li>
            <li> Cute hair clip at a great price !!!This clip isn&#x27;t to big or to heavy . It&#x27;s the perfect little accessory .</li>
            <li> ended up giving these away my mom fell in love with them. I am going to have to order me some more</li>
            <li> I waited about a week before of use, before I gave this review. I recieved all 32 items claw clips I ordered. They were packaged with extreme care. I examined each clip and was amazed at how gorgeous they were. The photos do them absolutely no justice! I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories. Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job. I&#x27;ve been using metal hair clips for over 15 years. These clips are high quality, hands down. The pricing is extemely reasonable. I truly have gotten my monies worth and then some. I would recommend this product to anyone, before going to a mall paying the outrageous prices. If I could rate this product any higher, I would!!!</li>
            <li> So sparkly and beautiful and the price was excellent.  Got here way ahead of schedule.  Love it!!  got so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Took three weeks for this hairclip to show up. Was large enough for an adult,but not same color or as pretty as the picture. Bought to wear in my wedding and showed up day before wedding . Pretty enough to wear,but it all turquoise blue gems and brighter yellow gold color than thought. Still gonna wear it in my wedding but wish it looked exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this item to be large enough to hold hair back.  It is small, and not glitzy.  I should have realized I was not paying enough to get what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Really pretty for how crazy cheap this clip is! It&#x27;s definitely more yellow gold than the picture shows, but I&#x27;m still glad I got it. Shipping took a little while, but they warned about that ahead of time and I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Cheap, and gems missing.</li>
            <li> It looks so expensive and well-made. I get lots of compliments whenever I wear it on my hair. It looks nice along, or as a topper for a neat pony tail or a bun. Will buy many more !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. For a friend that loves&lt;br /&gt;Peacocks. Was the perfect gift. She loved it. Nice to find a special gift.</li>
            <li> I considered this rating to be so because I actually haven&#x27;t put it in my hair. So I don&#x27;t know how sturdy it is. It is very pretty in person. The gold is bright and the gems sparkle.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair clip, it is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but it looks great and has a very secure hold. I definitely would recommend this to anyone, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Thought it would be much larger than it was as it was photographed in the picture...it is quite small for anyone with long hair.It was pretty though.</li>
            <li> This clip is very pretty however, quite heavy too. Seems very durable. Wish I had seen a picture of the back before ordering as the clip was different from what I had thought. Will be looking for a couple more in different colors.</li>
            <li> Loved! It looked pretty nice in my dark hair, buuuuutttttt... The first day I wore it, a couple hours of school, I had problems getting it to stay it. It kept popping out! Other than that, I liked it.</li>
            <li> THIS IDEM IS ONLY FOR THE WOMAN WHO DESIRES ATTENTION &amp; SERIOUS BLING FACTORS CAUSE IT&#x27;LL GEY YA THE LOOKS &amp; THEN SOME!!! I JUST LOVE IT!  ~</li>
            <li> This is a pretty barrette with a strong clasp.  It could be used in a lot of different ways.  I&#x27;m adding it to my gift giving stash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sparkly and pretty but i only got to wear it 2 or 3 times before the clip came off of the peacock.  appears it would need to be welded on since it&#x27;s metal but I&#x27;m going to have my husband try some JB Weld on it and see if that works.  But hey, for under $2 I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to last forever...just thought I would get more than a couple of uses out of it.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> Looks beyond cheap, couldn&#x27;t even wear it. 25 cent machine bad.</li>
            <li> Nice design at good price, but a little too heavy as it&#x27;s made of molded alloy</li>
            <li> This was everything I expected it to be from seeing the pic when I ordered it. Was extremely pleased when I received it.</li>
            <li> This pin is beautiful. It looks exactly like the picture, except that the aqua blue stones are brighter. I love it! My only complaint is that me being a lefty, it clips backward for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty, what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am astonished by some of the reviews here. This piece is very nice and is just as pictured. Why would one buy something they already don&#x27;t like??? Anyway our little girl loves it and that&#x27;s all I care about. I&#x27;m going to get some more of these form the same shipper. Good quality ESPECIALLY for the price.</li>
            <li> While the real thing does look &#x27;cheaper&#x27; than the photo presented, for the price it&#x27;s a great hair clip. It&#x27;s fake little crystals sparkle wildly, and are all placed where they should be.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, the lucky recipient, was thrilled and has worn it pretty much daily without any ill effects to the barrette clip part or the sparkles.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s a spring barrette, which I like because it really helps keep it in her hair.</li>
            <li> Very Nice hair piece &amp; the price was right. The color stands out. Easy on / off as well. My daughter enjoys it!</li>
            <li> It is a cute hair clasp. One my daughter finds lovely, and that is all that matters. For the price combined with the speedy shipment, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> The clip arrived in a small, bubble-wrapped envelope. It was just as it appears on the website &amp; is even prettier in real life. The clip mechanism is of good quality &amp; the overall quality is more than I expected for the price...certainly better than anything I have found in local stores &amp; much more unique. It is shipped from Hong Kong &amp; so takes a while to receive for international processing reasons, but the expected delivery date range is accurate. I bought it for my 8-year-old niece &amp; she went bananas. She has a full head of thick, medium-length, wavy hair &amp; the clip holds securely without snarling in the peacock tail (even if she affixes it herself).</li>
            <li> Before I even wore it, a stone slipped out.  Crazy glued it back on (along with some others for safe keeping) and... I love it.  Love the blue hues and it looks great on my daughter too!</li>
            <li> Look at the photos, and you&#x27;ll see the size. It is not huge - it is dainty and pretty. It is a clip-in accessory. Very pretty!</li>
