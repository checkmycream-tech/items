            <li>guide on the bristles to show the perfect amount of toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>They are awesome!</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are great!  </li>
            <li>they are awesome and you can use the OralB app as a tooth brush character that matches the tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the Subscribe &amp; Save value.</li>
            <li>Great size for my 18 month girl</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great to stock up.  </li>
            <li>The multi-pack is great for when she chews the bristles (which if often) and I need to replace it.</li>
            <li>These are great.</li>
            <li>These have a great design.</li>
            <li>The multi-pack is great for when he chews the bristles</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great size and material for the handle, good shape head, and</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>The price is good.</li>
            <li>I will very gladly purchase again .</li>
            <li>I looked both online and in stores; I&#x27;m so glad I found these!</li>
            <li>I like them better than the toothbrushes they sell for dogs, and they are a better quality for the cost.  </li>
            <li>the variety pack needs more variety.</li>
            <li>We love Minnie &amp; Mickey everything at grandmas</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;m satisfied with these brushes and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, for what I can find at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>However, wish the designs varied more and there were more options.  </li>
            <li>cute.</li>
            <li>And FWIW, the character features is both Minnie and Mickey, not just Minnie, making it a more gender-neutral option (if you care about that sort of thing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think I got way more &amp;#34;boy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If your kid is a Winnie the Pooh fan, these will be a hit :)  </li>
            <li>Oh, could be better priced also.</li>
            <li>And having a quality toothbrush with pictures of her favorite cartoon characters make it even more enjoyable for her.  </li>
            <li>I wish the pack had more variety in colors</li>
            <li>The grip on a toothbrush for this purpose is kind of important, as you might imagine; these are easy to hold and manipulate.</li>
            <li>The children love the characters and the grip is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>The compact head is a perfect fit for my toddler&#x27;s mouth, and it&#x27;s easy to access the back teeth.</li>
            <li>These are great toothbrushes for my 2yr old son.</li>
            <li>Need more variety to keep the kids excited about brushing.  </li>
            <li>but like I said, for the value, better than spending $4 a toothbrush elsewhere when they go through them fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The size of the head is perfect for little mouths and teeth.  </li>
            <li>By far the best toothbrush we have used so far, including the baby ones.</li>
            <li>I can clean all of her teeth relatively easily with this brush.</li>
            <li>This whole 6 pack will last us awhile and was an excellent price.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine, they still clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is a good size and shape for my 16 mo old, but the bristles come apart right away.  </li>
            <li>very nice&lt;br /&gt;baby love this toothbrush</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a schipperke, and they fit his mouth pretty well, and they are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect size for he to learn to brush herself a need big enough for my hands that I can brush her teeth too.</li>
            <li>Our son likes to chew on his toothbrush, so we go through them fairly quickly, and ordering the multi-pack is the way to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They have very soft bristles and the handle is perfect for little hands to grip.  </li>
            <li>works great with little hands.</li>
            <li>Great quality for little mouths.</li>
            <li>My daughter is fascinated with the sound but isn&#x27;t ready to use one just yet.</li>
            <li>My daughter is at the age where she is starting to brush her own teeth.  </li>
            <li>are the right size for a child&#x27;s mouth.  </li>
            <li>The handle is nicely rounded yet chunky, and easy to grip for my toddler as well as big enough for my hands so that I can brush her teeth when needed.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;d be good for little hands.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are the perfect size for my 2 year old, and big enough that my older kids (ages 9 and 6) can use them as well.  </li>
            <li>My tot is still  on his first one after 8 weeks.  </li>
            <li>All the bristles are coming out in the first use.</li>
            <li>The bristles hold up OK,  wish they lasted longer for my constant biter</li>
            <li>I only wish there were more colors.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks and it works great so far.</li>
            <li>This is very small, perfect for younger kids below 5.</li>
            <li>These kids toothbrushes work well, the only downside is that purchasing 6 at one time was not all that cheap.</li>
            <li>It looks very pretty！My girl loves it！</li>
            <li>It would be easier to clean an uncooperative toddler&#x27;s teeth with a larger head.</li>
            <li>Could be better if it had a slightly wider head like the stage 1 brush but still works well.</li>
            <li>My only issue with them is that my kids go through them too quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are really high quality.</li>
            <li>Tried several others before my son&#x27;s pediatric dentist recommended this one, I love it, the right length, the brush is not too stiff nor too soft, I had used them since then.</li>
            <li>I often get the feeling that baby and kids products are highly overpriced, leaving parents with little options but to pay out of the pocket for their little loved ones.</li>
            <li>I also wish the head on this stage 2 toothbrush was a little bigger, more like the stage 1.  </li>
            <li>My 2 year old daughter can pull the bristles out with her teeth with no strain.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft on her gums but not so soft that the bristles can&#x27;t remove plaque build-up..</li>
            <li>soft bristles.</li>
            <li>kids ruin them fast, they don&#x27;t last longer than 1month.</li>
            <li>the curve is just right for parent to brush the little one&#x27;s teeth, which is still the case in our house for our 2-year-old.</li>
            <li>In addition, I need a toddler brush for myself - I am a new denture wearer and find the the bristles on regular toothbrushes are too hard, plus the smaller head on these allows me to clean my dentures</li>
            <li>He does chew on his brush a little, but not a lot, and other brushes we&#x27;ve used haven&#x27;t come apart so easily.  </li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t fall for the whole pink is girls and blue is boys nonsense.  </li>
            <li>Too soft and don&#x27;t last long enough.</li>

            <li> I love these toothbrushes for my two year old, but I got sick of buying them at Target every week because he likes to throw them in protest of brushing his teeth.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, as long as they do the job.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll be sticking with these brushes for a long time.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using these since my kids were a little younger than two</li>
            <li> It was hard to find a toothbrush for the 2-4 year old age group.</li>
            <li> I purchased this 2x already and both times go the Mickey design and all of them were red toothbrushes with 1 green.  </li>
            <li> Minimal packaging, just as i like it.</li>
            <li> I understand product may vary, but is it really that hard to let us choose the character or at least send a mix?</li>
            <li> and I dont feel bad throwing them away when she chews on them because they were cheap compared to other characters.</li>
            <li> These are less durable than average.</li>
            <li> I just feel it can be a little softer.</li>
            <li> the little one loves the pooh / tigger print.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s thrown it there and no amount preparation can prevent an angry defiant two year old.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the stars, I&#x27;m in between 2 and 3.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> Just 1 toothbrush, very expensive!!!</li>

            <li> I bought these for my dog. He&#x27;s a schipperke, and they fit his mouth pretty well, and they are nice and soft. I like them better than the toothbrushes they sell for dogs, and they are a better quality for the cost.  The grip on a toothbrush for this purpose is kind of important, as you might imagine; these are easy to hold and manipulate. I think they&#x27;d be good for little hands.</li>
            <li> We purchased these toothbrushes after our two-year old chewed through a couple of those Red Cross/First Year toothbrushes after only a few uses. We&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks and it works great so far. I will return with an update if they start to fall apart or anything. But there is no indication of that yet. And in case you&#x27;re wondering what color combo we received, it was NOT a variety - they were all one color (blue/green for us). Also, the product description is incorrect. These toothbrushes are in no way battery powered, and I don&#x27;t think I would expect them to be at this price.</li>
            <li> These kids toothbrushes work well, the only downside is that purchasing 6 at one time was not all that cheap. I often get the feeling that baby and kids products are highly overpriced, leaving parents with little options but to pay out of the pocket for their little loved ones.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a good size and shape for my 16 mo old, but the bristles come apart right away.  He does chew on his brush a little, but not a lot, and other brushes we&#x27;ve used haven&#x27;t come apart so easily.  These are less durable than average.</li>
            <li> These are all &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34; toothbrushes. the variety pack needs more variety.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughter can pull the bristles out with her teeth with no strain.  Very disappointing. We will be using a different brand</li>
            <li> My tot is still  on his first one after 8 weeks.  Longest lasting one so far as he&#x27;s tried several brands that lasted about a few days and had bristle issues like fraying and coming off.  Not this one.  This whole 6 pack will last us awhile and was an excellent price.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. All the bristles are coming out in the first use. Will never buy this again. Junk. Junk Junk</li>
            <li> This is very small, perfect for younger kids below 5.</li>
            <li> Great size for my 18 month girl and she enjoys brushing her teeth... I just feel it can be a little softer.</li>
            <li> We love Minnie &amp; Mickey everything at grandmas</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes for my two year old, but I got sick of buying them at Target every week because he likes to throw them in protest of brushing his teeth.  In the toilet, garbage can, basement steps. You name it he&#x27;s thrown it there and no amount preparation can prevent an angry defiant two year old.  Enter this ginormous pack of toothbrushes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have very soft bristles and the handle is perfect for little hands to grip.  The size of the head is perfect for little mouths and teeth.  There&#x27;s also a &amp;#34;bullseye&amp;#34; guide on the bristles to show the perfect amount of toothpaste!  It&#x27;s PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are essentially unisex.  Although I don&#x27;t fall for the whole pink is girls and blue is boys nonsense.  My only annoyance is with the kids toothbrush market overall and the need to peddle products (Disney/Nickelodeon) to my child.  I just don&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t have a toothbrush with no cartoon character on it.  (Yes, I&#x27;m THAT mom.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m satisfied with these brushes and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, for what I can find at a reasonable price.  However, wish the designs varied more and there were more options.  I purchased this 2x already and both times go the Mickey design and all of them were red toothbrushes with 1 green.  Need more variety to keep the kids excited about brushing.  The bristles hold up OK,  wish they lasted longer for my constant biter but like I said, for the value, better than spending $4 a toothbrush elsewhere when they go through them fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> My kids have used these for years.  They like the characters and the brushes are the right size for a child&#x27;s mouth.  The price is good.</li>
            <li> These are great toothbrushes for my 2yr old son. I understand product may vary, but is it really that hard to let us choose the character or at least send a mix? We got all Minnie Mouse. Oh well</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using these since my kids were a little younger than two and they are now 3+.  I have twins so it&#x27;s great to stock up.  You might get maybe only two colors but the characters are different so you don&#x27;t mix toothbrushes up if you have multiple children.</li>
            <li> Too soft and don&#x27;t last long enough. I won&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use a Sonicare electric toothbrush for our dental care. My daughter is fascinated with the sound but isn&#x27;t ready to use one just yet. So in the meantime, she uses this toothbrush.    I like the design of the Oral-B Pro-Health Stages toothbrush. The handle is nicely rounded yet chunky, and easy to grip for my toddler as well as big enough for my hands so that I can brush her teeth when needed. The compact head is a perfect fit for my toddler&#x27;s mouth, and it&#x27;s easy to access the back teeth. The bristles are soft on her gums but not so soft that the bristles can&#x27;t remove plaque build-up.. The multi-pack is great for when she chews the bristles (which if often) and I need to replace it.</li>
            <li> These are great. The children love the characters and the grip is easy to hold. These have a great design.</li>
            <li> My kid loves his toothbrush!  They are small enough for his little mouth (he&#x27;s 2) and easy to hold on to. The multi-pack is great for when he chews the bristles and I need to replace it.</li>
            <li> very nice&lt;br /&gt;baby love this toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;he like play with it</li>
            <li> cute. get the job done</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these toothbrushes. They are the perfect size for he to learn to brush herself a need big enough for my hands that I can brush her teeth too.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find a toothbrush for the 2-4 year old age group. I looked both online and in stores; I&#x27;m so glad I found these! They are awesome! Great size and material for the handle, good shape head, and the curve is just right for parent to brush the little one&#x27;s teeth, which is still the case in our house for our 2-year-old. And FWIW, the character features is both Minnie and Mickey, not just Minnie, making it a more gender-neutral option (if you care about that sort of thing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are really high quality. By far the best toothbrush we have used so far, including the baby ones.</li>
            <li> soft bristles. my kids like it.</li>
            <li> My toddlers dentist gives these brushes out. I can clean all of her teeth relatively easily with this brush.</li>
            <li> works great with little hands. the little one loves the pooh / tigger print.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes and so do my kids.  I only wish there were more colors.  I have one boy and one girl and I think I got way more &amp;#34;boy&amp;#34; colors than &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34; colors.  Oh well, as long as they do the job.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are great!  If your kid is a Winnie the Pooh fan, these will be a hit :)  Our son likes to chew on his toothbrush, so we go through them fairly quickly, and ordering the multi-pack is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Just 1 toothbrush, very expensive!!! Thought it would come as 6 pack.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Could be better if it had a slightly wider head like the stage 1 brush but still works well.</li>
            <li> Great quality for little mouths. My only issue with them is that my kids go through them too quickly. Oh, could be better priced also.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these and I dont feel bad throwing them away when she chews on them because they were cheap compared to other characters.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the stars, I&#x27;m in between 2 and 3.&lt;br /&gt;My kids ruin them fast, they don&#x27;t last longer than 1month.</li>
            <li> My daughter is at the age where she is starting to brush her own teeth.  And having a quality toothbrush with pictures of her favorite cartoon characters make it even more enjoyable for her.  Now she asks to brush her teeth multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> We ended up with Mickey and Mini brushes- they are awesome and you can use the OralB app as a tooth brush character that matches the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my toddler who brushes his teeth once a day for 2 minutes. Each brush lasts about a month. He also gets the same brush from our pediatric dentist. I&#x27;m very happy with the Subscribe &amp; Save value. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with bristles falling out except when I catch my son chewing on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son has sensory processing issues, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of brushes, including battery powered brushes, but the noise and the vibration of those bother him. We&#x27;ll be sticking with these brushes for a long time.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are the perfect size for my 2 year old, and big enough that my older kids (ages 9 and 6) can use them as well.  In addition, I need a toddler brush for myself - I am a new denture wearer and find the the bristles on regular toothbrushes are too hard, plus the smaller head on these allows me to clean my dentures better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting this pack of 6 works - one for each of us plus a couple extras.  I will very gladly purchase again .</li>
            <li> Great product. Minimal packaging, just as i like it.</li>
            <li> It looks very pretty！My girl loves it！</li>
            <li> Tried several others before my son&#x27;s pediatric dentist recommended this one, I love it, the right length, the brush is not too stiff nor too soft, I had used them since then.</li>
            <li> I wish the pack had more variety in colors--we didn&#x27;t get all the colors shown in the pic.  That&#x27;s fine, they still clean teeth.  I also wish the head on this stage 2 toothbrush was a little bigger, more like the stage 1.  It would be easier to clean an uncooperative toddler&#x27;s teeth with a larger head.</li>
            <li> What can you say? It is a toothbrush afer all for kids.  Let me expound on the ergonomics?  or maybe the color?</li>
