            <li>known by the price it was too good to be true</li>

            <li>I suggest you get more than 1 pack.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d strongly recommend them if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive way to change your look. :)</li>

            <li>but my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>and i love them!Real hair and super soft!Was</li>
            <li>Nice extensions, they curl, they feel like real hair.</li>
            <li>I order the extensions thinking they are real hair, they are nice and I can use them but wanted them</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a bunch of cheap hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though it&#x27;s a great product especially for the price!</li>
            <li>These extensions are cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>, these were cheap</li>
            <li>These extensions feel like a cheap synthetic wig does.</li>
            <li>not at all 100% human hair please be honest when selling your product as we are honest giving you our moneyðŸ’µ</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing and actually owning an extensions for a good price, so I was very excited to receive it!</li>
            <li>Although the hair was beautiful,  it was not ready to wear.</li>
            <li>but I can tell it&#x27;s going to be worth it!</li>
            <li>and it looks good with the deep purple I have now.</li>
            <li>my full refund</li>
            <li>At first they were fine for my daughter then all of a studded the clips kept on falling off</li>
            <li>so so super thin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>super quick</li>
            <li>Would be good to add fullness to already long hair.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was good oroduct</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to order these hair extensions because the deal just seemed too good to be true but they absolutely met up to my expectations!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend Sally&#x27;s extensions, they give volume, length, able to curl and are a lot thicker than these I ordered.  </li>
            <li>But other than that I love it!</li>
            <li>They were exactly the color I wanted and the correct length it said.</li>
            <li>Nice one and very sturdy and long</li>
            <li>My first time getting extensions</li>
            <li>I love this Extensions, I have short hair!</li>
            <li>i give this rating because the item is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I will add that it&#x27;s not my first rodeo with extensions</li>
            <li>and they smelled funny after wearing them twice</li>
            <li>They look exactly like the picture and have a little golden string on the package that&#x27;s super cute</li>
            <li>But they tangle very fast wich makes the extension loose hair some more when you bruch it out</li>
            <li>They are not 100% real hair, they damaged with one use, very thin, length is perfect tho.</li>
            <li>I just know which one will last longer and won&#x27;t come apart easily...</li>
            <li>but I have so much hair</li>
            <li>I had been really looking forward to the arrival of this product just to find that it is not what had been promised.</li>
            <li>It also seems like it&#x27;s not made of genuine human hair.</li>
            <li>I just received a glob of hair all ATTATCHED in one whole piece.</li>
            <li>so I could have them curled or straight</li>
            <li>I also appreciated the fact that my seller took the time to add a letter with contact info in case there were any issues with the hair</li>
            <li>r feel a bit real....</li>
            <li>/&gt;the Price is very competitive also</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even real hair I tried curling them and they practically melted on my curling iron.</li>
            <li>but i fixed that by buying a weft and gluing more hair onto the back, I also ordered 22&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Definitely human hair, easy installation, sturdy clips, promising length, and very soft- even after straightening them!</li>
            <li>I have purchased $80 extensions from Sally&#x27;s before as well as from other places and wasn&#x27;t too satisfied, these are way better quality, by far the best extensions I have ever owned.100% human hair and one pack was enough as I have thin hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty new to the extension world</li>
            <li>Very soft and the color exactly matched my hair...</li>
            <li>Stringy, fine, hardly enough to look natural.</li>
            <li>It had a strong chemical smell when I took it out of the package and the clips aren&#x27;t sewn in very well compared to other sets of extensions</li>
            <li>Extensions were not the quality expected, hair falls out easily and the clips do not hold well.  </li>
            <li>I will more than likely not be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li>but because they are not real human hair will not be able to curl them or use a flat iron.</li>
            <li>If your looking for extensions just to  wear them a few times these are ok.</li>
            <li>The hair is a good quality, but it&#x27;s really thin.</li>
            <li>The pic I attached, the left extension is part of the hair extension set I purchased at Sally&#x27;s; the right is from this online seller.</li>
            <li>only about 3 strands of hair are the actual full length.</li>
            <li>so if you are buying them for the first time make sure to get 2-3 packs because a lot of extensions they sell online are thin.</li>
            <li>I would need actually like two packs of this to look like my hair is longer and the aspect of the hair is real.</li>
            <li>so I decided to get my natural color</li>
            <li>The texture is so soft.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised of how well this extensions was</li>
            <li>&amp; they blend so naturally to my hair.</li>
            <li>Nice color but way too thin</li>
            <li>Well, first of all I ordered dark brown to match my first pair of dark brown extensions, and these are more of a black brown.</li>
            <li>I got 18 inch extensions and ther were thin but perfect for dyeing and adding color not good for length or volume</li>
            <li>The extension strands are thin, tangle up and break easily!</li>
            <li>They are real human hair , suppppper soft !</li>
            <li>Once my package arrived I could clearly see they were human hair</li>
            <li>Very soft and long.</li>

            <li> Once my package arrived I could clearly see they were human hair</li>
            <li> Very soft and long.</li>
            <li> One improvement is if the seller allowed more density options because 70 g is very thin...</li>
            <li> not a good buy... spend a little more somewhere else</li>
            <li> My other extensions, which are remy, are soft and shiny, but not overly shiny.</li>
            <li> No clips 1 long piece of hair would have to cut into individual strips total</li>
            <li> and if you look at the top it looks like over half of the hair has broken off of the seam.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not entirely sure if the hair is real because I curled one and it worked</li>
            <li> I can use a flat iron on them with no problem!!</li>
            <li> inches and they are only 18&amp;#34; and the ends are really thin and the clips are coming off and are poorly put together, save your money to get a better pair!</li>
            <li> NOT REAL REMY HUMAN HAIR!</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The hair was just like I expected it and came with extra clips.</li>
            <li> These arrived two days earlier then expected!</li>
            <li> Thinking about dying to match the new color but not sure yet!</li>
            <li> The only thing is some of the wefts are a lot thinner than others and messily sewn together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never worn clip in hair extensions so not much to compare to</li>
            <li> Hair was really thin and didn&#x27;t hold a curl and wasn&#x27;t 100% real hair</li>
            <li> The ones I purchased here online were supposedly 18 inches, which do not look 18 inches in comparison to my other extensions...  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Arrived a lot sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to wear them after I dye my hair and other extensions to match.</li>
            <li> Even for normal hair it was to thin.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with that and recommend you order from a different company.</li>
            <li> Quite thin like other reviewers were saying but still blends in well and looks natural.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not right to take advantage of people.</li>
            <li> I ordered a dark brown and got a reddish medium brown.</li>
            <li> but I bought two packs in Dark Brown.</li>
            <li> Once the extensions came in, I purchase a dark brown 18inch.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth all the wait</li>
            <li> I got dark brown</li>
            <li> These were to thin for my hair not no were near my hair color</li>
            <li> They were way too thin and didn&#x27;t look natural at all.</li>
            <li> and frequently get extensions that dont match how thin my hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing a lot of people saying they aren&#x27;t thick enough.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you get dark brown, expect black.</li>
            <li> I received it in less than 2 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> cons are that the hair is thin - you need 2 packages for the whole head or 3 if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I was worried after reading some of the reviews for this product by a different seller that I would receive fake hair instead of human hair.</li>
            <li> so i decided to buy another set and paid a bit less for these.</li>
            <li> Was pretty disappointing from what I received...</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is its a little thin and the strands tend to fall out some.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> i read the reviews about it being thin.. or needing an extra set.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> Really really thin, and has too much white hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I opened up the package to discover that one of the clips was broken so that entire section wont stay in by itself.</li>
            <li> Seemed really thin for 70 g which is what I normally get since I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy and a little bit too shiny.</li>
            <li> They are very thin and would only match the thickness of about half of my head.</li>
            <li> Very little hair</li>
            <li> I really feel so frustrated about it.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at ALL.</li>
            <li> Horrible cheap!</li>
            <li> Overall the quality of the extensions wasn&#x27;t as bad as what I expected, except of having to see some of the hairs cut off in 7pcs of the extensions...</li>
            <li> it was so thin not worth</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re on a budget, have thin hair and want a little bit of volume, then these will work for you.  </li>
            <li> (they are a little too thin)</li>
            <li> rip off had to give a star but needs to be negative 5</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t false advertise something and rip people off and expect not to get in trouble I will be filing a claim if I don&#x27;t get what I paid for or</li>
            <li> Beware though if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very thin, fine, brittle, poorly packaged and smell bad.</li>
            <li> but I mean you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> The clips aren&#x27;t sewed in very tight, and they&#x27;re thin, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had such a bad experience with them</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t expect salon quality, but upon receiving them I was disappointed to see they were not only SYNTHETIC HAIR</li>
            <li> These set of extensions are thin and get thinner towards the ends of the hair strands.  </li>
            <li> did not like the hair, way to thin and the clips did not work well at all.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thin</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re some what thin</li>
            <li> Would recemended getting two packs, kinda thin.</li>
            <li> All hair extentions are fairly thin.</li>
            <li> Also the hair is really thin</li>
            <li> but they look fake to me.</li>
            <li> well so you can&#x27;t tell if they&#x27;re fake.</li>
            <li> fake doesn&#x27;t  even look</li>
            <li> Poor product!</li>
            <li> but they were also the wrong color and hair</li>
            <li> I bought a different set of remy hair from another seller on amazon and the difference between those extensions and these extensions is insane.</li>
            <li> Very thin.</li>
            <li> i have very very thin hair.</li>
            <li> they are very thin but suite the purpose of length.</li>
            <li> Very very thin.</li>
            <li> These are horrible, I&#x27;ve worn extensions for a long time</li>
            <li> Horrible, sheds toooooooo much, just so freaking annoying.</li>
            <li> Put together very sloppy.</li>
            <li> Disappointed too thin on ends</li>
            <li> They are very thin, and very fake looking.</li>
            <li> Smells weird!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin and stringy and looks awful.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I will keep them because they will work to add length to my hair :-(</li>
            <li> : ( very disappointing.</li>
            <li> So here, it&#x27;s a very disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> This piece of crap didn&#x27;t even come with clips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like these clip in hair extensions because there easy to put in and very comfortable to wear and they look and feel like my own hair.</li>
            <li> I did read the reviews before purchase.  I received the extensions 2 days before estimated date which was great!  The package was doubled and well put together.  These set of extensions are thin and get thinner towards the ends of the hair strands.  I had purchased a hair extension set at Sally Beauty for about $130 14 inches but I wanted longer extensions for lesser money.  You do get what you paid for.  The ones I purchased here online were supposedly 18 inches, which do not look 18 inches in comparison to my other extensions...  I would definitely recommend Sally&#x27;s extensions, they give volume, length, able to curl and are a lot thicker than these I ordered.  But if you&#x27;re on a budget, have thin hair and want a little bit of volume, then these will work for you.  Other than that, I plan on incorporating and sewing some of these 18 inch extensions with my 14 inch extensions.  In which this works for me. The pic I attached, the left extension is part of the hair extension set I purchased at Sally&#x27;s; the right is from this online seller. I just know which one will last longer and won&#x27;t come apart easily...</li>
            <li> I love my extensions!  It matches my hair perfectly. The only problem I have is its a little thin and the strands tend to fall out some.  If you have thick hair it&#x27;s best to buy a second set.  I had to buy two myself. I haven&#x27;t got the second order but I&#x27;m sure it will be better.</li>
            <li> Nice color but way too thin</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them.</li>
            <li> Horrible, sheds toooooooo much, just so freaking annoying. Gets tangled and sheds</li>
            <li> Seemed really thin for 70 g which is what I normally get since I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> you better use this to gain volume but I have so much hair and this extensions did not make the job for my hair. I would need actually like two packs of this to look like my hair is longer and the aspect of the hair is real.</li>
            <li> Although the hair was beautiful,  it was not ready to wear. There were no clips attached as advertised, and it was not sectioned off for placement.  I received one weft of hair and it would have required sewing on clips, which there were none of. So disappointed.  I had been really looking forward to the arrival of this product just to find that it is not what had been promised.</li>
            <li> Extensions were not the quality expected, hair falls out easily and the clips do not hold well.  I will more than likely not be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> I received a package of just hair. No clips.</li>
            <li> Hair was not 70 grams. Thinner than a set of 70 grams I have from a different seller. Hair stuck out in every direction at the weft. Put together very sloppy. Will never buy from this seller again. Waste of time and money. Don&#x27;t get this product.</li>
            <li> Nice extensions, they curl, they feel like real hair. Best set of extensions I ever owned. I recommend them especially for the price.</li>
            <li> All I got was one big piece of hair. Was supposed to be 7 pcs. With clips attached. Got neither. No package slip or anything to return it.</li>
            <li> Stringy, fine, hardly enough to look natural. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So here, it&#x27;s a very disappointing purchase. The extension strands are thin, tangle up and break easily! It also seems like it&#x27;s not made of genuine human hair. I really feel so frustrated about it.</li>
            <li> NOT REAL REMY HUMAN HAIR! ALL SYNTHETIC. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Do not buy these. I ordered a dark brown and got a reddish medium brown. They are very thin and would only match the thickness of about half of my head. I can&#x27;t use them. A complete waste of money. : ( very disappointing.</li>
            <li> ðŸ‘ŽI purchased not one but two and it&#x27;s synthetic hair not at all 100% human hair please be honest when selling your product as we are honest giving you our moneyðŸ’µ</li>
            <li> Very thin. But came in a good amount of time. Quality is ok.</li>
            <li> It would have gotten the 5 stars but I ordered 18&amp;#34; and got 15&amp;#34; . Besides that I love them ! They are real human hair , suppppper soft ! And simply great ! Buy TWO packs ladies :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Aneschka</li>
            <li> Arrived a lot sooner than expected! Very soft and long. They were sold out of the color I recently dyed my hair so I decided to get my natural color and it looks good with the deep purple I have now. I bought 2 packs to add a lot of volume! The only thing is some of the wefts are a lot thinner than others and messily sewn together. But other than that I love it! Thinking about dying to match the new color but not sure yet! Will but again!</li>
            <li> Pissed off. Instead of receiving hair extensions with CLIPS ATTATCHED. I just received a glob of hair all ATTATCHED in one whole piece. Not satisfied at ALL.</li>
            <li> I order the extensions thinking they are real hair, they are nice and I can use them but wanted them so I could have them curled or straight but because they are not real human hair will not be able to curl them or use a flat iron. I will keep them because they will work to add length to my hair :-(</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look like the picture. It had more of a reddish brown in it. Also they didn&#x27;t not have clips already in them. I would need to buy clips at the supply store and sew them in</li>
            <li> The hair was just like I expected it and came with extra clips. I also appreciated the fact that my seller took the time to add a letter with contact info in case there were any issues with the hair</li>
            <li> These were to thin for my hair not no were near my hair color i would order hair off of here again</li>
            <li> The hair was good.. Very soft and the color exactly matched my hair... One improvement is if the seller allowed more density options because 70 g is very thin... Other than that it was good oroduct</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin and stringy and looks awful. only about 3 strands of hair are the actual full length. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> does not come with the clips as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Well, first of all I ordered dark brown to match my first pair of dark brown extensions, and these are more of a black brown. And I&#x27;m not entirely sure if the hair is real because I curled one and it worked but they look fake to me. My hair is thick so that&#x27;s why I bought another set and they do blend in well so you can&#x27;t tell if they&#x27;re fake. I&#x27;m going to wear them after I dye my hair and other extensions to match.</li>
            <li> did not like the hair, way to thin and the clips did not work well at all. the clips kept flipping&lt;br /&gt;because it was so thin not worth the price needs to be thicker or sold with 2 packs instead of one.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectation. Item is different from what&#x27;s posted.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thin but i fixed that by buying a weft and gluing more hair onto the back, I also ordered 22&amp;#34; inches and they are only 18&amp;#34; and the ends are really thin and the clips are coming off and are poorly put together, save your money to get a better pair!</li>
            <li> They were exactly the color I wanted and the correct length it said. I recommend this brand to anyone who is needing extensions</li>
            <li> Disappointed too thin on ends</li>
            <li> great extensions. feels and looks just like my hair</li>
            <li> The texture is so soft. They&#x27;re some what thin but I bought two packs in Dark Brown. They&#x27;re easy to wash and easy with heat products.</li>
            <li> Nice one and very sturdy and long</li>
            <li> If I could give this zero stars I would they sent me synthetic hair I should of known by the price it was too good to be true don&#x27;t false advertise something and rip people off and expect not to get in trouble I will be filing a claim if I don&#x27;t get what I paid for or my full refund it&#x27;s not right to take advantage of people.</li>
            <li> Horrible cheap! Smells weird!</li>
            <li> These arrived two days earlier then expected! My first time getting extensions and i love them!Real hair and super soft!Was able to straighten and curl. Would recemended getting two packs, kinda thin.</li>
            <li> fake doesn&#x27;t  even look r feel a bit real....</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing and actually owning an extensions for a good price, so I was very excited to receive it! Once the extensions came in, I purchase a dark brown 18inch. There were 7pcs in the package and it felt like human hair. I was really surprised of how well this extensions was but as I was looking closely through each piece of extensions, I have noticed that there were some hairs that were cut off... Was pretty disappointing from what I received... Overall the quality of the extensions wasn&#x27;t as bad as what I expected, except of having to see some of the hairs cut off in 7pcs of the extensions...</li>
            <li> Returned these.  They were way too thin and didn&#x27;t look natural at all.</li>
            <li> nice quality goods , promptly shipped and arrived on time for an important occasion.&lt;br /&gt;the Price is very competitive also</li>
            <li> I purchased 15 inch color #04 medium brown and they match my hair perfect! I have purchased $80 extensions from Sally&#x27;s before as well as from other places and wasn&#x27;t too satisfied, these are way better quality, by far the best extensions I have ever owned.100% human hair and one pack was enough as I have thin hair so it was perfect! I will be ordering longer ones for the summer :)</li>
            <li> I would never recommend this to anyone. They are very thin, and very fake looking. It took two months to get to me. Just awful don&#x27;t buy from them.</li>
            <li> They are not 100% real hair, they damaged with one use, very thin, length is perfect tho. But they tangle very fast wich makes the extension loose hair some more when you bruch it out it&#x27;s not worth all the wait but I mean you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> This piece of crap didn&#x27;t even come with clips. It&#x27;s just a bunch of cheap hair</li>
            <li> Quite thin like other reviewers were saying but still blends in well and looks natural. Good for adding length rather than volume as I did with mine but still suitable for both.</li>
            <li> I love this Extensions, I have short hair! &amp; they blend so naturally to my hair.</li>
            <li> For the price these are great quality extensions. I bought medium brown to blend in as lowlights and I&#x27;ve received tons of compliments! I received it in less than 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are that the hair is thin - you need 2 packages for the whole head or 3 if you have thick hair. For lowlights or highlights 1 pkg is fine. It had a strong chemical smell when I took it out of the package and the clips aren&#x27;t sewn in very well compared to other sets of extensions I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though it&#x27;s a great product especially for the price! I&#x27;d strongly recommend them if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive way to change your look. :)</li>
            <li> i have very very thin hair. and frequently get extensions that dont match how thin my hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i read the reviews about it being thin.. or needing an extra set.&lt;br /&gt;i figured i would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its so so so super thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the hair is good quality. but its just not enough. NO MATTER WHAT ORDER TWO!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got 18 inch extensions and ther were thin but perfect for dyeing and adding color not good for length or volume</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even real hair I tried curling them and they practically melted on my curling iron. Plus they don&#x27;t even dye!</li>
            <li> Very little hair u r getting , i bought the 18 inch and it shorter than its supposed to be, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never worn clip in hair extensions so not much to compare to they are very thin but suite the purpose of length.I can use a flat iron on them with no problem!! I like them but I&#x27;m looking currently now for thicker extensions ...</li>
            <li> Really really thin, and has too much white hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone. Another thing the hair looked damaged with lots of split ends.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality, the worst I ever purchased. Very thin, fine, brittle, poorly packaged and smell bad. These extensions are cheap for a reason. Save some money and buy better ones</li>
            <li> Poor product! No clips 1 long piece of hair would have to cut into individual strips total rip off had to give a star but needs to be negative 5</li>
            <li> At first they were fine for my daughter then all of a studded the clips kept on falling off n she had to sew them back on Don&#x27;t waist your money</li>
            <li> i give this rating because the item is exactly what I wanted. I would recommend to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Not human hair!!! Stay away. does not curl and singes when heat is applied. not a good buy... spend a little more somewhere else</li>
            <li> Very very thin. Even for normal hair it was to thin. Would be good to add fullness to already long hair. Or add diffrent colors. But not for length.  Sent back. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order these hair extensions because the deal just seemed too good to be true but they absolutely met up to my expectations! I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was worried after reading some of the reviews for this product by a different seller that I would receive fake hair instead of human hair. Once my package arrived I could clearly see they were human hair and I am very pleased. I have washed straightened and curled my extensions and they have been excellent!</li>
            <li> These are horrible, I&#x27;ve worn extensions for a long time and I&#x27;ve never had such a bad experience with them, these were cheap so I didn&#x27;t expect salon quality, but upon receiving them I was disappointed to see they were not only SYNTHETIC HAIR but they were also the wrong color and hair was already falling out of them. I contacted the seller and they offered me a 40% refund. I am not satisfied with that and recommend you order from a different company.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them at all. I got dark brown and it had a greenish tint. After wearing them for 5 minutes chunks of hair had already started to fall out. Waste of my money. But you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> They look fab on my teenage daughter! Very nice.</li>
            <li> they were nice for the price</li>
            <li> When you purchase these you expect to get remy hair. I bought a different set of remy hair from another seller on amazon and the difference between those extensions and these extensions is insane. These extensions feel like a cheap synthetic wig does. It is very heavy and a little bit too shiny. My other extensions, which are remy, are soft and shiny, but not overly shiny. Also, if you get dark brown, expect black. I&#x27;m pretty new to the extension world but I can say 100% I would never ever recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Product does not stay in actual hair</li>
            <li> Hair was really thin and didn&#x27;t hold a curl and wasn&#x27;t 100% real hair</li>
            <li> These are absolutely amazing! Not only was the delivery date super quick but it got here ON A SUNDAY! Their great for people who have baby fine hair but if your looking for thickness..I suggest you get more than 1 pack. They look exactly like the picture and have a little golden string on the package that&#x27;s super cute but these extensions are amazing!!</li>
            <li> Great price for the hair love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing a lot of people saying they aren&#x27;t thick enough.  All hair extentions are fairly thin. I&#x27;ve had them done in a salon.  And if you want more thickness, than put more in!</li>
            <li> These were good extensions you can curl and straighten them. I will add that it&#x27;s not my first rodeo with extensions so if you are buying them for the first time make sure to get 2-3 packs because a lot of extensions they sell online are thin.</li>
            <li> I love them! I tried them on and I do have to buy a second pack, (they are a little too thin) but I can tell it&#x27;s going to be worth it! Definitely human hair, easy installation, sturdy clips, promising length, and very soft- even after straightening them! I recommend you to buy two packs though!</li>
            <li> The hair is good quality, and curls nicely. The clips aren&#x27;t sewed in very tight, and they&#x27;re thin, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> they lasted a while ! great product</li>
            <li> I opened up the package to discover that one of the clips was broken so that entire section wont stay in by itself. Also the hair is really thin and if you look at the top it looks like over half of the hair has broken off of the seam.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Loved it!!!! Nice and thick and color matched perfectly!</li>
            <li> I bought some light brown ones about a month ago and they were great so i decided to buy another set and paid a bit less for these. They were thin and looked cheap and they smelled funny after wearing them twice they started falling apart. If your looking for extensions just to  wear them a few times these are ok.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Beware though if you have thick hair. You will need 2 packs of these extensions. I ordered one and they work beautifully but my hair is fine. I only need to use 2 tracks for fuller hair.</li>
            <li> The hair is a good quality, but it&#x27;s really thin.</li>
