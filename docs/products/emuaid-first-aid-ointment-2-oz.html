    <ol>
            <li> This did not help me.</li>
            <li> It really works on warts! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Had a bed sore, or pressure sore on my butt cheeks, for about 9-10 months.  Tried hydrocortisone, helped a little..  Tried Spermaceta. That broke me out in a bad rash all over the butt cheeks, worse than ever.  Finally, in desperation, (when I had a sore on a blood vein where most of the pressure was because I had no fat on my butt to protect it), I looked on internet and  Emuaid came up.  So, though very expensive, for me,  I ordered  2 jars.  and hoped for the best.  Bought a $10 waffle foam pad, for the bed, and those two things did the trick.  Now, I tell everybody about the healing attributes of Emuaide.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of a rash/irritation on my eye lid that would not clear up. I tried several other products that did not help and I became very discouraged.  I was glad that I found Emuaid and after using it, the irritation cleared up within a few days. Amazing product!!</li>
            <li> overrated.  don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> does just what it claims, healed a bad scratch and bruise on my hand in just a few days..its gone....</li>
            <li> This is a miracle in a jar!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cream for my mother for her bedsores and came across a post about emuaid. The results were quite good.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for leg pain.</li>
            <li> product did not deliver or live up to the emuaid guarantee.  I purchased this to treat the pain and itching associated with shingles.&lt;br /&gt;It did nothing to help either.  I tried it on mosquito&#x27;s bites and it did not help with this this either.  This was a very pricey product.&lt;br /&gt;Could have purchased  calamine lotion for a few bucks and gotten much better results.</li>
            <li> This product is INCREDIBLE! The results we have seen on a variety of conditions, in multiple patients, and with a variety of health/skin issues has been remarkable.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised.m helps with redness and dryness of skin</li>
            <li> Did not relieve itching on the back.  Will not order this product again.</li>
            <li> It is working great on symptoms of lichen atrophicus........</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> It woks for wart and almost any kind of skin problem! I love it!</li>
            <li> Used for one week, on Mom&#x27;s bedsores and in five days it had scabbed and took the pain out&lt;br /&gt;good stuff!</li>
            <li> It was not good for shingles, which was the reason I bought  the product. It was however, good for a fungal problem but very expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Phyllis Huggett</li>
            <li> Works great even the dermatologist suggested that we keep using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent ointment, used it on my Mom&#x27;s fungal infection and it cleared it up, just some discoloration left. Also, brown spots on face has faded.</li>
            <li> Did not help with itch!</li>
