            <li>The product is very good.</li>
            <li>I used it for my incredibly chapped hands this winter.</li>
            <li>Great product with a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>Works great on feet, hands, elbows and knees ...</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not embarrassed about-- to have someone touch them and not be skeeved out--or be proud to wear flip-flops or anything that shows your feet--or to go barefoot--all that stress will be gone.</li>

            <li>And, it smells really great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>

            <li>My feet have never felt so good.</li>

            <li>Stays put for a good amount of time..</li>
            <li>too-- awesome softness and a sweet lemon scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;08/04/15:  After my concern with the product, the wonderful founder contacted me via email and true to their policies, issued a 100% refund.  </li>
            <li>He was very happy to get and use this balm and told me that his skin healed quickly.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s oil-based, the best time to put it on is right after a shower or bath, as it holds in the moisture in the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of the product too!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It smells great and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This good smelling stuff made my heels feel better and got rid of the flaky spots.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, i liked it quite a bit..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect consistency -- not gooey, not hard and waxy.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed by its natural ingredients, and even more impressed when I first tried it.</li>
            <li>and the lid on the tin comes off very easily.</li>
            <li>This product smells nice and works okay for softening my calloused feet</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, smells wonderful and it just the right size for travel!!</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li>It is exceptionally oily--but that&#x27;s what works best on dry skin.</li>
            <li>A great product that does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>And I have tried many, many remedies for these sore hands.</li>
            <li>Get it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Better products on the market will not buy again</li>
            <li>You would have better quality smearing your hands with coconut oil in a jar.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Way nicer and smells a lot better.</li>
            <li>when used (anyone who likes the smell of lemongrass tea will love this scent).</li>
            <li>it does not cause a transfer or leave stains of oils from your hand when touching things.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews of many satisfied customers, I took this leap of faith.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the great service and delivery.</li>
            <li>so it can do its magic.  </li>
            <li>She is also pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for such an awesome balm!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more for myself and gifts for family and friends.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>I have tried so many foot repair balms and lotions, etc.  </li>
            <li>I though, ok, why not try just one more?  </li>
            <li>ok I guess.</li>
            <li>I take great care of my hands, but still tear from time to time doing high volume bar work at my Crossfit box.</li>
            <li>Tried on my hand and was pretty good.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m much more comfortable now.</li>
            <li>Love how smoothly the balm goes on....</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and fresh as well.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the great deal I got, after spending so much more for &amp;#34;brands&amp;#34; that were full of chemical compounds.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, fits in purse or pocket easily.</li>
            <li>Soothing relief, not greasy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought it twice!</li>
            <li>I use this balm on tears and it keeps them protected and heals them quick!</li>
            <li>This balm has a light fragrance which works for it</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s say this the rocket tin will fit inside the Polish tin with ease.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and this is absolutely the most beneficial one.</li>
            <li>I just received this product yesterday, and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>This is very rare in this money driven society</li>
            <li>I love it very much.</li>
            <li>Really nice scent, not too strong and smells really natural.</li>
            <li>This product is great for after long hikes and does not leave skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>Works great on dry, winter feet too.</li>
            <li>Great balm for my dry hands.</li>
            <li>It really smells better on my hands than in the container.</li>
            <li>Not only does this product smell really good</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I are hiking the Pacific Crest Trail and use this to keep our feet, hands, and other areas happy and hydrated.</li>
            <li>You only need to use a tiny bit and it makes your feet feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>This balm is soothing and repairs damaged hands quickly.</li>
            <li>I have no cracked fingertips, which is nothing short of amazing.  </li>
            <li>Great, subtle scent and application is easy.</li>
            <li>works great after applying it a few times.</li>
            <li>but i did not see myself recovering real fast when using this..</li>
            <li>Then it would be Worth it</li>
            <li>We like that the balm is substantial but not heavy - it absorbs quickly - and that the scent is fresh and clean but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Thank you Rocket Pure!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sensitive to strong smells)--it&#x27;s from the ingredients, not added.</li>
            <li>So far so good; however, only time will tell.  </li>
            <li>Immediately after I received my order (super fast delivery)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t sting.  </li>
            <li>This balm has definitely earned its place in my backpack :)</li>
            <li>Comparable price, even with it being all natural, and the lemongrass smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and makes my hands soft.  </li>
            <li>I had struggled to find the proper moisturizer for them (most are too greasy), but this foot balm fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different creams and lotions.  </li>
            <li>I could tell a difference in the heels of my feet the first time.  </li>
            <li>I seemed to go through the tin more quickly than I expected.</li>
            <li>It is not only effective, it works on other body parts not officially recommended for :-)</li>
            <li>rocket pure, since i had brought the Rocket pure shoe deodorizer spray and since that was a bit crunched when it arrived he gave one of these as complimentary for me to try it out).. unbiased review as below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But then i have not used it much so this might not be the right thing to say..</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural as I&#x27;m making a transition to as many all natural products as possible in my life.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, applies nicely, definitely moisturizes much better than typical lotions.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a clean, natural lemon</li>
            <li>The balm is very smooth and soothing to my very dry hands.  </li>
            <li>but I can attest that Rocket Pure Foot Repair Balm is all it claims to be.  </li>
            <li>so I applaud you all at Rocket Pure and have since updated my review to 3 stars.</li>
            <li>She had tried EVERYTHING including the O&#x27;Keefes ointment but nothing worked until she tried this Rocket Pure ointment.</li>
            <li>Great for cracking, dry rough skin.  </li>
            <li>Most salves, balms and lotions; even scrubs, start out nice; then by the next day, your heels are hard again.  </li>
            <li>It is very greasy.</li>
            <li>The difference in my heels is very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>have not seen much if any of an improvement.</li>
            <li>Holding the weed eater really DOES NOT help that at all.  </li>
            <li>They did still hurt him but he could get up and walk without feeling as much pain.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>i mean, this does a good job</li>
            <li>in all a decent product from the rocket pure team..</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend giving Rocket Pure a try.</li>
            <li>With consistent use, it&#x27;s healed the cuts on my fingers fast and softened my sensitive hands.  </li>
            <li>So one hand is pressing down on the top while the other is trying to get the top off.</li>
            <li>HUGE cracks that have been there for years are almost completely gone two months later.</li>
            <li>The next morning I woke up with SOFT, SMOOTH heels.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will be ordering again.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and will purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>I started using about a week ago Rocket Pure&#x27;s Natural Hand and Foot repair balm</li>
            <li>Rocket Pure keeps my hands and feet soft in all kinds of weather.</li>
            <li>In the mornings I apply a little more before going to work.  </li>
            <li>An all natural product!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a responsible company that uses natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>One heel has this wrinkly feel to it, and now the skin doesn&#x27;t feel like some old lady&#x27;s heel as much as it did even this morning.</li>
            <li>After nine hours of putting this balm on my feet, putting a fresh pair of socks on, and going to my second job, my feet are so soft!</li>
            <li>Im always on the look out for new ones</li>
            <li>I just got this new hand balm</li>
            <li>I sent this product to my college senior son who rock climbs in New York state.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t believe it was possible for the balm to work so fast.</li>
            <li>When I first applied it, I noticed that my arthritic index finger suddenly stopped hurting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid ocean swimmer, beach walker and hiker which means I&#x27;m constantly in and out of salt water and putting my feet through a lot of varying conditions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a product with natural ingredients too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not surprised that the natural ingredients and the the right combination of them work wonders.</li>
            <li>A friend recently gave me a container of Rocket Pure Repair Balm to try.</li>
            <li>Obviously made of pure, natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild, not overpowering like some other products, and not at all perfume-y.  </li>
            <li>I use it occasionally and can really notice a difference without them being greasy.</li>
            <li>All natural hand repair?</li>
            <li>I frequently suffer from cracked skin on my feet from the abuse they get in my running training.  </li>
            <li>Although it was sore the next day, that was NOTHING compared to how much it would&#x27;ve hurt</li>
            <li>As far as softening hands and feet, I couldn&#x27;t tell ya.  </li>
            <li>I used this for my hands and it really made a big difference.  </li>
            <li>My niece plays basketball and has inherited our sensitive hands as well.  </li>
            <li>I am far from being an athlete</li>
            <li>This product has my hands and feet feeling really soft.</li>
            <li>but not the wow factor as the deodorizer..</li>
            <li>Within weeks all the cracks on her feet were completely healed.</li>
            <li>This product was also a good deal and not too expensive.</li>
            <li>For the first time since I can remember, my hands are not chapped, itchy or even dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that a little goes along way.</li>
            <li>Very soothing for cracked and dry heels  </li>
            <li>You have to lift up using the fingertips while the other hand holds the tin and inevitably presses down on the top to keep the tin from escaping your grip.  </li>
            <li>She has tried your product and says after four days of use Natural Hand and Foot Repair Balm for Athletes is starting to work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now begun to use it on my feet as well and so far, same results.  </li>
            <li>bought this in early June and started using it daily on my feet.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend if you are having a problem with dry, cracked heels.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it works better then other products in the market..</li>
            <li>Of course I tried various creams, balms, and spent lots of money before I found Rocket Pure products.</li>
            <li>With two young children, I am washing my hands constantly and they were getting extremely dry.  </li>
            <li>my cracked hands and heels are NOT from rock climbing ;)--way less glamorous simple dry skin.</li>

            <li> A great product that does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> And I have tried many, many remedies for these sore hands.</li>
            <li> Get it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Better products on the market will not buy again</li>
            <li> You would have better quality smearing your hands with coconut oil in a jar.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Way nicer and smells a lot better.</li>
            <li> when used (anyone who likes the smell of lemongrass tea will love this scent).</li>
            <li> it does not cause a transfer or leave stains of oils from your hand when touching things.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews of many satisfied customers, I took this leap of faith.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the great service and delivery.</li>
            <li> so it can do its magic.  </li>
            <li> She is also pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for such an awesome balm!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more for myself and gifts for family and friends.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> I have tried so many foot repair balms and lotions, etc.  </li>
            <li> I though, ok, why not try just one more?  </li>
            <li> ok I guess.</li>
            <li> I take great care of my hands, but still tear from time to time doing high volume bar work at my Crossfit box.</li>
            <li> Tried on my hand and was pretty good.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m much more comfortable now.</li>
            <li> Love how smoothly the balm goes on....</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and fresh as well.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the great deal I got, after spending so much more for &amp;#34;brands&amp;#34; that were full of chemical compounds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, fits in purse or pocket easily.</li>
            <li> Soothing relief, not greasy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I bought it twice!</li>
            <li> I use this balm on tears and it keeps them protected and heals them quick!</li>
            <li> This balm has a light fragrance which works for it</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s say this the rocket tin will fit inside the Polish tin with ease.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and this is absolutely the most beneficial one.</li>
            <li> I just received this product yesterday, and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> This is very rare in this money driven society</li>
            <li> I love it very much.</li>
            <li> Really nice scent, not too strong and smells really natural.</li>
            <li> This product is great for after long hikes and does not leave skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> Works great on dry, winter feet too.</li>
            <li> Great balm for my dry hands.</li>
            <li> It really smells better on my hands than in the container.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product smell really good</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I are hiking the Pacific Crest Trail and use this to keep our feet, hands, and other areas happy and hydrated.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a tiny bit and it makes your feet feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> This balm is soothing and repairs damaged hands quickly.</li>
            <li> I have no cracked fingertips, which is nothing short of amazing.  </li>
            <li> Great, subtle scent and application is easy.</li>
            <li> works great after applying it a few times.</li>
            <li> but i did not see myself recovering real fast when using this..</li>
            <li> Then it would be Worth it</li>
            <li> We like that the balm is substantial but not heavy - it absorbs quickly - and that the scent is fresh and clean but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Thank you Rocket Pure!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sensitive to strong smells)--it&#x27;s from the ingredients, not added.</li>
            <li> So far so good; however, only time will tell.  </li>
            <li> Immediately after I received my order (super fast delivery)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t sting.  </li>
            <li> This balm has definitely earned its place in my backpack :)</li>
            <li> Comparable price, even with it being all natural, and the lemongrass smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and makes my hands soft.  </li>
            <li> I had struggled to find the proper moisturizer for them (most are too greasy), but this foot balm fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different creams and lotions.  </li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in the heels of my feet the first time.  </li>
            <li> I seemed to go through the tin more quickly than I expected.</li>
            <li> It is not only effective, it works on other body parts not officially recommended for :-)</li>
            <li> rocket pure, since i had brought the Rocket pure shoe deodorizer spray and since that was a bit crunched when it arrived he gave one of these as complimentary for me to try it out).. unbiased review as below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then i have not used it much so this might not be the right thing to say..</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural as I&#x27;m making a transition to as many all natural products as possible in my life.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, applies nicely, definitely moisturizes much better than typical lotions.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a clean, natural lemon</li>
            <li> The balm is very smooth and soothing to my very dry hands.  </li>
            <li> but I can attest that Rocket Pure Foot Repair Balm is all it claims to be.  </li>
            <li> so I applaud you all at Rocket Pure and have since updated my review to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> She had tried EVERYTHING including the O&#x27;Keefes ointment but nothing worked until she tried this Rocket Pure ointment.</li>
            <li> Great for cracking, dry rough skin.  </li>
            <li> Most salves, balms and lotions; even scrubs, start out nice; then by the next day, your heels are hard again.  </li>
            <li> It is very greasy.</li>
            <li> The difference in my heels is very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> have not seen much if any of an improvement.</li>
            <li> Holding the weed eater really DOES NOT help that at all.  </li>
            <li> They did still hurt him but he could get up and walk without feeling as much pain.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> i mean, this does a good job</li>
            <li> in all a decent product from the rocket pure team..</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend giving Rocket Pure a try.</li>
            <li> With consistent use, it&#x27;s healed the cuts on my fingers fast and softened my sensitive hands.  </li>
            <li> So one hand is pressing down on the top while the other is trying to get the top off.</li>
            <li> HUGE cracks that have been there for years are almost completely gone two months later.</li>
            <li> The next morning I woke up with SOFT, SMOOTH heels.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will be ordering again.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and will purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> I started using about a week ago Rocket Pure&#x27;s Natural Hand and Foot repair balm</li>
            <li> Rocket Pure keeps my hands and feet soft in all kinds of weather.</li>
            <li> In the mornings I apply a little more before going to work.  </li>
            <li> An all natural product!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a responsible company that uses natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> One heel has this wrinkly feel to it, and now the skin doesn&#x27;t feel like some old lady&#x27;s heel as much as it did even this morning.</li>
            <li> After nine hours of putting this balm on my feet, putting a fresh pair of socks on, and going to my second job, my feet are so soft!</li>
            <li> Im always on the look out for new ones</li>
            <li> I just got this new hand balm</li>
            <li> I sent this product to my college senior son who rock climbs in New York state.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t believe it was possible for the balm to work so fast.</li>
            <li> When I first applied it, I noticed that my arthritic index finger suddenly stopped hurting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid ocean swimmer, beach walker and hiker which means I&#x27;m constantly in and out of salt water and putting my feet through a lot of varying conditions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a product with natural ingredients too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not surprised that the natural ingredients and the the right combination of them work wonders.</li>
            <li> A friend recently gave me a container of Rocket Pure Repair Balm to try.</li>
            <li> Obviously made of pure, natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild, not overpowering like some other products, and not at all perfume-y.  </li>
            <li> I use it occasionally and can really notice a difference without them being greasy.</li>
            <li> All natural hand repair?</li>
            <li> I frequently suffer from cracked skin on my feet from the abuse they get in my running training.  </li>
            <li> Although it was sore the next day, that was NOTHING compared to how much it would&#x27;ve hurt</li>
            <li> As far as softening hands and feet, I couldn&#x27;t tell ya.  </li>
            <li> I used this for my hands and it really made a big difference.  </li>
            <li> My niece plays basketball and has inherited our sensitive hands as well.  </li>
            <li> I am far from being an athlete</li>
            <li> This product has my hands and feet feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> but not the wow factor as the deodorizer..</li>
            <li> Within weeks all the cracks on her feet were completely healed.</li>
            <li> This product was also a good deal and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> For the first time since I can remember, my hands are not chapped, itchy or even dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> Very soothing for cracked and dry heels  </li>
            <li> You have to lift up using the fingertips while the other hand holds the tin and inevitably presses down on the top to keep the tin from escaping your grip.  </li>
            <li> She has tried your product and says after four days of use Natural Hand and Foot Repair Balm for Athletes is starting to work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now begun to use it on my feet as well and so far, same results.  </li>
            <li> bought this in early June and started using it daily on my feet.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend if you are having a problem with dry, cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works better then other products in the market..</li>
            <li> Of course I tried various creams, balms, and spent lots of money before I found Rocket Pure products.</li>
            <li> With two young children, I am washing my hands constantly and they were getting extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> my cracked hands and heels are NOT from rock climbing ;)--way less glamorous simple dry skin.</li>
            <li> You only need a light coating on your hands and feet to protect them from cold or dry weather, I live in Colorado where it is very dry and the weather is very variable.</li>
            <li> just the right amount of greasy and thick blend -- doesnt just slide off your skin</li>
            <li> It is very greasy but being a man I&#x27;m not sure if it supposed to be like that.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for several weeks now and is working well on my cracked heels and dry hands.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my extra dry hands.  </li>
            <li> Within a few days there was marked improvement.</li>
            <li> In the short time I&#x27;ve been using the balm I&#x27;ve seen a pretty dramatic improvement on my feet.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t regret it like I regretted my last marriage-- and your endless stress and obsession trying to have feet</li>
            <li> Went with the lemongrass scent, I bought for a friend who always complains her hands are dry.</li>
            <li> My hands (and heels) are cracked and dry and the hands hurt.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re going to end up with Dry and cracked feet and hands.</li>
            <li> I have always had dry hands and elbows, as well as heels.</li>
            <li> It is really helping to repair my peeling/cracked dried hands from the harsh winter.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband&#x27;s dry cracked feet and it did the job!</li>
            <li> Same price less of a greased pig feel and like a 5 or 6 oz tin.</li>
            <li> I play a lot of sand volleyball in addition to living in AZ where it is very dry.  </li>
            <li> And as the description says, you only need a little.</li>
            <li> Since I started rock climbing, my hands (palms) have been very rough, and in the winter it gets dry anyway.  </li>
            <li> I recently received this product and have had the opportunity to try it out a few times.  </li>
            <li> he has these rough patches of skin covering the palms of his hands and we have yet to find ANYTHING that helps.  </li>
            <li> A few minutes later, he was wiggling his toes and moving his feet around.  </li>
            <li> After only a few applications, the cracks in my heels began to feel better--less painful--making it easier for me to walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works just as claimed for rough and cracked hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> so I was really hoping this was the product for my tired, flaky feet.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry, cracked heels ( not now ! )  </li>
            <li> Betsy feet were rough to the extreme.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and is not very oily.</li>
            <li> sorry new American company na!</li>
            <li> I have used Joshua tree and Climb On repair balms religiously in the past to soothe the on-fire-dont-think-they-should-be-that-pink hands after climbing.</li>
            <li> The first night I used the balm, I was skeptical about the results.</li>
            <li> Living an active lifestyle</li>
            <li> The container itself was hard to open.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> to make sure that this wasn&#x27;t all in my head, my other son had a reaction to something and his feet had swollen so badly that he could hardly walk.  </li>
            <li> We live on a farm and are outside a lot in the cold and wind.  </li>
            <li> I applied just a small amount on the dry areas and felt like my skin was letting out a sigh of relief.</li>
            <li> but it is a small container and a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Even on raw skin it did not sting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not able to straighten my arm after working like that.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> His hands always get really rough and cracked from the cold and dry winter weather.</li>
            <li> I got this for my toes, as I always get rough spots on the sides of my big toes from wearing heels, this did not help and I cannot tell any difference at all. :(</li>
            <li> hard consistency.</li>
            <li> I can imagine it working wonders on those hard scabs</li>
            <li> neither is it too hard for spreading it on the chapped areas of the skin..</li>
            <li> The winter is not kind whatsoever to my hands.  </li>
            <li> I have a two inch scar on the heel of one foot from stitches received after a serious surfing accident.</li>
            <li> During extremely dry conditions the scar opens up and is quite painful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the secret ingredient is, but please - DON&#x27;T</li>
            <li> I had horrible hard flaky spots on my arms and dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> The cracks were deep, really bad and painful.</li>
            <li> Last year, my hands were in terrible shape over the winter.  </li>
            <li> After basic training years ago, my feet have been callused and nasty.</li>
            <li> Within 5 minutes, the lemon scent dissipated to a faint sweetness.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, it did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Scar tissue around the area makes my heel very tough and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This leads to painful cracked heels, and I&#x27;ve have a tough time finding a treatment that works.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Went with the lemongrass scent, I bought for a friend who always complains her hands are dry. She has since stopped complaining. I use it occasionally and can really notice a difference without them being greasy.</li>
            <li> The tea-tree oil is well balanced with a pleasant lemon balm scent. I used it for my incredibly chapped hands this winter. It is very greasy. I’d suggest using it at bed time with gloves or socks. Even on raw skin it did not sting. I was hoping a smaller amount would stretch further. I seemed to go through the tin more quickly than I expected.</li>
            <li> I got this for my toes, as I always get rough spots on the sides of my big toes from wearing heels, this did not help and I cannot tell any difference at all. :(</li>
            <li> Smells great, and goes on smoothly.  Great for cracking, dry rough skin.  Since I started rock climbing, my hands (palms) have been very rough, and in the winter it gets dry anyway.  Slathering this on before sleeping has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months in the mountains of NC.  Last year, my hands were in terrible shape over the winter.  For the first time since I can remember, my hands are not chapped, itchy or even dry.  I have no cracked fingertips, which is nothing short of amazing.  We live on a farm and are outside a lot in the cold and wind.  My husband has been using Cerave, which I used to use before I decided to only use products on my skin whose ingredients I could actually pronounce, understand and even put in my mouth.  I am buying another tin now for my husband.  The only thing I would improve is making it easier to open the tin.  You have to lift up using the fingertips while the other hand holds the tin and inevitably presses down on the top to keep the tin from escaping your grip.  So one hand is pressing down on the top while the other is trying to get the top off.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I are hiking the Pacific Crest Trail and use this to keep our feet, hands, and other areas happy and hydrated. We rub this into our feet at night, which is one of the best parts of the day. We like that the balm is substantial but not heavy - it absorbs quickly - and that the scent is fresh and clean but not overpowering. This balm has definitely earned its place in my backpack :)</li>
            <li> As a diabetic i have always had cracked heels. This is the best product i have ever used. I have used it every day 2 weeks. My feet have never felt so good.</li>
            <li> A great product that does exactly what it promises. What more can I say. Try it.</li>
            <li> I take great care of my hands, but still tear from time to time doing high volume bar work at my Crossfit box. I use this balm on tears and it keeps them protected and heals them quick!</li>
            <li> I had horrible hard flaky spots on my arms and dry cracked heels. This good smelling stuff made my heels feel better and got rid of the flaky spots. I liked it so much I bought it twice!</li>
            <li> I have used Joshua tree and Climb On repair balms religiously in the past to soothe the on-fire-dont-think-they-should-be-that-pink hands after climbing. Im always on the look out for new ones and, I have to say, this one is impressive. Comparable price, even with it being all natural, and the lemongrass smell is fantastic. Not too greasy. Works great on dry, winter feet too. Hoping they come out with a stick-version in the future.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product and have had the opportunity to try it out a few times.  The difference in my heels is very noticeable.  I play a lot of sand volleyball in addition to living in AZ where it is very dry.  I put it on my heels at night after I shower and then put a pair of gel heel socks on.  In the mornings I apply a little more before going to work.  Wonderful product.  I would highly recommend if you are having a problem with dry, cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for several weeks now and is working well on my cracked heels and dry hands.  With two young children, I am washing my hands constantly and they were getting extremely dry.  This product has solved the issue.  It goes on smoothly and makes my hands soft.  My heels also have improved.  The scent is nice and fresh as well.  I highly recommend this product and will be ordering again.  This is a Great Product!</li>
            <li> Betsy feet were rough to the extreme. She has tried your product and says after four days of use Natural Hand and Foot Repair Balm for Athletes is starting to work.  Ask us again in a month but for now exellent.</li>
            <li> This product smells nice and works okay for softening my calloused feet but it is a small container and a little pricey.</li>
            <li> All natural hand repair? Yes, please. I&#x27;ll confess--my cracked hands and heels are NOT from rock climbing ;)--way less glamorous simple dry skin. My hands (and heels) are cracked and dry and the hands hurt. This balm has a light fragrance which works for it (I&#x27;m sensitive to strong smells)--it&#x27;s from the ingredients, not added. It is exceptionally oily--but that&#x27;s what works best on dry skin. I use it before bed and as often as I can during the day (if I don&#x27;t wear white cotton gloves, I leave an oily residue on everything I touch). If you plan to use it during the day I recommend gloves. It soothes the cracked skin--zero irritation, even there--and the healing is quicker than anything I&#x27;ve used. And I have tried many, many remedies for these sore hands. I highly recommend this. It&#x27;s true that a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> Living an active lifestyle and you&#x27;re going to end up with Dry and cracked feet and hands. I&#x27;d been trying to moisturize my feet with different lotions my wife hoards all around the house but nothing seems to work well enough. I started using about a week ago Rocket Pure&#x27;s Natural Hand and Foot repair balm and I absolutely love it! Smells amazing, applies nicely, definitely moisturizes much better than typical lotions. In the short time I&#x27;ve been using the balm I&#x27;ve seen a pretty dramatic improvement on my feet. I also love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural as I&#x27;m making a transition to as many all natural products as possible in my life. In fact, as soon as I&#x27;m done writing this review I&#x27;m going to place an order for a couple of tins for my parents! Get it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Great balm for my dry hands. Smells great and rubs in nicely.  Totally recommended!</li>
            <li> hard consistency. have not seen much if any of an improvement. Better products on the market will not buy again</li>
            <li> The container itself was hard to open. And once you open the product it was yucky. You would have better quality smearing your hands with coconut oil in a jar.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a hand balm or hand repair balm. Use Climb-On products. Way nicer and smells a lot better. Unless you like greasy. Then by all means this is the stuff for you.</li>
            <li> This product is great for after long hikes and does not leave skin feeling greasy.  Great, subtle scent and application is easy.</li>
            <li> I frequently suffer from cracked skin on my feet from the abuse they get in my running training.  I had struggled to find the proper moisturizer for them (most are too greasy), but this foot balm fits the bill.  Excellent.  And I&#x27;m much more comfortable now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this balm for about 2 weeks. It is really helping to repair my peeling/cracked dried hands from the harsh winter. I love the faint lemongrass scent when used (anyone who likes the smell of lemongrass tea will love this scent). Although the balm leaves your hand looking moisturized it does not cause a transfer or leave stains of oils from your hand when touching things.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my son - he has these rough patches of skin covering the palms of his hands and we have yet to find ANYTHING that helps.  Well, once I tried it, I never even mentioned it to my son.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing.  When I first applied it, I noticed that my arthritic index finger suddenly stopped hurting.  Also, since I was working out in the yard that day using the weed eater, I kept applying it to my left elbow area and forearm from Tennis Elbow.  Holding the weed eater really DOES NOT help that at all.  Although it was sore the next day, that was NOTHING compared to how much it would&#x27;ve hurt had I not used this stuff!!  I&#x27;m usually not able to straighten my arm after working like that.&lt;br /&gt;Just to make sure that this wasn&#x27;t all in my head, my other son had a reaction to something and his feet had swollen so badly that he could hardly walk.  I asked him to try this stuff and, although reluctant, he did.  A few minutes later, he was wiggling his toes and moving his feet around.  They did still hurt him but he could get up and walk without feeling as much pain.  I don&#x27;t know what the secret ingredient is, but please - DON&#x27;T CHANGE A THING!!  As far as softening hands and feet, I couldn&#x27;t tell ya.  For me, it&#x27;s the instant relief that I get when I put it on!!!  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid ocean swimmer, beach walker and hiker which means I&#x27;m constantly in and out of salt water and putting my feet through a lot of varying conditions. This leads to painful cracked heels, and I&#x27;ve have a tough time finding a treatment that works. A friend recently gave me a container of Rocket Pure Repair Balm to try. I was impressed by its natural ingredients, and even more impressed when I first tried it. It smells great and is easy to apply. After only a few applications, the cracks in my heels began to feel better--less painful--making it easier for me to walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve just about given up on finding a solid solution for your cracked heels, I highly recommend giving Rocket Pure a try. It&#x27;s a responsible company that uses natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Just received product recently.  The balm is very smooth and soothing to my very dry hands.  I purchased this for my extra dry hands.  I am hoping it will revive them since I constantly wash my hands and do not use rubber gloves.  Based on the reviews of many satisfied customers, I took this leap of faith.  So far so good; however, only time will tell.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I just got this new hand balm and I love it!  It is very moisturizing, smells wonderful and it just the right size for travel!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this. An all natural product!! Works great on feet, hands, elbows and knees ...love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best.  I truly appreciate this product.  I use it every night at bedtime.  You only need to use a tiny bit and it makes your feet feel wonderful. I have tried many products and this is absolutely the most beneficial one. I highly recommend and will purchase it again.  Thanks for the great service and delivery.</li>
            <li> Love how smoothly the balm goes on....and the lid on the tin comes off very easily. I just received this product yesterday, and so far, so good. I will write another review after I have used it on my cracked feet for a couple of weeks. But I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The product is very good. I love it very much.</li>
            <li> Great product with a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> I wish I could post before and after pictures of my husbandʻs feet after using this. HUGE cracks that have been there for years are almost completely gone two months later. I just bought five tins so we can have some in every room.</li>
            <li> I used this for my hands and it really made a big difference.  It&#x27;s easy to use, fits in purse or pocket easily. I put some on before I head out the door and definitely before bed so it can do its magic.  Carry it with me all the time. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Use it every night on my feet and hands!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an athlete and this balm is perfect for me.  The winter is not kind whatsoever to my hands.  With consistent use, it&#x27;s healed the cuts on my fingers fast and softened my sensitive hands.  I&#x27;ve now begun to use it on my feet as well and so far, same results.  Gratefully no cuts there to begin with.  I have tried so many different creams and lotions.  For me, this has worked the best.  My niece plays basketball and has inherited our sensitive hands as well.  She is also pleased with the results.  It really smells better on my hands than in the container. And as the description says, you only need a little. Thank you for such an awesome balm!</li>
            <li> A-MAZING product!! I just received it, but my hands and feet look and feel great! You have no idea what I&#x27;ve been through-- with my feet especially. After basic training years ago, my feet have been callused and nasty. Whatever you can do to improve your feet, I&#x27;ve done.... Pedis, callus removers at the spa and at home, pumice stones, foot soaks, foot peels, that foot shaving thingie, creams, lotions up the wa-zoo.... After nine hours of putting this balm on my feet, putting a fresh pair of socks on, and going to my second job, my feet are so soft! One heel has this wrinkly feel to it, and now the skin doesn&#x27;t feel like some old lady&#x27;s heel as much as it did even this morning. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough. I even rubbed some on my hands too-- awesome softness and a sweet lemon scent. But don&#x27;t worry about walking around smelling like a lemon. Within 5 minutes, the lemon scent dissipated to a faint sweetness. Also, it&#x27;s a clean, natural lemon smell-- not the &amp;#34;I just cleaned my house&amp;#34; lemon smell. Do yourself a favor-- do your skin a favor--put this stuff in your cart and buy it now. I&#x27;m telling you-- you won&#x27;t regret it like I regretted my last marriage-- and your endless stress and obsession trying to have feet you&#x27;re not embarrassed about-- to have someone touch them and not be skeeved out--or be proud to wear flip-flops or anything that shows your feet--or to go barefoot--all that stress will be gone. This is the best!!!!  Whoever made this stuff....I love you!!!</li>
            <li> I have always had dry hands and elbows, as well as heels. Of course I tried various creams, balms, and spent lots of money before I found Rocket Pure products. Immediately after I received my order (super fast delivery) I applied just a small amount on the dry areas and felt like my skin was letting out a sigh of relief. I&#x27;m really not surprised that the natural ingredients and the the right combination of them work wonders. I was surprised at the great deal I got, after spending so much more for &amp;#34;brands&amp;#34; that were full of chemical compounds. Thank you Rocket Pure! A very happy customer here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very enthusiastic abouit this product!  It&#x27;s the perfect consistency -- not gooey, not hard and waxy.  The scent is mild, not overpowering like some other products, and not at all perfume-y.  It works just as claimed for rough and cracked hands and feet.  In addition, it helps heal scrapes and gouges from gardening and yard work.  I can imagine it working wonders on those hard scabs kids get on skinned elbows and knees.  It&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t sting.  Because it&#x27;s oil-based, the best time to put it on is right after a shower or bath, as it holds in the moisture in the skin.  When you use it daily you see improvement every day.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I sent this product to my college senior son who rock climbs in New York state. His hands always get really rough and cracked from the cold and dry winter weather. He was very happy to get and use this balm and told me that his skin healed quickly. Happy mom, happy kid.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s cuticles get chapped and cracked in the winter from outdoor work. This balm is soothing and repairs damaged hands quickly.</li>
            <li> I am far from being an athlete but I can attest that Rocket Pure Foot Repair Balm is all it claims to be.  Very soothing for cracked and dry heels  This foot repair speeds up  the healing of cracks in your heels.  I will buy it again and again and again.</li>
            <li> Really nice scent, not too strong and smells really natural. Tried on my hand and was pretty good. Soothing and not oily.</li>
            <li> The first night I used the balm, I was skeptical about the results. The next morning I woke up with SOFT, SMOOTH heels. I really didn&#x27;t believe it was possible for the balm to work so fast. I have very dry, cracked heels ( not now ! )  All the products, including prescription, never worked. I will be ordering more for myself and gifts for family and friends.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly! Completely satisfied!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a month with no change. I am in the healthcare field and stand on my feet all day so I was really hoping this was the product for my tired, flaky feet.  I love the smell but unfortunately, it did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;08/04/15:  After my concern with the product, the wonderful founder contacted me via email and true to their policies, issued a 100% refund.  This is very rare in this money driven society so I applaud you all at Rocket Pure and have since updated my review to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders on my feet and hands. I do a lot of gardening plus I am a nurse so my hands are constantly bring washed. Great product.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product smell really good it works really good. A little goes a long way and is not very oily. I wish that this was a bigger container because I feel like there is not enough in there. This product has my hands and feet feeling really soft. This product was also a good deal and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> It is not only effective, it works on other body parts not officially recommended for :-) And, it smells really great. Obviously made of pure, natural ingredients. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband&#x27;s dry cracked feet and it did the job! Love the smell of the product too!</li>
            <li> I love this product! You only need a light coating on your hands and feet to protect them from cold or dry weather, I live in Colorado where it is very dry and the weather is very variable. You can have sunshine and warmth in the morning and snow in the afternoon. Rocket Pure keeps my hands and feet soft in all kinds of weather. I had a pervasive area of dryness on each foot that had healed since using this product. I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> This is like NOTHING I have ever tried before!  I have tried so many foot repair balms and lotions, etc.  I though, ok, why not try just one more?  Well, I am very happy that I did.  This is very impressive.  I could tell a difference in the heels of my feet the first time.  Most salves, balms and lotions; even scrubs, start out nice; then by the next day, your heels are hard again.  With this, they were not.  This is an awesome product and I&#x27;m so happy I ordered it!</li>
            <li> Smaller container than a shoe polish tin! It says your getting 2ozs(over looked that when ordered) but then you hold the can up to a can of Polish (1 1/8 oz) let&#x27;s say this the rocket tin will fit inside the Polish tin with ease. Smells ok I guess. Does it work:/ for the price sorry new American company na! Not worth it. It is very greasy but being a man I&#x27;m not sure if it supposed to be like that. I find myself putting it on at night for a hour then wiping it off before I walk on my floors. Same price less of a greased pig feel and like a 5 or 6 oz tin. Then it would be Worth it</li>
            <li> Get Some!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in early June and started using it daily on my feet. I have a two inch scar on the heel of one foot from stitches received after a serious surfing accident. During extremely dry conditions the scar opens up and is quite painful. Scar tissue around the area makes my heel very tough and uncomfortable. Since applying the balm to my foot, my heel has softened up and the scar is shrinking. This stuff is amazing! My girlfriend snagged my tin and started using it on her arms and legs. She swears it is the best moisturizer she has ever used! I can only hope to get it back before it&#x27;s all gone!</li>
            <li> works great after applying it a few times. a bit pricey though.</li>
            <li> so well, i got 1 of these from Alex (@ rocket pure, since i had brought the Rocket pure shoe deodorizer spray and since that was a bit crunched when it arrived he gave one of these as complimentary for me to try it out).. unbiased review as below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, i liked it quite a bit.. but not the wow factor as the deodorizer..&lt;br /&gt;Pros --&lt;br /&gt;1. doesnt feel like chemically loaded.. i applied it a couple of times and had the feeling of freshness with it..&lt;br /&gt;2. just the right amount of greasy and thick blend -- doesnt just slide off your skin neither is it too hard for spreading it on the chapped areas of the skin.. Stays put for a good amount of time..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons --&lt;br /&gt;1. I am not sure if it works better then other products in the market.. i mean, this does a good job but i did not see myself recovering real fast when using this.. But then i have not used it much so this might not be the right thing to say..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all a decent product from the rocket pure team..</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom&#x27;s cracked soles. The cracks were deep, really bad and painful. She had tried EVERYTHING including the O&#x27;Keefes ointment but nothing worked until she tried this Rocket Pure ointment. Within a few days there was marked improvement. Within weeks all the cracks on her feet were completely healed. Now she&#x27;s back to wearing sandals. It&#x27;s a product with natural ingredients too! Would give this product six stars if I could! Try it!</li>
            <li> Soothing relief, not greasy and easy to apply.</li>
