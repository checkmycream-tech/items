            <li>I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Product delivers most of what it promises.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much better</li>
            <li>It is easy to install; just hang it on the wall and plug it in.</li>
            <li>I love the 7x magnification, and the price was definitely right!</li>
            <li>We installed it easily in our c. 1931 bathroom and it looks fine.</li>
            <li>this mirror looks great and mounts easily but only comes with a 15 watt bulb and cautions not to use any thing brighter!  </li>
            <li>Wall mounting prevents counter clutter and allows you to put it at level that is comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>The light on the mirror was weaker than the bathroom lighting.  </li>
            <li>NOTHING CHEAP ABOUT THIS MIRROR.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to mount and the swivil arm make useing the mirror easy and fun.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A TRUE QUALITY PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>This is so much better, leaving my counters free and clear.</li>
            <li>Plus it looks pretty and doubles as a night light.  </li>
            <li>Pretty Good value for Money for me Personally.</li>
            <li>The mirror was easy to install and makes life much easier for my wife who wears glasses.    </li>
            <li>My wife really likes the light and magnification to put on her make-up and pluck her eyebrows.</li>
            <li>IT WAS PRICEY, BUT EVERY PENNEY WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>As my wife and I get older, more light is needed to see things clearly.</li>
            <li>Just the right size, and can see so well in it, but would like a brighter lite.  </li>
            <li>It also will adjust, so it is always just right.</li>
            <li>The magnification however, is pretty powerful.</li>
            <li>The light on this thing is so dim</li>
            <li>My husband mounted this one exactly where I wanted it.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is quite adequate as far as the style, installation, and ease of use are concerned.</li>
            <li>We found that the 7X was too much magification coupled with the 8 inch diameter</li>
            <li>you cannot see your whole face.</li>
            <li>The price is quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>It was not too expensive, and she really has been very appreciative, esp for her eye makeup.</li>
            <li>The only factor you might want to consider if it&#x27;s really important for you, is that the light around the mirror is not strong.</li>
            <li>I initially got a free-standing mirror on my vanity, but found it was never at the right height or angle.  </li>
            <li>Id rather have a light weight mirror without a light to hang on the wall than a heavy one with a light thats no good.</li>
            <li>My wife wished it could have been a little larger to see more area of her face.</li>
            <li>it like I did to the GFI outlet near sink.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could have found a lighted mirror for this modest a price elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I think it looks cool as far as wall mirrors go - but its too heavy to buy just for looks.  </li>
            <li>Only draw backs I found were the switch for the light is loud and stiff.  </li>
            <li>The little amount of heat produced by the light actually helps keep the mirror defogged during showertime, too.</li>
            <li>(Can&#x27;t turn on and off quietly) and not made to hide wiring if you want to direct wire</li>
            <li>I got this mirror, because my eyes are getting too old for the regular mirror.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The light on this thing is so dim I cant believe they have the nerve to make it this way.  Its ridiculous.  You would think a name like Revlon would have some standards.  I guess they just slapped their name on it without even bothering to try it out.  I think it looks cool as far as wall mirrors go - but its too heavy to buy just for looks.  Id rather have a light weight mirror without a light to hang on the wall than a heavy one with a light thats no good.</li>
            <li> We found that the 7X was too much magification coupled with the 8 inch diameter you cannot see your whole face. We are exchanging it for a larger 10 inch with 5X magnification.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this mirror.  To me the light is perfect and 7x magnification is great!  Plus it looks pretty and doubles as a night light.  Would buy again and have recommended it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  March 2013 (6 yrs later). The mirror is still working great!  The arms still move in and out so I can swing it out to use it and push it in when not in use.  I could not be happier with a magnification mirror!</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful mirror for a bathroom. The price is quite reasonable. The only inconvenience is that the power cable is too thick.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this!  It was not too expensive, and she really has been very appreciative, esp for her eye makeup.</li>
            <li> A great value for the price. It&#x27;s easy to mount and the swivil arm make useing the mirror easy and fun. The light arround the mirror dose cast a weird circile in your eyes but you get used to it, and it dosn&#x27;t effect or quility of the product.</li>
            <li> Product delivers most of what it promises. The only factor you might want to consider if it&#x27;s really important for you, is that the light around the mirror is not strong. The magnification however, is pretty powerful. If the trade off work for you, nothing like it.    Pretty Good value for Money for me Personally.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with her mirror.  She wanted one after using one on vacation.  The price is best I found.  Only draw backs I found were the switch for the light is loud and stiff.  (Can&#x27;t turn on and off quietly) and not made to hide wiring if you want to direct wire it like I did to the GFI outlet near sink.  But again those are my draw backs, my wife is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I know there are some pricier wall mirrors than this one out there. But for being a two-sided light-up and the only mirror I&#x27;ve found with a handle, you can&#x27;t beat this one for the value. We installed it easily in our c. 1931 bathroom and it looks fine. The little amount of heat produced by the light actually helps keep the mirror defogged during showertime, too.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. The magnification is strength is perfect, and the light feature is great!  Wall mounting prevents counter clutter and allows you to put it at level that is comfortable to use.  Counter styles requires either a sitting area or bending over.  I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The mirror is quite adequate as far as the style, installation, and ease of use are concerned. However, the light output is quite bad. As my wife and I get older, more light is needed to see things clearly. In my opinion, it fails as a \\&quot;lighted\\&quot; mirror.</li>
            <li> The mirror is great, and easy to mount on the wall.  Just the right size, and can see so well in it, but would like a brighter lite.  Glad I have it!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product and plan on returning it.  The light on the mirror was weaker than the bathroom lighting.  You get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> this mirror looks great and mounts easily but only comes with a 15 watt bulb and cautions not to use any thing brighter!  I added a 60 watt bulb and it&#x27;s much better but I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to explode someday.</li>
            <li> I got this mirror, because my eyes are getting too old for the regular mirror.  I can now put on my eye-makeup and not wonder if my eyeliner is even!!  I initially got a free-standing mirror on my vanity, but found it was never at the right height or angle.  My husband mounted this one exactly where I wanted it.  It also will adjust, so it is always just right. It is a good mirror for the money.  I don&#x27;t think I could have found a lighted mirror for this modest a price elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror for our master bedroom bath.  My wife really likes the light and magnification to put on her make-up and pluck her eyebrows. The mirror was easy to install and makes life much easier for my wife who wears glasses.    [[ASIN:B000H0S2JO Revlon RV976 Lighted Wall Mount Mirror]]</li>
            <li> I previously had a lighted make-up mirror that stood on my bathroom counter. This is so much better, leaving my counters free and clear. It is easy to install; just hang it on the wall and plug it in. It definitely helps see all the details that aging eyes need help with, be it plucking eyebrows or putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> GREAT product. I love the 7x magnification, and the price was definitely right!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A TRUE QUALITY PRODUCT. IT WAS PRICEY, BUT EVERY PENNEY WORTH IT. NOTHING CHEAP ABOUT THIS MIRROR. I WOULD BUY ONE FOR EVERY BATHROOM IN MY HOUSE AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.The short fall is the mirror.My wife wished it could have been a little larger to see more area of her face.</li>
