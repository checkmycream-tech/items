            <li>and this was recommended to me by a plastic surgeon and has been touted as an effective pigment corrector.</li>
            <li>My quest for an effective fading cream continues.</li>
            <li>NICE customer service Valerie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a nice job moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, really does work.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and was a great price point.</li>
            <li>It is more effective when applied twice each day versus once.</li>
            <li>I read about this as one of the best products in Allure magazine and I completely agree.  </li>
            <li>rec&#x27;d product right away and in great condition.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be sure to use with sun protection.</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply one with SPF -</li>
            <li>The price for this product sure is steep.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many months</li>
            <li>IT WAS BETTER THAN ELURE.</li>
            <li>It is sold in my top dermatologist&#x27;s office .  </li>
            <li>but i am not seeing any better.</li>
            <li>They said formula is improved and will give better results</li>
            <li>but i think they are talking better results on income statement instead on client face.</li>
            <li>After using it twice a day for a month my skin was noticeably clearer, brighter and more even-toned.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried in a long time for my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gradual fade, but safe to use if pregnant as it is hydroquinone and retinol free.</li>
            <li>have used this product (Skinceuticals Advanced Pigment Corrector) for 9 weeks, twice a day - morning and night and followed the instructions on the box.  </li>
            <li>I use their Phloretin CF serum (antioxidants), wait 3 minutes, then use the Phyto + botanical gel for hyper pigmentation (arbututin, kojic acid which lighten and brighten), wait a couple minutes, then apply this advanced pigment corrector (Hydroxyphenoxy propionic acid and yeast extract which inhibit melanin, ellagic acid which fights free radicals, salicylic acid which exfoliates).  </li>
            <li>I think it is the combo of this SkinCeuticals Advanced Pigment corrector and the Olay Pro X, that when used together I notice I don&#x27;t have shiny, oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first bottle, and already the brown blotches have faded more than 50%.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan to purchase more, rather I may try a different product before considering a more aggressive treatment.</li>
            <li>I have mild redness in the t-zone and hyperpigmentation along my jawline.  </li>
            <li>I used the product as directed, morning and evening on my cheekbones where I have light sun damage, on my neck where I have moderate malasma and on my décolleté where I had more advanced sun damage.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and have always had freckles, but as I aged there are also age spots.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reordering another bottle right now.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, you don&#x27;t need much and the tube seems to have a decent amount.</li>
            <li>I used twice a day and by the end of the first tube had no change in melasma.  </li>
            <li>The price is pretty steep, so I can see how that would deter people from purchasing it.</li>
            <li>SkinCeuticals Advanced Pigment Corrector is on a par with Obagi Clear.  </li>
            <li>a month later, I find myself 85$ poorer but all the more wiser for my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love all of my skinCeuticals products and was expecting to feel the same about this one this</li>
            <li>I have positive results without any sensitivity reactions.  </li>
            <li>Both are pretty harsh and I found this product to be as effective as both.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not snake oil, hence I&#x27;m writing a real review to help people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, but does not work.</li>
            <li>I have been using it faithfully since purchase and there has been 0 change in my cheek spot, the one I really want to go away.</li>
            <li>After a month of usage I can&#x27;t really tell if any of my age spots have faded or not.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this product, and I do believe it is working very well.  </li>
            <li>Much improved after using this product.</li>
            <li>I used in all over my face but found the most significant results on the hyperpigmentation due to tons of sun as a teenage under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product for sun spots.</li>
            <li>This cream really delivers as promised!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks and the stubborn discolorations are fading!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also - I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so at night I use retina a and Ambi fade cream (hydroquinone) to maximize the fading of my spots.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product in late April 2015 with high hopes that my light sun damage and hipper pigmentation would fade away.  </li>
            <li>I only have one tube, as it is pretty pricey, and sometimes I just don&#x27;t remember to take it with me traveling and such, so I am not always diligent in applying it every day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Obagi Clear for 15 years and recently tried the SkinCeuticals Corrector.  </li>
            <li>So far, the brown spots from sun damage seem to be peeling off with daily use of this product.</li>
            <li>Her ONLY recommendation is to see a professional before I get any products for my face.</li>
            <li>I find my complexion was less red after the first tube of it.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t see much difference in dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t live up to that claim, and one empty bottle and</li>

            <li> and I can&#x27;t see much difference in dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t live up to that claim, and one empty bottle and</li>
            <li> It did slightly lighten some of my freckles and provide a very slight brightness, overall it was nothing special and didnt do what I purchased it for which is melasma.  </li>
            <li> Another area on my face had started to become dark and it is now completely gone.</li>
            <li> Only four stars because my stubborn freckles on my hands have faded, but not completely.  </li>
            <li> Pricing is substantially less that the Obagi Clear</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a few days and it seems to be lightening my freckles and old scars already.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another note - I&#x27;m not sure how soon you can apply facial lotion after applying this, but I wait at least a few minutes just to be safe.</li>
            <li> used the entire tube - religiously - with absolutely no effect on the dark spot - whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have a nickel sized dark spot on my left cheek.  </li>
            <li> I am 58 and have been trying different products for years to get rid of the dark spots.</li>
            <li> Finally a pigment corrector that works (in conjunction with an SPF 50 sunscreen everyday).  </li>
            <li> I have two sunspots on my cheeks and they are not even remotely faded.</li>
            <li> It is not giving results as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other creams before and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty skeptical about claims made by products like these.</li>
            <li> I only use a small amout 2 times a day on those spots.</li>
            <li> The bottle is out of a hard plastic, similar to glass.</li>
            <li> It was so dark people thought I had dirt on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought it specifically for 2 dark sunspots I&#x27;ve had on my forehead for about a year.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are lighter now.</li>
            <li> Expiring date was a year and a half away.</li>
            <li> Started using less than 1 week ago.</li>
            <li> Used about half of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad because this is third week and my skin looks the same.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the pump releases about twice as much as I need for each application, so I try to minimize how hard I press it.</li>
            <li> I wear the skin ceuticals SFP 50 everyday, and use a clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing sunscreen religiously everyday on both my face and hands (even on foggy and rainy days).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a retinol cream from the dermatologist for a few years and that didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> I was super disappointed since I was seeking a product without hydroquinone</li>
            <li> The packing is impossible; you are not able to get a very large amount out towards the end.  </li>
            <li> I also apply in just a few small spots, so that&#x27;s one</li>
            <li> (there is about 1-2 more applications in there after the pump won&#x27;t pump anymore out which I hate)!  </li>
            <li> , their representative - Valerie - is very vague, she can&#x27;t even give me any clear answers at all to any questions I have regarding to the product.  </li>
            <li> Usually they promise effects that are hard to truly measure, or even notice, thus making it hard to determine their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day, and I like that this kinda sucks up the oil on my face.  </li>
            <li> Use approximately 3 times and it&#x27;s either empty or broken.</li>
            <li> away some subtle spots on my face that were not coming off with Renova/Tretinoin</li>
            <li> AND AFTER 5 WEEKS MY SKIN DID NOT GET WORSE</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this cream but decided to try it after reading all the hyped reviews.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s the best over the counter product I&#x27;ve ever used to keep melasma under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this religiously for almost two months and have seen no reduction on my brown spots.  Perhaps it takes longer, but I&#x27;m not too hopeful.</li>
            <li> I used twice a day and by the end of the first tube had no change in melasma.  It did slightly lighten some of my freckles and provide a very slight brightness, overall it was nothing special and didnt do what I purchased it for which is melasma.  I wear the skin ceuticals SFP 50 everyday, and use a clarisonic.  The packing is impossible; you are not able to get a very large amount out towards the end.  The bottle is out of a hard plastic, similar to glass.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a few days and it seems to be lightening my freckles and old scars already. I like that it does not leave my oily skin greasy. The scent is just okay - nothing great, but not nasty either.</li>
            <li> So far, the brown spots from sun damage seem to be peeling off with daily use of this product.</li>

            <li> I use it twice a day.  I have positive results without any sensitivity reactions.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> This cream really delivers as promised!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks and the stubborn discolorations are fading!&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to use with sun protection.</li>
            <li> Finally a pigment corrector that works (in conjunction with an SPF 50 sunscreen everyday).  Only four stars because my stubborn freckles on my hands have faded, but not completely.  I&#x27;ve been wearing sunscreen religiously everyday on both my face and hands (even on foggy and rainy days).  I wear gloves while gardening.</li>
            <li> Very happy. Product came in sealed package.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this cream but decided to try it after reading all the hyped reviews. After using this twice a day for a month i see NO CHANGE at all. I have two sunspots on my cheeks and they are not even remotely faded. I&#x27;ve tried other creams before and nothing worked. The only thing that works for removing sun spots is photofacial. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cream. I wish i didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> 40-something Caucasian male. Used it daily &amp; didn&#x27;t have any reduction in sun spots or &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in late April 2015 with high hopes that my light sun damage and hipper pigmentation would fade away.  I used the product as directed, morning and evening on my cheekbones where I have light sun damage, on my neck where I have moderate malasma and on my décolleté where I had more advanced sun damage.  I have seen no change in any area.  I don&#x27;t plan to purchase more, rather I may try a different product before considering a more aggressive treatment.</li>
            <li> (A guy&#x27;s review) I&#x27;m usually pretty skeptical about claims made by products like these. Usually they promise effects that are hard to truly measure, or even notice, thus making it hard to determine their effectiveness. This one does work. It&#x27;s not snake oil, hence I&#x27;m writing a real review to help people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months. When I&#x27;m diligent about applying it, it does make a noticeable reduction in the appearance of sun spots. It is more effective when applied twice each day versus once. I only have one tube, as it is pretty pricey, and sometimes I just don&#x27;t remember to take it with me traveling and such, so I am not always diligent in applying it every day. The price is pretty steep, so I can see how that would deter people from purchasing it. Fortunately, you don&#x27;t need much and the tube seems to have a decent amount. Unfortunately, the pump releases about twice as much as I need for each application, so I try to minimize how hard I press it. I expect it to last me ~4-6 months if I apply twice a day. I also apply in just a few small spots, so that&#x27;s one factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note - I&#x27;m not sure how soon you can apply facial lotion after applying this, but I wait at least a few minutes just to be safe. Be sure to apply one with SPF - that&#x27;s good practice regardless of whether you use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d buy it again and may pick up a second tube so I can have one in my traveling kit and one for home.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, but does not work.</li>
            <li> SkinCeuticals Advanced Pigment Corrector is on a par with Obagi Clear.  I&#x27;ve used Obagi Clear for 15 years and recently tried the SkinCeuticals Corrector.  I am very pleased with the results.  Pricing is substantially less that the Obagi Clear and it does not require a prescription whereas the Obagi does.</li>
            <li> I chose this number of stars because basically this product is a placebo. I have been using it faithfully since purchase and there has been 0 change in my cheek spot, the one I really want to go away.</li>
            <li> I have a nickel sized dark spot on my left cheek.  It was so dark people thought I had dirt on my skin.  This has made it noticeably lighter.  I use it morning and night all over my face.  Another area on my face had started to become dark and it is now completely gone.</li>
            <li> The price for this product sure is steep. Now had it only worked, I wouldn&#x27;t have given it another thought. Though this product feels great on your skin upon application and has a pleasant smell, that&#x27;s about all it&#x27;s good for. I was super disappointed since I was seeking a product without hydroquinone and this was recommended to me by a plastic surgeon and has been touted as an effective pigment corrector. But it didn&#x27;t live up to that claim, and one empty bottle and a month later, I find myself 85$ poorer but all the more wiser for my purchase. Oh well. My quest for an effective fading cream continues.</li>
            <li> Number 1 products......</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried in a long time for my skin.  I am 54 and this has brightened my skin tone,&lt;br /&gt;taken away some subtle spots on my face that were not coming off with Renova/Tretinoin creams.&lt;br /&gt;This is an exceptional product and I will purchase it again here because the price is unbeatable compared to&lt;br /&gt;Ulta or Sephora, etc.  This gets an A++ from me!  My skin glows from it.</li>
            <li> The product DOESN&#x27;T WORK!!!  Please save your money for something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have moderate pigmentations on my cheeks and I took pictures before and after, I compared those pictures and I do not see anything has changed at all.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product (Skinceuticals Advanced Pigment Corrector) for 9 weeks, twice a day - morning and night and followed the instructions on the box.  In hope to see any changes to my pigmentations, I combined this product with Skinceuticals Phyto+ in the last 5 weeks and both products do not deliver any results at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Skinceuticals today, their representative - Valerie - is very vague, she can&#x27;t even give me any clear answers at all to any questions I have regarding to the product.  Her ONLY recommendation is to see a professional before I get any products for my face. So, don&#x27;t bother to buy anything from Skinceuticals, just go to your dermatologist for anything you need for your face, according to her. And when your dermatologist recommends Skinceuticals, please say NO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, she said Amazon is not their authorized dealer so they do not want and can&#x27;t do anything to back up their products. NICE customer service Valerie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, Amazon Customer Service is The Best! 😊</li>
            <li> As with all SkinCeuticals, this is somewhat pricey. After a month of usage I can&#x27;t really tell if any of my age spots have faded or not. Does a nice job moisturizing.</li>
            <li> rec&#x27;d product right away and in great condition. have noticed my sun spots getting lighter after only 4-5 uses. thanks</li>
            <li> This is a white lotion, you need 2 pumps to cover your face and neck.  When it won&#x27;t pump out anymore, I have my husband break off the silver tip so I can get in the bottle with a q-tip and scrape out the remaining product inside (there is about 1-2 more applications in there after the pump won&#x27;t pump anymore out which I hate)!  I use their Phloretin CF serum (antioxidants), wait 3 minutes, then use the Phyto + botanical gel for hyper pigmentation (arbututin, kojic acid which lighten and brighten), wait a couple minutes, then apply this advanced pigment corrector (Hydroxyphenoxy propionic acid and yeast extract which inhibit melanin, ellagic acid which fights free radicals, salicylic acid which exfoliates).  Then over this I use Oil Of Olay Pro X with SPF 35.  I think it is the combo of this SkinCeuticals Advanced Pigment corrector and the Olay Pro X, that when used together I notice I don&#x27;t have shiny, oily skin.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day, and I like that this kinda sucks up the oil on my face.  Also I have noticed a lightening of my sun spots.  But for one of their Phyto+ bottles, I use 2-3 bottles of this stuff, so stock up!  Also - I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so at night I use retina a and Ambi fade cream (hydroquinone) to maximize the fading of my spots.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked to reduce pigment at all! It is moisturizing, and I give it some credit for that. Otherwise, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, really does work. Worth the price,amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve shopped around all products in this brand that have tried so far work excellent</li>
            <li> I am 58 and have been trying different products for years to get rid of the dark spots. You get what you pay for. This products works. I saw a difference in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Amazon always strives to give the best price and keeps on top of the best products.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, and I do believe it is working very well.  I have fair skin and have always had freckles, but as I aged there are also age spots.  This product seems to be fading them and my skin is looking a lot clearer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many months and I can&#x27;t see much difference in dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had melasma on both sides of my neck for years. Nothing would get rid of it so I purchased this without &amp;#34;great expectations.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I am stunned at how well it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;m still on my first bottle, and already the brown blotches have faded more than 50%. I&#x27;m reordering another bottle right now. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great product works well 2 times a day . Highly recommend this product. Skin Ceuticals  has great products . Must buy</li>
            <li> My friends have noticed the visible effects of the Skinceuticals pigment corrector on my skin</li>
            <li> This is a pump bottle. The pump broke shortly about a month after I bought it. Also, I have seen no improvement in the age spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED IT ALL, AND I LIKE THIS PRODUCT,  IT DOES NOT IRRITATE MY SKIN BUT I ALWAYS WANT A MIRICLE WORKER FOR PIGMENTATION AND AFTER 5 WEEKS MY SKIN DID NOT GET WORSE BUT IT DID SEEM A BIT CLEARER.  I MUST SAY FOR ME IT WAS BETTER THAN ELURE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already seen results and I&#x27;ve been using this product about a month!</li>
            <li> Using it for the last 2 months. The sun marks stay the same...</li>
            <li> I have done IPL and retin A.  Both are pretty harsh and I found this product to be as effective as both.  I read about this as one of the best products in Allure magazine and I completely agree.  I used in all over my face but found the most significant results on the hyperpigmentation due to tons of sun as a teenage under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product. Shipped quickly and was a great price point. I would purchase it again from this company.</li>
            <li> After using this product for two weeks, I could see promised results.</li>
            <li> Great, recommended. Need a prescription.</li>
            <li> Great product - good service</li>
            <li> Helps even tone and coloring. Works.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. Expiring date was a year and a half away.</li>
            <li> Started using less than 1 week ago. I bought it specifically for 2 dark sunspots I&#x27;ve had on my forehead for about a year. I have already seen quite a bit of lightening on both spots in a short amount of time. I only use a small amout 2 times a day on those spots. I&#x27;ve been using a retinol cream from the dermatologist for a few years and that didn&#x27;t help at all. Would highly recommend this product for sun spots.</li>
            <li> It is sold in my top dermatologist&#x27;s office .  It has got to be good.  I find my complexion was less red after the first tube of it.  I use it every morning.</li>
            <li> It definitely worked for me. My dark spots are lighter now. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love all of my skinCeuticals products and was expecting to feel the same about this one this Especially after I read all the reviews. I have been using this for a month now and do not see even the slightest change or difference in  my dark spots not even the small light ones. I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gradual fade, but safe to use if pregnant as it is hydroquinone and retinol free. Works great! Just wish the tube lasted me longer than 6-7 weeks (at 2x day face and neck)</li>
            <li> Use approximately 3 times and it&#x27;s either empty or broken. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> It is not giving results as expected. Used about half of it but i am not seeing any better. They said formula is improved and will give better results but i think they are talking better results on income statement instead on client face.</li>
            <li> works great. already seeing improvement</li>
            <li> This is the best face lotion I have ever used.  After using it twice a day for a month my skin was noticeably clearer, brighter and more even-toned.  I have mild redness in the t-zone and hyperpigmentation along my jawline.  Much improved after using this product.</li>
            <li> Over a month of use consistanly... no noticable difference</li>
            <li> Definitely lightened up the redness and pigmentation on my face.  I am very pleased with the results!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the skin fading cream it has made her blemishes lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad because this is third week and my skin looks the same. Spots still there.</li>
