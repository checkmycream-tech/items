            <li>This line is awesome period.</li>
            <li>Another reason for the additional star is I did not realize how awesome this product smells.  </li>
            <li>Nourishing Mask was the perfect rememdy!</li>
            <li>And the smell if wonderful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a very good product which does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>It does smell good though!</li>
            <li>It makes a great after shower conditioner and eliminates flyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>I chose this item because I hoped that its hydrating properties would alleviate the itchy scalp issues I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great treatment that doesn;&#x27; cost a lot and fits well into my routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have found an affordable product that does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>Nourishing Mask smells great.</li>
            <li>This mask does a fair job of helping with that, but it is not an ideal product for my needs.</li>
            <li>I appreciate an inexpensive (compared to salon products) great mask.</li>
            <li>It would be great anytime</li>
            <li>I will say, my hair is remarkably shiny after use of this product.</li>
            <li>Imagine my pleasant surprise when I read the ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This might be good for longer hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any scalp issues before using this product, so I can&#x27;t say if it is good for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I really loved this aspect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a smell I can describe but it smells so good.  </li>
            <li>and I have found that it is good for my hair.</li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s official: I am ordering another of this on my own dime because I loved it</li>
            <li>Excellent product, it really his rates your hair.</li>
            <li>a nice deeper conditioning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is advertised for dandruff, but if you have the scaling itchy kind, it&#x27;s just wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>best results, really rub and massage it into the scalp thoroughly.</li>
            <li>but if you want your hair to look lively and smell delicious then I suggest you hit \\&quot;add to cart\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>The best part about the Clear Scalp and Hair Mask is its price.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasant and it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t go more than that</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it helps my scalp or not, but it gives my hair a more moisturized feel.</li>
            <li>(I get migraines from many perfumes).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spend more on the &amp;#34;higher priced&amp;#34; brands - this product does the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Mask is a great product.</li>
            <li>have issues with my hair and scalp, but since switching to a cleansing conditioner (Hair One here on Amazon), it&#x27;s been much better.</li>
            <li>(Just the Hair One, it&#x27;s more like 4</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>tie haha - great value.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Suave is better.</li>
            <li>The scent is okay --</li>
            <li>After I use it my hair feels smoother and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>And I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>It could be a bit more smooth as I still had some tangles to battle</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s a good product that does the job!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use -</li>
            <li>* Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It  might not work so well if the person doesn&#x27;t have a dry scalp problem to begin with, but it did leave the hair looking good and feeling nice.</li>
            <li>The smell is not as lovely as say Herbal Essence, but it&#x27;s still pleasant enough that I enjoy using it, and the cactus extract also does wonders for fine hair.</li>
            <li>It is noticeably more effective than the conditioner from the same line, and leaves my wife&#x27;s hair very soft and does a great job detangling it.  </li>
            <li>price might seem a bit steep compared to more bargain products, but given what you&#x27;re paying for this is worth the price.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s especially perfect for after a few days with chlorinated pool water.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for newer and better products when it comes to skin and hair, So when the opportunity arises to try out a new product to review for Amazon&#x27;s Vine program, I jump it, hoping to either discover something fabulous or be able to give others a chance to learn from my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally I am the type of person who likes to saves my Sundays for catching up on my shows and pampering myself.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used several of the Clear products and have been very impressed.  </li>
            <li>put it on clean hair and leave it in for 3 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>Not too perfumed, but clean.</li>
            <li>Ok, my hair gets very frizzy when its humid, but this stuff does a good job of controlling it-- better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair very smooth and soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>It works really well to make my hair softer, hydrated and more manageable.</li>
            <li>A while ago, I got another Clear hair product, which I liked, so I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>It is a good supplement to my regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>I can run my fingers through my hair with no snags... pretty cool!</li>
            <li>I always love their products, so I had high hopes for this mask.</li>
            <li>I love Clear&#x27;s hair products!!</li>
            <li>Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy with “intense hydration” is described as a “deep hydrating treatment mask” meant to leave hair “strong and beautiful.”</li>
            <li>It also helps calm an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I have used products 3x the price of the Clear Hair and Scalp Mask and they have not done anything more for my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not crazy about all the chemicals listed in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got the clear shampoo and conditioner, which I love, but this mask just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li>- it has a light scent and goes on like a rich mouse - but I am deducting a star because when I read &amp;#34;intense hydration&amp;#34; in the description I expected a bit more from it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time messing around with hair-care products, but Clear Scalp &amp; Hair is super easy and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels healthier right away.</li>
            <li>It rinses out easily and leaves hair soft, sleek, and shiny.</li>
            <li>hair runs to pretty oily, which was helped by not using shampoo anymore.</li>
            <li>I treat is exactly like my fake-Wen.</li>
            <li>By pampering, I mean giving myself a mani &amp; pedi, shaving (lol) and hair treatments.  </li>
            <li>The color when the product came out was kind of odd</li>
            <li>I have noticed an improvement in my dry scalp and expect more with continued use.</li>
            <li>- I put it on my whole hair and the hair closest to my scalp was greasy all day</li>
            <li>(Using this with argan oil after showering really helps a lot.)  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in how my scalp felt after using this.</li>
            <li>Intense Hydration</li>
            <li>but this really did nourish my hair and help with the split</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve really appreciated what this has done with my hair.</li>
            <li>Intense Hydration</li>
            <li>The consistency is close to toothpaste and therefore really clings to your scalp and penetrates your hair.</li>
            <li>Intense Hydration</li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with the shampoo my hair is definitely shinier than it was when I was using the more natural products from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>Intense Hydration</li>
            <li>* Makes hair really soft&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably still look for more products to try, but Clear Scalp &amp; Hair will likely remain in my rotation.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much out of this product, but it&#x27;s doing a nice job at keeping my normally coarse, dry hair under control and super soft.</li>
            <li>I left it on for a little more than the three minutes the label says to, and my hair was easy to comb through (</li>
            <li>Clear&#x27;s &#x27;Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Mask&#x27; does exactly what it sets out to do.  </li>
            <li>(The active ingredient in many dandruff shampoos.)  </li>
            <li>This nourishing mask is a little thicker than regular conditioner and has a pleasant, not-too-distinct smell.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thinning hair that I color,  spray, mousse, blow dry and curl - so my hair takes a beating.  </li>
            <li>If you have long hair, this is really important.</li>
            <li>If I use it more than once a week it leaves my hair looking and feeling a bit weighed down.</li>
            <li>The Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Mask works as well as any other product of this type that I have tried, and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;snot necessary to leave it in for that long, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt and after I rinse it out, my hair feels very clean.</li>
            <li>I will continue using the Clear Scalp and Hair Mask and highly recommend it to anyone who is in need of hair repair!  </li>
            <li>It is pretty much a product that can be used daily, but I prefer to use it once or twice a week to give my hair</li>
            <li>I then will style as I normally do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth a try, especially at the price.</li>
            <li>I notice that if I use it too often that my (fine) hair ends up feeling flat and like there is residue left on it.</li>
            <li>and I had to shampoo 3 times to get it out the next day, which shows you how very hydrating this mask is!  </li>
            <li>I give this product 4 stars because it works better than more expensive products we have tried, such as Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Hair and Scalp Treatment.</li>
            <li>that I have had time to use this product consistently, I raised the rating from 3 to 4 stars because when I use this product, it makes my leftover curls from my perm (big disaster) bouncy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt exactly the same afterward.</li>
            <li>It was much thicker, but had the same effect as my normal conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love this deep conditioning treatment; leaves hair soft without weighting it down.  </li>
            <li>The mask is thick, smells fresh, and leaves your hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>After washing your hair, apply Clear Scalp  and Hair Beauty Therapy to your scalp, let it remain in your hair for three minutes, then rinse.</li>
            <li>I used this product in conjunction with the Clear Shampoo</li>
            <li>Clear Scalp and Hair</li>
            <li>Clear Scalp and Hair</li>
            <li>days\\&quot; so that is when a product like Clear Scalp and Hair</li>
            <li>Again, Clear has come out with another surperior hair product.</li>
            <li>Clear Scalp and Hair</li>
            <li>Wash, rinse, add Clear Scalp &amp; Hair, wait ...</li>
            <li>* Works even without the use of the products in the Clear line&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really well, I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>Just one use will soothe a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>For the latter purpose, it really didn&#x27;t alleviate any of the itchiness, but that may have been an unreasonable expectation on my part.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at how soft it made my hair.the price was unbeatable compare to the retail store ...</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>After two applications my hair felt springy and soft.</li>
            <li>Specialty scalp products can be wildly overpriced.</li>
            <li>Most importantly for me at least, the mask rinses out easily and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue that can weigh hair down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li>Part the very wet hair and use fingertips to deposit it right on the scalp, then try to massage it along your scalp to cover all the area.</li>
            <li>its usually knotty) and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is not heavily scented, in fact the smell is barely noticeable at all.</li>
            <li>This works fine as long as you don&#x27;t use it too frequently, as it is somewhat heavy.</li>
            <li>- this stuff works really well for dry hair!</li>
            <li>I end up using way too much, this tube won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>As I get older I am experiencing dry scalp issues</li>
            <li>As I mentioned, my hair is dry in the hair, oily at the scalp if I use normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a little worried that it would be too heavy for my fine and straight hair, but once a week it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li>Unlike other products that treat only the hair, this works the whole head.</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair that tends to get frizzy and dry easily.</li>
            <li>Another added benefit is that when I use this, I don&#x27;t need any other product afterward, i.e. hair serum (which I normally need for my frizzy hair).</li>
            <li>My hair really does seem less damaged now that I use a mask 1-2 times a week in place of regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the subtle, natural scent.</li>

            <li> Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy with “intense hydration” is described as a “deep hydrating treatment mask” meant to leave hair “strong and beautiful.”</li>
            <li> It also helps calm an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I have used products 3x the price of the Clear Hair and Scalp Mask and they have not done anything more for my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not crazy about all the chemicals listed in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the clear shampoo and conditioner, which I love, but this mask just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> - it has a light scent and goes on like a rich mouse - but I am deducting a star because when I read &amp;#34;intense hydration&amp;#34; in the description I expected a bit more from it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time messing around with hair-care products, but Clear Scalp &amp; Hair is super easy and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels healthier right away.</li>
            <li> It rinses out easily and leaves hair soft, sleek, and shiny.</li>
            <li> hair runs to pretty oily, which was helped by not using shampoo anymore.</li>
            <li> I treat is exactly like my fake-Wen.</li>
            <li> By pampering, I mean giving myself a mani &amp; pedi, shaving (lol) and hair treatments.  </li>
            <li> The color when the product came out was kind of odd</li>
            <li> I have noticed an improvement in my dry scalp and expect more with continued use.</li>
            <li> - I put it on my whole hair and the hair closest to my scalp was greasy all day</li>
            <li> (Using this with argan oil after showering really helps a lot.)  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in how my scalp felt after using this.</li>
            <li> Intense Hydration</li>
            <li> but this really did nourish my hair and help with the split</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve really appreciated what this has done with my hair.</li>
            <li> Intense Hydration</li>
            <li> The consistency is close to toothpaste and therefore really clings to your scalp and penetrates your hair.</li>
            <li> Intense Hydration</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with the shampoo my hair is definitely shinier than it was when I was using the more natural products from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Intense Hydration</li>
            <li> * Makes hair really soft&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably still look for more products to try, but Clear Scalp &amp; Hair will likely remain in my rotation.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much out of this product, but it&#x27;s doing a nice job at keeping my normally coarse, dry hair under control and super soft.</li>
            <li> I left it on for a little more than the three minutes the label says to, and my hair was easy to comb through (</li>
            <li> Clear&#x27;s &#x27;Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Mask&#x27; does exactly what it sets out to do.  </li>
            <li> (The active ingredient in many dandruff shampoos.)  </li>
            <li> This nourishing mask is a little thicker than regular conditioner and has a pleasant, not-too-distinct smell.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thinning hair that I color,  spray, mousse, blow dry and curl - so my hair takes a beating.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair, this is really important.</li>
            <li> If I use it more than once a week it leaves my hair looking and feeling a bit weighed down.</li>
            <li> The Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Mask works as well as any other product of this type that I have tried, and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;snot necessary to leave it in for that long, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt and after I rinse it out, my hair feels very clean.</li>
            <li> I will continue using the Clear Scalp and Hair Mask and highly recommend it to anyone who is in need of hair repair!  </li>
            <li> It is pretty much a product that can be used daily, but I prefer to use it once or twice a week to give my hair</li>
            <li> I then will style as I normally do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth a try, especially at the price.</li>
            <li> I notice that if I use it too often that my (fine) hair ends up feeling flat and like there is residue left on it.</li>
            <li> and I had to shampoo 3 times to get it out the next day, which shows you how very hydrating this mask is!  </li>
            <li> I give this product 4 stars because it works better than more expensive products we have tried, such as Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Hair and Scalp Treatment.</li>
            <li> that I have had time to use this product consistently, I raised the rating from 3 to 4 stars because when I use this product, it makes my leftover curls from my perm (big disaster) bouncy and shiny.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt exactly the same afterward.</li>
            <li> It was much thicker, but had the same effect as my normal conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Love this deep conditioning treatment; leaves hair soft without weighting it down.  </li>
            <li> The mask is thick, smells fresh, and leaves your hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> After washing your hair, apply Clear Scalp  and Hair Beauty Therapy to your scalp, let it remain in your hair for three minutes, then rinse.</li>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with the Clear Shampoo</li>
            <li> Clear Scalp and Hair</li>
            <li> Clear Scalp and Hair</li>
            <li> days\\&quot; so that is when a product like Clear Scalp and Hair</li>
            <li> Again, Clear has come out with another surperior hair product.</li>
            <li> Clear Scalp and Hair</li>
            <li> Wash, rinse, add Clear Scalp &amp; Hair, wait ...</li>
            <li> * Works even without the use of the products in the Clear line&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really well, I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Just one use will soothe a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> For the latter purpose, it really didn&#x27;t alleviate any of the itchiness, but that may have been an unreasonable expectation on my part.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at how soft it made my hair.the price was unbeatable compare to the retail store ...</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> After two applications my hair felt springy and soft.</li>
            <li> Specialty scalp products can be wildly overpriced.</li>
            <li> Most importantly for me at least, the mask rinses out easily and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue that can weigh hair down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> Part the very wet hair and use fingertips to deposit it right on the scalp, then try to massage it along your scalp to cover all the area.</li>
            <li> its usually knotty) and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is not heavily scented, in fact the smell is barely noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> This works fine as long as you don&#x27;t use it too frequently, as it is somewhat heavy.</li>
            <li> - this stuff works really well for dry hair!</li>
            <li> I end up using way too much, this tube won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> As I get older I am experiencing dry scalp issues</li>
            <li> As I mentioned, my hair is dry in the hair, oily at the scalp if I use normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little worried that it would be too heavy for my fine and straight hair, but once a week it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products that treat only the hair, this works the whole head.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that tends to get frizzy and dry easily.</li>
            <li> Another added benefit is that when I use this, I don&#x27;t need any other product afterward, i.e. hair serum (which I normally need for my frizzy hair).</li>
            <li> My hair really does seem less damaged now that I use a mask 1-2 times a week in place of regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the subtle, natural scent.</li>
            <li> For someone with thick hair, this product isn&#x27;t useful.</li>
            <li> You massage it down into the roots, unlike a normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> Days I use this mask, I can see and feel a big difference in my hair, especially when it comes to using my flat iron.</li>
            <li> The cream is concentrated, smooth and thick, so a little bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I use it, after I rinse out my shampoo, I towel dry my hair just a bit and then apply the mask from root to tip, massaging my scalp and then combing through it entirely.</li>
            <li> I give it only 4 stars because it did not completely take care of my husband&#x27;s on going dry scalp</li>
            <li> you have thinning or otherwise very unhealthy hair, I strongly recommend also taking 25mg of zinc, 400i.u.</li>
            <li> I started using this Clear product a few months ago.</li>
            <li> just wash your hair per your normal routine, rinse, then apply this mask while you continue your usual ablution rituals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By hair treatment, I mean that I will lather my hair with whatever hair treatment product catches my eye and then put on a plastic cap and leave it on the whole day and sometimes night before washing it off.  </li>
            <li> Especially on all the rainy days this month, this has been a godsend to keep my hair from corkscrewing into a total mess.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers did not like the scent, so I agree it is a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that tends to get extremely dry in the summer.</li>
            <li> Instead my hair felt dry (as if I hadn&#x27;t used ANY conditioner) and coated with a greasy substance.</li>
            <li> As the name says, it is clear, and has very little noticable fragrance, even out of the container.</li>
            <li> I would recommend only putting it below ear length and down</li>
            <li> It weighed down my short hair</li>
            <li> This hair masque just isn&#x27;t enough for the texture of my hair which is thick and coarse, and very long.</li>
            <li> would only recommend this product to someone with very thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to start looking dry, frizzy and broken if I don&#x27;t use a deep conditioner regularly, so I decided to give this one a try</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long - just leave it on for a few minutes after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I think if you use conventional shampoo, this will help replenish the stripping in your scalp.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to those with coarse thick hair.</li>
            <li> I worry though that this may weigh down those with thinner hair or curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down or make it greasy.</li>
            <li> Noticeably less dandruff when used properly&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it does leave your hair a little nicer.</li>
            <li> really make my hair feel softer and less frizzy, which is something I feel I desperately need in the Florida summer with our humidity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have terrible dry scalp, and most dandruff shampoos/conditioners do not seem to help.</li>
            <li> I recently made some bad hair dying decisions that left my hair dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> think that it is a little too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> The scent has lingered for a few hours, but hasn&#x27;t bothered me</li>
            <li> There are quite a few conditioners on the market</li>
            <li> used this product in place of my usual, weekly hair mask.</li>
            <li> If you are a prime member then by all means, price compare and if you are lazy like me, you might just hit \\&quot;add to cart\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if they sell it there</li>
            <li> My hair is not its old silky self and this helps eliminate the frizzy problem and although I may never see silky again, it reduces the ill effects!</li>
            <li> but I believe they recommend at least once a week.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, luxourious masque for your hair.</li>
            <li> This has a thick and almost sticky feel to it.</li>
            <li> and I found that as a conditioner it has performed flawlessly on my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is in the summer I get this awful itching and scaling and usually have to use something like some Extra Strength dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Who would purchase a hair care product that promised to make hair weak and</li>
            <li> Too bad it didn&#x27;t work in the way I expected.</li>
            <li> This product feels too thin to be an &amp;#34;intense hydration&amp;#34; mask.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, none of the cleansing conditioners are made for dandruff, including the Hair One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Scent isn&#x27;t too bad, and I don&#x27;t notice it after I rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> It stops the itching and scaling, which sometimes itches so badly that I scratch until it bleeds.</li>
            <li> My hair did seem cleaner and freer from those annoying and sometimes painful tangles after use, but the long-term effect will require long-term use.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Conditions hair really well, I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Just one use will soothe a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, it really his rates your hair.</li>
            <li> like it says, there is a mixture of white hydrating cream and an aqua stripe (mixed together) containing cactus extract for hydration.  I would recommend only putting it below ear length and down - I put it on my whole hair and the hair closest to my scalp was greasy all day and I had to shampoo 3 times to get it out the next day, which shows you how very hydrating this mask is!  It says to only keep on for 3 minutes, I think I did about 5 so don&#x27;t go more than that - this stuff works really well for dry hair!</li>
            <li> This is a thick, luxourious masque for your hair. It doesn&#x27;t take long - just leave it on for a few minutes after shampooing. It rinses out easily and leaves hair soft, sleek, and shiny. It makes a great after shower conditioner and eliminates flyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those with wiry or frizzy hair who want to take control of it.</li>
            <li> Ok, my hair gets very frizzy when its humid, but this stuff does a good job of controlling it-- better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.  (Using this with argan oil after showering really helps a lot.)  Scent isn&#x27;t too bad, and I don&#x27;t notice it after I rinse it out.  I don&#x27;t know if it helps my scalp or not, but it gives my hair a more moisturized feel.</li>
            <li> This nourishing mask is a little thicker than regular conditioner and has a pleasant, not-too-distinct smell. I left it on for a little more than the three minutes the label says to, and my hair was easy to comb through (its usually knotty) and smooth. I can run my fingers through my hair with no snags... pretty cool! The scent has lingered for a few hours, but hasn&#x27;t bothered me (I get migraines from many perfumes). Great value.</li>
            <li> The Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Mask works as well as any other product of this type that I have tried, and I have tried many.  I have fine, thinning hair that I color,  spray, mousse, blow dry and curl - so my hair takes a beating.  Once I discovered Hair &amp;#34;Masks&amp;#34; I was  hooked.  My hair really does seem less damaged now that I use a mask 1-2 times a week in place of regular conditioner.  The best part about the Clear Scalp and Hair Mask is its price.  I have used products 3x the price of the Clear Hair and Scalp Mask and they have not done anything more for my hair.  I will continue using the Clear Scalp and Hair Mask and highly recommend it to anyone who is in need of hair repair!  Don&#x27;t spend more on the &amp;#34;higher priced&amp;#34; brands - this product does the job.</li>
            <li> I chose this item because I hoped that its hydrating properties would alleviate the itchy scalp issues I&#x27;ve experienced. For the latter purpose, it really didn&#x27;t alleviate any of the itchiness, but that may have been an unreasonable expectation on my part. I will say, my hair is remarkably shiny after use of this product. It&#x27;s easy to use - just wash your hair per your normal routine, rinse, then apply this mask while you continue your usual ablution rituals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not crazy about all the chemicals listed in the ingredients. I didn&#x27;t find the scent to be overbearing.  The only reason I took off one star was because of the amount of product I&#x27;d need to use if I were to incorporate this into my beauty routine on a regular basis.  My hair is of a medium thickness and falls about 2 inches below my shoulders, so I end up using a lot of the tube (already half-way gone after 3 uses).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very good product which does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Clear&#x27;s &#x27;Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Mask&#x27; does exactly what it sets out to do.  It is noticeably more effective than the conditioner from the same line, and leaves my wife&#x27;s hair very soft and does a great job detangling it.  As an added bonus it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price might seem a bit steep compared to more bargain products, but given what you&#x27;re paying for this is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for newer and better products when it comes to skin and hair, So when the opportunity arises to try out a new product to review for Amazon&#x27;s Vine program, I jump it, hoping to either discover something fabulous or be able to give others a chance to learn from my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Mask is a great product. I don&#x27;t regularly use the shampoo and conditioner, but I do like this mask as a weekly &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34;. It is pretty much a product that can be used daily, but I prefer to use it once or twice a week to give my hair a nice deeper conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;It really make my hair feel softer and less frizzy, which is something I feel I desperately need in the Florida summer with our humidity.&lt;br /&gt;As for ho I use it, after I rinse out my shampoo, I towel dry my hair just a bit and then apply the mask from root to tip, massaging my scalp and then combing through it entirely. Then I leave it on for about 5 minutes or so. It&#x27;snot necessary to leave it in for that long, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt and after I rinse it out, my hair feels very clean. I then will style as I normally do. Days I use this mask, I can see and feel a big difference in my hair, especially when it comes to using my flat iron. I find it looks shinier and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great treatment that doesn;&#x27; cost a lot and fits well into my routine.</li>
            <li> This has a thick and almost sticky feel to it. The scent is very pleasant and it makes my hair feel soft. It smooths out the flyaway&#x27;s. I like it.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on this product. I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in how my scalp felt after using this. I didn&#x27;t have scalp issues to begin with. It weighed down my short hair and I had to wash this out. This might be good for longer hair.</li>
            <li> Love this deep conditioning treatment; leaves hair soft without weighting it down.  I comb it through an let it sit for 2 or 3 minutes before rinsing out…leaves hair manageable and repairs split ends.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I waited to review this product until I had used the entire bottle to see if it was something I would purchase. Now, it&#x27;s official: I am ordering another of this on my own dime because I loved it so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have issues with my hair and scalp, but since switching to a cleansing conditioner (Hair One here on Amazon), it&#x27;s been much better. The only problem is in the summer I get this awful itching and scaling and usually have to use something like some Extra Strength dandruff shampoo. Unfortunately, none of the cleansing conditioners are made for dandruff, including the Hair One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I did not know that this would help dandruff. I requested it because I had read about hair masks and wanted to try one. Imagine my pleasant surprise when I read the ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has pyrthine zinc! (The active ingredient in many dandruff shampoos.)  So, I tried it. And, it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair runs to pretty oily, which was helped by not using shampoo anymore. I just wanted to try this to try a mask, but now it&#x27;s my weekly non-shampoo dandruff treatment. It stops the itching and scaling, which sometimes itches so badly that I scratch until it bleeds. Not anymore. I&#x27;m so thankful to have found this by accident. I don&#x27;t think it is advertised for dandruff, but if you have the scaling itchy kind, it&#x27;s just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried that it would be too heavy for my fine and straight hair, but once a week it&#x27;s really not. As I mentioned, my hair is dry in the hair, oily at the scalp if I use normal shampoo. I think if you use conventional shampoo, this will help replenish the stripping in your scalp. You massage it down into the roots, unlike a normal conditioner. With using the cleansing conditioner and this product, I can only go about two days between cleansing. (Just the Hair One, it&#x27;s more like 4 days.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, really rub and massage it into the scalp thoroughly. I treat is exactly like my fake-Wen. Part the very wet hair and use fingertips to deposit it right on the scalp, then try to massage it along your scalp to cover all the area. If you have long hair, this is really important. This helps your hair, yes, but it&#x27;s meant to replenish your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thinning or otherwise very unhealthy hair, I strongly recommend also taking 25mg of zinc, 400i.u. of vitamin E, and 10,000mcg of biotin every day. Just don&#x27;t overdo it on the zinc - 50mg max per 24 hours, as it is toxic if you get too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and I wholeheartedly recommend this mask. The smell is not as lovely as say Herbal Essence, but it&#x27;s still pleasant enough that I enjoy using it, and the cactus extract also does wonders for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy with “intense hydration” is described as a “deep hydrating treatment mask” meant to leave hair “strong and beautiful.” Well, of course.  Who would purchase a hair care product that promised to make hair weak and hideous?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not meant for daily use. It is intended as a weekly substitute for a conditioner. After washing your hair, apply Clear Scalp  and Hair Beauty Therapy to your scalp, let it remain in your hair for three minutes, then rinse. Simple. My hair did seem cleaner and freer from those annoying and sometimes painful tangles after use, but the long-term effect will require long-term use. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to start looking dry, frizzy and broken if I don&#x27;t use a deep conditioner regularly, so I decided to give this one a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. It works really well to make my hair softer, hydrated and more manageable. My hair looks and feels healthier right away. (Just leave it on for 3 minutes in the shower) It also helps calm an itchy scalp. The scent is light and pleasant. Most importantly for me at least, the mask rinses out easily and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue that can weigh hair down or make it look greasy. I&#x27;m happy to have found an affordable product that does what it says it will. Will be a repeat buyer of this. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with the Clear Shampoo and I found that as a conditioner it has performed flawlessly on my thick hair.  I worry though that this may weigh down those with thinner hair or curly hair.  It made my hair very smooth and soft and easy to manage.  It could be a bit more smooth as I still had some tangles to battle but overall it&#x27;s a good product that does the job!</li>
            <li> I give this product 4 stars because it works better than more expensive products we have tried, such as Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Hair and Scalp Treatment. I give it only 4 stars because it did not completely take care of my husband&#x27;s on going dry scalp problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is not heavily scented, in fact the smell is barely noticeable at all. The cream is concentrated, smooth and thick, so a little bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> This is another product that helps with aging, brittle, fizzy hair. It isn&#x27;t a miracle cure but it does leave your hair a little nicer. My hair is not its old silky self and this helps eliminate the frizzy problem and although I may never see silky again, it reduces the ill effects! Unlike other products that treat only the hair, this works the whole head.</li>
            <li> Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Mask is an inexpensive hair and scalp treatment. It did seem to work well enough by hydrating the head and hair and is rather simple to use. It  might not work so well if the person doesn&#x27;t have a dry scalp problem to begin with, but it did leave the hair looking good and feeling nice.</li>
            <li> This line is awesome period. The mask is thick, smells fresh, and leaves your hair super soft and manageable. It will not stay in a bun and even slides out of a hair tie haha - great value.</li>
            <li> The color when the product came out was kind of odd but this really did nourish my hair and help with the split ends/frizziness.  Especially on all the rainy days this month, this has been a godsend to keep my hair from corkscrewing into a total mess. As well, I didn&#x27;t feel like I was leaving a lot of waxy product after washing, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several of the Clear products and have been very impressed.  There are quite a few conditioners on the market but I&#x27;ve really appreciated what this has done with my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am surprised at how soft it made my hair.the price was unbeatable compare to the retail store ...</li>
            <li> Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Mask smells great. But, that&#x27;s all of the praise that I can give this product. This product feels too thin to be an &amp;#34;intense hydration&amp;#34; mask. It actually just feels like regular, run of the mill conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product in place of my usual, weekly hair mask. My hair definitely felt drier and it looked frizzier and puffier when using this product. On the plus side, this product did help to cover up the medicinal smell of my coal tar shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend this product to someone with very thin, straight hair. For someone with thick hair, this product isn&#x27;t useful.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother.  Suave is better.</li>
            <li> I recently made some bad hair dying decisions that left my hair dry and damaged. This mask does a fair job of helping with that, but it is not an ideal product for my needs. I didn&#x27;t have any scalp issues before using this product, so I can&#x27;t say if it is good for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just put it on clean hair and leave it in for 3 minutes or so. The scent is okay -- not too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that it is a little too heavy for my hair. If I use it more than once a week it leaves my hair looking and feeling a bit weighed down.</li>
            <li> As I get older I am experiencing dry scalp issues so I was eager to try this product. The first thing I noticed was the subtle, natural scent. I don’t like overly floral scents so I really loved this aspect. Other reviewers did not like the scent, so I agree it is a personal preference. The consistency is close to toothpaste and therefore really clings to your scalp and penetrates your hair. It leaves your hair incredibly soft. I have noticed an improvement in my dry scalp and expect more with continued use. Add the incredibly low price and you have a winner.</li>
            <li> Normally I am the type of person who likes to saves my Sundays for catching up on my shows and pampering myself.  By pampering, I mean giving myself a mani &amp; pedi, shaving (lol) and hair treatments.  By hair treatment, I mean that I will lather my hair with whatever hair treatment product catches my eye and then put on a plastic cap and leave it on the whole day and sometimes night before washing it off.  However, not all my Sundays can be \\&quot;pamper myself days\\&quot; so that is when a product like Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Mask comes in.  If I miss a Pamper Sunday, then on Monday while showering I will use this and leave on my hair for the allotted 3 minutes and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it is suppose to do so the only reason I gave it a 3 star is because you can go to your local CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and/or Target and get something similar for the same price without having to pay for shipping.  If you are a prime member then by all means, price compare and if you are lazy like me, you might just hit \\&quot;add to cart\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of 11/7/14:&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have had time to use this product consistently, I raised the rating from 3 to 4 stars because when I use this product, it makes my leftover curls from my perm (big disaster) bouncy and shiny.  I noticed that if I just use use a shampoo with conditioner, my hair looks frizzy and lifeless.  Another reason for the additional star is I did not realize how awesome this product smells.  It&#x27;s not a smell I can describe but it smells so good.  I haven&#x27;t seen this product at my local CVS or Target so I am not sure if they sell it there but if you want your hair to look lively and smell delicious then I suggest you hit \\&quot;add to cart\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This works fine as long as you don&#x27;t use it too frequently, as it is somewhat heavy. I notice that if I use it too often that my (fine) hair ends up feeling flat and like there is residue left on it. Used in conjunction with the shampoo my hair is definitely shinier than it was when I was using the more natural products from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> This is a hydration treatment that does not leave you hair feeling greasy.  As the name says, it is clear, and has very little noticable fragrance, even out of the container.</li>
            <li> I appreciate an inexpensive (compared to salon products) great mask. It would be great anytime but it&#x27;s especially perfect for after a few days with chlorinated pool water.</li>
            <li> Again, Clear has come out with another surperior hair product. I always love their products, so I had high hopes for this mask. And I was not disappointed! I have curly hair that tends to get extremely dry in the summer. Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Mask was the perfect rememdy! After just one use, I noticed my hair was softer. After two applications my hair felt springy and soft. I&#x27;m only using it once a week and I&#x27;m noticing a difference. It does not weigh my hair down or make it greasy. I love Clear&#x27;s hair products!!</li>
            <li> I have terrible dry scalp, and most dandruff shampoos/conditioners do not seem to help. I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time messing around with hair-care products, but Clear Scalp &amp; Hair is super easy and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to use. Wash, rinse, add Clear Scalp &amp; Hair, wait ... rinse, done. Once or twice per week.&lt;br /&gt;* Price. Specialty scalp products can be wildly overpriced. A product under $5? Nice.&lt;br /&gt;* No medicinal, off-putting odor. Ugh, the things I have put in my hair ...&lt;br /&gt;* Makes hair really soft&lt;br /&gt;* Noticeably less dandruff when used properly&lt;br /&gt;* Works even without the use of the products in the Clear line&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Inconsistent results. Might be my experience, but at times it actually aggravated my dandruff. Maybe I didn&#x27;t rinse well enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try, especially at the price. I&#x27;ll probably still look for more products to try, but Clear Scalp &amp; Hair will likely remain in my rotation.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because my hair tends to tangle and get stringy if I don&#x27;t deep condition every once in a while. I have to say this didn&#x27;t work at all for me in that department. It was much thicker, but had the same effect as my normal conditioner.  My hair felt exactly the same afterward. I&#x27;ve got the clear shampoo and conditioner, which I love, but this mask just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that tends to get frizzy and dry easily. I am always looking for products to moisturize and condition my hair. A while ago, I got another Clear hair product, which I liked, so I decided to give this product a try. I started using this Clear product a few months ago. I use it once a week and I have found that it is good for my hair. After I use it my hair feels smoother and more hydrated. It is a good supplement to my regular conditioner. I like it - it has a light scent and goes on like a rich mouse - but I am deducting a star because when I read &amp;#34;intense hydration&amp;#34; in the description I expected a bit more from it.</li>
            <li> This hair masque just isn&#x27;t enough for the texture of my hair which is thick and coarse, and very long. I end up using way too much, this tube won&#x27;t last long. It might be enough moisture for finer, thinner textured hair, it just isn&#x27;t enough for me. It does smell good though! Too bad it didn&#x27;t work in the way I expected. Instead my hair felt dry (as if I hadn&#x27;t used ANY conditioner) and coated with a greasy substance. Yuk.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much out of this product, but it&#x27;s doing a nice job at keeping my normally coarse, dry hair under control and super soft. And the smell if wonderful. Not too perfumed, but clean. Another added benefit is that when I use this, I don&#x27;t need any other product afterward, i.e. hair serum (which I normally need for my frizzy hair). I use it about twice a week but I believe they recommend at least once a week. I would recommend to those with coarse thick hair.</li>
