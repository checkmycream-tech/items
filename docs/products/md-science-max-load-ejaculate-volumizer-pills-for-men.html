            <li>I&#x27;m stIll searching for a good volume zero</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m looking for something more affordable.</li>

            <li>I also drank a full gallon of water that day</li>
            <li>there not to much i can say about this stuff it work great the 1st &amp; 2nd time i used it</li>

            <li>really fills up the sack</li>
            <li>For those real gushers</li>
            <li>What really looking for volume, and extended length of orgasm.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I have never cum so much before.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping as usual with most Amazon.</li>

            <li>The longer I waited past the initial hour the better the blast...</li>
            <li>Ogoplex is the only product I&#x27;ve found so far that has shown any difference.</li>
            <li>At 56, this really helps me perform harder, longer and more...as advertised.</li>
            <li>Other than that nothing else has really happened such as increasing my load volume which is why I bought it to test.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, does absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>just wait a few days and get agressive with your gal or significant other.</li>
            <li>So done with groupon, with their sub par deals and super slow shipping.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference, a big let down</li>
            <li> Yes indeed and then some. 10 stars</li>
            <li> waste of loot....just wait a few days and get agressive with your gal or significant other. its cheaper and makees ya work for it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stIll searching for a good volume zero and this is not the one. These pills actually gave me a headache so not only did they not wok but they had side effects!  Save your money here too!</li>
            <li> upon taking two pills it made my stomach upset to the point of vomating</li>
            <li> As others have reported, this garbage will give you a headache. I also got sick to my stomach and felt like I was going to vomit for a good hour. No increase in load and actually made me develop a very low sex drive when taking these. It&#x27;s just plain flat out garbage, all these increase volume pills are.</li>
            <li> Max load works really well at what it is supposed to do, not really sure what I can say on here but go for it.</li>
            <li> Horrible!&lt;br /&gt;Please, do not wast your money with this.&lt;br /&gt;It did not work!&lt;br /&gt;I am really disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Weak product that has not kept any of its promises thus far. Just took my 7th  dose this morning &amp; have committed to using the entire bottle since I spent the money. I&#x27;ve always had relatively low volume &amp; would love to be porn star messy but I don&#x27;t think MaxL will help me.I&#x27;d been dosing 2 days before I&#x27;d had sex again. I noticed no effect  I  could attribute to the pill even though it&#x27;d been in my system 48hrs yet instructions say dose daily OR an hour before activity. MaxL is completely inferior to RopeX which I&#x27;ve used but I&#x27;m looking for something more affordable. With RopeX I cum so much harder &amp; longer we end up laughing sometimes because it&#x27;s like, hey wetwork, turn it off now. And there&#x27;s about a 30-40% volume increase plus I&#x27;ve noticed also there&#x27;s more precum.  That&#x27;s what happens when I take RopeX as directed. Taking MaxL is like being in the placebo group of a study: nothing. As of today, I&#x27;ll increase my water intake another 8oz, see if that&#x27;s the help MaxL needs but not what the directions say. MaxL is loads &amp; loads inferior to RopeX.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work even though I experience a slight headache from it.</li>
            <li> Does not work. No change at all in volume. Waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t even help keep an erection. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> really fills up the sack</li>
            <li> there not to much i can say about this stuff it work great the 1st &amp; 2nd time i used it but after that it was a dumer</li>
            <li> Great deal on an awesome addition to my love life. Super fast shipping as usual with most Amazon. So done with groupon, with their sub par deals and super slow shipping.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any change since taking this product.  Ogoplex is the only product I&#x27;ve found so far that has shown any difference.</li>
            <li> Great for the wife but the kids HATED it</li>
            <li> Repeat customer over 5 times!</li>
            <li> Seems to work. Everyone is different. The longer I waited past the initial hour the better the blast...</li>
            <li> for the first 5 days I felt sickly like I did learning to smoke cigarettes. Now my load hasn&#x27;t changed one bit, I feel less sickly and I do feel more sexual aroused looking at woman a lot more frequently. Other than that nothing else has really happened such as increasing my load volume which is why I bought it to test.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  At 56, this really helps me perform harder, longer and more...as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product Suck I get headache I wounder why and what ingredients are using &amp; adding on it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, does absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> It worked for me and will continue to use! For those real gushers</li>
            <li> It didnt work for me at all. Im pretty upset about it. I took them as i was instructed too</li>
            <li> Do not buy!!!!!  Gives you a headache and nothing happens!!!!!  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money. Was having a problem with watery and runny ejaculate as well as sexual desires so thought maybe this could help. If anything all it did was give me a headache because one of the ingredients increases your blood pressure and didn&#x27;t thicken anything or increase any sensations. Don&#x27;t waste your time and or money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any change... Bad product. Take it away from the web site.</li>
            <li> It work great for me!</li>
            <li> Great product deliver results.</li>
            <li> I took this product for a month. It seems that  my orgasms were a bit more pleasurable, but it did not increase volume. What really looking for volume, and extended length of orgasm. Overall, no harm, no foul.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all!!!!</li>
            <li> This really works. Take daily for a week then on the day you plan to beat the monkey, take an hour before her yourself worked up a little, then let it go. I have never cum so much before. lol</li>
            <li> I saw a notable difference within a few hours.  I also drank a full gallon of water that day but my orgasm was longer as well!</li>
            <li> It is doing its job so far. I would get it again</li>
