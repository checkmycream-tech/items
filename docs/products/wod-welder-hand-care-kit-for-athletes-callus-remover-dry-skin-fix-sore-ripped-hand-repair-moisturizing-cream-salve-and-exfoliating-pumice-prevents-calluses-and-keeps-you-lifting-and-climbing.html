            <li>I don&#x27;t stress about it if I do because wodwelder is the best product out there.</li>
            <li>The soap is great for exfoliation as well!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and leaves my hands feeling great!</li>
            <li>I also found that it worked great for when bacon splatter burned my wrist.</li>
            <li>It felt so amazing</li>
            <li>(This stuff also smells amazing.)</li>
            <li>The salve is incredibly handy and it&#x27;s also sold separately, so you can keep one in your workout bag and one in your work bag or at home.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best handcare product I have used to date.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, it has improved my calluses and tears a thousand times over.</li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>Thus far, the product has been great.</li>
            <li>This salve, along with good grip tape and sometimes even gloves, can really make the difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be a loyal user for life!</li>
            <li>Helps to make sure your hands heal quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>so rub on and cool it on contact.</li>
            <li>There is nothing fun or cool about ripping your hands.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You might be better off getting the cream as a stand alone (if possible) and some sort of callus shaver.</li>
            <li>It has worked very well so far and the provided instructions were helpful as to when to use the cream versus the balm.</li>
            <li>some activities, such as the false grip, simple hurt your hands and take time to train the skin to be able to manage effectively.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll only get little blister type things now, but they don&#x27;t hurt and come off easily to reveal fresh skin underneath.</li>
            <li>The first time I  tried a sample of this, I had just done the last workout of a competition, 75 deadlifts at 115#.  </li>
            <li>I think with regular use it also prevents your hands from tearing in the first place.  </li>
            <li>In retrospect, I&#x27;m not sure if a pumice stone is effective enough for me to keep my calluses in check, but I don&#x27;t have any complaints about this kit.</li>
            <li>The cream works nicely, but I haven&#x27;t actually tried the salve yet; I&#x27;m not exactly sure of the use case</li>
            <li>Great way to get your hands back in the game after a long week of training or after a wod that tears your hands up.</li>
            <li>After using this as instructed by rubbing out my callouses and keeping my hands moisturizers, I&#x27;ve noticed less tears, less blisters, stronger grip-strength, and much more gains in any pull barbell lift.</li>
            <li>Love this product and the people behind it.</li>
            <li>So I was new to crossfit just over a year ago and was starting to learn the different way to grip the barbell, kettlebell, pull up rig, ect</li>
            <li>I bought this after I ripped my hands for the first time doing heavy barbell work</li>
            <li>No doubt about it: flipping a tractor tire, doing handstands on concrete, endless pull-ups, and even barbell and dumbbell work can knock the heck out of your hands.</li>

            <li> This is by far the best handcare product I have used to date. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and leaves my hands feeling great! My dad even loves it he is a plumber and has dried cracked hands, now they aren&#x27;t anymore!</li>
            <li> So I was new to crossfit just over a year ago and was starting to learn the different way to grip the barbell, kettlebell, pull up rig, ect so I was roughing up my hands pretty bad.

            <li> I crossfit 7 days a week so I am no doubt going to rip. I don&#x27;t stress about it if I do because wodwelder is the best product out there. Gets my hands healed in 1-2 days! Love this product and the people behind it.</li>
            <li> Definitely keeps you in the game. Helps to make sure your hands heal quickly and efficiently. Whether your a crossfit or gymnastics athlete this should be your go to hand care product</li>
            <li> I bought this after I ripped my hands for the first time doing heavy barbell work and I haven&#x27;t ripped since. The salve is incredibly handy and it&#x27;s also sold separately, so you can keep one in your workout bag and one in your work bag or at home. There is nothing fun or cool about ripping your hands. It interferes with your training and every day life outside of the box/barbell club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products are well priced and last for a long time, even with daily use. (This stuff also smells amazing.)</li>
            <li> In retrospect, I&#x27;m not sure if a pumice stone is effective enough for me to keep my calluses in check, but I don&#x27;t have any complaints about this kit. It is what it is. The cream works nicely, but I haven&#x27;t actually tried the salve yet; I&#x27;m not exactly sure of the use case is for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might be better off getting the cream as a stand alone (if possible) and some sort of callus shaver.</li>
            <li> The first time I  tried a sample of this, I had just done the last workout of a competition, 75 deadlifts at 115#.  In ten minutes, my hands weren&#x27;t red and the next morning my callouses were closed\healed up.  Instantly became my go-to, as nothing else works as efficiently.  The soap is great for exfoliation as well!  I also even tried the balm on my face for acne and noticed redness reduced and the open acne spots clearing up within two days.  This is a must have for any athlete using pullup bars or a weighlifting bar.</li>
            <li> It help my hands a lot!!</li>
            <li> No doubt about it: flipping a tractor tire, doing handstands on concrete, endless pull-ups, and even barbell and dumbbell work can knock the heck out of your hands. Now, you need your hands to toughen up, but everyone has a limit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this salve, when used in small amounts, can take the edge off when it comes to worn areas and painful calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, here&#x27;s the deal: some activities, such as the false grip, simple hurt your hands and take time to train the skin to be able to manage effectively. This salve, along with good grip tape and sometimes even gloves, can really make the difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff has helped my husband and me with our tender, torn hands.  I think with regular use it also prevents your hands from tearing in the first place.  I would recommend this to anyone that has callouses or rough hands.</li>
            <li> This product is as described. It has worked very well so far and the provided instructions were helpful as to when to use the cream versus the balm. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Thus far, the product has been great. 2 days after starting to use w.o.d.welder we did a WOD with 50 chest-to-bar pullups and I didn&#x27;t rip. Blood blisters formed, but no ripping. Will continue use!</li>
            <li> Got to the point where my calluses were taking over my hand with all the barbell work I did. After three days, i never got back to that problem. The peppermint smell even got people admiring the effects. The lotions are grade A quality.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product a couple of weeks ago and saw a change almost immediately. I never realized how bad calluses were for my hands. After using this as instructed by rubbing out my callouses and keeping my hands moisturizers, I&#x27;ve noticed less tears, less blisters, stronger grip-strength, and much more gains in any pull barbell lift. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great way to get your hands back in the game after a long week of training or after a wod that tears your hands up.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it has improved my calluses and tears a thousand times over. I&#x27;ll only get little blister type things now, but they don&#x27;t hurt and come off easily to reveal fresh skin underneath.</li>
            <li> Such a great product! This has softened my man hands like crazy while still allowing me to maintain my hard earned calluses!</li>
            <li> Welder Hand Care Kit have saved my hands.  The cream keeps my hands softer than ever.  The handcare stick keeps you splits and tears from drying.  I tore a callous on a finger during a tough pull-up WOD.  I trimmed it up and used the handcare stick and was back on the bar for our next bar WOD 2 days later.  If you CrossFit and you like your hands, I definitely recommend this.</li>
