            <li>This one isnt the same i think but its tottaly great and works better than my others!</li>
            <li>This curling iron is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>I find it easy to use but without the glove.</li>
            <li>it does get very hot though so the glove is a must!</li>
            <li>I kept it, but it is one of the many tools that now sits in my hair cart and is pulled out rarely.</li>
            <li>i did it on freshly washed hair even (harder to curl) and it worked great!</li>
            <li>The performance of this beaut is that of its original pricing.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and this curling iron makes great waves in my hair.  </li>

            <li>I have straight baby fine hair that is very long, so I can see this being a great tool for someone with hair that is more coarse or unruly.</li>
            <li>Not worth the money, although it seemed like a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The wand is very hot which is good for my thick hair and the temperature is even throughout.</li>
            <li>great big loose waves -</li>
            <li>The larger size makes perfect loose waves that last ALL DAY!</li>
            <li>Once you get used to using this time of curling iron it works very well.</li>
            <li>Heats fast, curls hold, gentle on my damaged hair.</li>
            <li>My hair always holds curl very well and stays straight when I straighten it.</li>
            <li>Came fast in the mail</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd curling wand from them, and so far, this is my favorite hair tool company.</li>
            <li>I found it to give my hair static for some reason due to the coating on the barrel.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying, I have only had 1 quick date with this beauty</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have the 35.00 but want one now and go to a local store for one that is most likely tapered &amp; crappy, you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
            <li>So its a high priced wand that must be an older year model (hence the pricing)</li>
            <li>I have pretty fine hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>If you are new to wands they take a little getting use to but this one is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>and it feels very professional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m terrible at doing my own hair and have never been able to use a traditional curling iron (with a clip), but this is so easy to use!</li>
            <li>and my hair is very fine, thin, and straight.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a wand on my hair and it makes tight spiral curls which can be fun sometimes, but for school and work I want something a little bit more professional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about getting another &amp; storing it for that sad day when something happens to this one (to good of a deal that probably wont be avail.</li>
            <li>&gt;( view hair pic)&lt;br /&gt;I researched this specific company and their products and on their website this particular wand was 149.95 on sale for 59.99 and Amazon knocked it out of the park for 35.00.</li>
            <li>Like it so far  Only had it for a day.</li>

            <li> It heats up fast, and curls my &amp;#34;hard to curl hair&amp;#34; great! This is my 2nd curling wand from them, and so far, this is my favorite hair tool company.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to using this time of curling iron it works very well. I wish it had an adjustable temperature setting instead of on/off. The curls come out beautifully though.</li>
            <li> This curling wand it great.  In the picture it does not look like it tapers but it does.  It&#x27;s a little backwards from the normal curling wands you would see, because it tapers from a small to a large end so it gets bigger at the end of the wand.  This wand works excellent. I used it the day after I purchased it and I had beautiful curls that lasted all day and my hair is very fine, thin, and straight.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like these, I got 2 sizes. The curls were ugly and fell out quickly. Waste of my money</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my hair</li>
            <li> Heats fast, curls hold, gentle on my damaged hair. Perfect price.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
            <li> I have bought more expensive curling wands, but this one works just as well. It&#x27;s the perfect size for longer hair. Heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this curler because when I tried my sisters I fell in love with the curls it made in my hair! I already have curly hair, I&#x27;d say about medium wavy/curly coarse hair. My hair always holds curl very well and stays straight when I straighten it. I&#x27;ve used a wand on my hair and it makes tight spiral curls which can be fun sometimes, but for school and work I want something a little bit more professional. This makes the most perfect relaxed waves and they last for days without falling. The wand is very hot which is good for my thick hair and the temperature is even throughout. Very nice packaging and it feels very professional. The swivel cord was a nice touch!</li>
            <li> great big loose waves - i did it on freshly washed hair even (harder to curl) and it worked great! it does get very hot though so the glove is a must!</li>
            <li> Like it so far  Only had it for a day.</li>
            <li> I bought this to curl my hair for my wedding.  It&#x27;s very difficult to use,  the glove doesn&#x27;t really protect you and the curls fell after only a few minutes, even though I used product.  Save yourself a lot of time and use a small flat iron.  Worked so much better than this product.</li>
            <li> Seriously, best curling iron ever! I&#x27;m terrible at doing my own hair and have never been able to use a traditional curling iron (with a clip), but this is so easy to use! (Although, I do need to use the heat glove, otherwise I&#x27;ll burn myself.) I need to use some serious heavy-duty hairspray, but the curls will hold for hours in my otherwise lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> My sister bought the realy on in winners a while ago and i loved it so i went on the search to find it. This one isnt the same i think but its tottaly great and works better than my others! Im happy with it!</li>
            <li> The packaging for this item was perhaps the most lovely and well packaged hair tool I have ever bought. The iron itself though-not life changing. I found it to give my hair static for some reason due to the coating on the barrel. I kept it, but it is one of the many tools that now sits in my hair cart and is pulled out rarely. I have straight baby fine hair that is very long, so I can see this being a great tool for someone with hair that is more coarse or unruly. The very loose curls (which was the look I wanted) did last all day when I did use it though.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!! Came fast in the mail and I love the waves it gives my hair!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent price. Works great!</li>
            <li> I have pretty fine hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well.&lt;br /&gt;This hardly did a thing for me. No curl &amp; hardly any wave. Not worth the money, although it seemed like a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;I get a better wave after leaving braids in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand!!  My hair looks bouncy and wavy and amazing!  If you are new to wands they take a little getting use to but this one is phenomenal.  The larger size makes perfect loose waves that last ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is pretty good. I find it easy to use but without the glove. The glove seems a little unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister who has been wanting it ever since I bought mine! I got myself a curling iron for $175 and this iron works just as good! I wish I had gotten this product. It&#x27;s great and makes amazing curls!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. The curls last all day!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying, I have only had 1 quick date with this beauty and  I must say, I think this relationship its going to be beautiful!!&lt;br /&gt;( view hair pic)&lt;br /&gt;I researched this specific company and their products and on their website this particular wand was 149.95 on sale for 59.99 and Amazon knocked it out of the park for 35.00. I&#x27;m thinking about getting another &amp; storing it for that sad day when something happens to this one (to good of a deal that probably wont be avail. when I need another). So its a high priced wand that must be an older year model (hence the pricing) but I didn&#x27;t have to break the wallet. The performance of this beaut is that of its original pricing. &amp;#34;Ceramic coated non-stick barrel •Tangle-free swivel cord •Includes heat resistant thermal glove •Heavy duty long-life heating element.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other comments mention that is &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t look tapered in the picture but when received it was slightly tapered at the base.&amp;#34; I can tell you the entire wand is 32mm from base to tip. Also, no need for adjustable heating, like most new heating tools it get hotter than needed in seconds. If you don&#x27;t have the 35.00 but want one now and go to a local store for one that is most likely tapered &amp; crappy, you&#x27;ll regret it. Spend the extra $10-$15 and get this.&lt;br /&gt;With more practice (and not much might I add) I will perfect those Kim K inspired flirty curls. Hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this curling iron makes great waves in my hair.  If you&#x27;re looking for a tighter curl I would go with a smaller barrel.</li>
