            <li>I love them because they&#x27;re cute</li>
            <li>and I can get creative with my nails...</li>
            <li>These cute little pearls are just great!</li>
            <li>It took 17 - 28 business days to deliver but it was worth the wait. : )</li>
            <li>Nice product not as many big ones as I wanted</li>
            <li>Items were great, just what I expected...</li>
            <li>They come in different sizes, and there is definetely a good amount for the price.</li>
            <li>and I really saw it as more on the pic</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this set for anyone who enjoys designing nails at home or is just starting out with Nail art, these are a GREAT value for the price</li>
            <li>fast delivery, ordered on the 22nd of may..received on june 5th!!</li>
            <li>My only warning is that if you select no rush shipping you better practice some patience!</li>
            <li>The different sizes were convenient and when the package arrived all the pearls were in a nice organized order.</li>
            <li>SUPER fast shipper.</li>
            <li>I actually ended up buying two more sets (The colored Rhinestones and Metal bling).</li>
            <li>maybe you can add how many actually come in the container!</li>
            <li>Thanks for your fast shipping</li>
            <li>These are tiny and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Shipped out fast as well.</li>
            <li>Yeah thanks, they arrived earlier than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Comes in all sizes comes in early</li>
            <li>BUT them being small is not why it&#x27;s one star less, the tiny ones are great for flowers.</li>
            <li>I love the variety of sizes and especially the very small sizes.  </li>

            <li> BUT them being small is not why it&#x27;s one star less, the tiny ones are great for flowers.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of sizes and especially the very small sizes.  </li>
            <li> more of an off white and the smallest are very small like the point of a ball point pen maybe a little smaller.</li>
            <li> the amount in tray roughly a third of the amount in the picture although that was expected.</li>
            <li> I did select no rush to receive the promotional credits for Amazon instant and whatnot, and because this product(s) have to pass through customs it will take longer than the average product coming from the Amazon warehouse.</li>
            <li> and they were just as I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that the smaller stones were just so small.</li>
            <li> Like a sharp regular HB pencil point small.</li>
            <li> Very tiny to small.</li>
            <li> The down side was there&#x27;s maybe like 100</li>
            <li> They do not shine like the VAGA brand I ordered previously.</li>
            <li> They just pop up slightly but remained in the case.</li>
            <li> but I deporting them into a little tackle box and got all the sandy bits off.</li>
            <li> Still wish I&#x27;d known just how small they were.</li>
            <li> Like literally small.</li>
            <li> it was bubble wrapped and sealed in a small package.</li>
            <li> but I guess you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price $  </li>
            <li> Quantity is very poor</li>
            <li> and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> I bought the multi sized pearls. They are PERFECT for my daughters graduation mani. SUPER fast shipper.</li>
            <li> Yeah thanks, they arrived earlier than I thought it would. I love them they look great on my nails</li>
            <li> Quantity is very poor</li>
            <li> Perfect for the price! Can&#x27;t complain at all :)</li>
            <li> I got these to use in makeup looks and they are really nice. They did have a Sandy type stuff in the packaging but I deporting them into a little tackle box and got all the sandy bits off. Very nice!</li>
            <li> OK.  worked for what I wanted them for, use on cards.  Still wish I&#x27;d known just how small they were.</li>
            <li> just were not different sizes as advertised</li>
            <li> fast delivery, ordered on the 22nd of may..received on june 5th!! the biggest beads are not white like the others..more of an off white and the smallest are very small like the point of a ball point pen maybe a little smaller. the amount in tray roughly a third of the amount in the picture although that was expected. have&#x27;nt tested them out yet but i cant wait to do so. also the middle sized are not as big as the picture...actually they&#x27;re slightly larger than the smallest beads.</li>
            <li> buy the VAGA brans. These are tiny and cheaply made. They do not shine like the VAGA brand I ordered previously. I will not be using these on my nails.</li>
            <li> Received my set of Pearls in the mail yesterday, I am in love!! They come in different sizes, and there is definetely a good amount for the price. I actually ended up buying two more sets (The colored Rhinestones and Metal bling). I am waiting on the Metal bling, but the Rhinestones are just as cute, and the colors in them are awesome! I would highly recommend this set for anyone who enjoys designing nails at home or is just starting out with Nail art, these are a GREAT value for the price and you will not be disappointed. My only warning is that if you select no rush shipping you better practice some patience! I did select no rush to receive the promotional credits for Amazon instant and whatnot, and because this product(s) have to pass through customs it will take longer than the average product coming from the Amazon warehouse. I hope this helps your shopping experience!!</li>
            <li> Hello I just bought these two weeks ago I love them because they&#x27;re cute and I can get creative with my nails... The down side was there&#x27;s maybe like 100 altogether and I really saw it as more on the pic but I guess you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price $  maybe you can add how many actually come in the container!</li>
            <li> For the price-a great product! Shipped out fast as well. (:</li>
            <li> They are supposed to be different size rhinestone beads and they were just as I expected. It&#x27;s just that the smaller stones were just so small. Like literally small. Like a sharp regular HB pencil point small. AND another thing is that it&#x27;s as if they want to pop out of the container and want to jump on me. When I turn the wheel around to see if it got stuck some pop out of there slots, not out of the case. They just pop up slightly but remained in the case. BUT them being small is not why it&#x27;s one star less, the tiny ones are great for flowers. The one star is because some want to pop out the case. BUT  I RECOMMEND you buy it if you want pearls. Also, I got my item earlier than the actually last delivery date and thank goodness it was bubble wrapped and sealed in a small package. It took 17 - 28 business days to deliver but it was worth the wait. : )</li>
            <li> These are great!  I love the variety of sizes and especially the very small sizes.  They look very lovely on the nails.</li>
            <li> The description said Pearl but that&#x27;s not what i received. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> These cute little pearls are just great! The different sizes were convenient and when the package arrived all the pearls were in a nice organized order.</li>
            <li> Comes in all sizes comes in early</li>
            <li> Very tiny to small. No medium to XL.</li>
