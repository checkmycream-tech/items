            <li>I have tried most of the AXE shower scrubs</li>
            <li>The smell is really appealing to women but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>more do I need?</li>

            <li>I love the feel, the fragrance, and the quality of cleansing this scrub provides.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the overpowerg aromas of most of the AXE products, but this stuff works wonders for my skin and body order.  </li>

            <li>I love the scent and my husband likes the scrubbing beads.</li>

            <li>My favorite Axe product.</li>
            <li>We bought so many cause he won&#x27;t use anything else (</li>
            <li>my favorite Axe shower gel.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>(+33% More size),</li>
            <li>maybe there is something better, but i haven&#x27;t found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I make sure to buy it in bulk</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this product a lot.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>From amazon, was a pretty good deal for the price.  </li>
            <li>so well he doesn&#x27;t need a loofah &amp; still moisturizes his dry skin perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time my girlfriend will just say I smell good without really knowing why.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel super clean, and it smells really good to both me and the wife.</li>
            <li>I also have issues with strong perfumes/colognes and the smell of this stuff is very mild.  </li>
            <li>Just easy to use</li>
            <li>I got the Tangerine, as the Lavendar was too strongly scented.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more soon!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I just purchased a huge case somewhere</li>
            <li>He asked if I had experienced the same thing.</li>
            <li>At $3 a bottle with free shipping</li>
            <li>The aroma (perfumieness) is just right and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It lathers nicely, seems to go a long way, and smells nice, while doing an okay job of mildly scrubbing the skin, leaving you with a clean, smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>&quot; (or, even more interesting, the \\&quot;desert minerals\\&quot;) are intended to be, but they seem to clean very well, and they did so without drying my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a clean freak and this stuff gets me clean.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t make women swarm out of the woodwork toward you, but it will most definitely get you clean. :-)</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice smooth feeling, not real dry but also not oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the scent is really neat, and it also leaves you feeling very clean with no residue.  </li>
            <li>It smells odd in the bottle but after a shower it is an excellent compliment to my natural scent</li>
            <li>The Snake Peel is by far my most prefer scent from the Axe body wash line.</li>
            <li>This product is made from toxic chemicals which are absorbed by the skin and are linked to neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and bioaccumulation.</li>
            <li>It took me a dozen tries on different scrubs/washes to come up with this one (the perfect one for me)--and</li>
            <li>It has exfoliating scrub, colorful scrubbing beads, and sparkles.  </li>
            <li>I really feel being pampered as well as getting super scrubby clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it is a light abrasive that makes you clean, yet is gentle on the skin because you dont have to rub or scrub much at all.  </li>
            <li>the suds it produces is just right</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my local store stopped carrying it, and this deal was pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>but I like the snake peel because it has some kind of gritty substance in it that really scrubs away any grease.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;desert minerals\\&quot; are very much like (and might just be) pumice and scrub away dirt and grime thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I got a mild sunburn, and the warm water was more irritating to the burn than the exfoliant was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Last time I ordered it I had to go to the Axe website and find out who the authorized dealers of this particular kind is.  </li>
            <li>Just something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first found out about it around 5 or so</li>
            <li>My personal favorite body wash.  </li>
            <li>Many different fragrances.  </li>
            <li>so I was pretty pumped to see I could buy this online in bulk.</li>
            <li>Sad that this is discontinued, I loved this scrub, I had gone through many and this one met all of my requirements.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>Once I was pretty certain it was the scrub, I gave it up.</li>
            <li>I certainly hope AXE never discontinues Snake Peel.  </li>
            <li>I do not care much about the exfoliating properties or other benefits that are being promoted, the main things that I am concerned about is that the product should work and smell nice, which it does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this product, and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I was never that stinky before- even hours after an intense workout.</li>
            <li>item as described - fast</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a woman, but really like the axe men&#x27;s body sprays.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fussy.  </li>
            <li>I really hope it was not discontinued.</li>
            <li>and it also cleans with what feels like juices and gentle acids from a cactus plant.  </li>
            <li>This is really a man&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li>bought it here as I could get it much cheaper than in the stores and this one still tends to sell out fast where Axe products are sold.  </li>
            <li>Much better than other brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that makes him feel clean.</li>
            <li>Since my husband is a creature of habit, this will last him until he can get comfortable with a \\&quot;new scent\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, but i&#x27;m having a hard time buying it local any more, wal-mart seems to have quit carrying it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to get it  here in Houston, it really cleans your body with the kind of sandy stuff in it.</li>
            <li>but the cost of shipping and handling vwas way too high.</li>
            <li>Sure, it DOES exfoliate, but maybe a little too well --</li>
            <li>I use this after I finish working out and it removes all of my body odor and leaves me fresh for my next work out (wink, wink).</li>
            <li>all of the new Axe shower gels stink to me, so i&#x27;ll be getting the case subscription...</li>
            <li>Snake Peel is one of the few shower gels I&#x27;ve tried which actually lathers up nicely, because it&#x27;s a thicker gel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually very masculine, without being musky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure it out at first, and definitely didn&#x27;t expect it to be my new bodywash.</li>
            <li>I threw my bottle away and they started with a new one, purchased at a different time than the first one.  </li>
            <li>Ive been uisng this scent for the past 10 years now, and i love it.</li>
            <li>, I just can&#x27;t get enough of its smell ;-)</li>
            <li>This really helps get rid of sweat, oil, dirt and old, dead skin and makes you feel so soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Compared to other shower gels, the price is not bad at all because it is so concentrated.  </li>
            <li>Once I picked up on it, I decided to experiment; using it only on certain days to see if I&#x27;d get that signature stink.</li>
            <li>The scent is...nonexistant, as far as I can tell, so you won&#x27;t need to worry about reeking of Axe BEFORE you use the bodyspray.</li>
            <li>Find a friend who lives near a TJ and have them ship you one of each scent.  </li>
            <li>[...]Consider some type of natural hemp soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is by far</li>
            <li>when I use it, I find my skin tends to feel a little on the oily side, but it does feel clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;possibly they could come out with a snake peel 2 with extra abrasives for when one is really muddy or dirty, but for everyday use the product is near perfect.</li>
            <li>Axe is fairly good at putting interesting sounding buzzwords on their packaging that don&#x27;t really mean anything when you use the product, but overall, it&#x27;s still a good product, despite the useless marketing lingo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to an earlier reviewer who complained of dry skin,</li>
            <li>stunk--didn&#x27;t smell sexy like their sprays,&lt;br /&gt;few scrubbing nubs--not enough to accomplish anything,&lt;br /&gt;had to work hard to get the nubs off me,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>A couple weeks later, one of my roommates commented to me that he thought the new bodywash was making him stink by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Although it may very well \\&quot;exfoliate to remove dirt and dry</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer stated, this stuff will dry out your skin if you use it too much.  </li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t rinse off really well the beads stick and dry out in your body hair.</li>
            <li>Most individuals think I am in my mid to late fifties rather than my seventies.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very similar to Lava soap in that aspect although Lava will peel your skin right off if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li>My husband swears this snake peel body wash is the only wash that keeps his skin clear...</li>
            <li>I got through nearly the entire bottle (and purchased another) before noticing the correlation.  </li>
            <li>This one REALLY leaves your feet slippery, so be careful in the shower, and even for the next person, too.</li>
            <li>Having naturally oily skin, I also appreciate Snake Peel not \\&quot;oiling me up\\&quot; further, with \\&quot;moisturizers\\&quot; and such.</li>
            <li>only I can feel it apparently*</li>
            <li>This shower gel has a slightly-citrus tang and foams up well in normal water, which means it&#x27;ll last you a while since not much is needed for one use.  </li>
            <li>In this day and age I think it is really easy for the companies to make a shower gel that cleans, because they got a basic formula and just add different ingredients here and there in small quantities; like the exfoliating beads and other stuff like cactus oil.</li>
            <li>However, it does exactly what the fine print says that it does, and that is get your nasty rear clean.  </li>

            <li> I am enjoying this product a lot.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> From amazon, was a pretty good deal for the price.  </li>
            <li> so well he doesn&#x27;t need a loofah &amp; still moisturizes his dry skin perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time my girlfriend will just say I smell good without really knowing why.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel super clean, and it smells really good to both me and the wife.</li>
            <li> I also have issues with strong perfumes/colognes and the smell of this stuff is very mild.  </li>
            <li> Just easy to use</li>
            <li> I got the Tangerine, as the Lavendar was too strongly scented.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more soon!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I just purchased a huge case somewhere</li>
            <li> He asked if I had experienced the same thing.</li>
            <li> At $3 a bottle with free shipping</li>
            <li> The aroma (perfumieness) is just right and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> It lathers nicely, seems to go a long way, and smells nice, while doing an okay job of mildly scrubbing the skin, leaving you with a clean, smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> &quot; (or, even more interesting, the \\&quot;desert minerals\\&quot;) are intended to be, but they seem to clean very well, and they did so without drying my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a clean freak and this stuff gets me clean.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make women swarm out of the woodwork toward you, but it will most definitely get you clean. :-)</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice smooth feeling, not real dry but also not oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the scent is really neat, and it also leaves you feeling very clean with no residue.  </li>
            <li> It smells odd in the bottle but after a shower it is an excellent compliment to my natural scent</li>
            <li> The Snake Peel is by far my most prefer scent from the Axe body wash line.</li>
            <li> This product is made from toxic chemicals which are absorbed by the skin and are linked to neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and bioaccumulation.</li>
            <li> It took me a dozen tries on different scrubs/washes to come up with this one (the perfect one for me)--and</li>
            <li> It has exfoliating scrub, colorful scrubbing beads, and sparkles.  </li>
            <li> I really feel being pampered as well as getting super scrubby clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it is a light abrasive that makes you clean, yet is gentle on the skin because you dont have to rub or scrub much at all.  </li>
            <li> the suds it produces is just right</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my local store stopped carrying it, and this deal was pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li> but I like the snake peel because it has some kind of gritty substance in it that really scrubs away any grease.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;desert minerals\\&quot; are very much like (and might just be) pumice and scrub away dirt and grime thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I got a mild sunburn, and the warm water was more irritating to the burn than the exfoliant was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last time I ordered it I had to go to the Axe website and find out who the authorized dealers of this particular kind is.  </li>
            <li> Just something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first found out about it around 5 or so</li>
            <li> My personal favorite body wash.  </li>
            <li> Many different fragrances.  </li>
            <li> so I was pretty pumped to see I could buy this online in bulk.</li>
            <li> Sad that this is discontinued, I loved this scrub, I had gone through many and this one met all of my requirements.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> Once I was pretty certain it was the scrub, I gave it up.</li>
            <li> I certainly hope AXE never discontinues Snake Peel.  </li>
            <li> I do not care much about the exfoliating properties or other benefits that are being promoted, the main things that I am concerned about is that the product should work and smell nice, which it does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this product, and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I was never that stinky before- even hours after an intense workout.</li>
            <li> item as described - fast</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a woman, but really like the axe men&#x27;s body sprays.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fussy.  </li>
            <li> I really hope it was not discontinued.</li>
            <li> and it also cleans with what feels like juices and gentle acids from a cactus plant.  </li>
            <li> This is really a man&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li> bought it here as I could get it much cheaper than in the stores and this one still tends to sell out fast where Axe products are sold.  </li>
            <li> Much better than other brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that makes him feel clean.</li>
            <li> Since my husband is a creature of habit, this will last him until he can get comfortable with a \\&quot;new scent\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, but i&#x27;m having a hard time buying it local any more, wal-mart seems to have quit carrying it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get it  here in Houston, it really cleans your body with the kind of sandy stuff in it.</li>
            <li> but the cost of shipping and handling vwas way too high.</li>
            <li> Sure, it DOES exfoliate, but maybe a little too well --</li>
            <li> I use this after I finish working out and it removes all of my body odor and leaves me fresh for my next work out (wink, wink).</li>
            <li> all of the new Axe shower gels stink to me, so i&#x27;ll be getting the case subscription...</li>
            <li> Snake Peel is one of the few shower gels I&#x27;ve tried which actually lathers up nicely, because it&#x27;s a thicker gel.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually very masculine, without being musky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure it out at first, and definitely didn&#x27;t expect it to be my new bodywash.</li>
            <li> I threw my bottle away and they started with a new one, purchased at a different time than the first one.  </li>
            <li> Ive been uisng this scent for the past 10 years now, and i love it.</li>
            <li> , I just can&#x27;t get enough of its smell ;-)</li>
            <li> This really helps get rid of sweat, oil, dirt and old, dead skin and makes you feel so soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other shower gels, the price is not bad at all because it is so concentrated.  </li>
            <li> Once I picked up on it, I decided to experiment; using it only on certain days to see if I&#x27;d get that signature stink.</li>
            <li> The scent is...nonexistant, as far as I can tell, so you won&#x27;t need to worry about reeking of Axe BEFORE you use the bodyspray.</li>
            <li> Find a friend who lives near a TJ and have them ship you one of each scent.  </li>
            <li> [...]Consider some type of natural hemp soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far</li>
            <li> when I use it, I find my skin tends to feel a little on the oily side, but it does feel clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;possibly they could come out with a snake peel 2 with extra abrasives for when one is really muddy or dirty, but for everyday use the product is near perfect.</li>
            <li> Axe is fairly good at putting interesting sounding buzzwords on their packaging that don&#x27;t really mean anything when you use the product, but overall, it&#x27;s still a good product, despite the useless marketing lingo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to an earlier reviewer who complained of dry skin,</li>
            <li> stunk--didn&#x27;t smell sexy like their sprays,&lt;br /&gt;few scrubbing nubs--not enough to accomplish anything,&lt;br /&gt;had to work hard to get the nubs off me,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> A couple weeks later, one of my roommates commented to me that he thought the new bodywash was making him stink by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Although it may very well \\&quot;exfoliate to remove dirt and dry</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer stated, this stuff will dry out your skin if you use it too much.  </li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t rinse off really well the beads stick and dry out in your body hair.</li>
            <li> Most individuals think I am in my mid to late fifties rather than my seventies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very similar to Lava soap in that aspect although Lava will peel your skin right off if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> My husband swears this snake peel body wash is the only wash that keeps his skin clear...</li>
            <li> I got through nearly the entire bottle (and purchased another) before noticing the correlation.  </li>
            <li> This one REALLY leaves your feet slippery, so be careful in the shower, and even for the next person, too.</li>
            <li> Having naturally oily skin, I also appreciate Snake Peel not \\&quot;oiling me up\\&quot; further, with \\&quot;moisturizers\\&quot; and such.</li>
            <li> only I can feel it apparently*</li>
            <li> This shower gel has a slightly-citrus tang and foams up well in normal water, which means it&#x27;ll last you a while since not much is needed for one use.  </li>
            <li> In this day and age I think it is really easy for the companies to make a shower gel that cleans, because they got a basic formula and just add different ingredients here and there in small quantities; like the exfoliating beads and other stuff like cactus oil.</li>
            <li> However, it does exactly what the fine print says that it does, and that is get your nasty rear clean.  </li>
            <li> The thing about the Snake Peel and other Axe body washes from the clear bottle lineup that I observed, is that they tend not to stay much (in terms of time) on the sponge compared to Axe body washes in black bottles and to body washes of other brands.</li>
            <li> This stuff left my skin so dry</li>
            <li> It is rich and thick and luxurious, and a little goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> This is by far his favorite body wash, but for some reason, it has been difficult to locate them in stores lately.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use Snake Peel as long as they continue to make it.</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer gels with the little gritty pieces in them.</li>
            <li> one reviewer&#x27;s mention of dry skin; I actually get dry skin with bar soap (which I typically have to use when traveling</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the soap is the packaging won&#x27;t sit upside down</li>
            <li> However, being that I have oily skin on my face, I&#x27;m a little leery of washing my face with this soap, since I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;ll really help.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years as I found it helps me keep a smoother less wrinkle skin.</li>
            <li> And it was less than ten dollars for 18 oz.  </li>
            <li> Also I like Snake Peel&#x27;s little gritty \\&quot;desert</li>
            <li> Bottles are a little smaller than expected, but can&#x27;t complain with a pack of 6.</li>
            <li> For some reason, it is getting harder to find in the stores around us</li>
            <li> This gel comes with blue, exfoliating micro-beads, but there are so few of them that their effect appears to be negligible, as is the after-scent of this so-so shower scrub.</li>
            <li> I have to balance the bottle onto something upside down to get the last little bit out.</li>
            <li> The other roommate eventually discovered this as well.</li>
            <li> my hands and face became VERY dry and flaky -- so be careful when you use this, no more than once a day, and even then it may be too often.</li>
            <li> since using it my skin is softer, i&#x27;m not sure about drier, since a long time ago i started using gold bond body lotion after showering.  </li>
            <li> (see my Amazon review), so it is difficult for me to know how much additional scrubbing power AXE provides.</li>
            <li> Some of those others (by Nivea, Old Spice, Softsoap) are thin, and just run off without lathering.</li>
            <li> for the cactus oils and such, I mark that up to marketing speak for stuff that&#x27;s in there that doesn&#x27;t really mean anything.</li>
            <li> as that&#x27;s what hotels often have) but have not had any issues with this, and I typically shower twice/day.</li>
            <li> I like the little pieces of grit in the Scrub, and it helps to get rid of that excess dead skin (I even use it ias my shampoo).  </li>
            <li> Even gave me a few bonus ounces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if Axe stopped making Snake Peel or what the deal is, but all the stores around me stopped carrying it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the \\&quot;snake peel\\</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very expensive, little bottles for $12, bigger bottles for $25.  </li>
            <li> My wife picked this up for me after I complained about my bar soap turning to mush.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t get the soap scum everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I usually get tired of these types of products and soon try another, but I&#x27;ve found myself sticking with this one for months now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to describe the scent, since it&#x27;s a combination of airy and citrus-y, but it&#x27;s not a girly scent...</li>
            <li> ...I&#x27;m very disappointed that the Axe PR department gave in to what was probably some lame complaints and altered the &#x27;instructions&#x27; on the back of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the smell is faintly citrus and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Sad it is off the markets.</li>
            <li> I am so sad to see this being discontinued.  </li>
            <li> If you sniff it REAL hard, you can smell a very faint engine oil odor, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> However, about 15 - 20 hours after using it I was rank.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried out Snake Peel on a recent trip, and I bought a couple of full-size bottles as soon as I got home. It&#x27;s tough to describe the scent, since it&#x27;s a combination of airy and citrus-y, but it&#x27;s not a girly scent... it&#x27;s actually very masculine, without being musky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating aspect is nice because it does a nice job of scrubbing the skin without being too abrasive. I got a mild sunburn, and the warm water was more irritating to the burn than the exfoliant was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cactus oils and such, I mark that up to marketing speak for stuff that&#x27;s in there that doesn&#x27;t really mean anything. Axe is fairly good at putting interesting sounding buzzwords on their packaging that don&#x27;t really mean anything when you use the product, but overall, it&#x27;s still a good product, despite the useless marketing lingo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to an earlier reviewer who complained of dry skin, when I use it, I find my skin tends to feel a little on the oily side, but it does feel clean. However, being that I have oily skin on my face, I&#x27;m a little leery of washing my face with this soap, since I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;ll really help. Just something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this product, and would recommend it to others. It lathers nicely, seems to go a long way, and smells nice, while doing an okay job of mildly scrubbing the skin, leaving you with a clean, smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, but i&#x27;m having a hard time buying it local any more, wal-mart seems to have quit carrying it.  i tried it because it smells very good.  since using it my skin is softer, i&#x27;m not sure about drier, since a long time ago i started using gold bond body lotion after showering.  all of the new Axe shower gels stink to me, so i&#x27;ll be getting the case subscription...</li>
            <li> I have tried most of the AXE shower scrubs but I like the snake peel because it has some kind of gritty substance in it that really scrubs away any grease. It works almost as well as Lava soap for removing grease. The smell is really appealing to women but not overbearing. Most of the time my girlfriend will just say I smell good without really knowing why. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the soap is the packaging won&#x27;t sit upside down and you can&#x27;t get the last 10% out by just squeezing it. I have to balance the bottle onto something upside down to get the last little bit out. If the changed the bottle I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> As advertised received in timely manner</li>
            <li> I LOVED the smell of this scrub. I loved the texture, the color- I was pretty happy with it. However, about 15 - 20 hours after using it I was rank. I didn&#x27;t understand why. I was never that stinky before- even hours after an intense workout. I couldn&#x27;t figure it out at first, and definitely didn&#x27;t expect it to be my new bodywash. I got through nearly the entire bottle (and purchased another) before noticing the correlation.  It didn&#x27;t happen every day, but I also didn&#x27;t use the bodywash every day. Once I picked up on it, I decided to experiment; using it only on certain days to see if I&#x27;d get that signature stink. Once I was pretty certain it was the scrub, I gave it up. I told my roommates they could use it if they wanted as I probably wasn&#x27;t going to finish it. I did not tell them about my experience, only that I had bought 2 bottles but was switching to another scent. I threw my bottle away and they started with a new one, purchased at a different time than the first one.  A couple weeks later, one of my roommates commented to me that he thought the new bodywash was making him stink by the end of the day. He asked if I had experienced the same thing. The other roommate eventually discovered this as well. So, it wasn&#x27;t just me, and the Snake Peel was retired.</li>
            <li> Bought a case of this for my husband; WOW, does it smell SOOOO GOOD!! I haven&#x27;t used it, of course, but he says it scrubs so well he doesn&#x27;t need a loofah &amp; still moisturizes his dry skin perfectly.  GREAT product at a GREAT price...thank you Amazon!!! Will definitely be ordering more soon!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My husband swears this snake peel body wash is the only wash that keeps his skin clear...he even washes his face with it. For some reason, it is getting harder to find in the stores around us so I ordered a case online. I have to agree this is one of the best smelling mens body washes on the market!</li>
            <li> Although it may very well \\&quot;exfoliate to remove dirt and dry skin,\\&quot; it dries out your skin to no end, and you&#x27;re caught in a loop. Sure, it DOES exfoliate, but maybe a little too well -- my hands and face became VERY dry and flaky -- so be careful when you use this, no more than once a day, and even then it may be too often. The scent is...nonexistant, as far as I can tell, so you won&#x27;t need to worry about reeking of Axe BEFORE you use the bodyspray.</li>
            <li> item as described - fast shipping - well packaged but would recommend taping tops of bottles has some leakage in box - great deal on the price - would gladly buy again</li>
            <li> Axe Snake Peel Shower Scrub has a pleasant citrus scent to it.  The \\&quot;desert minerals\\&quot; are very much like (and might just be) pumice and scrub away dirt and grime thoroughly.  It&#x27;s very similar to Lava soap in that aspect although Lava will peel your skin right off if you aren&#x27;t careful.  Like another reviewer stated, this stuff will dry out your skin if you use it too much.  However, it does exactly what the fine print says that it does, and that is get your nasty rear clean.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife picked this up for me after I complained about my bar soap turning to mush. I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience using shower scrubs, so my expectations were low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something handy to take along on business trips and use in the locker rooms. The AXE shower scrub was good on both counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the shower scrub along with the [[ASIN:B000CSDDDG Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel]] (see my Amazon review), so it is difficult for me to know how much additional scrubbing power AXE provides. Anyway, the smell is faintly citrus and not overpowering. I get a good lather, drizzling a bit on the nylon towel. And my wife says I smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more do I need?</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years as I found it helps me keep a smoother less wrinkle skin. Most individuals think I am in my mid to late fifties rather than my seventies.</li>
            <li> The Snake Peel is by far my most prefer scent from the Axe body wash line. I first found out about it around 5 or so (maybe more) years ago when the Maxim magazine had one of those scratch-and-sniff promotional inserts; I tried it and bought a bottle. From that day on I was hooked on the Axe Snake Peel. The scent is pleasantly good with a hint of citrus. I do not care much about the exfoliating properties or other benefits that are being promoted, the main things that I am concerned about is that the product should work and smell nice, which it does. In this day and age I think it is really easy for the companies to make a shower gel that cleans, because they got a basic formula and just add different ingredients here and there in small quantities; like the exfoliating beads and other stuff like cactus oil. The thing about the Snake Peel and other Axe body washes from the clear bottle lineup that I observed, is that they tend not to stay much (in terms of time) on the sponge compared to Axe body washes in black bottles and to body washes of other brands. In terms of scent I think it is 5 but in terms of longevity on the sponge it is a 3, so overall rating is 4.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a clean freak and this stuff gets me clean. Plus the ladies are always telling me I smell good. I never wear cologne so it must be the AXE shower scrub.</li>
            <li> This is one of the good ones in the Axe line. I like the feel of the soap. Bottles are a little smaller than expected, but can&#x27;t complain with a pack of 6.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 cases of this as it seems to have been discontinued. I love it. It smells odd in the bottle but after a shower it is an excellent compliment to my natural scent and I receive comments all the time on how good I smell. I do not wear cologne.</li>
            <li> My personal favorite body wash.  Unfortunately my local store stopped carrying it, and this deal was pretty amazing.  Seems amazon has stopped selling it was well now.  Last time I ordered it I had to go to the Axe website and find out who the authorized dealers of this particular kind is.  From amazon, was a pretty good deal for the price.  As for the product itself, love this stuff.  Makes me feel super clean, and it smells really good to both me and the wife.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this for my boyfriend. This is by far his favorite body wash, but for some reason, it has been difficult to locate them in stores lately. It&#x27;s cheaper to get them from Amazon anyway!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a woman, but really like the axe men&#x27;s body sprays.&lt;br /&gt;thot i&#x27;d try this axe snake peel scrub, and maybe my man would like it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it stunk--didn&#x27;t smell sexy like their sprays,&lt;br /&gt;few scrubbing nubs--not enough to accomplish anything,&lt;br /&gt;had to work hard to get the nubs off me,&lt;br /&gt;and then to get them out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the best scrubs there are are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Trader Joe&#x27;s, Purify Scrub.  Many different fragrances.  And it was less than ten dollars for 18 oz.  Top quality.  Find a friend who lives near a TJ and have them ship you one of each scent.  I got the Tangerine, as the Lavendar was too strongly scented.  They don&#x27;t sell it on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* One Minute Manicure.  The classic, original best scrub there is.  However, it&#x27;s very expensive, little bottles for $12, bigger bottles for $25.  This one REALLY leaves your feet slippery, so be careful in the shower, and even for the next person, too.</li>
            <li> I was bummed when Axe discontinued this body wash...so I bought 3 cases when I found it! At $3 a bottle with free shipping that&#x27;s cheaper than I used to pay at Wally World.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.  I have been having problems finding it locally so Amazon has been a life safer! Once you start using this you will not want anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if Axe stopped making Snake Peel or what the deal is, but all the stores around me stopped carrying it so I was pretty pumped to see I could buy this online in bulk.</li>
            <li> I usually get tired of these types of products and soon try another, but I&#x27;ve found myself sticking with this one for months now.  I love the smell, the bottle dispenses easily, and the pumice in the soap is great for cleaning my shower mirror so it doesn&#x27;t fog.  Nice product!</li>
            <li> This stuff left my skin so dry and if you don&#x27;t rinse off really well the beads stick and dry out in your body hair. I have since switched to Axe shock body wash and it does wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Axe shower gel is the finest product i have ever found.  It has a wonderful scent and the exfoliating scrub in the soap makes my skin feel great. i ordered this online because i cant seem to find it in any of my local stores.</li>
            <li> GREAT SCENT, GREAT PRICE - FOR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS - FOR MOST OF MY GRANDSONS, NEPHEWS, ETC.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT! ORDERED MORE - MY GRANDKIDS LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This product is made from toxic chemicals which are absorbed by the skin and are linked to neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and bioaccumulation. [...]Consider some type of natural hemp soap.</li>
            <li> I certainly hope AXE never discontinues Snake Peel.  I used to have this on Subscribe and Save, but Amazon dropped it.  It is my favorite Body Scrub product</li>
            <li> I love the feel, the fragrance, and the quality of cleansing this scrub provides.  I use this after I finish working out and it removes all of my body odor and leaves me fresh for my next work out (wink, wink).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the overpowerg aromas of most of the AXE products, but this stuff works wonders for my skin and body order.  The aroma (perfumieness) is just right and refreshing.  I like the little pieces of grit in the Scrub, and it helps to get rid of that excess dead skin (I even use it ias my shampoo).  When I get out of the shower I smell and feel refreshed.  It took me a dozen tries on different scrubs/washes to come up with this one (the perfect one for me)--and I&#x27;m very fussy.  Snake Skin is not carried in any of our local stores anymore, so Amazon is about my only reasonablr priced source for this product.</li>
            <li> Even gave me a few bonus ounces. Will gladly patronize again when they have something of this nature in stock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite a while now and my wife loves the smell. I will continue to use Snake Peel as long as they continue to make it.</li>
            <li> Nothing like Axe soap.  I have tried various types.  They are probably the best men&#x27;s soap out there.  Much better than other brands.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and my husband likes the scrubbing beads. Very nice product.  He&#x27;s been using it for years.</li>
            <li> bought this for my sons.  they love it.  Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing. A great product. I really hope it was not discontinued. All in all, the best Axe made</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t find this scent anywhere on the shelf anymore. Since my husband is a creature of habit, this will last him until he can get comfortable with a \\&quot;new scent\\&quot;. Thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> ...I&#x27;m very disappointed that the Axe PR department gave in to what was probably some lame complaints and altered the &#x27;instructions&#x27; on the back of the bottle.  For years, they&#x27;d have the step by step be a picture of showering with it followed by a picture of a guy with two girls; now it&#x27;s a guy with one girl in a bathing suit.  I guess Axe is no longer good for shower three ways LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding one reviewer&#x27;s mention of dry skin; I actually get dry skin with bar soap (which I typically have to use when traveling as that&#x27;s what hotels often have) but have not had any issues with this, and I typically shower twice/day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get it  here in Houston, it really cleans your body with the kind of sandy stuff in it.</li>
            <li> This shower gel has a slightly-citrus tang and foams up well in normal water, which means it&#x27;ll last you a while since not much is needed for one use.  I&#x27;m not sure what the \\&quot;snake peel\\&quot; (or, even more interesting, the \\&quot;desert minerals\\&quot;) are intended to be, but they seem to clean very well, and they did so without drying my skin.  This gel comes with blue, exfoliating micro-beads, but there are so few of them that their effect appears to be negligible, as is the after-scent of this so-so shower scrub.</li>
            <li> My favorite Axe product. It&#x27;s basically soap, sand (&amp;#34;desert minerals&amp;#34; -- hah!) and perfume. It won&#x27;t make women swarm out of the woodwork toward you, but it will most definitely get you clean. :-)</li>
            <li> My fiance&#x27; has psoriasis and this works wonders. He even uses it on his scalp prior to using shampoo. We bought so many cause he won&#x27;t use anything else (and it was a good price).</li>
            <li> Just trying to get a deal. Already knew I liked it so it wasn&#x27;t a surprise. Amazon comes through again.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff! He is very satisfied.  It&#x27;s the only thing that makes him feel clean. Sad it is off the markets.</li>
            <li> I have problems with dry/itchy skin and the scrubs in this body wash are great.  I also have issues with strong perfumes/colognes and the smell of this stuff is very mild.  This six-pack was a great deal!</li>
            <li> I am so sad to see this being discontinued.  I just purchased a huge case somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far my favorite Axe shower gel.  It is rich and thick and luxurious, and a little goes a long ways.  It has exfoliating scrub, colorful scrubbing beads, and sparkles.  I really feel being pampered as well as getting super scrubby clean.  This really helps get rid of sweat, oil, dirt and old, dead skin and makes you feel so soft and clean.  It also has a wonderful smell -- kind of citrus, kind of exotic fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for years.  It is my favorite.  Compared to other shower gels, the price is not bad at all because it is so concentrated.  My only gripe is that you can&#x27;t transfer it to a pump bottle because the \\&quot;goodies\\&quot; (sparkles, beads, etc.) will clog the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, note that this product comes (in addition to a travel size) in 12 oz, 16 oz (+33% More size), and in an 18 oz (+50% Bonus size).  Do your math to make sure you are getting the best price as it&#x27;s all over the map now that it appears to be discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad that it seems all the best Axe shower gels get discontinued...</li>
            <li> maybe there is something better, but i haven&#x27;t found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is a light abrasive that makes you clean, yet is gentle on the skin because you dont have to rub or scrub much at all.  the suds it produces is just right and it also cleans with what feels like juices and gentle acids from a cactus plant.  i know it claims this, but it truly does deliver this feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the scent is really neat, and it also leaves you feeling very clean with no residue.  no residue!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;possibly they could come out with a snake peel 2 with extra abrasives for when one is really muddy or dirty, but for everyday use the product is near perfect.</li>
            <li> Ive been uisng this scent for the past 10 years now, and i love it. I make sure to buy it in bulk so i know i wont run out of it any time soon.</li>
            <li> This is really a man&#x27;s soap. Just easy to use and you don&#x27;t get the soap scum everywhere.  I would recommend</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; the skin as it has an abrasive quality.&lt;br /&gt;My hubby jokes I could do an axe commercial hehehe, I just can&#x27;t get enough of its smell ;-)</li>
            <li> Sad that this is discontinued, I loved this scrub, I had gone through many and this one met all of my requirements.&lt;br /&gt;No slimy feeling *only I can feel it apparently* after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make me itch or sting if I have an open wound or something.&lt;br /&gt;Grit- I definitely prefer gels with the little gritty pieces in them.</li>
            <li> Snake Peel is one of the few shower gels I&#x27;ve tried which actually lathers up nicely, because it&#x27;s a thicker gel. Some of those others (by Nivea, Old Spice, Softsoap) are thin, and just run off without lathering. Also I like Snake Peel&#x27;s little gritty \\&quot;desert minerals\\&quot; (Arizona sand? lol), which do scrub you well. Having naturally oily skin, I also appreciate Snake Peel not \\&quot;oiling me up\\&quot; further, with \\&quot;moisturizers\\&quot; and such. It leaves a nice smooth feeling, not real dry but also not oily. However, I give it only four stars instead of five -- because there is NO distinguishable scent!? What&#x27;s that about? If you sniff it REAL hard, you can smell a very faint engine oil odor, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Always used this product with no problems.</li>
            <li> Price for product was very very good but the cost of shipping and handling vwas way too high. $9.50 for product but $14 for shipping kind of takes away from the fact that I was getting a good deal. Love this product. Wish it was still sold in stores.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product a lot.  It leaves me feeling clean and refreshed.  :)</li>
            <li> one of their first, snake peel is still one of their best.  bought it here as I could get it much cheaper than in the stores and this one still tends to sell out fast where Axe products are sold.  I now have enough supply to last me a while.</li>
