            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>It almost sounds like magic.  </li>
            <li>I kept on using it, and ended up with more definition on my abs, as well as tighter skin.</li>
            <li>It may have had a placebo effect though :)</li>
            <li>It smells good, however i didn&#x27;t notice any effects after using a whole bottle.  </li>
            <li>my skin feels really smooth.</li>
            <li>idea if it works, but love the smell\\&quot; so that really cannot attest to the product working as advertised!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I give this product all 5 stars because it smells good, tones and really helped me gain my sexy tummy back!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really going to pay attention more to the 1-3 star</li>
            <li>I work out daily, eat good and was hoping this would do the rest</li>
            <li>It smells good and you see instant results.</li>
            <li>it  works  pretty  good, so I can openly recomend this product to define  you abs</li>
            <li>anyway I ordered another tube today, I will be getting this on the regular, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>So I work out and eat right and am working on getting the six pack abs.  </li>
            <li>If it sounds to good to be true, most likely it is not worth your time and effort.</li>
            <li>This lotion really works for me!</li>
            <li>for the 1 5 star review that is not a fake - the review outright says...</li>
            <li>That is what I thought when I was first told about this cream.  </li>
            <li>First you cant tell a difference from one bottle, with that being said I think you dont need this</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Clearly the seller has  seen my original review (and will see this one) and will probably verify some purchases in order to give 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li>I will be a long time customer for sure.  </li>
            <li>Which now makes me certain that they came from the seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend the.product because it didn&#x27;t bare significant results</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>There was&#x27;nt a whole lot in the bottle.</li>
            <li>but I also don&#x27;t really</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle and nothing happened.  </li>
            <li>I used exactly as indicated in the instructions, as well as I work out regularly, and eat a healthy diet, but no change in my mid section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking back at the 5 star reviews: the first is from Jeffrey.</li>
            <li>guess the moral is you can&#x27;t really trust any non-verified purchases.</li>
            <li>As long as they do not push the price any higher.</li>
            <li>then half full lasted me 2 uses ...</li>
            <li>get back to this one even though the high price.</li>
            <li>Who knows how much money I&#x27;ve spent on this.</li>
            <li>this product is nothing but fake reviews and a nice smell.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t have much fat on my abs, so not really sure</li>
            <li> After using a whole bottle, I&#x27;m not sure this works.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;EVERY SINGLE review 4 stars and up with the exception of 1 only have one written review!</li>
            <li> I used this product and I definately noticed I lost some weight in my abdomen area, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s solely due to the ab cream or my recent weight loss or possibly a combination of both.</li>
            <li> so far i been wanting to firm up my belly after pregnancy i am at 120 pounds</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much further to go, but I had hopes that this toning creaming would be the last little bit to get me there.  </li>
            <li> but other may say differently.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying this product for a few weeks now and it seems to be doing what it claims, I have been loosing mass from the mid section.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks religiously, I have seen absolutely no results.  </li>
            <li> Bought it based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pissed an  considering filing a law suit against this company.</li>
            <li> Not buying it again, could have only been a expensive moisturizer as far as I care because this product didn&#x27;t do its job.</li>
            <li> I liked this product but was disappointed it was in a small bottle.</li>
            <li> it was less</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super close to a six pack, but just wanted to lose some the of abdominal fat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Used it for two months with maybe a slight difference if that.</li>
            <li> My tummy looks so toned, so tight and</li>
            <li> and my stomach  needed a little help and</li>
            <li> Nothing happened for a couple of weeks, then my abs started to feel a little tighter than they were before.  </li>
            <li> Waste ...</li>
            <li> I wasted my money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its already been a few mounth</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for over a few months now with exercise and diet and haven&#x27;t seen</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li> so im not fat but still trying to loose skin anything to firm up.its been 2 weeks and half way through the bottle im going to buy a cheaper cream and see how it goes if it doesnt work ill</li>
            <li> Needless to say I won&#x27;t be purchasing a second bottle.</li>
            <li> I was working out, dieting, and exercising quite a bit while using this, and I did indeed lose weight and inches, but not sure I can attribute anything to this cream.  </li>
            <li> sorry that I wasted money on this product, and wasted a month of using it.</li>
            <li> but it does slowly make you lose inches.</li>
            <li> Sad because I guess I naively do trust these reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> was sorry</li>
            <li> its kinda expensive thats</li>
            <li> boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> I know after being an amazon member for over a decade that 98% of the one time reviews that give products 4-5 stars are fake and written by the products maker or seller!</li>
            <li> Its that fricking bad.</li>
            <li> I received this item about a month ago...and sad to say I was very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed</li>
            <li> Dont be stupid like I was and buy this product.</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m very Disappointed as I Don&#x27;t see any changes on my stomach!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I gave these cream a try but I don&#x27;t think it benefitted me. I workout 5-6 days a week and have a good healthy eating habbits. I thought this cream would enhance my body but it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> This lotion really works for me! It definitely made my skin tighter and took way some of the bulk in my abdomen. I&#x27;m really impressed with how well it works.</li>
            <li> I have been using for almost a week and I can see a difference I think it removed water weight out of my stomach area anyway I ordered another tube today, I will be getting this on the regular, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Waste ... I got it it was less then half full lasted me 2 uses ... I&#x27;m disappointed</li>
            <li> I used this product and I definately noticed I lost some weight in my abdomen area, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s solely due to the ab cream or my recent weight loss or possibly a combination of both. I can say that I have not noticed any defination in my abs, but the benefits may be greater/different for someone else. The smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is the best toning cream I&#x27;ve ever tried!!!</li>
            <li> I keep a food journal, I work out regularly, yet the only thing I changed was Avaitor on my mid section.  After a week or so, I started to see results.  I thought this was going to be snake oil......boy was I wrong!  I will be a long time customer for sure.  Thank you, for the added \\&quot;boost\\&quot; to my body composition goals.</li>
            <li> I wish I had checked the others reviews prior to buying it for my sister!&lt;br /&gt;As for my sisters feedback&lt;br /&gt;1. smelt great&lt;br /&gt;2. no improvement at all&lt;br /&gt;3. was sorry I wasted my money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVERY SINGLE review 4 stars and up with the exception of 1 only have one written review! I know after being an amazon member for over a decade that 98% of the one time reviews that give products 4-5 stars are fake and written by the products maker or seller! Over the years that have gotten smarter and started buying their own products to show \\&quot;verified purchase\\&quot; but all their friends and such that post will not buy the product and just post the review! Check them yourselves. Click \\&quot;see all my reviews\\&quot; next to their name!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the 1 5 star review that is not a fake - the review outright says... \\&quot;No idea if it works, but love the smell\\&quot; so that really cannot attest to the product working as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find something else people... this product is nothing but fake reviews and a nice smell.</li>
            <li> it  works  pretty  good, so I can openly recomend this product to define  you abs&lt;br /&gt;it  is a good inversment</li>
            <li> So I work out and eat right and am working on getting the six pack abs.  I don&#x27;t have much further to go, but I had hopes that this toning creaming would be the last little bit to get me there.  After using it for a few weeks religiously, I have seen absolutely no results.  Needless to say I won&#x27;t be purchasing a second bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion  for the pass 2 weeks and I can honestly say its doing its job I see a difference I have 5children and my stomach  needed a little help and this lotion is helping I plan on using this lotion for a while ..I love it...</li>
            <li> I received this item about a month ago...and sad to say I was very disappointed in the product. I used exactly as indicated in the instructions, as well as I work out regularly, and eat a healthy diet, but no change in my mid section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very sorry that I wasted money on this product, and wasted a month of using it.</li>
            <li> This is the second toning cream I ordered and I am in shock! Could it be that it works? Could I have gotten rid of my 2 baby 2 c section pouch? Yes yes yes!!!! My tummy looks so toned, so tight and my skin feels really smooth. I give this product all 5 stars because it smells good, tones and really helped me gain my sexy tummy back!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. i believe there is no such thing as an &amp;#34;abdominal toning cream.&amp;#34; I have now tried several.</li>
            <li> its kinda expensive thats why im giving it 4 star. so far i been wanting to firm up my belly after pregnancy i am at 120 pounds so im not fat but still trying to loose skin anything to firm up.its been 2 weeks and half way through the bottle im going to buy a cheaper cream and see how it goes if it doesnt work ill get back to this one even though the high price.</li>
            <li> Product was ok, didn&#x27;t notice any change. Won&#x27;t be purchasing any more. Not recommending this to friends. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I almost never write reviews, but feel compelled to on this one.  I took a chance on this and haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.  Granted I&#x27;m not super close to a six pack, but just wanted to lose some the of abdominal fat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I received my product, I noticed that it was sold from a Jeffrey A Bolter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking back at the 5 star reviews: the first is from Jeffrey. the second from A. Bolter, the third from Adam.  And all three of these are the only reviews written by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidence? maybe. maybe not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take my review with a grain of salt, maybe it&#x27;ll work for you.  The smell is pleasant.  However, I won&#x27;t be ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All 3 of the 5 star reviews I mentioned have now been deleted.  Which now makes me certain that they came from the seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the moral is you can&#x27;t really trust any non-verified purchases. The more I think about it even some of the verified purchase ones might be questionable.  Clearly the seller has  seen my original review (and will see this one) and will probably verify some purchases in order to give 5 star reviews.  Sad because I guess I naively do trust these reviews on Amazon.  Going forward I&#x27;m really going to pay attention more to the 1-3 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just consider yourself warned.  Buyer Beware.</li>
            <li> Not buying it again, could have only been a expensive moisturizer as far as I care because this product didn&#x27;t do its job.</li>
            <li> I have been trying this product for a few weeks now and it seems to be doing what it claims, I have been loosing mass from the mid section.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any results. Its already been a few mounth I&#x27;ve been using three bottles. Who knows how much money I&#x27;ve spent on this. I&#x27;ve done the excersise and the cream plus the diet  This cream did nothing, so therefor I give it a 1.</li>
            <li> I liked this product but was disappointed it was in a small bottle. You would have to order a lot to to have it worked the way they advertise. I guess it was doing the job as my girlfriend said it looked like I was losing pounds.</li>
            <li> It smells good, however i didn&#x27;t notice any effects after using a whole bottle.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.  Gimmick</li>
            <li> I Have not seen ANY results!!! Bought it based on other reviews. But, I&#x27;m very Disappointed as I Don&#x27;t see any changes on my stomach!!!&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT Recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> The product did nothing at all...i changed my diet and started a exercise routinein hopes the product would help burn the fat quicker and it did nothing.....</li>
            <li> I dont think it works. I work out daily, eat good and was hoping this would do the rest but I didnt notice any change that wasnt from diet and exercise. Not even a tingling sensation or hint that something was trying to happen. wouldnt suprise me if it was just lotion</li>
            <li> This product is a total gimick. The fricken thing changed my skin tone to where I now have spots on my stomach. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT WILL GIVE YOU A RASH THAT HAS PERMANENT EFFECTS. I am extremely pissed an  considering filing a law suit against this company. Yes. Its that fricking bad. Dont be stupid like I was and buy this product. Its forcing me to put a rating but this deserves negttive 5.</li>
            <li> This product has no odor and no greasy feel.  I love it.  I have been using it for 6 weeks and notice a tightening in the abdominal area.  Minimal inches lost so far, though.</li>
            <li> It was ok. There was&#x27;nt a whole lot in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much fat on my abs, so not really sure how well this works. The science side says that unless it is actually getting through the skin and either dehydrating it or blocking the alpha-2 receptors, it isn&#x27;t actually working... but I also don&#x27;t really care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff smells good, so I use it more for that.</li>
            <li> It simply does not work.  I used the whole bottle and nothing happened.  If it is too good to be true, it probably is...</li>
            <li> It almost sounds like magic.  That is what I thought when I was first told about this cream.  But I trusted my friend, and went ahead and took the bottle he was offering, and used it.  Nothing happened for a couple of weeks, then my abs started to feel a little tighter than they were before.  I kept on using it, and ended up with more definition on my abs, as well as tighter skin.</li>
            <li> Great item and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> MY SHIPMENT WAS EARLY.CANT SAY IF IT WORKS OR NOT I WILL REPOST IN ABOUT 4 WEEKS..WISH ME LUCK.I HOPE I GET THE RESULTS IM LOOKING FOR.</li>
            <li> First you cant tell a difference from one bottle, with that being said I think you dont need this but other may say differently.  Save your money for now</li>
            <li> I ordered this with and sweat belt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for over a few months now with exercise and diet and haven&#x27;t seen a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions on the bottle and well I&#x27;m not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regret ordering this.</li>
            <li> After using a whole bottle, I&#x27;m not sure this works.  I was working out, dieting, and exercising quite a bit while using this, and I did indeed lose weight and inches, but not sure I can attribute anything to this cream.  It may have had a placebo effect though :)</li>
            <li> I havent seen any notice of changes while using for a month so I will not purchase again but it didnt hurt to try.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for a month and no progress in my stomach tightening or shrinking. It smells good but maybe i have to pyhsically ork out as well. But that wasnt in the instructions. so if a customer is supposed to work out they should say, as well as provide a belt.</li>
            <li> Used it for two months with maybe a slight difference if that. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend the.product because it didn&#x27;t bare significant results</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It smells good and you see instant results. Do not expect chiseled ab over night. You still have to work out but it does slowly make you lose inches. It does show ab definition after every use. Like anything it takes time. As long as they do not push the price any higher. I give it a 5 star. When I purchased it, this item was 27 dollars and in 2 weeks it jumped to 33 dollars. So my advice to this company is keep it affordable and don&#x27;t get greedy!</li>
            <li> If it sounds to good to be true, most likely it is not worth your time and effort. Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money.</li>
