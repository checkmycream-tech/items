    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product and company!!</li>
            <li>and it worked awesome.</li>
            <li>Still a very good product.</li>
            <li>Bronner&#x27;s is an INCREDIBLE company.</li>
            <li>for body odor control it is great</li>
            <li>It lathers great</li>
            <li>Its amazing!</li>
            <li>This product is not laced with Paraben or Lauryl sulfate unlike most product I come across which is very good.</li>
            <li>It feels good to use it to know that you are not getting toxin into your body or giving yourself cancer in anyways.</li>
            <li>so that was good.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy tea tree soap, this is the best.  </li>
            <li>We love Dr Bronner&#x27;s soaps, and this one is equally great.</li>
            <li>P)&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li>I love this tea tree soap!</li>
            <li>Great lather and quick rinse!</li>
            <li>i liked the unscented soap from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but the Tea Trea scent was just too medicinal for me.</li>
            <li>Also, not a fan of having to dilute the rinse on my own before use.</li>
            <li>Really nice soap.  </li>
            <li>This is just a nice.</li>
            <li>I love the soap, it&#x27;s my favorite kind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it cleans well.</li>
            <li>ok but pumper drips after using</li>
            <li>While I am quite happy with the soap itself, the pump dispenser leaves much to be desired.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Lathers okay with quite a bit.</li>
            <li>the soap smells wonderful, it doesn&#x27;t last on your hair</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than the chemical laden disinfecting soaps.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a couple ants around but nothing overwhelming.</li>
            <li>sure the is a great natural option for some people, it just didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li>the strong smell of the soap when showering :) ahhh...tea tree...peppermint...</li>
            <li>It is easy on my hands and doesn&#x27;t cause my eczema to flair up.</li>
            <li>One thing I love is the way it rinses clean so easily...</li>
            <li>Antiseptic (tea tree) odor with strong musty overtones, runny, brown</li>
            <li>The tea-tree-oil version has a pungent smell that I find interesting and not unpleasant, but some might find it disagreeable.</li>
            <li>This soap may not smell good but it rinses clean and seems to have a decent amount of tea tree oil in it for antibacterial purposes.</li>
            <li>This works great though it can be sticky if you do not use enough water.</li>
            <li>Someone at the gym mentioned &amp;#34;tea tree oil&amp;#34; as great for getting rid of various skin conditions you can pick up from the gym.</li>
            <li>I did some searching and found that this item had alot of natural elements good for skin</li>
            <li>This soap lathers up rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>Originally used the soap on body too, but after not seeing a noticeable difference over my Dove bar, decided to save it for just the hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Though</li>
            <li>This soap has me spoiled, cleans so clean</li>
            <li>and I feel clean.</li>
            <li>Excited to try the new pump soap, had heard Dr Bronner&#x27;s changed formulation to be able to use it in a pump format that didn&#x27;t clog easily and this is it.</li>
            <li>I have had no skin reactions to this product, it has stopped my breakouts and I feel super clean after using.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad..</li>
            <li>So soft, so shiny (not greasy though), so healthy and strong...</li>
            <li>What a clean, fresh feeling it gives.</li>
            <li>I love this product and wish more of my local stores carried it!!</li>
            <li>It rinses off quickly and easily, and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I wonder why doesn&#x27;t most of the skin product follow the chemical and carcinogen free standard like this product?</li>
            <li>/&gt;good fresh feeling too&lt;</li>
            <li>so we liked it enough to reorder and that says a lot right there.</li>
            <li>Legit fair trade, seriously organic, no one gets paid more than 5 times another</li>
            <li>If someone put their nose right up to your hair, they may smell it, though.  </li>
            <li>Interesting note the first ingredient is white grape juice.</li>
            <li>At first use it seemed strong&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I suspect my hair actually smells a bit more like some oil (for all my desi folks out there, kinda like Ayurvedic medicine).</li>
            <li>First world problems, I know,</li>
            <li>/&gt;We used up the first bottle and reordered another</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again, but I&#x27;m willing to try another Dr. Bronners product.</li>
            <li>This product has somehow removed hot spots and itchy ness of my scalp.</li>
            <li>Right now, might be using too much shampoo, because hair becomes parched if I don&#x27;t use the leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;-Price.</li>
            <li>I decided to start taking better care of my skin especially now that it&#x27;s being exposed to intense heat from the sun.</li>
            <li>(amazing considering that most CEOs nowadays make hundreds times what their factory floor workers do), employees get 100% free healthcare, and they give like a third of their profits back to charity (beyond their free trade projects, which, among other things, support peaceful Palestinian/Israeli coexistence and medical equipment for hospitals in Sri Lanka).</li>
            <li>The large 24 oz bottle got knocked into the sink a couple of times and now the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean and soft and with no dry winter skin itch.</li>
            <li>This Hand Soap is all organic and really washes everything off your hands and keeps them hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely hooked.</li>
            <li>Environmentally, socially, financially responsible through and through.</li>
            <li>Do you know how much time that saves me in the morning?</li>
            <li>I only wish there were refills available for it so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep adding to my collection of plastic bottles.</li>
            <li>We really like this body wash.</li>
            <li>It feels very comforting and leaves the skin moist and energized...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in more socially responsible products, check out the Good Guide app (here&#x27;s the Apple link: [...] )</li>
            <li>For 8years, I had two problems with my scalp, first with really uncontrollable dandruff, and second with some kind of &amp;#34;travelling&amp;#34; eczema that caused small blisters and scale.  </li>
            <li>I know this may not mean anything, but the lather matters to me now, whether it&#x27;s in my head or not,</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients from a responsibly run family business....</li>
            <li>The hand and body wash has a bit of the smell as well (this is how you know it&#x27;s real), but after the hair is dry, the smell pretty much goes away.</li>
            <li>The pump spring doesn&#x27;t come back up automatically (maybe a defect on mine?), but manually pulling the pump back up works fine.</li>
            <li>(Yes, I live alone.)</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>2 stars for bringing this organic natural product to the market.  </li>
            <li>but after a while it just smells natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even gentle enough to use on my hair (I use the tea tree variety).</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li>It cleans better then the typical chemical laced partners actually since the tea tree oil actually kills bacteria and germs.</li>
            <li>: love the company and the results, not such a big fan of the price or the slight oily smell--but that&#x27;s what you get for all-natural.</li>
            <li>I went back to old spice in the shower and dial at the sink.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, mind you, Tea Tree Oil smells like a mixture of Pine Sol and cat butt, so this is the reason I only put it directly on my scalp in the evening.</li>
            <li>So worth a little Pine Sol and cat butt smell!</li>
            <li>However, my daughter really likes it for her two little boys.</li>

            <li> So worth a little Pine Sol and cat butt smell!</li>
            <li> However, my daughter really likes it for her two little boys.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using this product due to my skin being so sensitive.</li>
            <li> Great soap bad pump...leaves a sticky mess on counter.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Even lasts through long asian flights from USA&lt;br</li>
            <li> I say \\&quot;suspect\\&quot; because I don&#x27;t smell it on a day to day basis, and no one has told me my hair stinks, but if I am hot and/or sweaty, sometimes I smell it.&lt;br /&gt;-for the citrus conditioning rinse, be careful, because it really stings if you get it in your eyes or on open cuts.</li>
            <li> It just makes me wonder if they are giving us products to kill us in the long run but either way this product you must try to know.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d appreciate it if it came pre-diluted, and preferably at the same consistency as the soap (instead of having the viscosity of water, which is harder to work through your hair).&lt;br</li>
            <li> At night, after my shower after working out, I put a few drops of the tea tree oil directly on the affected areas on my scalp and then also massage it all over and comb it in.  </li>
            <li> Once you start using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, you&#x27;ll never go back to other soaps.  </li>
            <li> And my color treated hair is soft and needs very little</li>
            <li> Several times I&#x27;ve washed my hands using this, and later felt the stickiness on my palms because I didn&#x27;t hit that spot hard enough with the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is a little different</li>
            <li> I have it placed in my shower and quite a bit of soap drips out of the pump and into the bathtub between every use, which is a total waste of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soap as body soap for years, but always felt like it was a bit harsh and left a film.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days now</li>
            <li> I saw this in my mother&#x27;s bathroom &amp; was curious about it</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve never seen ants in our house until we left this soap in our bathroom for a few nights.</li>
            <li> The travelling blisters are 75% gone and are no longer get rough and scaley.  </li>
            <li> The price is right, but the odor is wrong.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried other types yet.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> as mentioned in the subject.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is typical with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell natural, or botanical, just smells weird and medicine-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably one of the few guys (with medium length hair) who uses Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products...</li>
            <li> So, I bought this hand and body soap as well as a small bottle of tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> But the results of no more dandruff and reduction of that eczema???</li>
            <li> , i found it pretty disgusting if truth be told.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and company!!</li>
            <li> i liked the unscented soap from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but the Tea Trea scent was just too medicinal for me.</li>
            <li> The pump spring doesn&#x27;t come back up automatically (maybe a defect on mine?), but manually pulling the pump back up works fine.</li>
            <li> The pump leaks! Great soap bad pump...leaves a sticky mess on counter. Won&#x27;t but again.</li>
            <li> Antiseptic (tea tree) odor with strong musty overtones, runny, brown, i found it pretty disgusting if truth be told. Excited to try the new pump soap, had heard Dr Bronner&#x27;s changed formulation to be able to use it in a pump format that didn&#x27;t clog easily and this is it. Interesting note the first ingredient is white grape juice. Haven&#x27;t tried other types yet. The large 24 oz bottle got knocked into the sink a couple of times and now the pump doesn&#x27;t work. After your hands are rinced the hint of antiseptic is gone they just smell musty like a dirty basement. 2 stars for bringing this organic natural product to the market.  After all is said and done I&#x27;m sure it cleans well.</li>
            <li> as mentioned in the subject. This Hand Soap is all organic and really washes everything off your hands and keeps them hydrated. the downside is that it smells like TAR; however you get used to the smell.</li>
            <li> ok but pumper drips after using</li>
            <li> This soap lathers up rich and creamy. It rinses off quickly and easily, and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin. The tea-tree-oil version has a pungent smell that I find interesting and not unpleasant, but some might find it disagreeable. I was afraid that, since tea-tree oil is supposed to have antibacterial properties, it might breed resistant bacteria, but it seems that this is not a concern. According to Genelle Weule, in an article dated 12 March 2013 for ABC Science, researchers tested it and found no evidence that this oil can contribute to antibiotic resistance.</li>
            <li> In the beginning there is this plant smell that is weird to get used to but after a while it just smells natural. This product is not laced with Paraben or Lauryl sulfate unlike most product I come across which is very good. It cleans better then the typical chemical laced partners actually since the tea tree oil actually kills bacteria and germs. It feels good to use it to know that you are not getting toxin into your body or giving yourself cancer in anyways. I wonder why doesn&#x27;t most of the skin product follow the chemical and carcinogen free standard like this product? It just makes me wonder if they are giving us products to kill us in the long run but either way this product you must try to know.</li>
            <li> While I am quite happy with the soap itself, the pump dispenser leaves much to be desired.  I have it placed in my shower and quite a bit of soap drips out of the pump and into the bathtub between every use, which is a total waste of product.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but over 90 degrees and the soap dispenser spits soap everywhere.  Other than that, it works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soap as body soap for years, but always felt like it was a bit harsh and left a film. But the Skikakai soap eliminates that... It&#x27;s even gentle enough to use on my hair (I use the tea tree variety). This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> At first use it seemed strong&lt;br /&gt;But for body odor control it is great&lt;br /&gt;Even lasts through long asian flights from USA&lt;br /&gt;good fresh feeling too&lt;br /&gt;this is typical with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This product may be just what the doctor ordered for some people, but I come from a mainstream soap consumer market, and here is what I don&#x27;t like about this stuff compared to my store brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Has a residue that is sticky and weird if you don&#x27;t wash it off thoroughly.  Several times I&#x27;ve washed my hands using this, and later felt the stickiness on my palms because I didn&#x27;t hit that spot hard enough with the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t lather up like bigger brands do.  I know this may not mean anything, but the lather matters to me now, whether it&#x27;s in my head or not, if only because I can see where I&#x27;m cleaning.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem to cut through grime like my regular stuff does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Don&#x27;t like the smell.  Doesn&#x27;t smell natural, or botanical, just smells weird and medicine-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the is a great natural option for some people, it just didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I went back to old spice in the shower and dial at the sink.</li>
            <li> Once you start using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, you&#x27;ll never go back to other soaps.  Natural ingredients from a responsibly run family business.... I&#x27;m absolutely hooked.</li>
            <li> If you really,really like tree tea oil you will like this body wash. Feels and smells like your washing with medicine . Lathers okay with quite a bit. It&#x27;s not bad..it&#x27;s just eh</li>
            <li> Sadly, while I love the benefits of Tea Tree Oil soaps this smells like WD40.  Not what I want in a body wash.</li>
            <li> As others have said, made me quite itchy with rashes.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the few guys (with medium length hair) who uses Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products... so here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is an INCREDIBLE company. Environmentally, socially, financially responsible through and through. Legit fair trade, seriously organic, no one gets paid more than 5 times another (amazing considering that most CEOs nowadays make hundreds times what their factory floor workers do), employees get 100% free healthcare, and they give like a third of their profits back to charity (beyond their free trade projects, which, among other things, support peaceful Palestinian/Israeli coexistence and medical equipment for hospitals in Sri Lanka). If corporations were actually people, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s would be Gandhi (and I should know, I&#x27;m Indian :P)&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair! So soft, so shiny (not greasy though), so healthy and strong...Not only that, but after using this and the conditioning rinse and leave-in conditioner, I can just run my hands through my hair to style it almost any which way I please! Do you know how much time that saves me in the morning? Now I don&#x27;t feel so guilty when pressing snooze 3x.&lt;br /&gt;-Love the strong smell of the soap when showering :) ahhh...tea tree...peppermint...so refreshing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-still experimenting on how much/little to use of each product. Right now, might be using too much shampoo, because hair becomes parched if I don&#x27;t use the leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;-Price. Originally used the soap on body too, but after not seeing a noticeable difference over my Dove bar, decided to save it for just the hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Though the soap smells wonderful, it doesn&#x27;t last on your hair (like my hair doesn&#x27;t smell like peppermint or tea trees--do those actually exist?? I don&#x27;t think tea leaves grow on trees, I always imagined them growing in bushes). Anyways... I suspect my hair actually smells a bit more like some oil (for all my desi folks out there, kinda like Ayurvedic medicine). I say \\&quot;suspect\\&quot; because I don&#x27;t smell it on a day to day basis, and no one has told me my hair stinks, but if I am hot and/or sweaty, sometimes I smell it.&lt;br /&gt;-for the citrus conditioning rinse, be careful, because it really stings if you get it in your eyes or on open cuts. Also, the smell of citrus and whatever oils they use is, frankly, nauseating in the shower. Citrus and that oil smell do not mix Dr. Bronner, nuh uh, not at all. Also, not a fan of having to dilute the rinse on my own before use. First world problems, I know, but I&#x27;d appreciate it if it came pre-diluted, and preferably at the same consistency as the soap (instead of having the viscosity of water, which is harder to work through your hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the novella. TL;DR: love the company and the results, not such a big fan of the price or the slight oily smell--but that&#x27;s what you get for all-natural. Also, for guys, cut back ALOT on what they tell you to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~A Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lifetime customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s.

            <li> This soap has me spoiled, cleans so clean</li>
            <li> Really nice soap.  My skin feels very clean and soft and with no dry winter skin itch.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It is easy on my hands and doesn&#x27;t cause my eczema to flair up. This is so much better than the chemical laden disinfecting soaps. I only wish there were refills available for it so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep adding to my collection of plastic bottles.</li>
            <li> I use Dr Bronner&#x27;s tea tree bar soap. This is just a nice. It keeps my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li> This works great though it can be sticky if you do not use enough water. One thing I love is the way it rinses clean so easily...no oily residue like some soaps. The smell is a little different but we use daily for hand washing and both my husband and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used up the first bottle and reordered another so we liked it enough to reorder and that says a lot right there.</li>
            <li> I decided to start taking better care of my skin especially now that it&#x27;s being exposed to intense heat from the sun. I did some searching and found that this item had alot of natural elements good for skin so that&#x27;s what enticed me to buy it. The smell reminds me of medicine but it&#x27;s not super awful.I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days now and i will continue to use it despite the smell to see if there&#x27;s any difference in the appearance of my skin. I read somewhere that it attracts ants- I have noticed a couple ants around but nothing overwhelming. I had this shipped to my APO/DPO address with an estimated arrival time of 12 days and it was here in 9 days so that was good. If/When i notice a difference in my skin, i&#x27;ll update this post.</li>
            <li> I love this product and wish more of my local stores carried it!!</li>
            <li> I saw this in my mother&#x27;s bathroom &amp; was curious about it so I decided to try it for myself. OMG my skin loves this! What a clean, fresh feeling it gives. I will definitely be getting the gallon when this is out.</li>
            <li> The price is right, but the odor is wrong. It&#x27;s a soap that smels a bit like motor oil. My skin doesn&#x27;t smell that way, just the soap. It lathers great and I feel clean. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again, but I&#x27;m willing to try another Dr. Bronners product.</li>
            <li> This soap has a truly unpleasant odor, and it is sticky.  The faucets become sticky from the soap.  I would probably never purchase this item again.  However, my daughter really likes it for her two little boys.</li>
            <li> We love Dr Bronner&#x27;s soaps, and this one is equally great. Only problem is that this one seems to attract ants. We&#x27;ve never seen ants in our house until we left this soap in our bathroom for a few nights. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the bottle or the soap residue, but ants seem to go crazy for it. Weird.</li>
            <li> We really like this body wash. It feels very comforting and leaves the skin moist and energized...</li>
            <li> This product has somehow removed hot spots and itchy ness of my scalp. I can feel it working into my scalp and seems to soothe scalp.</li>
            <li> This soap may not smell good but it rinses clean and seems to have a decent amount of tea tree oil in it for antibacterial purposes. We have phases out all the commercial antibacterial soap in our house.</li>
            <li> Item received promptly.Takes some getting used to.  It&#x27;s thicker than the traditional Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Castle liquid soap.  Still a very good product.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using this product due to my skin being so sensitive. I now have this in my guest bathroom for use by visitors.</li>
            <li> I love the soap, it&#x27;s my favorite kind. But the dispenser leaks constantly and I need to transfer it out to another one.</li>
            <li> Very bad smell, this stuff absolutely smells horrible, would not recommend!!</li>
            <li> It contains lye!! (Potassium hydroxide), why would you want that on your body?? This ingredient is used in batteries!! Disgusting! See the ingredients list yourself... Ew!!!</li>
            <li> If you enjoy tea tree soap, this is the best.  You get the stimulation of the tea tree plus the silky smoothness of the brazilian moisturizer!</li>
            <li> For 8years, I had two problems with my scalp, first with really uncontrollable dandruff, and second with some kind of &amp;#34;travelling&amp;#34; eczema that caused small blisters and scale.  The medicine the doctor prescribed did nothing for either, neither did any of the 9 different dandruff shampoos alone or in various combinations.  Baby oil did nothing.  Nothing worked.  Someone at the gym mentioned &amp;#34;tea tree oil&amp;#34; as great for getting rid of various skin conditions you can pick up from the gym. So, I bought this hand and body soap as well as a small bottle of tea tree oil.  At night, after my shower after working out, I put a few drops of the tea tree oil directly on the affected areas on my scalp and then also massage it all over and comb it in.  In the morning and after my evening shower, I use this hand and body wash as my only shampoo.  After a week, my dandruff is gone.  The travelling blisters are 75% gone and are no longer get rough and scaley.  And my color treated hair is soft and needs very little conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, mind you, Tea Tree Oil smells like a mixture of Pine Sol and cat butt, so this is the reason I only put it directly on my scalp in the evening. (Yes, I live alone.) The hand and body wash has a bit of the smell as well (this is how you know it&#x27;s real), but after the hair is dry, the smell pretty much goes away. If someone put their nose right up to your hair, they may smell it, though.  But the results of no more dandruff and reduction of that eczema??? So worth a little Pine Sol and cat butt smell!</li>
            <li> Its amazing! Great lather and quick rinse!</li>
            <li> I love this tea tree soap! I am a nurse and I have to use something antimicrobial or I break out terribly. I also have very sensitive skin. I have had no skin reactions to this product, it has stopped my breakouts and I feel super clean after using. I will never use anything else again after using this. In a pinch, I brushed my teeth with it as well and it worked awesome. I highly recommend!</li>
