            <li>Even with the lavender it still kind of smelled like cigarettes.</li>

            <li>After using this product for well over a month I think its pulling my edges out more so than making them grow.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s simply amazing; it leaves my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Be warned, this particular product with the lavender scent smells very strong and medicinal.</li>
            <li>Well this review is late as my bottle of this is gone lol!  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>and i find IT such a good product that i will be repurchasing the 8 oz</li>
            <li>It grows and thickens the hair quickly..</li>
            <li>I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen significant results but defiantly love the smell and how soft my hair feel</li>
            <li>The lavender black castor oil leaves a very fresh and pleasant scent on my hair.</li>
            <li>Really happy to receive my Lavender Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Tropic Isle!!</li>
            <li>So far I am enjoying using it and how it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft my hair is when I used this castor oil.</li>
            <li>This Natural product I absolutely Love and recommend.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Does not live up to the promise of healthy, strong and growing hair.</li>
            <li>After being pregnant my hair started shedding and this has really helped with that.</li>
            <li>Castor oil is good for black hair, though so if you need some  </li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li>Feels great on my hair, smells a little smoky for me, but it works wonders!!</li>
            <li>It did cause my scalp to itch when I first started using it, but I kept using it since the website said to keep using it to improve scalp health.</li>
            <li>This one smells MUCH better than the regular JBCO.</li>
            <li>I am currently transitioning from relaxed hair and love this product.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well if you use as directed.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>You can buy it here at Amazon.com, same price as most stores - the folks who make it seemed to have that locked in no matter</li>
            <li>I hope it works as well as it did with my first bottle.</li>
            <li>I added more Lavender Essential Oil&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the end, however, if you have damaged hair, I recommend my tried and true stand-by - \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Blessing - a fab hair dressing from my home town of Brooklyn, New York...</li>
            <li>The lavender jamaican castor oil works very well with my hair.</li>
            <li>I can really see how massaging it in works.</li>
            <li>Purchasing it from Amazon is much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li>hair is much thicker now</li>
            <li>I have very thinning hair around my head (my edges).  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The oil can feel sticky if too much is applied.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well and arrived as described.</li>
            <li>The lavender definitely masks the original smell of the roasting bean process....</li>
            <li>I have a healthy sheen to my hair without it being weighted down.  </li>
            <li>I really love this  Lavender Jamican Black Castor Oil</li>
            <li>i love this smell over the smell of orginal black castor oil.</li>
            <li>I love using black castor oil on my hair, because it helps with the dryness and aids in the growth.</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;ll be back to buy more when I run low.  </li>
            <li>I mainly bought this products to help with hair growth and moisture.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair growth, but the added moisture is great for the winter months because my hair tends to be more dry in cold weather.</li>
            <li>I normally just oil my scalp with it, massage it into my edges, and use it to deal in moisture.</li>
            <li>I personally am not into \\&quot;Eau de Smo-kee\\&quot; scents, but if it works to restore strength and vibrancy to my locks, than it might be worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough to give you any review other than the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>It has helped increase the length of my already existing hair, and I can see regrowth of new hair coming in around the edges and crown of my head.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use a lot I used a very sparingly actually because I read reviews of people using too much and it irritates the skin.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>the meantime, I will report back on any progress after using Lavendar Jamaican Black Castor Oil for a bit...after all, like most females, it takes a while for hair to change its mind...</li>
            <li>Smells much better than the standard Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  </li>
            <li>It is very thick kind of like a syrup</li>
            <li>I purchased this oil to help stimulate the growth of my natural hair.</li>
            <li>but two or three times so far.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The regular version had a very, smoky scent.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been natural this has been my go to product for retaining length and moisture.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use frequently</li>
            <li>I am a repeat customer and so far I have 2 family members using it</li>
            <li>I have used it years ago on permed hair and my Natural hair.</li>
            <li>and I use this as scalp oil for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Have only used when mixed with other oils in my hair but love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing so many rave reviews on youtube, I mean I guess it works, just seems like any type of oil.</li>
            <li>This oil has a unique scent that takes a minute to get use to however it does fade after a little while.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say much about it other than it smells like smoked wood...  </li>
            <li>The lavender scent helps but the odor is still strong but you get past it after a while.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t see much change after using it on a daily basis for a long amount of time.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, the itching stopped, my natural 4b hair (which always feels dry and \\&quot;crunchie\\&quot;) is incredibly moisturized, and last but not least, I kid you not, my hair grew almost an inch in less than a month of use!!!</li>
            <li>A lot thinner that the regular Jamaican Black Castor Oil and the smell make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get a chance to actually try it as the bottle was broken when it arrived, however, I am sure this oil would have been very nice.</li>
            <li>This oil is thick and not runny, it has a strong smell</li>
            <li>Generally I use at bedtime.</li>
            <li>It was a bit too heavy for me to use as a sealant, which I learned the hard way, but when I used it before washing my hair, my scalp felt amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li>First, I purchased this along with the extra dark JBCO about a wk ago.</li>
            <li>I really felt it when I was driving with my windows down...</li>
            <li>The oil is thick so less is more.</li>
            <li>I am currently using it on my edges and the nap of my neck as they were becoming thin, now they are starting to grow back.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my edges in order to regrow them, mainly because it was highly recommended on You Tube for helps with hair regrowth in complex areas.</li>

            <li> You can buy it here at Amazon.com, same price as most stores - the folks who make it seemed to have that locked in no matter</li>
            <li> I hope it works as well as it did with my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I added more Lavender Essential Oil&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the end, however, if you have damaged hair, I recommend my tried and true stand-by - \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Blessing - a fab hair dressing from my home town of Brooklyn, New York...</li>
            <li> The lavender jamaican castor oil works very well with my hair.</li>
            <li> I can really see how massaging it in works.</li>
            <li> Purchasing it from Amazon is much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li> hair is much thicker now</li>
            <li> I have very thinning hair around my head (my edges).  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The oil can feel sticky if too much is applied.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well and arrived as described.</li>
            <li> The lavender definitely masks the original smell of the roasting bean process....</li>
            <li> I have a healthy sheen to my hair without it being weighted down.  </li>
            <li> I really love this  Lavender Jamican Black Castor Oil</li>
            <li> i love this smell over the smell of orginal black castor oil.</li>
            <li> I love using black castor oil on my hair, because it helps with the dryness and aids in the growth.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ll be back to buy more when I run low.  </li>
            <li> I mainly bought this products to help with hair growth and moisture.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair growth, but the added moisture is great for the winter months because my hair tends to be more dry in cold weather.</li>
            <li> I normally just oil my scalp with it, massage it into my edges, and use it to deal in moisture.</li>
            <li> I personally am not into \\&quot;Eau de Smo-kee\\&quot; scents, but if it works to restore strength and vibrancy to my locks, than it might be worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to give you any review other than the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> It has helped increase the length of my already existing hair, and I can see regrowth of new hair coming in around the edges and crown of my head.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use a lot I used a very sparingly actually because I read reviews of people using too much and it irritates the skin.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> the meantime, I will report back on any progress after using Lavendar Jamaican Black Castor Oil for a bit...after all, like most females, it takes a while for hair to change its mind...</li>
            <li> Smells much better than the standard Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick kind of like a syrup</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to help stimulate the growth of my natural hair.</li>
            <li> but two or three times so far.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The regular version had a very, smoky scent.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been natural this has been my go to product for retaining length and moisture.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use frequently</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer and so far I have 2 family members using it</li>
            <li> I have used it years ago on permed hair and my Natural hair.</li>
            <li> and I use this as scalp oil for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Have only used when mixed with other oils in my hair but love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing so many rave reviews on youtube, I mean I guess it works, just seems like any type of oil.</li>
            <li> This oil has a unique scent that takes a minute to get use to however it does fade after a little while.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really say much about it other than it smells like smoked wood...  </li>
            <li> The lavender scent helps but the odor is still strong but you get past it after a while.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t see much change after using it on a daily basis for a long amount of time.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, the itching stopped, my natural 4b hair (which always feels dry and \\&quot;crunchie\\&quot;) is incredibly moisturized, and last but not least, I kid you not, my hair grew almost an inch in less than a month of use!!!</li>
            <li> A lot thinner that the regular Jamaican Black Castor Oil and the smell make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get a chance to actually try it as the bottle was broken when it arrived, however, I am sure this oil would have been very nice.</li>
            <li> This oil is thick and not runny, it has a strong smell</li>
            <li> Generally I use at bedtime.</li>
            <li> It was a bit too heavy for me to use as a sealant, which I learned the hard way, but when I used it before washing my hair, my scalp felt amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li> First, I purchased this along with the extra dark JBCO about a wk ago.</li>
            <li> I really felt it when I was driving with my windows down...</li>
            <li> The oil is thick so less is more.</li>
            <li> I am currently using it on my edges and the nap of my neck as they were becoming thin, now they are starting to grow back.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my edges in order to regrow them, mainly because it was highly recommended on You Tube for helps with hair regrowth in complex areas.</li>
            <li> I havent noticed any growth yet as I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough.</li>
            <li> so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% castor.  </li>
            <li> One thing is certain: this stuff is so thick that it will last 20 lifetimes!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been natural for 6 years, and I swear by Jamaican Black Castor Oil!&lt;br /&gt;Quick and</li>
            <li> I remember a long time ago when I used to use JBCO on my hair.</li>
            <li> My package arrived earlier than I expected and will probably reorder again when this bottle is all gone.</li>
            <li> have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil -</li>
            <li> I use mixed with other oils (coconut, olive, jojoba, etc..) to maintain moisture.</li>
            <li> Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is super thick and can weigh the hair down, so if I put it on my straightened hair i use it sparsely so that my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down.</li>
            <li> The Lavender Jamaican Black Castor Oil has helped my hair so much in the past 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> take a small bit microwave it and grease my natural hair with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular Jamaican Black Castor Oil, but decided on the Lavender version for the scent.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll try the Jamaican black castor oil with coconut next (Tropic Isle Living).</li>
            <li> It provides great shine and the smell is not overly terrible.</li>
            <li> I have unprocessed afro textured hair.  </li>
            <li> My skin is glowing and clear, my hair grows so thick and faster with this product.</li>
            <li> I simply put a little oil on my finger tips and massage my scalp the JBCO every other day.</li>
            <li> (a little goes a long way)</li>
            <li> Plus a little foes a long way.</li>
            <li> but you can mix with other carrier oils to help mask the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, a little oil goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I wish it was in other scents as well.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as my extra dark JBCO, but a little still goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A very little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It helps with dry scalp...a little TMI, but the truth!</li>
            <li> but I seen growth with in two weeks; there was fuzz and now its hair that I can lay down.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Lavender one and the smell is not as bad as the original Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> they have grew in slightly</li>
            <li> it is slightly sticky.</li>
            <li> Add on the Lavender Jamaican Black Castor Oil.</li>

            <li> I like the lavender scent to mask some of the harsh odor.</li>
            <li> A few drops of this oil smoothed through my hair and applied to my scalp controls the dryness and itch.  </li>
            <li> , it is very thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is very thick but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Beware it is very thick so only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> The oil is pretty thick but to bad.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easier to apply with a (Hair Tooth brush) and/or massaged a Small amount into scalp being</li>
            <li> I found using a small makeup brush helps with keeping it off your hands.</li>
            <li> It was so thick, but then I stopped.</li>
            <li> The oil was a bit thick though.</li>
            <li> Its thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick but that doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit.</li>
            <li> It coats and protect hair and leaves it soft and well moisterized, after dealing with dry brittle hair that was shredding awful</li>
            <li> It is thick, but if you mix it with another oil it helps to loosen it up!</li>
            <li> You can thin the consistency with 100% coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Also, even with the lavender, black castor oil still smells a bit unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about the smell everyone kept saying was &#x27;bad&#x27;.  </li>

            <li> and it stinks</li>
            <li> It has the consistency of cold honey and one drop, after warming it in the palm of your hands, spreads like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it that bad, maybe the Lavender scent helps.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot! I remember a long time ago when I used to use JBCO on my hair. It was so thick, but then I stopped. Worst choice I ever made. I will never stop using this stuff again!</li>
            <li> i dont like the smell but it works great</li>
            <li> this product seems to work for everyone but me and my mom cause it made both of our hairs fall out i have not used it since and it stinks</li>
            <li> In just the short period of time that I have used this product, it has helped to stimulate hair growth. I love it.</li>
            <li> The lavender jamaican castor oil works very well with my hair. I stretch my relaxers and I also do the greenhouse effect on my hair and I use this as one of my staple products! It is thick, but if you mix it with another oil it helps to loosen it up! I saw a lot of reviews about the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Mix it with a better smelling oil and that will help! It works for me!</li>
            <li> Really happy to receive my Lavender Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  A lot thinner that the regular Jamaican Black Castor Oil and the smell make a huge difference.  So far I am enjoying using it and how it makes my hair feel.  Pretty good on the skin also.</li>
            <li> I am on my 4th bottle of this stuff and I cannot get enough of it. It is great for my relaxed hair that I flat iron and roller set. It is super thick and can weigh the hair down, so if I put it on my straightened hair i use it sparsely so that my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down. This not only works for hair and scalp, but also for nails and skin. My nails are noticeably stronger just by happenstance of applying this on my hair with my fingers. This also works for kitchen and heat tool burns, scapes, and pimples. I like the lavender scent to mask some of the harsh odor. This is truly a great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to help stimulate the growth of my natural hair. I can really see how massaging it in works. Be warned, this particular product with the lavender scent smells very strong and medicinal. Because if that, I really only use it after hours and sleep with a satin cap.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell, and is so moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I am the biggest skeptic...but this product is AWESOME!!! It did cause my scalp to itch when I first started using it, but I kept using it since the website said to keep using it to improve scalp health. After a few weeks, the itching stopped, my natural 4b hair (which always feels dry and \\&quot;crunchie\\&quot;) is incredibly moisturized, and last but not least, I kid you not, my hair grew almost an inch in less than a month of use!!! I recommend to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely a lot smoother than regular castor oil. Works great on thinning natural hair but it didnt smell any different. I thought the lavender smell would be stronger.</li>
            <li> Well this review is late as my bottle of this is gone lol!  I did just purchase another bottle though.  Great all purpose oil!</li>
            <li> smell was still horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working so far so good. Will definitely purchase more in the future. Smells soooo good.</li>
            <li> Have only used when mixed with other oils in my hair but love the way it makes my hair feel. My package arrived earlier than I expected and will probably reorder again when this bottle is all gone.</li>
            <li> I use this for my daughters hair because she is bald on the edges when using this product her edges they have grew in slightly so I will continue to use</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning around the edges. I use this product on my edges, eyelashes and my eyebrows. My edges are growing, my eyelashes and my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I really love this  Lavender Jamican Black Castor Oil......I use it on my edges in order to regrow them, mainly because it was highly recommended on You Tube for helps with hair regrowth in complex areas. It really does work!!!!! I cowash my hair twice a week and at the end of my routine I oil My edges with my LJBCO. Yes I see growth. I believe I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a month now.... but I seen growth with in two weeks; there was fuzz and now its hair that I can lay down.  Will be repurchasing</li>
            <li> Love love this oil  will buy againgreat oil for my hair</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it but two or three times so far.</li>
            <li> This product is great. All I smell is the lavender and no castor oil smell. Great product, good value, will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I bought the 4oz for our daughter, we love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and end results of using JBCO! This one smells MUCH better than the regular JBCO. It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and moisturizer. I normally just oil my scalp with it, massage it into my edges, and use it to deal in moisture. Great product, and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product, It came almost right away and I started using it immediately I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular Jamaican Black Castor Oil, but decided on the Lavender version for the scent. The regular version had a very, smoky scent.</li>
            <li> Does not live up to the promise of healthy, strong and growing hair.</li>
            <li> Product smelled nice. The oil was a bit thick though. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get a chance to actually try it as the bottle was broken when it arrived, however, I am sure this oil would have been very nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of JBCO. Purchasing it from Amazon is much cheaper than in the stores. Since I&#x27;ve been natural this has been my go to product for retaining length and moisture.  It&#x27;s a great sealant and I also add it my homemade shea butter hair/scalp moisturizer. After I had my second child I started losing my hair around my edges and immediately started using lavender JBCO. My hair started to grow back immediately. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use frequently but it definitely keeps my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my hair is when I used this castor oil. I love the smell! I think I&#x27;ll try the Jamaican black castor oil with coconut next (Tropic Isle Living).</li>
            <li> This makes for a great pre-poo!     It was a bit too heavy for me to use as a sealant, which I learned the hard way, but when I used it before washing my hair, my scalp felt amazing afterwards. Also, even with the lavender, black castor oil still smells a bit unpleasant.</li>
            <li> hair is much thicker now</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen significant results but defiantly love the smell and how soft my hair feel</li>
            <li> I am currently transitioning from relaxed hair and love this product.  I use mixed with other oils (coconut, olive, jojoba, etc..) to maintain moisture.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer and so far I have 2 family members using it</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after researching and finding it had Great benefits for hair and making it thicker...A lot thicker, even in balding areas and edges. You may prefer the Lavender scented the (original smells like ash), it is very thick and a little goes a long way. The 4oz bottle last me  6+ months with daily use, it&#x27;s easier to apply with a (Hair Tooth brush) and/or massaged a Small amount into scalp being it is slightly sticky. I have used it years ago on permed hair and my Natural hair. The Tropic Isle Living brand is the The Best quality brand. This Natural product I absolutely Love and recommend.</li>
            <li> I read this would help with my thinning edges. It works pretty well if you use as directed. The oil is pretty thick but to bad. I found using a small makeup brush helps with keeping it off your hands. I also read that if you use a q-tip you can use it at night to regrow eye lashes</li>
            <li> Castor oil is smelly. I was hoping that the lavender would mask the smell but it didn&#x27;t. I do still use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because  I heard that it would help with hair growth.  I have very thinning hair around my head (my edges).  I have seen some women have very good results using this product.  I have been using it nightly on my hair and eyebrows.  I bought the Lavender one and the smell is not as bad as the original Castor Oil. Beware it is very thick so only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> First, I purchased this along with the extra dark JBCO about a wk ago. The lavender definitely masks the original smell of the roasting bean process....very pleasant scent.  I love how it feels on my scalp, the tingling of the lavender gives it a cooling sensation.  I really felt it when I was driving with my windows down...WOW!  It also puts you in a relax state as if you were getting a scalp/body massage.  Would definitely purchase again!  It is not as thick as my extra dark JBCO, but a little still goes a long way.  Applicator bottle recommended.  This is a must have to soothe the scalp and relax the mind.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it!! I use it on all of my clients along with myself and family!!</li>
            <li> i love this smell over the smell of orginal black castor oil. i use it the same way. take a small bit microwave it and grease my natural hair with it. when i do my two strand twists i use it on my ends. for winter it is a great sealent. i use olive oil in the summer because its lighter. but in the winter i need something heaveier. the smell i actually like.</li>
            <li> This oil makes my hair grow and it moisturize my hair at the same time. I will used this oil forever.</li>
            <li> Great product, great seller and price. I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
            <li> I love using black castor oil on my hair, because it helps with the dryness and aids in the growth.The lavender black castor oil leaves a very fresh and pleasant scent on my hair.</li>
            <li> my hair feels so good with this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a amazing product for your hair &amp; skin if you choose. It coats and protect hair and leaves it soft and well moisterized, after dealing with dry brittle hair that was shredding awful this was a miracle fix</li>
            <li> This product really works! It grows and thickens the hair quickly.. The oil is thick so less is more. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this is my second bottle and I use this as scalp oil for my natural hair. I have noticed hair growth and it keeps my hair moisturized. The smell is a little smoky but the lavender helps with that some.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;m liking this oil a lot! It&#x27;s very thick!!! (a little goes a long way) I simply put a little oil on my finger tips and massage my scalp the JBCO every other day. I can&#x27;t believe how hydrated and silky my hair feels. Will definitely be a staple in my hair care regimen!!!</li>
            <li> I kept hearing good things about JBCO (Jamaican Black Castor Oil) and I am happy to know it has lived up to the hype!  Awesome stuff.  I was a little worried about the smell everyone kept saying was &#x27;bad&#x27;.  I don&#x27;t find it that bad, maybe the Lavender scent helps.  Anyway, I&#x27;ll be back to buy more when I run low.  My Sisterlocks love this stuff! Thanks</li>
            <li> Love the product. It provides great shine and the smell is not overly terrible. Its thick and it moisturizes like it says it would. I havent noticed any growth yet as I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough.</li>
            <li> It smells better than the original.  I love what it does for my hair.  It is very thick but a little goes a long way.  I am currently using it on my edges and the nap of my neck as they were becoming thin, now they are starting to grow back.  Would definitely recommend.  You can also use on your scalp.  Generally I use at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who  needs to thicken and grow their hair.  This stuff is the truth!</li>
            <li> I have unprocessed afro textured hair.  A few drops of this oil smoothed through my hair and applied to my scalp controls the dryness and itch.  I have a healthy sheen to my hair without it being weighted down.  A very little goes a long way.  The oil can feel sticky if too much is applied.  You can thin the consistency with 100% coconut oil.</li>
            <li> The Lavender Jamaican Black Castor Oil has helped my hair so much in the past 2 weeks. I mainly bought this products to help with hair growth and moisture. I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair growth, but the added moisture is great for the winter months because my hair tends to be more dry in cold weather. The smell is pleasant and not too over-powering. I have fine, 4a/b kinky-curly hair. After I wash my hair: I use a leave-in conditioner, KC Knot Today. Add on the Lavender Jamaican Black Castor Oil. Then use a mixture of Shea Butter and Coconut Oil. My looks great, has shine, but isn&#x27;t oily. Love it. I would definitely recommend this product to people.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick but that doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit. I love the smell also. It works wonders on my hair and I love to use it as a sealant after I&#x27;ve moisturized my hair. Thanks Tropic Isle!!</li>
            <li> Helping to keep m hair healthy! After being pregnant my hair started shedding and this has really helped with that. I hear it even helps with thinning.</li>
            <li> It works for thinning hair</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my natural hair. It seals the moisture in my hair perfectly. And the lavender scent is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I just began using this product so I can&#x27;t really say much about it other than it smells like smoked wood...  I suppose that&#x27;s good if you like the smell of smoked whatever and the Lavendar additive does nothing to disguise it.  Me? I personally am not into \\&quot;Eau de Smo-kee\\&quot; scents, but if it works to restore strength and vibrancy to my locks, than it might be worth it.  One thing is certain: this stuff is so thick that it will last 20 lifetimes!  It has the consistency of cold honey and one drop, after warming it in the palm of your hands, spreads like crazy.  Multiply that by 8oz. and well, you get the picture...  In the end, however, if you have damaged hair, I recommend my tried and true stand-by - \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Blessing - a fab hair dressing from my home town of Brooklyn, New York...also loving referred to by its faithful fans as \\&quot;Hair Crack\\&quot;.  You can buy it here at Amazon.com, same price as most stores - the folks who make it seemed to have that locked in no matter where it&#x27;s sold.&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I will report back on any progress after using Lavendar Jamaican Black Castor Oil for a bit...after all, like most females, it takes a while for hair to change its mind...</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming. Delivery was very fast. I use this all the time. Can&#x27;t go wrong with. Plus a little foes a long way.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product!  I like the lavender scented mix.  It has helped increase the length of my already existing hair, and I can see regrowth of new hair coming in around the edges and crown of my head.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff soooooooooooo much!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been natural for 6 years, and I swear by Jamaican Black Castor Oil!&lt;br /&gt;Quick and efficient results!&lt;br /&gt;Thickness is promised!</li>
            <li> This oil has so many uses - but I use this on my scalp. This is wonderful for hair growth and strengthening plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! Just rub this on the scalp a couple of times a day and you will be AMAZED! This oil is thick and not runny, it has a strong smell but you can mix with other carrier oils to help mask the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a severe hair loss issue and using this oil helped me grow it back in a couple of months! Consistency is the key! I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil - just look for 100% and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand. I have indeed posted reviews on different brands because I have used these brands.  I use castor oil on my hair and my daughters hair and I mix my own hair products so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% castor.  I hope this review helps!!</li>
            <li> Smells much better than the standard Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  Shipment arrived on time and was well packaged.  Great customer service!!</li>
            <li> Feels great on my hair, smells a little smoky for me, but it works wonders!! It helps with dry scalp...a little TMI, but the truth!</li>
            <li> I got the package in a timely manner. I&#x27;ve purchased it once from another vendor but I loved the product itself and wanted to give it another go. It helped my hair grow with braids and now I want to try it again with a sew in I&#x27;m about to do. I hope it works as well as it did with my first bottle. The lavender scent helps but the odor is still strong but you get past it after a while.</li>
            <li> It is very thick kind of like a syrup but i put it in my conditioner and shampoo and its amazing</li>
            <li> I really like this product, smell great.  I added more Lavender Essential Oil&lt;br /&gt;to the Black Castor Oil.  I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this castor oil. It&#x27;s simply amazing; it leaves my hair very soft and shiny. This is now a staple product of mine and I will be repurchasing again.</li>
            <li> I love this product , it is perfect for the skin and hair . My skin is glowing and clear, my hair grows so thick and faster with this product.</li>
            <li> Smell is different but not overpowering. Lasts throughout the day. Makes your skin nice and soft. Doesn&#x27;t take much. I use it on my hair as well.</li>
            <li> Tropic Isle Jamaican Black castor&lt;br /&gt;Is the best ,just try it.&lt;br /&gt;Originally i bought the 4 oz and i find IT such a good product that i will be repurchasing the 8 oz</li>
            <li> At first I was worried about the smell however, the Lavender is absolutely wonderful.  Also, a little oil goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to give you any review other than the smell is pleasant. I wish it was in other scents as well.</li>
            <li> love the product, quick delivery, will buy again</li>
            <li> I purchased this project product as a result of multiple recommendations and after reading and lot of reviews! I bought it because my edges were very thin. After using this product for well over a month I think its pulling my edges out more so than making them grow. I didn&#x27;t use a lot I used a very sparingly actually because I read reviews of people using too much and it irritates the skin. It just doesn&#x27;t do what I thought it would do.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing so many rave reviews on youtube, I mean I guess it works, just seems like any type of oil. Even with the lavender it still kind of smelled like cigarettes. I needed it for thinning hair in the front of my head and I really didn&#x27;t see much change after using it on a daily basis for a long amount of time. Castor oil is good for black hair, though so if you need some  I guess it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well and arrived as described. This oil has a unique scent that takes a minute to get use to however it does fade after a little while. My hair seems to love this oil and plan on keeping as one of staple products.</li>
