            <li>so happy i can have it so cheap</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and smells great!</li>
            <li>It is a great year-round fragrance in my opinion, but most purists would probably say that it is mostly a spring and summer smell.  </li>
            <li>I had a friend who always wore this stuff and besides the fact that i liked the scent, girls would always complement him on his scent, so i got it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own way.</li>
            <li>It goes on light, with a good blend of citrus to create an inviting smell that does not overpower the senses.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite colognes and my experience with the sells was very smooth.</li>
            <li>Favorite scent of my husband :)</li>
            <li>If you want to smell better but still be recognized as a man, you should try Echo.</li>
            <li>This has been one of my favorite cologne&#x27;s for seven or eight years.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells great but it fades really fast.  </li>
            <li>and now i get more attention from women too.</li>
            <li>i love this eau de toilette.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite men&#x27;s cologne and my husband loves it</li>
            <li>and now I have another product from Davidoff that I love.</li>
            <li>Nice cheap price for the size of bottle I received.</li>
            <li>Price don&#x27;t match the smell I can do better for cheaper</li>
            <li>Recommend it to anyone who wants to smell good.</li>
            <li>My brother received this for christmas and seems to like it just fine.</li>
            <li>It has a great fresh scent much like Cool Water, yet unique in</li>
            <li>I say it is worth the $30 asking price, but it would be much better if it came in a container that I could not finish in under a month.</li>
            <li>I just love the fresh clean smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Cool Water</li>
            <li>The bottle is also a bit different but a good design.    </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect cologne for those of us who do not want to choke people around us, while letting those close to us have a little something extra.</li>
            <li>He used to wear this cologne when I first met him but it has been since discontinued</li>
            <li>I would categorize this cologne in the fruit category, as it is more of a sweet smell, than any of the other categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the scent of Echo by Davidoff but the trouble is it wears off super quickly.</li>
            <li>In fact, most people only notice the cologne after a hug, which is really when I want others to notice me for that.</li>
            <li>alcohol content is high in this scent, given it isn&#x27;t one of the &amp;#34;exclusive&amp;#34; scents, and will sting if you apply it to your neck right after shaving.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this men&#x27;s cologne at a local department store but it wasn&#x27;t available anymore.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone who likes Cool Water.    </li>
            <li>four main categories of men&#x27;s cologne&#x27;s as I understand them, are: fruit, herbal, woodsy, and baby-powder smells.  </li>
            <li>The scent has the sort of pleasant under smell you see in Old Spice&#x27;s &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; deodorant, and then a faint fruity overlay to it.</li>
            <li>It has a very beach like smell and lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li>the perfume stays for a long time,and very pleasing too</li>
            <li>However, I like the scent so much that I&#x27;m quite willing to deal with a few second sting.</li>
            <li>I have used this scent for several years now, and it never gets old.</li>
            <li>A few minutes after application (1-2 sprays), the scent will diminish to just the right amount.</li>
            <li>Whatever the case might be, it is worth about $90 a bottle, so in my opinion, the $30 price tag on Amazon is an unbelievable price.  </li>

            <li> Favorite scent of my husband :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and smells great! My husband loves it!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Echo by Davidoff but the trouble is it wears off super quickly.</li>
            <li> smells good, lasts up to 6 hours</li>
            <li> excellent fragrance is 100% recommended</li>
            <li> This is a hidden secret and was suggested to me by my nephew. An excellent cologne that should be in all men&#x27;s collection.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good purchase. It smells like heaven. Recommend it to anyone who wants to smell good. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This product is a well smelling cologne. It has a very beach like smell and lasts the entire day. Despite this, it comes in a small package. I say it is worth the $30 asking price, but it would be much better if it came in a container that I could not finish in under a month.</li>
            <li> I have used this scent for several years now, and it never gets old. It goes on light, with a good blend of citrus to create an inviting smell that does not overpower the senses. In fact, most people only notice the cologne after a hug, which is really when I want others to notice me for that. It also seems to blend well with different shampoo, deodorant, and shaving scents. This is the perfect cologne for those of us who do not want to choke people around us, while letting those close to us have a little something extra.</li>
            <li> You recognize the name Davidoff if you are a cigar smoker. This foo-foo juice goes well with cigars and even smells great by itself. A scent a man doesn&#x27;t mind even if you aren&#x27;t the perfume type. If you want to smell better but still be recognized as a man, you should try Echo. Good stuff !</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite cologne&#x27;s for seven or eight years.  I am almost on my third bottle of it, as I use it almost every day.  It is a great year-round fragrance in my opinion, but most purists would probably say that it is mostly a spring and summer smell.  Whatever the case might be, it is worth about $90 a bottle, so in my opinion, the $30 price tag on Amazon is an unbelievable price.  I have never seen this Cologne sold in a store for less than $60.  Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four main categories of men&#x27;s cologne&#x27;s as I understand them, are: fruit, herbal, woodsy, and baby-powder smells.  I would categorize this cologne in the fruit category, as it is more of a sweet smell, than any of the other categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received numerous compliments whilst wearing this cologne throughout the years.  I hope Davidoff never stops making it.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last long.  Wears off after  about an hour.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great but it fades really fast.  Whenever I wear it I ask people If they can smell it and no one ever can.  Be prepared to reapply ever couple of hours.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes and my experience with the sells was very smooth. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had a friend who always wore this stuff and besides the fact that i liked the scent, girls would always complement him on his scent, so i got it and now i get more attention from women too.</li>
            <li> i love this eau de toilette. so happy i can have it so cheap</li>
            <li> This is not too overbearing. My brother received this for christmas and seems to like it just fine. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite men&#x27;s cologne and my husband loves it</li>
            <li> Just get it,you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Another great product from Davidoff.    I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Cool Water and now I have another product from Davidoff that I love. It has a great fresh scent much like Cool Water, yet unique in it&#x27;s own way. The bottle is also a bit different but a good design.    I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone who likes Cool Water.    Delivery time from Amazon was great.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband. He used to wear this cologne when I first met him but it has been since discontinued and I could not find it anywhere locally. Arrived promptly, well packaged, smelled great!</li>
            <li> He smells so darn good! I love this on my man! Great buy also. Nice cheap price for the size of bottle I received. We are both happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this men&#x27;s cologne at a local department store but it wasn&#x27;t available anymore.  I just love the fresh clean smell.  I purchased two of them.</li>
            <li> I started buying this scent around 10 years ago, and never plan to change. The scent has the sort of pleasant under smell you see in Old Spice&#x27;s &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; deodorant, and then a faint fruity overlay to it. A few minutes after application (1-2 sprays), the scent will diminish to just the right amount. You will get faint whiffs now and then, but the scent is not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alcohol content is high in this scent, given it isn&#x27;t one of the &amp;#34;exclusive&amp;#34; scents, and will sting if you apply it to your neck right after shaving. However, I like the scent so much that I&#x27;m quite willing to deal with a few second sting.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and I&#x27;m very glad I did! Smells great.</li>
            <li> My wife loves when I smell like this. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years now and do not plan to change anything.</li>
            <li> Grandson Loves it. It was a Gift for him. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using it for 8 years now. the perfume stays for a long time,and very pleasing too</li>
            <li> spray is too hard to operate.</li>
            <li> Price don&#x27;t match the smell I can do better for cheaper</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this fragrance!</li>
