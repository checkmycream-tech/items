            <li>I normally love MAC lipsticks, but  this goes on like wallpaper paste.</li>
            <li>Eh, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more orangish.</li>

            <li>I LOVE IT ☆　</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;m going to start wear it more during Fall and Winter.</li>
            <li>Lipstick love</li>
            <li>really smooth and it smells nice which is a bonus</li>
            <li>Seller is very nice and fast answering questions about product.</li>
            <li>have full lips (which I love!)</li>
            <li>I love the consistency--goes on smoothly but has body and staying power.  </li>
            <li>Smears to easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great color, I didn&#x27;t think it was too dark of a red but looks great with my fair skin.</li>
            <li>I love MAC lipstick and it is way cool to find it at Amazon,.</li>
            <li>The color is deep and beautiful</li>
            <li>I love the bright red look</li>
            <li>and it have a smooth texture</li>
            <li>an orange tint, but still a great red.</li>
            <li>so I enjoy wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Super for women of color with darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>and she went from nice, normal to GLAM!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice red.  </li>
            <li>I have a very fair skin and dark hair</li>
            <li>When I wear it I get compliments all day long on how great I look and</li>
            <li>Great color and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>I thought the red was as bright as the picture....</li>
            <li>Goes well with bright red attire</li>
            <li>For me it lasts most of the day unless I&#x27;m eating something really juicy.  </li>
            <li>Quick and considerate service.  </li>
            <li>VERY MUCH!</li>
            <li>this color looked horrid on me, I&#x27;m a pale red head, it was a bit to orange, however my best friend looks GREAT in it, shes a medium skin toned blonde</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s half the price of Dior just adds to the joy.</li>
            <li>This has just the right amt of orange...</li>
            <li>It stays on and has just the right amt of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I guess I haven&#x27;t found the right pencil for it</li>
            <li>and she really can rock it!</li>
            <li>too orange, thought it was more of a red,blue not red orange</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to Le Orange by YSL, as it&#x27;s just as bright and a near dupe, but it&#x27;s less than half the price!</li>
            <li>This is very orange.</li>
            <li>It came really fast</li>
            <li>Really a knock out shade.</li>
            <li>It really stands OUT .</li>
            <li>very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I would just let it go, however, the real problem for me is the consistency.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is the absolute reason for the start of my MAC lipstick obsession...</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real matte and very orange,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>VERY MUSH.&lt;br</li>
            <li>unlike the mostly orange mac color I bought previously.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>and it is long lasting ,I love it</li>
            <li>I have dark hair, brown eyes and a light olive completion.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a hot, tomato red.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for red lipstick and this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I am a light skinned black haired scottish type and this goes with my coloring/ wardrobe here in South FL.  </li>
            <li>i own.the texture is also very matt but has moisture at the same time.</li>
            <li>kind of confused</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m black and you never really know how much you&#x27;ll like something until you try it on.</li>
            <li> This is the most fabulous, insane shade of red.  </li>
            <li> Lasts long, and then fades to a lip stain without losing a beat (i.e., no discoloration).  </li>
            <li> Lasts long time.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I like to mix it with a darker red to tone it down a bit.</li>
            <li> It is dry!  </li>
            <li> I like MAC just as much as any other makeup fanatic out there, but for some odd reason this lipstick didn&#x27;t knock me off my feet.</li>
            <li> For some reason it&#x27;s not actually matte like the ones I&#x27;ve bought in past..</li>
            <li> perhaps a little of glitter goes well if you don&#x60;t like the sensation of dry lips</li>
            <li> and I have a slightly tanned skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it everyday</li>
            <li> I usually take my butt down to the MAC counter</li>
            <li> this price is ridiculous</li>
            <li> guess i was wrong</li>
            <li> If it were just the color that was wrong for me</li>
            <li> i have owned some expensive lipstick..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very nice red.  Not too purple or brownish.  I have dark hair, brown eyes and a light olive completion.  It&#x27;s a great color for me.</li>
            <li> It is dry!  But I tell myself it is matte.  I have a MAC lipstick that is not matte that I love.</li>
            <li> This lipstick was not odered by me. Someone broke into my account while I was abroad and ordered it, so I know nothing about the product, except the price...</li>
            <li> I must say that when Amazon uses another vendor for purchase, they are just as good as Amazon.  I love MAC lipstick and it is way cool to find it at Amazon,.</li>
            <li> this color looked horrid on me, I&#x27;m a pale red head, it was a bit to orange, however my best friend looks GREAT in it, shes a medium skin toned blonde and she really can rock it! I gave it to her on our way to a fancy diner and she went from nice, normal to GLAM!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as pictured. When you put it on it has an orange look to it not red.</li>
            <li> Great my wife love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing this lipstick now. I love the Matte finish</li>
            <li> This is very orange. I like to mix it with a darker red to tone it down a bit.</li>
            <li> I usually take my butt down to the MAC counter but I saw this and said what the heck. It came really fast and I am very happy!!!</li>
            <li> so beautiful color and fits very nice on the lips. perhaps a little of glitter goes well if you don&#x60;t like the sensation of dry lips</li>
            <li> too orange, thought it was more of a red,blue not red orange</li>
            <li> This has just the right amt of orange...unlike the mostly orange mac color I bought previously. I am a light skinned black haired scottish type and this goes with my coloring/ wardrobe here in South FL.  It stays on and has just the right amt of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great color, I didn&#x27;t think it was too dark of a red but looks great with my fair skin.</li>
            <li> I love this color. Goes with almost everything i own.the texture is also very matt but has moisture at the same time.</li>
            <li> I had even contacted the House of Dior in Paris in my search for their  legendary but discontinued  \\&quot;Goldfish Red\\&quot;.  This is a great match and the end of my search.  This color is tres fabu with a summer tan, and equally perfect when feeling washed out by the winter blahs.  When I wear it I get compliments all day long on how great I look and what is different...  (No one mentions the lipstick per se, which is how it should be).  Lasts long, and then fades to a lip stain without losing a beat (i.e., no discoloration).  The fact that it&#x27;s half the price of Dior just adds to the joy.</li>
            <li> The most beatifull lipstick! Perfect red!,</li>
            <li> Nice color and feel to the lips. I&#x27;m black and you never really know how much you&#x27;ll like something until you try it on. The color matches pic but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t relate in pictures [I have iPhone 5c] the way it does in person.</li>
            <li> This is the most fabulous, insane shade of red.  Looks like there&#x27;s no blue in it so it&#x27;s a hot, tomato red.  I love the consistency--goes on smoothly but has body and staying power.  For me it lasts most of the day unless I&#x27;m eating something really juicy.  Still, it stays on beautifully and retains it&#x27;s color.  Really a knock out shade.</li>
            <li> this price is ridiculous i got this from macys for 15 dollar  you got to be kidden me i thought i was going to get it cheaper guess i was wrong i could buy 2 different lip stick from mac for the same price</li>
            <li> Love this color. It really stands OUT . I can wear it to work or the club. I recommend this color</li>
            <li> Love the color it&#x27;s definitely an orange red.</li>
            <li> For some reason it&#x27;s not actually matte like the ones I&#x27;ve bought in past.. kind of confused</li>
            <li> I have a very fair skin and dark hair it suits me so mush and it have a smooth texture and it is long lasting ,I love it</li>
            <li> Love it...... I love the bright red look</li>
            <li> beautiful color. very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Oh, la la!  Great color and I like the way it goes on and stays on.  Price is not a sign of quality and this is fairly priced.</li>
            <li> If it were just the color that was wrong for me I would just let it go, however, the real problem for me is the consistency. I normally love MAC lipsticks, but  this goes on like wallpaper paste.</li>
            <li> Eh, it&#x27;s okay. I thought the red was as bright as the picture.... it&#x27;s more orangish.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is the absolute reason for the start of my MAC lipstick obsession... I need to go to more places that require a dress code so I can flash these amazing lipsticks around!</li>
            <li> MAC definitely has pastier lipsticks...this is not one of them. Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;Has an orange tint, but still a great red. Goes well with bright red attire</li>
            <li> No what I was looking for.  Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with purchase</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick very pigmented and beautiful.... I get so many compliments everytime I wear it... I feel like lady danger! Lol</li>
            <li> I love it.  It is the best shade of red I have found. It also stays on well.</li>
            <li> Something I got to get used to I guess I haven&#x27;t found the right pencil for it but I&#x27;m still searching something different from this color but I like the madness of it I like the brightness of it or maybe I should get my foundation together with it</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to Le Orange by YSL, as it&#x27;s just as bright and a near dupe, but it&#x27;s less than half the price!</li>
            <li> Great Lipstick! The color is really bright. Love it!!! Seller is very nice and fast answering questions about product.</li>
            <li> The color is deep and beautiful I really love it</li>
            <li> I like the color of this lipstick site has great price for  MAC Cosmetics , I will be buying more of this from this site.</li>
            <li> Not for the gals who dont like being noticed. This lipstixk is debine for olive skin types as am I. However, it definitely gets attention.</li>
            <li> Great color and lasts a really long time. Great MAC product</li>
            <li> Looks amazing. Lasts long time. Gets on everything. Smears to easily</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick.  It&#x27;s a real matte and very orange,&lt;br /&gt;I have full lips (which I love!) so I enjoy wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Super for women of color with darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> BEST LIPSTICK I have  EVER OWNED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and i have owned some expensive lipstick..&lt;br /&gt;it stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT ☆　THANK YOU VERY MUCH! I AND&lt;br /&gt;WILL USE EVERY DAY. THANK YOU VERY MUSH.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS SO PERFECT.</li>
            <li> Love this color! I&#x27;ve been looking for red lipstick and this is exactly what I was looking for. I don&#x27;t wear it everyday but I think I&#x27;m going to start wear it more during Fall and Winter.</li>
            <li> This lipstick has a orange undertone great for olive skin.  I&#x27;m Asian and I have a slightly tanned skin.  I had gotten compliments wearing this red lipstick.</li>
            <li> Lipstick love lady danger by mac is great.  Would recommend it to anyone. Quick and considerate service.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> really smooth and it smells nice which is a bonus</li>
            <li> I like MAC just as much as any other makeup fanatic out there, but for some odd reason this lipstick didn&#x27;t knock me off my feet. One of my biggest lipstick pet peeves is when it sort of congeals on your lips. This lipstick does this for me (maybe it&#x27;s just my lips), so I have to set it with an eyeshadow. Love the shade though!</li>
