            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love curl keeper because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel too sticky, and there is no product build up.  </li>
            <li>I just wish I would&#x27;ve found it before I tried so many others.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but that is ok with me.  </li>

            <li>Have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is soaked with the product.  </li>
            <li>I love this curling solution ...</li>
            <li>Great for keeping curly hair  from REALLY frizzing.</li>
            <li>I love my curls now</li>
            <li>Adds a lot of time to drying, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love how it &amp;#34;reactivates&amp;#34;  with water, so If I decide not to wash my hair that morning,  </li>
            <li>The one thing I would recommend is that if you find it is not working, try using more product.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Buy the big bottle for the best value.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>am glad I bought the 33oz bottle because I go through a lot of product for one application.</li>
            <li>I have tried many name brands from the beauty salon and none have worked as well as this one.</li>
            <li>, I love it , I would order again from this seller</li>
            <li>It gives my hair control and beautiful soft curls</li>
            <li>Great for my natural curls.</li>
            <li>my curls love this stuff and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It washes out easily without leaving any buildup.</li>
            <li>My hair is no longer frizzy and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfumy smell</li>
            <li>Light weight, you can&#x27;t use too much cuz you can scrunch your hair and BOOM soft, defined, beautiful curls!</li>
            <li>You can also re-wet your hair with just water to have beautiful second day curls as well.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best curly hair product I have tried.  </li>
            <li>As much as I love Curl Keeper, it would be great if it were priced lower or if there was another similar product with a more economical price</li>
            <li>I have fine medium curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The package arrived super quick - AND - they threw in a really nice canvas tote bag and a free product (some nail strengthener).  </li>
            <li>Since I started using curl keeper not only are my curls beautiful, defined and frizz free, but it&#x27;s so light weight</li>
            <li>The product also works well on dry hair to control fly aways and more humid days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with my curly (3b), frizzy hair for years, but this product has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample from Birchbox then ordered this huge bottle.</li>
            <li>I have very coarse curly hair; this product works great.  </li>
            <li>this is a light silky product that controls frizz, and makes my locks silky and bouncy.</li>
            <li>smooth over hair</li>
            <li>I do not get great second day hair with this like it claims</li>
            <li>It is the best product I have found to tame my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>After many years, products, and a whole lotta $$, this is the product for me!  </li>
            <li>but sometimes, the price is worth it!</li>
            <li>I had been purchasing Curl Keeper from the seller&#x27;s website; however, shipping wasn&#x27;t always too friendly.</li>
            <li>She uses two different products (Curl Keeper and another product by Ouidad) and gives a great tutorial on how to properly apply the product for good results.  </li>
            <li>And the price was right!</li>
            <li>I find that if I use quite a bit (it&#x27;s very light weight), comb it evenly through my hair and then not touch it until it&#x27;s dry, my curls hold a nice spiral.</li>
            <li>so I can wake up day 2 and wet my hands, run over my hair and my curls look great.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I tried Curl Keeper after reading several good reviews and watched a video on youtube by Veronica Meza on how to apply it.  </li>
            <li>It tames the frizz and brings out the true beauty of curly hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted those nice soft curls, I would not buy it again</li>
            <li>Absolutely fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I use a professional grade hair dryer with a diffuser and get it 99% dry, scrunch in some hairspray and - voila - perfectly defined curls and NO FRIZZ.</li>
            <li>My curly hair will go fuzzy if when I let it air dry, which is fine if I liked 80&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job of taming fuzzy curls without too much heavy, sticky, or crunchy.  </li>
            <li>Light, not sticky, not crunchy, keeps my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>and they are enjoying soft manageable curls.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using Aubrey Rosa Mosqueta condtioner right now and am liking it.</li>
            <li>Ok, so it gives a nice curl,  but it leaves it super hard and crunchy,  </li>
            <li>Great Product really keeps the frizz down</li>
            <li>It will most likely look pretty gross/stringy/frizzy while it&#x27;s drying, but trust me, don&#x27;t touch it!</li>
            <li>It leaves hair feeling light and natural.</li>
            <li>Great for thick curly hair that tends to get frizzy.</li>
            <li>in first, then this.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My curls are smooth and soft, not at all crunchy.</li>
            <li>I flip my head back up and do the same to be sure to get the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>The first day I did my hair</li>
            <li>The packers had taped the products top from opening but didn&#x27;t tighten the entire lid.  </li>
            <li>Pretty springy curls without frizz, but every time I touched my hair, there was product dust everywhere.  </li>
            <li>The Curl Keeper keeps my hair from frizzing up, and can be reactivated the next day with just water and more scrunching.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>My husband, employees, and children have all made positive comments about my hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on the amazing reviews...so not worth the $.</li>
            <li>I want to add the this product also helps hold hot tool effects very well.</li>
            <li>If the main thing that you struggle with is frizz control, curl keeper will most likely work wonders for you.</li>
            <li>and after it is dry I scrunch it once more</li>
            <li>- I lived in VERY humid Florida most of my life, then moved out the the EXTREMELY arid Western US a year ago and Curl Keeper works like magic in both places, so</li>
            <li>and I still keep coming back to this one - lightweight and always works great on my 3b curls without weighing them down.</li>
            <li>I tried Curly Hair Solutions Curl Keeper last summer and it does a great job in keeping the fuzz down.  </li>
            <li>I let my hair air dry, then shake, scrunch, and fluff my curls out until they are the volume I am happy with.</li>
            <li>I always seem to have to totally wet it again and add more product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make a difference at all, it was very watery</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest going to the curly hair solutions website and reading about how the product works and watching some of the styling videos to get an idea of how much product to use.</li>
            <li>You can use quite a bit of the product and it never seems to be too much.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for keeping curly hair from frizzing in humid weather, but you do have to use a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been sulfate-free, silicone-free, paraben-free for three years now and my hair is much healthier but still very thirsty.</li>
            <li>there is no product build up no matter how much you use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very watery, non sticky and applies like a dream.</li>
            <li>It works really well...</li>
            <li>and this is the one I use to the very last drop and repurchase in the largest available size.</li>
            <li>My hair is very frizzy and this keeps things from getting out of control.</li>
            <li>The grays really frizz</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s dry and crunchy feeling, you should flip your hair over, &amp;#34;scrunch out the crunch&amp;#34; with your hands or a microfiber towel, flip your hair back up, and magically you will have soft, shiny, frizz free curls.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s dry (or almost dry), I scrunch a small amount of John Masters Shine On through the sections of hair most likely to frizz, and it stays perfectly all day.  </li>
            <li>Works great on long curly hair but it has dried my hair out a bit.</li>
            <li>I am down to using only Curl Keeper for perfect, frizz-free curls - not bad for a girl who used to use at least 3-4 products on any given day.  </li>
            <li>I found I had to add it in layers and use more than I would normally use for other products.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for many years a product that tames my frizz with out weighing down my curls.  </li>
            <li>Got a regular size from Birchbox but when that ran out checked out Amazon for better price and larger size.  </li>
            <li>I also used the pineapple method to sleep at night with the satin sleep cap and it worked wonders for 2nd day hair as I&#x27;ve never been able to sleep on my curly hair and wear it again without washing it the next day, until now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>keeps my hair from going flat on top later).  </li>
            <li>I just have to play with it a little more which I hoped to avoid.  </li>
            <li>Bonus - 2nd and 3rd day curls are still great with just a little water and/or leave-in spritz.</li>
            <li>It smooths my curls so they clump together, instead of breaking apart and having a huge fluff on my head.</li>
            <li>Normally, I shop at naturallycurly.com for all my products.  </li>
            <li>I put a good quantity on towel dried hair, flip my head over and scrunch, finger curl or shape according to the style I&#x27;m wearing, and dry with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s water-based, so it washes out clean every day and is gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to not mess with the curls until they&#x27;re dry, or you&#x27;ll still end up with frizz.  </li>
            <li>I live in moist Portland OR and frizzy hair is an on going battle.  </li>
            <li>did notice that after a few weeks of using, I was having to wash my hair more frequently to achieve the curl definition I wanted.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is so thick I don&#x27;t have good results of misting it with water the next day.  </li>
            <li>I normally hate my curly hair and defiantly never have more than one good curly hair day in a row.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Curl Keeper for about 5 years on my natural curly hair &amp; there is no product like it!</li>
            <li>It may sound like a major production and an excess of product, but I refuse to be one of those curlies who succumbs to the challenges of the ringlets and keep it up in a hair tie, so an extra 15 minutes 2-3 times a week is a tiny time investment to me.</li>
            <li>One great thing about this product is that it is impossible to use too much.</li>
            <li>After years of trying different products--and different combinations of products--to defrizz and smooth my curls, I have settled on Curly Hair Solutions Curl Keeper as my one and only after-shampoo-and-conditioner product.  </li>
            <li>I have been very dedicated to Aveda products for the last 18 years.</li>
            <li>I use this product EVERY DAY on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that tends to be frizzy.  </li>
            <li>This not only holds the curl but helps keep down the fine friz.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that makes my hair look normal.</li>
            <li>Definitely gonna be my new product of choice.  </li>
            <li>When I initially started using this I was not using enough and it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to be very generous; don&#x27;t skimp or your curls will be sorry.</li>
            <li>I use about 4 half dollar sized blobs on soaking wet hair, and top with a small amount of moptop light hold gel for some extra hold.</li>
            <li>I have tried using just gel, different gels, different serums, and the only thing I consistently need is this hair serum.</li>
            <li>This product will fight frizz like no other.</li>
            <li>have been using this product for 7 years and no other product has proven to define, maintain and enhance my curls the way</li>
            <li>I apply it to wet hair that I let air dry (or if I do use a diffuser I only dry most of the way).</li>
            <li>but actually let them do their naturally curly thing.  </li>
            <li>MUST use a &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34; of three different products to achieve any sense of looking normal when my mop is styled, and CHS Curl Keeper is an absolutely essential ingredient in my arsenal.</li>
            <li>Love this product it is the only thing that works on my naturally curly hair, it is very expensive but worth it for me.</li>
            <li>This cuts the frizz down to almost nothing, keeps my curls soft, and helps somewhat with curl definition, although a gel or another product with some hold is really necessary for good curl definition that doesn&#x27;t fall limp within a few hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lived in the dry desert of Palm Springs and now live in the humid conditions of Houston, Texas and Curl Keeper</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried alternatives to Curl Keeper with limited success, but keep going back to it since I know it will never let me - or my hair - down.</li>
            <li>After a few hours, the crystalized product began to &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; more and left my hair dull.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This stuff is great for my very curly hair!</li>
            <li> Products is very light weight, water based product.  </li>
            <li> It fights the frizz, defines the curls and is very light weight.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love curl keeper because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel too sticky, and there is no product build up.  </li>
            <li> I just wish I would&#x27;ve found it before I tried so many others.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but that is ok with me.  </li>
            <li> I is curl magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love how my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I love Curl Keeper.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> Make sure your hair is soaked with the product.  </li>
            <li> I love this curling solution ...</li>
            <li> Great for keeping curly hair  from REALLY frizzing.</li>
            <li> I love my curls now</li>
            <li> Adds a lot of time to drying, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love how it &amp;#34;reactivates&amp;#34;  with water, so If I decide not to wash my hair that morning,  </li>
            <li> The one thing I would recommend is that if you find it is not working, try using more product.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Buy the big bottle for the best value.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> am glad I bought the 33oz bottle because I go through a lot of product for one application.</li>
            <li> I have tried many name brands from the beauty salon and none have worked as well as this one.</li>
            <li> , I love it , I would order again from this seller</li>
            <li> It gives my hair control and beautiful soft curls</li>
            <li> Great for my natural curls.</li>
            <li> my curls love this stuff and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It washes out easily without leaving any buildup.</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer frizzy and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfumy smell</li>
            <li> Light weight, you can&#x27;t use too much cuz you can scrunch your hair and BOOM soft, defined, beautiful curls!</li>
            <li> You can also re-wet your hair with just water to have beautiful second day curls as well.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best curly hair product I have tried.  </li>
            <li> As much as I love Curl Keeper, it would be great if it were priced lower or if there was another similar product with a more economical price</li>
            <li> I have fine medium curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The package arrived super quick - AND - they threw in a really nice canvas tote bag and a free product (some nail strengthener).  </li>
            <li> Since I started using curl keeper not only are my curls beautiful, defined and frizz free, but it&#x27;s so light weight</li>
            <li> The product also works well on dry hair to control fly aways and more humid days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with my curly (3b), frizzy hair for years, but this product has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I got a sample from Birchbox then ordered this huge bottle.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse curly hair; this product works great.  </li>
            <li> this is a light silky product that controls frizz, and makes my locks silky and bouncy.</li>
            <li> smooth over hair</li>
            <li> I do not get great second day hair with this like it claims</li>
            <li> It is the best product I have found to tame my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> After many years, products, and a whole lotta $$, this is the product for me!  </li>
            <li> but sometimes, the price is worth it!</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing Curl Keeper from the seller&#x27;s website; however, shipping wasn&#x27;t always too friendly.</li>
            <li> She uses two different products (Curl Keeper and another product by Ouidad) and gives a great tutorial on how to properly apply the product for good results.  </li>
            <li> And the price was right!</li>
            <li> I find that if I use quite a bit (it&#x27;s very light weight), comb it evenly through my hair and then not touch it until it&#x27;s dry, my curls hold a nice spiral.</li>
            <li> so I can wake up day 2 and wet my hands, run over my hair and my curls look great.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I tried Curl Keeper after reading several good reviews and watched a video on youtube by Veronica Meza on how to apply it.  </li>
            <li> It tames the frizz and brings out the true beauty of curly hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted those nice soft curls, I would not buy it again</li>
            <li> Absolutely fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I use a professional grade hair dryer with a diffuser and get it 99% dry, scrunch in some hairspray and - voila - perfectly defined curls and NO FRIZZ.</li>
            <li> My curly hair will go fuzzy if when I let it air dry, which is fine if I liked 80&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job of taming fuzzy curls without too much heavy, sticky, or crunchy.  </li>
            <li> Light, not sticky, not crunchy, keeps my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> and they are enjoying soft manageable curls.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Aubrey Rosa Mosqueta condtioner right now and am liking it.</li>
            <li> Ok, so it gives a nice curl,  but it leaves it super hard and crunchy,  </li>
            <li> Great Product really keeps the frizz down</li>
            <li> It will most likely look pretty gross/stringy/frizzy while it&#x27;s drying, but trust me, don&#x27;t touch it!</li>
            <li> It leaves hair feeling light and natural.</li>
            <li> Great for thick curly hair that tends to get frizzy.</li>
            <li> in first, then this.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My curls are smooth and soft, not at all crunchy.</li>
            <li> I flip my head back up and do the same to be sure to get the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> The first day I did my hair</li>
            <li> The packers had taped the products top from opening but didn&#x27;t tighten the entire lid.  </li>
            <li> Pretty springy curls without frizz, but every time I touched my hair, there was product dust everywhere.  </li>
            <li> The Curl Keeper keeps my hair from frizzing up, and can be reactivated the next day with just water and more scrunching.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> My husband, employees, and children have all made positive comments about my hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on the amazing reviews...so not worth the $.</li>
            <li> I want to add the this product also helps hold hot tool effects very well.</li>
            <li> If the main thing that you struggle with is frizz control, curl keeper will most likely work wonders for you.</li>
            <li> and after it is dry I scrunch it once more</li>
            <li> - I lived in VERY humid Florida most of my life, then moved out the the EXTREMELY arid Western US a year ago and Curl Keeper works like magic in both places, so</li>
            <li> and I still keep coming back to this one - lightweight and always works great on my 3b curls without weighing them down.</li>
            <li> I tried Curly Hair Solutions Curl Keeper last summer and it does a great job in keeping the fuzz down.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry, then shake, scrunch, and fluff my curls out until they are the volume I am happy with.</li>
            <li> I always seem to have to totally wet it again and add more product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make a difference at all, it was very watery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest going to the curly hair solutions website and reading about how the product works and watching some of the styling videos to get an idea of how much product to use.</li>
            <li> You can use quite a bit of the product and it never seems to be too much.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for keeping curly hair from frizzing in humid weather, but you do have to use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sulfate-free, silicone-free, paraben-free for three years now and my hair is much healthier but still very thirsty.</li>
            <li> there is no product build up no matter how much you use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very watery, non sticky and applies like a dream.</li>
            <li> It works really well...</li>
            <li> and this is the one I use to the very last drop and repurchase in the largest available size.</li>
            <li> My hair is very frizzy and this keeps things from getting out of control.</li>
            <li> The grays really frizz</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry and crunchy feeling, you should flip your hair over, &amp;#34;scrunch out the crunch&amp;#34; with your hands or a microfiber towel, flip your hair back up, and magically you will have soft, shiny, frizz free curls.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s dry (or almost dry), I scrunch a small amount of John Masters Shine On through the sections of hair most likely to frizz, and it stays perfectly all day.  </li>
            <li> Works great on long curly hair but it has dried my hair out a bit.</li>
            <li> I am down to using only Curl Keeper for perfect, frizz-free curls - not bad for a girl who used to use at least 3-4 products on any given day.  </li>
            <li> I found I had to add it in layers and use more than I would normally use for other products.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for many years a product that tames my frizz with out weighing down my curls.  </li>
            <li> Got a regular size from Birchbox but when that ran out checked out Amazon for better price and larger size.  </li>
            <li> I also used the pineapple method to sleep at night with the satin sleep cap and it worked wonders for 2nd day hair as I&#x27;ve never been able to sleep on my curly hair and wear it again without washing it the next day, until now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair from going flat on top later).  </li>
            <li> I just have to play with it a little more which I hoped to avoid.  </li>
            <li> Bonus - 2nd and 3rd day curls are still great with just a little water and/or leave-in spritz.</li>
            <li> It smooths my curls so they clump together, instead of breaking apart and having a huge fluff on my head.</li>
            <li> Normally, I shop at naturallycurly.com for all my products.  </li>
            <li> I put a good quantity on towel dried hair, flip my head over and scrunch, finger curl or shape according to the style I&#x27;m wearing, and dry with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s water-based, so it washes out clean every day and is gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to not mess with the curls until they&#x27;re dry, or you&#x27;ll still end up with frizz.  </li>
            <li> I live in moist Portland OR and frizzy hair is an on going battle.  </li>
            <li> did notice that after a few weeks of using, I was having to wash my hair more frequently to achieve the curl definition I wanted.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so thick I don&#x27;t have good results of misting it with water the next day.  </li>
            <li> I normally hate my curly hair and defiantly never have more than one good curly hair day in a row.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Curl Keeper for about 5 years on my natural curly hair &amp; there is no product like it!</li>
            <li> It may sound like a major production and an excess of product, but I refuse to be one of those curlies who succumbs to the challenges of the ringlets and keep it up in a hair tie, so an extra 15 minutes 2-3 times a week is a tiny time investment to me.</li>
            <li> One great thing about this product is that it is impossible to use too much.</li>
            <li> After years of trying different products--and different combinations of products--to defrizz and smooth my curls, I have settled on Curly Hair Solutions Curl Keeper as my one and only after-shampoo-and-conditioner product.  </li>
            <li> I have been very dedicated to Aveda products for the last 18 years.</li>
            <li> I use this product EVERY DAY on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that tends to be frizzy.  </li>
            <li> This not only holds the curl but helps keep down the fine friz.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that makes my hair look normal.</li>
            <li> Definitely gonna be my new product of choice.  </li>
            <li> When I initially started using this I was not using enough and it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to be very generous; don&#x27;t skimp or your curls will be sorry.</li>
            <li> I use about 4 half dollar sized blobs on soaking wet hair, and top with a small amount of moptop light hold gel for some extra hold.</li>
            <li> I have tried using just gel, different gels, different serums, and the only thing I consistently need is this hair serum.</li>
            <li> This product will fight frizz like no other.</li>
            <li> have been using this product for 7 years and no other product has proven to define, maintain and enhance my curls the way</li>
            <li> I apply it to wet hair that I let air dry (or if I do use a diffuser I only dry most of the way).</li>
            <li> but actually let them do their naturally curly thing.  </li>
            <li> MUST use a &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34; of three different products to achieve any sense of looking normal when my mop is styled, and CHS Curl Keeper is an absolutely essential ingredient in my arsenal.</li>
            <li> Love this product it is the only thing that works on my naturally curly hair, it is very expensive but worth it for me.</li>
            <li> This cuts the frizz down to almost nothing, keeps my curls soft, and helps somewhat with curl definition, although a gel or another product with some hold is really necessary for good curl definition that doesn&#x27;t fall limp within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lived in the dry desert of Palm Springs and now live in the humid conditions of Houston, Texas and Curl Keeper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried alternatives to Curl Keeper with limited success, but keep going back to it since I know it will never let me - or my hair - down.</li>
            <li> After a few hours, the crystalized product began to &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; more and left my hair dull.  </li>
            <li> kind of hard to describe, but between being mixed with the other products and being dried, it dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it when my hair was both long and short.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it&#x27;s no small task styling it, let alone finding the right</li>
            <li> You do need to deep condition because it tends to dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> I can wear it clumped or play with it a little to get a soft curly look.  </li>
            <li> I have crazy hair...type 2A/B on top and type 3B underneath, very porous, color treated, down to the middle of my back and so thick it feels like I have a fur animal living atop my head during the summer.</li>
            <li> the only down fall is that it sometimes leaves white particles like if you were using gel.</li>
            <li> I recommend using this only on the roots and down the hair a few inches as it really helped the curls stay close to my head without them weighing down by the end of the day, but a softer curling cream for the rest to help keep movement and shine.</li>
            <li> I let it air dry</li>
            <li> It dries a bit crispy, but I scrunch the crispiness out once my hair is mostly dry  and am good-to-go.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair.</li>
            <li> After three times of using it the ends of my hair seemed dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I air dry my hair when using this.</li>
            <li> The only drawback for my very thick curly hair is that you have to use a lot of product and it is kind of expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have average thickness loose spiral curls with a big tendency to frizz and knot.</li>
            <li> Went back to using my previous products.</li>
            <li> You have nothing to loose but FRIZZ!</li>
            <li> The way I use it is after conditioning my hair in the shower, I dry my hair VERY minimally, then apply the Curl Keeper to saturate my curls.</li>
            <li> Then, the trick is to put your hair in place how you&#x27;d like it to dry, then DO NOT TOUCH IT until it is dry!!!</li>
            <li> My regimen is in the shower I brush though my hair with a wide tooth brush and comb when I have conditioner in it.  </li>
            <li> Put I on your hair wet and just watch the curls clump.</li>
            <li> It has no real hold to it, but that&#x27;s not its function</li>
            <li> was missing because it was shipped with the cap very, very loose and a lot spilled out and soiled the entire box and other product i ordered.  </li>
            <li> I swear it cuts down the dry time</li>
            <li> Once you figure out how to use this for your type of curls (always soaking wet hair!), it is a Godsend.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is curly and changing due to age or hormones, try this product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a little, alot, before product, after product, really wet, all the ways I can think of.</li>
            <li> A young girl in my church has very tight thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I like this product but the only negative thing is that you have to wait until hair dries out</li>
            <li> It is the one product that has never let me down.  </li>
            <li> It has zero hold, so I mix it LIBERALLY (impossible to use too much, but you can use too little) with Biosilk Rock Hard Gelee and AG Cosmetics Re:Coil Curl Activator, separate my sopping wet hair into 4 sections then completely saturate it with this concoction.</li>
            <li> so when applying it you lose half the product.</li>
            <li> One of the few curl products I&#x27;ve found which don&#x27;t weigh down my 3A</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years.  </li>
            <li> a few curls sometimes hair.</li>
            <li> Curl keeper has been one of the few products that works for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick somewhat tight currly hair and this product does not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely cottony soft, and very difficult to hold in place.  </li>
            <li> I will never be without Curl Keeper -- a total game changer for curlies!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a small miracle for me.  </li>
            <li> I use a small about of the solution, and it controls my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping that it would work for me, but it is not:(</li>
            <li> Seriously, I don&#x27;t know why I hadn&#x27;t tried it sooner.</li>
            <li> I have been using CK for at least 7 years now, and I don&#x27;t think I will ever find something that works as well as this stuff!</li>
            <li> And you still need to apply gel/mouse, so it just seemed like an unnecessary step.</li>
            <li> Seriously, give this a try!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, I can&#x27;t describe the smell, but after a little bit, as the hair dries, you can&#x27;t smell it</li>
            <li> tube watch some videos on what I was doing wrong</li>
            <li> It is TOO EXPENSIVE to throw away.</li>
            <li> I lost a couple of ounces; too bad since it&#x27;s really expensive and every penny counts.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does an amazing job on my curls I love it so much. Definitely gonna be my new product of choice.  It leaves hair feeling light and natural. I can get 3 day hair out of this. Going to buy this for my mom. (:</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great for thick curly hair that tends to get frizzy. It gives my hair control and beautiful soft curls</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that makes my hair look normal. My hair is no longer frizzy and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfumy smell</li>
            <li> I love curl keeper because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel too sticky, and there is no product build up.  It washes out like water.  The only drawback for my very thick curly hair is that you have to use a lot of product and it is kind of expensive.  Because my hair is so thick I don&#x27;t have good results of misting it with water the next day.  I always seem to have to totally wet it again and add more product.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the amazing reviews...so not worth the $. I wont be purchasing again. It didn&#x27;t make a difference at all, it was very watery so when applying it you lose half the product. And you still need to apply gel/mouse, so it just seemed like an unnecessary step.</li>
            <li> great for kinky or curly hair, no frizz</li>
            <li> I have very coarse curly hair; this product works great.  You do need to deep condition because it tends to dry out my hair.  One of the best products I have ever used on my hair type.</li>
            <li> I have been using CK for at least 7 years now, and I don&#x27;t think I will ever find something that works as well as this stuff! Trust me, I have tried a ton of curly hair products, and they don&#x27;t compete (for my hair type). If the main thing that you struggle with is frizz control, curl keeper will most likely work wonders for you. I&#x27;d suggest going to the curly hair solutions website and reading about how the product works and watching some of the styling videos to get an idea of how much product to use. You can use quite a bit of the product and it never seems to be too much. I use about 4 half dollar sized blobs on soaking wet hair, and top with a small amount of moptop light hold gel for some extra hold. Then, the trick is to put your hair in place how you&#x27;d like it to dry, then DO NOT TOUCH IT until it is dry!!! It will most likely look pretty gross/stringy/frizzy while it&#x27;s drying, but trust me, don&#x27;t touch it! Once it&#x27;s dry and crunchy feeling, you should flip your hair over, &amp;#34;scrunch out the crunch&amp;#34; with your hands or a microfiber towel, flip your hair back up, and magically you will have soft, shiny, frizz free curls. I have no idea how it works, but all I know is that I hope they never stop making this stuff. It&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle for us curly girls!</li>
            <li> Once you figure out how to use this for your type of curls (always soaking wet hair!), it is a Godsend.  If it hasn&#x27;t worked for you, you just haven&#x27;t figured it out yet.  Keep trying - you will love it once you do!  I am down to using only Curl Keeper for perfect, frizz-free curls - not bad for a girl who used to use at least 3-4 products on any given day.  Bonus - 2nd and 3rd day curls are still great with just a little water and/or leave-in spritz.</li>
            <li> Products is very light weight, water based product.  It gives great hold and beautiful shine, and my 3C curls look moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> Great for my natural curls. Light, not sticky, not crunchy, keeps my hair soft and frizz free. Recommend for anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> It works great for my hair but I ordered for my daughters hair and it didn&#x27;t work on her curls.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with my curly (3b), frizzy hair for years, but this product has made a huge difference.  I&#x27;ve used it when my hair was both long and short.  I put a good quantity on towel dried hair, flip my head over and scrunch, finger curl or shape according to the style I&#x27;m wearing, and dry with a diffuser.  It&#x27;s important to not mess with the curls until they&#x27;re dry, or you&#x27;ll still end up with frizz.  When it&#x27;s dry (or almost dry), I scrunch a small amount of John Masters Shine On through the sections of hair most likely to frizz, and it stays perfectly all day.  I don&#x27;t use sulphate shampoos and often just condition after a rinse (Curly Girls book method) and my hair is the healthiest it&#x27;s ever been, despite being home colored.  I&#x27;m using Aubrey Rosa Mosqueta condtioner right now and am liking it.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for keeping curly hair from frizzing in humid weather, but you do have to use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> one of the best product for curly hair! helps with frizz and it reactivates with water. It leaves my hair soft and with perfect ringlets.</li>
            <li> For 30 something years I have been battling my hair.  This product immediately cut the friz.  I can wear it clumped or play with it a little to get a soft curly look.  I swear it cuts down the dry time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on leave-in first, then this.  That&#x27;s it!  That&#x27;s all I need to survive the Florida heat and humidity.  My hair is 3a (with spots of 2b along the nape), hates protein, moisture deprived, coarse, and dense.</li>
            <li> If your hair is curly and changing due to age or hormones, try this product.  It  works to help support curls and adds softness and shine too!</li>
            <li> Yes!! My curls love it!!</li>
            <li> This hair serum changed my life. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up I had cotton candy hair, because I was the only curly head in my family and no one could help me with it. Through online research and a curly hair forum I learned how to manage my curls, and one of the products I discovered was this hair serum. It smooths my curls so they clump together, instead of breaking apart and having a huge fluff on my head. The one and only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t have hold, so using a gel with it is necessary. I have tried using just gel, different gels, different serums, and the only thing I consistently need is this hair serum. People stop me all the time to comment on my hair and ask me what I use (no joke). I use this after I put in a leave-in conditioner (if I bother with this step), and before I add my hair gel. I apply it to wet hair that I let air dry (or if I do use a diffuser I only dry most of the way). Amazing product!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing curly hair product out there. I just wish I would&#x27;ve found it before I tried so many others.</li>
            <li> The search is over!!! After many years, products, and a whole lotta $$, this is the product for me!  this is a light silky product that controls frizz, and makes my locks silky and bouncy. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product, quick shipping, great seller!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The product helps with my curly hair frizz. I have no frizz. It&#x27;s awesome! I&#x27;ve tried several products that promise to help with frizz but no luck. This is the only product that does what it says.</li>
            <li> After years of trying different products--and different combinations of products--to defrizz and smooth my curls, I have settled on Curly Hair Solutions Curl Keeper as my one and only after-shampoo-and-conditioner product.  My curls are smooth and soft, not at all crunchy. It washes out easily without leaving any buildup. It holds up well for a second-day refresh of just a bit of water, too.</li>
            <li> I have been using Curl Keeper for about 5 years on my natural curly hair &amp; there is no product like it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have been using it for a few years.  It is the best product I have found to tame my curly hair.  I love the smell and get compliments on how good my hair smells all the time.  Works perfectly if you follow the instructions.  My regimen is in the shower I brush though my hair with a wide tooth brush and comb when I have conditioner in it.  Rinse with my head flipped over (brushing through and rinsing with the head flipped over for me keeps my hair from going flat on top later).  I then apply a leave in conditioner and comb through it to get it spread out.  Just out of the shower I squeeze excess water out of my hair and with my head flipped over I take a quarter to 50 cent piece size amount of curly keeper in my hand smooth over hair then scrunch it up.  I flip my head back up and do the same to be sure to get the top of my head.  I do not use a towel or anything on my hair just have one across my back to catch drips.  I let it air dry and after it is dry I scrunch it once more and it stays great all day.  I do not get great second day hair with this like it claims but that is ok with me.  I have fine medium curly hair.  A young girl in my church has very tight thick curly hair and I have just introduced this to her.  It also worked great on her.  Her mom is now buying some.</li>
            <li> I have been very dedicated to Aveda products for the last 18 years. I recently noticed my spirals were gone and my hair styled in frizzy manner. I went on you tube watch some videos on what I was doing wrong and I came across this product. I is curl magic in a bottle. Put I on your hair wet and just watch the curls clump. My hair hasn&#x27;t been so curly in at year. Love it. Customer For life.</li>
            <li> I had been using a combination of two products for over 15 years to fight the frizz of my curly hair and define my curls.....UNTIL I used this product.  It fights the frizz, defines the curls and is very light weight.</li>
            <li> I love how my hair looks. The first day I did my hair I looked like I had a wig on. I got sooo many compliments on my hair! I just cringe when I think about the price tag but sometimes, the price is worth it!</li>
            <li> This product works so well on my 3B curls.  It doesn&#x27;t build up, but can be reactivated with a spritz of water, so I often get second and even third-day hair.  It dries a bit crispy, but I scrunch the crispiness out once my hair is mostly dry  and am good-to-go.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of taming fuzzy curls without too much heavy, sticky, or crunchy.  (Though there is a teeny bit of all that.)</li>
            <li> After 45 years, I finally found something for my frizzy/wavy/a few curls sometimes hair. Seriously, give this a try!</li>
            <li> I love Curl Keeper.  It is the one product that has never let me down.  It is great for forming curls and keeping them all day.  You can also re-wet your hair with just water to have beautiful second day curls as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my very curly hair! I&#x27;ve lived in the dry desert of Palm Springs and now live in the humid conditions of Houston, Texas and Curl Keeper has always been the best.  I find that if I use quite a bit (it&#x27;s very light weight), comb it evenly through my hair and then not touch it until it&#x27;s dry, my curls hold a nice spiral. I can spritz it with water the next day to reactivate and restyle.</li>
            <li> I would order it again love it!</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair. Have been using it for many years. Great for curly hair.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Best hair product for any curly hair type. Must have.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Make sure your hair is soaked with the product.  It does work.&lt;br /&gt;Love my curls now!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Curl Keeper for years, and it literally changed my life.  I mix it into a cocktail with my strong-hold gel.  You cannot believe the compliments I get on my hair.  It&#x27;s shiny, perfectly coiled, and in control!  I will never be without Curl Keeper -- a total game changer for curlies!  (For reference: my hair is 3a, medium curl.  It&#x27;s extremely cottony soft, and very difficult to hold in place.  Medium thickness.)</li>
            <li> I like this product but the only negative thing is that you have to wait until hair dries out and then you can comb your hair and style as you like it.</li>
            <li> For frizzy hair, this is a life-saver. I got a sample from Birchbox then ordered this huge bottle. It&#x27;s water-based, so it washes out clean every day and is gentle enough to use daily. I haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well as this does!</li>
            <li> After three times of using it the ends of my hair seemed dry and unmanageable. Went back to using my previous products.</li>
            <li> I tried so many things for my curly hair, and this was perfect. makes my curls tamable. the only down fall is that it sometimes leaves white particles like if you were using gel.</li>
            <li> I love this curling solution ... Discovered it when a friend got a sample in her Birchbox... And the price was right!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like crack in a bottle! my curls love this stuff and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I use this product EVERY DAY on my naturally curly hair.  Normally, I shop at naturallycurly.com for all my products.  This time I decided to try one of Amazon&#x27;s stores/sellers.  The package arrived super quick - AND - they threw in a really nice canvas tote bag and a free product (some nail strengthener).  It was an excellent experience and will certainly use this seller again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crispy when it dries and I like my curls softer.  I just have to play with it a little more which I hoped to avoid.  Also, when the product arrived it was leaking.  I lost a couple of ounces; too bad since it&#x27;s really expensive and every penny counts.  The packers had taped the products top from opening but didn&#x27;t tighten the entire lid.  It leaked from the bottom of the lid.  3 stars because of the crunchies and leaking.</li>
            <li> This product was introduced to me by a salon that specializes in curly hair. Curl keeper has been one of the few products that works for my curly hair. This product will fight frizz like no other. Best used with root clips and a blow dryer. I want to add the this product also helps hold hot tool effects very well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great for keeping curly hair  from REALLY frizzing. Does not leave hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in one of my Birchbox about a year ago and loved it.  Got a regular size from Birchbox but when that ran out checked out Amazon for better price and larger size.  This hair product is awesome.  I live in moist Portland OR and frizzy hair is an on going battle.  This not only holds the curl but helps keep down the fine friz.</li>
            <li> This is my #1 hair care product. I have average thickness loose spiral curls with a big tendency to frizz and knot. I&#x27;ve been sulfate-free, silicone-free, paraben-free for three years now and my hair is much healthier but still very thirsty. This cuts the frizz down to almost nothing, keeps my curls soft, and helps somewhat with curl definition, although a gel or another product with some hold is really necessary for good curl definition that doesn&#x27;t fall limp within a few hours. One great thing about this product is that it is impossible to use too much. You could pour the entire bottle on your head and your hair wouldn&#x27;t end up crunchy, greasy, or with white residue. The only drawback is the price.</li>
            <li> I have crazy hair...type 2A/B on top and type 3B underneath, very porous, color treated, down to the middle of my back and so thick it feels like I have a fur animal living atop my head during the summer. Needless to say, it&#x27;s no small task styling it, let alone finding the right products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I MUST use a &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34; of three different products to achieve any sense of looking normal when my mop is styled, and CHS Curl Keeper is an absolutely essential ingredient in my arsenal. It has zero hold, so I mix it LIBERALLY (impossible to use too much, but you can use too little) with Biosilk Rock Hard Gelee and AG Cosmetics Re:Coil Curl Activator, separate my sopping wet hair into 4 sections then completely saturate it with this concoction. I squeeze/scrunch out the excess with my hands SIX times (don&#x27;t ask why, but 6 times seems to be the perfect amount), throw a microfiber towel (NEVER use a regular towel; it roughs up the hair cuticle causing dreaded frizz) over my shoulders and flip my head up. I use a professional grade hair dryer with a diffuser and get it 99% dry, scrunch in some hairspray and - voila - perfectly defined curls and NO FRIZZ. I&#x27;ve tried alternatives to Curl Keeper with limited success, but keep going back to it since I know it will never let me - or my hair - down. It may sound like a major production and an excess of product, but I refuse to be one of those curlies who succumbs to the challenges of the ringlets and keep it up in a hair tie, so an extra 15 minutes 2-3 times a week is a tiny time investment to me. As much as I love Curl Keeper, it would be great if it were priced lower or if there was another similar product with a more economical price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the smell...kind of hard to describe, but between being mixed with the other products and being dried, it dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - I lived in VERY humid Florida most of my life, then moved out the the EXTREMELY arid Western US a year ago and Curl Keeper works like magic in both places, so no matter where in the world you are, it&#x27;s going to be a product you can depend on.n both places, so no matter where in the world you are, it&#x27;s going to be a product you can depend on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love curl keeper!! I&#x27;ve tried every curly hair product out there and still ended up frizzy. Since I started using curl keeper not only are my curls beautiful, defined and frizz free, but it&#x27;s so light weight there is no product build up no matter how much you use. Plus it reactivates with water so I can wake up day 2 and wet my hands, run over my hair and my curls look great. I will never use another product again!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Curl Keeper for years.  Great product, and this price was lower than I can get it anywhere!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for many years a product that tames my frizz with out weighing down my curls.  This is the perfect product for me!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my curly frizzy hair I love my curls now</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever tried to keep frizz at bay and curls in good shape. It has no real hold to it, but that&#x27;s not its function either so all&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s very watery, non sticky and applies like a dream. Yet the best part is that it leaves hair shining like nothing else! Just make sure to be very generous; don&#x27;t skimp or your curls will be sorry. Bye bye frizzies!</li>
            <li> Love this product it is the only thing that works on my naturally curly hair, it is very expensive but worth it for me. However, i just received my shipment and about a cup of it was missing because it was shipped with the cap very, very loose and a lot spilled out and soiled the entire box and other product i ordered.  Not at all happy about the shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying curly hair gel and I still keep coming back to this one - lightweight and always works great on my 3b curls without weighing them down.</li>
            <li> It works really well...no denying that.  BUT....oh my gosh does it flake!  Pretty springy curls without frizz, but every time I touched my hair, there was product dust everywhere.  After a few hours, the crystalized product began to &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; more and left my hair dull.  I recommend using this only on the roots and down the hair a few inches as it really helped the curls stay close to my head without them weighing down by the end of the day, but a softer curling cream for the rest to help keep movement and shine.</li>
            <li> I will keep on buying this product...it contains my frizz.</li>
            <li> Great Product really keeps the frizz down</li>
            <li> A must have for curly, wavy hair. Must be used correctly, watch use on you tube. I air dry my hair when using this. Adds a lot of time to drying, but that&#x27;s ok. The next day I just moisten my hands and scrunch..done.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!!  I had wanted to get this product for years and finally did.  I have naturally curly hair that tends to be frizzy.  This has totally tamed my locks!  I have had 4 good hair days in a row.  That&#x27;s a small miracle for me.  I normally hate my curly hair and defiantly never have more than one good curly hair day in a row.  This product has changed all that.  My husband, employees, and children have all made positive comments about my hair.  I am super happy with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now, and I love it!  I have recommended it to a handful of people as well and they are enjoying soft manageable curls.  The product also works well on dry hair to control fly aways and more humid days.  I had been purchasing Curl Keeper from the seller&#x27;s website; however, shipping wasn&#x27;t always too friendly.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best curly hair product I have tried.  Glad I found it cheaper on Amazon. I have thick somewhat tight currly hair and this product does not weigh my hair down.  I love how it &amp;#34;reactivates&amp;#34;  with water, so If I decide not to wash my hair that morning,  the &amp;#34;reactivation&amp;#34; of the product saves alot of time in the morning!!</li>
            <li> I tried Curl Keeper after reading several good reviews and watched a video on youtube by Veronica Meza on how to apply it.  She uses two different products (Curl Keeper and another product by Ouidad) and gives a great tutorial on how to properly apply the product for good results.  I tried both products, they are very similar but I prefer the Curl Keeper.  I also used the pineapple method to sleep at night with the satin sleep cap and it worked wonders for 2nd day hair as I&#x27;ve never been able to sleep on my curly hair and wear it again without washing it the next day, until now. :)  If you want healthy, great looking curls watch Veronica&#x27;s video tutorials and use Curl Keeper.  Good luck!!</li>
            <li> This has been my go to product now for years. It feels like I have tried every curly haired product out there and this is the one I use to the very last drop and repurchase in the largest available size. My hair is very frizzy and this keeps things from getting out of control. I do sometimes layer this product with something else depending on how I am styling my hair. The one thing I would recommend is that if you find it is not working, try using more product. When I initially started using this I was not using enough and it didn&#x27;t do much for me. I found I had to add it in layers and use more than I would normally use for other products. I do not get build up from this product.</li>
            <li> I have 3b/3c thin,fine hair. I tried Curl Keeper a couple of years ago. Didn&#x27;t remember why I did not continue to purchase it. Well now I remember, It does nothing for me but make my hair frizzy, with a grayish ashy tone. I have tried a little, alot, before product, after product, really wet, all the ways I can think of. Still frizz and ashy.&lt;br /&gt;I will put this product away til fall/winter. It is TOO EXPENSIVE to throw away. I was really hoping that it would work for me, but it is not:(</li>
            <li> Love the product. Retailer great.</li>
            <li> have been using this product for 7 years and no other product has proven to define, maintain and enhance my curls the way curl keeper does!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product, and uses it almost daily on her frizzy curly hair.  It tames the frizz and brings out the true beauty of curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great hold for my curls</li>
            <li> Best gel out there for curly hair!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for curls. Brings them back to life.</li>
            <li> Everything I never knew I needed. Buy the big bottle for the best value.</li>
            <li> absolutely best product on the market for curly hair</li>
            <li> Ok, so it gives a nice curl,  but it leaves it super hard and crunchy,  I wanted those nice soft curls, I would not buy it again</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. The way I use it is after conditioning my hair in the shower, I dry my hair VERY minimally, then apply the Curl Keeper to saturate my curls. I let my hair air dry, then shake, scrunch, and fluff my curls out until they are the volume I am happy with. The Curl Keeper keeps my hair from frizzing up, and can be reactivated the next day with just water and more scrunching.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that after a few weeks of using, I was having to wash my hair more frequently to achieve the curl definition I wanted. Of course my hair looks perfect after my hair stylist uses the Curl Keeper on my hair after a trim.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I bought the 33oz bottle because I go through a lot of product for one application.</li>
            <li> Works great on long curly hair but it has dried my hair out a bit.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to figure the correct amount to use but it&#x27;s really great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried many name brands from the beauty salon and none have worked as well as this one. I also found a stylist that has curly hair herself and her hair is gorgeous and she has shown me how to apply and keep my hair from frizzing and this one works! I have hair that is to the middle of my back and curly and I am gray on the sides and some through it. The grays really frizz but with this product, they are controlled. I highly recommend this product. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, I can&#x27;t describe the smell, but after a little bit, as the hair dries, you can&#x27;t smell it and so it doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.</li>
            <li> They should call this product frizz begone!! Absolutely fell in love with this product. It gave me the curls I only dreamed of. Seriously, I don&#x27;t know why I hadn&#x27;t tried it sooner. It gives me control of my curls, tames my mane, DEFINES my 3a/3b curly hair, and FRIZZ BEGONE!!! Light weight, you can&#x27;t use too much cuz you can scrunch your hair and BOOM soft, defined, beautiful curls! I absolutely recommend you try this product. You have nothing to loose but FRIZZ! Blessed day yall!</li>
            <li> My curly hair will go fuzzy if when I let it air dry, which is fine if I liked 80&#x27;s hair.  I tried Curly Hair Solutions Curl Keeper last summer and it does a great job in keeping the fuzz down.  I use a small about of the solution, and it controls my shoulder length hair.  I bought the bigger bottle so I can refill my travel size and the 8 oz bottle I have on my vanity.  Works for curly or semi-straight.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;It Arrived on time and it works amazingly, I love it , I would order again from this seller</li>
            <li> One of the few curl products I&#x27;ve found which don&#x27;t weigh down my 3A curls-- but actually let them do their naturally curly thing.  Will definitely be buying more of this.</li>
