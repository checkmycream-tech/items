            <li>/&gt;The best way to describe its effect is that after using this product, my hair looks like it looks in the evening after a morning shampoo.</li>
            <li>I try to wash my hair every 2-3 days, so this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>and they both work wonderfully to take away</li>

            <li>The scent is a bit strong but pleasant and lasts well over the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for those with light hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very easy product to apply.</li>
            <li>Came out very easily and never had it happen again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong AND persistent - you have been warned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong AND persistent - you have been warned.</li>
            <li>but it came early so the shipping is definitely great!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing product.</li>
            <li>Not the &#x27;Magic&#x27; shower replacement I was kind of hoping for,</li>
            <li>and this works the best by far.  </li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for a night out if you want to make your hair smell fresh and add some volume.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Wow, is this stuff incredible!</li>

            <li>I have very fine oily hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>You have to shake it good or it will be clumpy, but it leaves my hair with a fresh scent, movement and body!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super cheap, works amazingly well and smells great.</li>
            <li>I thought this will work perfectly but not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>Ok so far of all the products I have tried I do like this best.  </li>
            <li>Smells exactly like HE Color me Happy shampoo.</li>
            <li>Smells like bright, sweet citrus.</li>
            <li>Smells like bright, sweet citrus.</li>
            <li>I have very fine blonde hair and this product is perfect..</li>
            <li>A huge life saver for a girl that spends many days in the gym and can&#x27;t wash my hair after each workout!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always going to have dry shampoo in my life from now on, and I&#x27;ve heard this is the best brand from a couple of popular YouTube beauty gurus.</li>
            <li>Handy for fine hair that needs washing every day.</li>
            <li>so the dryness is huge!</li>
            <li>Though make sure to hold your breath after spraying as it can be a bit asphyxiating for a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>Then after some more time passes I rub it into my scalp with my fingers again.</li>
            <li>Better than some of the store brands.  </li>
            <li>It gives my hair a refreshing look and scent.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t work and even made my hair look and feel more greasy.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>People seem to love it.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to use this product two days in a row.  </li>
            <li>give your hair a rest :]  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to avoid washing my hair for a couple more days and keep it healthy from this product.</li>
            <li>I like to use it before I work out to maintain my hairstyle and in my roots after a blowout (especially if it&#x27;s hot)</li>
            <li>Yea I enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>like i hoped it would :)</li>
            <li>okay*</li>
            <li>so make sure you work it into the scalp and brush it through your  hair</li>
            <li>The product works okay, but could definitely be better.</li>
            <li>Make sure you comb through</li>
            <li>You want to spray your hair in sections and rub out any whiteness, but then just toss your hair and love yourself.</li>
            <li>I thought I would like this more....</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>The good news is that my hair smelled quite fresh and my hair almost regained the fullness that it has when it&#x27;s just shampooed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked for a product for years that gives my hair more volume and this defiantly helps.</li>
            <li>Also, the Batiste does a better job of making my hair feel cleaner...</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful because I had heard so many great things</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s better suited for those with lighter hair colors.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it so I tried and love it too.</li>
            <li>It may be deemed &#x27;safe&#x27;, but it&#x27;s not something that I want to put on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I used this on a day off work when I wouldn&#x27;t see many people.</li>
            <li>Psssst was so much better.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Baby powder does better then</li>
            <li>I prefer their brunette version better.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>(you can always add more</li>
            <li>Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i like this scent more because it&#x27;s not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>I know they tell you how many Fl Oz are in it</li>
            <li>It works great, but is very smelly.</li>
            <li>I can still feel the &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; feeling more than halfway through my day.</li>
            <li>batiste is the best- you just need to use a hair dryer to blow out the white powder.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, this is my second time buying it.</li>
            <li>Like it a lot. :)</li>
            <li>My hair already feels more</li>
            <li>Has a bit of a learning curve to use, but I love the smell</li>
            <li>Pretty nice results from this product!</li>
            <li>Even better than the pricier counterparts.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and it really works.  </li>
            <li>It would probably work better for people with lighter, thinner hair than mine.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have been having issues with hair fall because I wash it every day, not any more</li>
            <li>This one has more aerosol than the others and helps spread it throughout my roots.</li>
            <li>removing bedtime cowlicks.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is OK, wish I had chosen apple or something though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for about a month now and am so glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t lingering, but I like the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent one the most.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make my hair feel better, and</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love the tropical scent...</li>
            <li>though I would try one more time to find an alternative.</li>
            <li>I am glad I</li>
            <li>I was able to do my hair 3 days in a row!!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to use a lot more of the Batiste.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s OK for emergency use, say, for keeping in the car; but you never know whom else you will offend with the smell.</li>
            <li>So maybe the formula is not fantastically healthy, it&#x27;s just the rest of us go symptom-free?&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love them all.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to rub the product in well.</li>
            <li>I apply this to the top of my hair and the hairline, let it sit a minute, rub it in, and then brush it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better for my hair to be able to go a day or two before washing it again....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I can do that now.</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>I like Psssst better.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Perfect for later day plans just spray and go!</li>
            <li>Wish it was available here in the states!</li>
            <li>Makes hair thicker and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Batiste products.</li>
            <li>This was okay.</li>
            <li>Lovely &amp; refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbal</li>
            <li>it works and smells better than others i&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Nice product, it helps to keep your hair oil free for the day, in case you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair</li>
            <li>I have tried Dove, Tressemme(?), &amp;#34;Pfft&amp;#34;, and many others.</li>
            <li>cant you tell :)</li>
            <li>Mi tried this stuff on a whim when I was on vacation, and I was able to go THREE DAYS without washing my hair....</li>
            <li>and I was not incredibly disgusting at the end of those three days.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair sticky on top of being oily.</li>
            <li>It also smells clean and fresh, a welcome change.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair look clean and fresh; does a GREAT job soaking up oil.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the original, even though it still works amazing.</li>
            <li>Has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>It hides itself well in even dark hair, smells good and clean and reduces grease perfectly.</li>

            <li>Fair job of absorbing oil.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li>BEST DRY SHAMPOO EVER!!</li>
            <li>In buying this one before I had bought several bottles, this time for a friend to buy, very good smell taste, easy to carry.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely one of my most favorite products in my beauty arsenal!</li>
            <li>I tried the original formula/scent, &amp; I think it smells lovely.</li>
            <li>The reviews of others are indeed true!</li>
            <li>Keep trying other products, but Batiste is the best.</li>
            <li>I love the original scent.  </li>
            <li>Tried other brands, this is the best.</li>
            <li>I used this to clean some doll faces safely.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo leaves my hair feeling lightweight, lasts all day, smells great, and is inexpensive - perfect for 3rd day hair.</li>
            <li>~6 inches away--doing this, the residue easily comes out by just rubbing my hair with my fingers.</li>
            <li>It is easy to be applied and makes your hair nicer during the day.</li>
            <li>This one is easily the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My oily hair gets greasy easily.</li>
            <li>Hair becomes silky and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>Hair becomes silky and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong, just right!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they make it so strong.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell to it on your hair and does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>I must say, I enjoy the texture of my hair after 3 days of not washing versus freshly clean!</li>
            <li>I have used some of the more popular brands of dry shampoo and this one has been the best so far.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not bad or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used - gives hair lots of volume and feels very fresh and clean</li>
            <li>The TresSemme dry shampoo leaves a super powdery but the Batiste is the best!</li>
            <li>Excellent product to keep from washing hair daily and priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li>It was the very first dry shampoo that I ever tried and it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>It does dry up the oil &amp; give your hair volume which is especially great if you have very fine straight hair like myself, but it leaves a ashy residue.</li>
            <li>; It&#x27;s always worked into my hair just fine.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this product would make my hair look fine and not oily.</li>
            <li>My hair looks fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It worked fine.  </li>
            <li>I have oily fine</li>
            <li>Works fine with my short-ish medium weight</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, hair</li>
            <li>nothing else will give my fine hair volume without making it look greasy.  </li>
            <li>most important, one that is affordable.ance is that of sweet roses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for the price</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing, but it&#x27;s got the most cloyingly sweet smell and if you use as much as I do</li>
            <li>I have finely textured light blond hair, and this doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or film.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product for touching up hair quickly by adding volume and eliminating some grease.</li>
            <li>It is half the price of most and works just as good, or better than most.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best dry shampoo on the market, and I have tried many many brands.</li>
            <li>however, if you have a little gray in your hair, this would be the perfect shade.  </li>
            <li>Great product but not that good when you have dark hair, put it on my roots and was like spraying baby powder on it!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t deposit a huge amount of powder but still seems to do the job</li>
            <li>so I would recommend it for people with light colored hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>but once you rub it in with your hands it goes away and leaves your hair with great texture and volume without any 3rd day without a shower grease!</li>
            <li>Just spray lightly at scalp and work through the hair and brush.  </li>
            <li>It is a great price and a big bottle.</li>
            <li>It also is unscented which is a big win for me.</li>
            <li>I section off the crown of my head and lightly spray at the roots.</li>
            <li>The primary ingredient (as listed on the can) is butane.  </li>
            <li>I have light brown hair and the powder</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that is not offensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just about fragrance free, and it leaves no residue on my hair.</li>
            <li>This also comes in a tropical scent which is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product , especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I kept seeing people talk about how great it was and for some reason, I&#x27;d always end up getting a different brand at the store-</li>
            <li>Not a disappointment but could be better.</li>
            <li>It is also a great texturizer that provides extra hold for up dos.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t produce the same results that I experienced with the Blow Pro product.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky smooth with no oil at all.</li>
            <li>I really only use it at the crown at the roots and it works great.</li>
            <li>This product is far superior</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re willing to drop $25 on dry shampoo, then this is the best stuff you can buy.</li>
            <li>Now if only I could find one with free shipping - or better yet, find it in the store!!  </li>
            <li>it brushes out fairly easily, but based on all the positive reviews I was hoping that this brand would be better in that way.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good but did very little good for my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and light after I use it, which allows me to use it for 2 days in a row if needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The smell is fine, just a fresh scent, nothing strong or overly fragrant.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and smells so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo ever, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Good aerosol power, easy to work through hair, adds volume and texture on that second day after washing.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute BEST dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Was not disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh!</li>
            <li>Really useful for me!</li>
            <li>Totally refreshes my hair and smells nice too!</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like most Garnier Fructis products; like tropical fruits &amp; citrus.</li>
            <li>The first ingredient is butane, though, so you need to be ok with that.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend thought my hair was freshly washed that morning!</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best dry shampoo on the market without a doubt!</li>
            <li>Also, the Original Clean doesn&#x27;t leave a distinctive smell or anything.</li>
            <li>I spray it in all the roots and all over the top of my head lightly, then go about my business getting ready.</li>
            <li>Gives me a clean hair look in a jiffy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;fresh washed&amp;#34; hair on day 3 using this product, but it still looks and feels clean.</li>
            <li>Hair looks clean, not oily.  </li>
            <li>great dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is great.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair look fresh and lessens how often I actually need to wash my hair which is great because it has allowed my hair to grow longer and look healthier.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look and feel clean in minutes.  </li>
            <li>There is no residue, it smells clean, and my hair looks and feels clean.</li>
            <li>It provides volume and clean hair on those between shampoo days.</li>
            <li>If your head is great and your ends are dry</li>
            <li>This product gives me clean, volumized hair</li>
            <li>Great dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>you scalp clean.</li>
            <li>Happy dry shampoo:</li>
            <li>I use baking soda as well to clean my hair.</li>
            <li>A clean smell and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work to make hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong for my preference, but the product works well and keeps my hair feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>It also has a fairly pleasant smell of all the different kinds we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My second day hair looks better than my freshly washed hair!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I tried this Batiste Dry shampoo!  </li>
            <li>This is great dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love love love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>but it massages right in!</li>
            <li>smell is light and has the smell of soap--very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell and made my hair soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Love love love this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>My hair looks pretty clean!</li>
            <li>Bright white.</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair bright red</li>
            <li>I wish the can was larger for the price, but I got maybe 10 or so good uses out of it.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good buy</li>
            <li>If I accidentally spray too much, meh, that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I also love that I can&#x27;t really feel it in my hair after use.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair full of body and eliminates grease</li>
            <li>I wish the can was larger for the price, but I got maybe 10 or so good uses out of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a miracle worker and the next day your hair still looks good.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>love the way it smells and really works with my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried only two others before this one and they didn&#x27;t do as nearly a good job as this one does.</li>
            <li>It really gets the job done and I will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you spray it on at the roots and really brush it all out.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is that of sweet roses.</li>
            <li>The smell is a syrupy sweet mango/vanilla concoction.</li>
            <li>The smell is a syrupy sweet mango/vanilla concoction.</li>
            <li>I wanted a more lifting &amp;#34;va va voom&amp;#34; , but no matter how much I teased with this product, all I got was &amp;#34;va&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Overall product was good.</li>
            <li>The original has this supposed-to-be fresh and clean scent to it.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes my hair look less oily, but it doesn&#x27;t make it look as good as I thought it would since I had read so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>but I honestly don&#x27;t understand how it has such good reviews because Oscar blandi or drybar dry shampoos are much better</li>
            <li>I have never found a dry shampoo that does what this can do, it leaves my hair soft and full and smelling great!  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;d bought batiste and the clean and classic is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed to product, it is a pretty good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I have dark hair and when spraying it initially, I got a real good idea what I&#x27;d look like as a graying granny. :D</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best of the dry shampoos she has tried.  </li>
            <li>Of all the dry shampoos I have tried, this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot).</li>
            <li>This is by far the best dry shampoo I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>The best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used so far, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  </li>
            <li>Just restyle a little and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others and this is the only one that feels clean and refreshing and doesn&#x27;t leave buildup in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li>It also created a lot of volume which is amazing especially when you have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>Smell is a bit strong at first but quickly goes away.</li>
            <li>Other than that one thing it was great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly curly hair that I wash out and flat iron every.single.day.  </li>
            <li>and it smells fresh and clean</li>
            <li>looks fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t be washing it all the time if I hope to keep the color in because they fade super quick, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than most I&#x27;ve tried, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>then my hair gets super oily.</li>
            <li>Great product, you really have to rub it in to get rid of the white</li>
            <li>Shipped quick.</li>
            <li>I think the tresemm&amp;eacute; brand does a better job, without drying out scalp and it pretty much lasts all day!</li>
            <li>I seem to go through a can quite quickly.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t use it instead of showering if I had the time but woulds well as a quick fix if your in a rush.</li>
            <li>Smelled like mildly scented talcum powder on my head.  </li>
            <li>but my ends frizz and my roots get oily quickly</li>
            <li>super powers-</li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERY, Wonderful treatment and I like the dry shampoo so much thank you.</li>
            <li>But if you need a quick fix now and then, this is the stuff to use.</li>
            <li>Luckily, my wife is.  </li>
            <li>Your hair feels more refreshed and leaves the hair feeling VERY soft and smelling clean.</li>
            <li>First time trying dry shampoo and am very pleased!</li>
            <li>This is the first dry shampoo I have tried and it works great for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have brown hair and at first it does leave a light color</li>
            <li>It helps keep my hair looking great on the 2nd or 3rd day (don&#x27;t judge) after shampooing and gives my hair more volume and control.</li>
            <li>the silvery tint it gave to my hair was actually very pretty.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs the oil well as long as you dump a fair amount of the product into your hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair super dry which is good</li>
            <li>Just wish they sold it at more stores where I live.</li>
            <li>It has a nice slight scent and makes your hair good as new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and my hair styles very well after massaging it in and combing through.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t easily remove too much).</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;ve bought original</li>
            <li>First dry shampoo that I have tried (I&#x27;ve tried many different types) that smells good and works well!</li>
            <li>Simply the best dry shampoo I have found.</li>
            <li>After buying a different dry shampoo, found at walmart, we now understand why this is one of the best selling ones out there.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best dry shampoo product on the market.</li>
            <li>With that being said, it was less greasy and did feel &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; had more movement to it as well and smelled nice.</li>
            <li>The best way to use dry shampoo is to spray sections of hair from below, and let sit (don&#x27;t brush or touch) for ten minutes.</li>
            <li>My favorite dry shampoo :)</li>
            <li>My hair is blond, fine, and straight so this helps between shampoos.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of dry shampoo, it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t leave a gross residue on your hair.</li>
            <li>but I personally prefer Klorane dry shampoo (the best one I&#x27;ve ever used and well worth the price).</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s tried at least half a dozen different ones, and the Batiste smells the best and works the best, period.</li>
            <li>my little helper on my rush day, works great.</li>
            <li>Love the refreshing original scent and keeps my hair less greasy looking for hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, I just wish there were bigger</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist, I found a great shampoo to use and it usually works great, but when it doesn&#x27;t my greasy spot ruins my day.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just fresh smelling but not over powering.</li>
            <li>To date this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The spray goes on white (I didn&#x27;t try the tinted kind)</li>
            <li>This is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>My hair feels freshly washed immediately after use, and it has a delightfully fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Definitely handy for someone like myself who only washed their hair 1-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>It had a fresh look and a washed scent.  </li>
            <li>This stuff wins-</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s citrusy and fresh</li>
            <li>I recommended this to my best friend and she is addicted to it as well.</li>
            <li>A decent dry shampoo with a clean pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of grabbing all of the oil in my hair, doesn&#x27;t leave any weird residue, and smells nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it -</li>
            <li>Baby powder soaks up far more oil</li>
            <li>I spray it in my hair before I go to bed so that by morning the powder is all absorbed</li>
            <li>any oil is absorbed and leaves hair looking fresh.</li>
            <li>Not a problem if you&#x27;re a blond, and actually useful if, like me, you&#x27;re a highlighted blond, as it helps cover as my roots are growing out.</li>
            <li>As a brunette, I do have to brush or shake it out with my hands to diffuse the powdery residue it can leave if you spray it too closely, but afterwards the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>keeps it looking and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>But I still use it rarely when I need to hurry.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Truly looks like you have freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is not oily at all and looks fresh.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a kid because chemicals get absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>The scent of the dry shampoo is very light and pleasant as well which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li>The spray is very powerful and goes straight to your roots.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this dry shampoo has been a holy grail for my hair as it otherwise needs a full washing every day.</li>
            <li>She tells me that this is the best dry shampoo she&#x27;s ever used, by a long shot.  </li>
            <li>I like this product better than some of the other brands out there, and we&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li>Fine, but ran out pretty quickly - only got 2 weeks of use (at most) out of one bottle.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets oily at the roots pretty quickly in the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hunting for the perfect dry shampoo for a very long time now.</li>
            <li>If you have really dark hair you may have a harder time making it not look like you put powder in your hair but for medium to light hair, this is awesome.</li>
            <li>then right before I get dressed</li>
            <li>Right when you spray this stuff into your hair you can automatically feel the difference.</li>
            <li>to think, I don&#x27;t think &amp;#34;allergic&amp;#34; is the right word.</li>
            <li>But do not expect your hair to feel like it does right after washing it.</li>
            <li>Note that this bottle size is not the right size for carrying on to a plane.</li>
            <li>It works right away to get rid of the oily roots, and as the day goes on I find my hair gets nicer and nicer.</li>
            <li>I loved the light, not overwhelming lemon scent.</li>
            <li>By far the best dry shampoo I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li>However, this comes out more whitish so it may not be appropriate for dark hair.</li>
            <li>I replced the oily look with a slight overcast of powder that, I&#x27;m sure, was most noticeable to me.</li>
            <li>My favorite is Simply Smooth Xtend Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li>With all this in mind the price is great and compared to other dry shampoos Batiste was OK.</li>
            <li>works pretty well, but run out fast, would be nicer if it&#x27;s pretty cheap</li>
            <li>This is great for someone who wants to keep their hair looking fresh a few days longer between washes.</li>
            <li>This is the first type of dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s been working great so far.  </li>
            <li>She uses the original, my older daughter uses the brunette/dark brown variety.  </li>
            <li>I have used other dry shampoos, this one works the best for me, and doesnt leave my hair feeling chalking like others.</li>
            <li>Fantastic gift for a new mom care</li>
            <li>With this amazing dry spray I can go days without washing my hair.</li>
            <li>Plus don&#x27;t spray it wearing your good clothes, as a slight powdery residue will form.</li>
            <li>It is the most clean feeling dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Works great, no smell later on and easier to not have the white powder residue.</li>
            <li>Really works super</li>
            <li>I tried &#x27;Not Your Mothers&#x27; Clean Freak Refreshing Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>not only do you not have to wash your hair everyday, it gives you wonderful volume.  </li>
            <li>First dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever liked.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is not the best for individuals with dark hair.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo my wife has ever had, hands down.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo ever hands down.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best dry shampoo in the world.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best dry shampoo I have used, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t use it all the time or it will dry out your scalp too much, but my friend joked that she was never going to wash her hair again because she loved it so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried an easy half dozen, more</li>
            <li>I have super fine, super blonde hair that gets greasy if you look at it too long, and this stuff is like magic.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product since it is so popular - but it actually could not handle the oily-ness to my hair.  </li>
            <li>My bangs &amp; top of my head get oily so fast, and I love how I can just spray a little of this on</li>
            <li>Love how this product takes away the oil, but I have brown hair and this type leaves white in</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t need so much spray on the hair!  </li>
            <li>It is a pretty aggressive spray, and by that</li>
            <li>the spray will leave a dusting of white all over your bathroom, so beware of that.  :)</li>
            <li>I wish I would have found this one first.</li>
            <li>I have tried many and always come back to this.</li>
            <li>would definitely buy this product again :)</li>
            <li>This works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>but it looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>The first time that I used this product I had not washed my hair in two days and three nights.  </li>
            <li>My hair had been through 2 work-outs, 1 hot tubbing session (up in a pony tail) , and a day of gardening prep (think, potting soil and dirt).  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>love that batiste comes in various scents and even shades!</li>
            <li>I like how it smells at first.</li>
            <li>It does give my hair extra body and the smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I got this product yesterday and I&#x27;m using for the first time today.</li>
            <li>After a couple days of not washing my hair my roots get pretty oily, while the rest of my hair is is normal/dry.</li>
            <li>Probably would be better in a different scent.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it&#x27;s finally for sale in Walgreens</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty fine/</li>
            <li>I have gone 3 WHOLE NIGHTS without water washing my hair!</li>
            <li>I love this product and can&#x27;t image my daily routine without it!</li>
            <li>I think I will know better after several uses.</li>
            <li>Thanks Batiste!</li>
            <li>With this stuff, I can make it through a whole day and sometimes two!</li>
            <li>Great for late in the day when my hair starts getting grease just spray it in and helps.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite beauty product I have ever owned, and believe me, that is a BIG statement.</li>
            <li>I would have to say that after several uses of this item, it works better than PSSSTT did for me.  </li>
            <li>sure while you apply the product your parting your hair and only spraying the scalp!</li>
            <li>this version is much better, but i do wish that it sometimes didn&#x27;t spray as much white powder.</li>
            <li>It still doesn&#x27;t beat a hot shower though</li>
            <li>also there is so much product!</li>
            <li>Smells generic but refreshing nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells generic but refreshing nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does leave some white residue after using it but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Delivery was Fast and Furious!  </li>
            <li>I have to really brush it out!</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>When my roots are oily, i spray a little of this dry shampoo on and it looks perfectly matte!  </li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found, just a little pricy.</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I ever tried - i bought few more for future use.&lt;br /&gt;Why</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had more success with a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be getting this again, and have just as good results using plain corn starch the night before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it in the original, cherry, wild scents, as well as in the brown spray.</li>
            <li>Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing dry shampoo: Cleans very effectively without leaving any residue behind.</li>
            <li>Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing dry shampoo: Cleans very effectively without leaving any residue behind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a whole new era!!!  </li>
            <li>- great if you are a natural blonde or pretty much totally blonde.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t emphasize this enough, I have used it on clean hair just to boost the volume!</li>
            <li>Also, when you use it your hair actually feels clean!</li>
            <li>Actually leaves my hair looking like it is clean!</li>
            <li>Leaves a strong white residue in your hair at first.</li>
            <li>This product has majorly positively impacted my life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos and I have to say this is the best, by far.  </li>
            <li>I can use this product 2 days in a row and not have to worry about chalky residue as long as I make sure to run my fingers through it a couple of times and comb it through.</li>
            <li>Quite a bit of it does come out in spray and it&#x27;s pretty fast, do what it says and spray from a distance.</li>
            <li>Unlike two other brands I have used, the fragrance of this one is very mild and dissipates pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it- especially for the price. :)</li>
            <li>I love Batiste dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Batiste is the top dry shampoo on the market.  </li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am now a fan of Dry Shampoo :)</li>
            <li>Favorite dry shampoo to use.</li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>It seems like a spray gel more than dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on white, but blends easily if I have oil in my hair to soak it up.</li>
            <li>batiste is my favorite brand of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t leave the whiteness on your hair like most dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>and I have to wait for it to dry before massaging in and styling, so it takes more time to use.</li>
            <li>There are much better dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>reslly the closest dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used without having to wash your hair again. :)</li>
            <li>Love this dry shampoo</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an ok dry shampoo</li>
            <li>I have tried Suave and Dove dry shampoos and this one is far better and worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>It leaves a strong white residue.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different dry shampoos, sprays and powders, including Bumble &amp; bumble&#x27;s offerings at a much higher price point, and this Batiste is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>Seriously the best dry shampoo, for real!</li>
            <li>Seriously the best dry shampoo, for real!</li>
            <li>It looks fantastic on my dark brown hair, an instant washable highlight when I need it, adding warmth to my hair to match my warm skin tone and allowing for a lot of experimentation.</li>
            <li>I must admit ive tried many dry shampoos, just trying to find one that really does what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Just a quick few minutes and my hair is shiny and bouncy again.  :-).</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo does a good job on my short hair.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Transforms my slightly oily hair to fresh, light and bouncy!  </li>
            <li>Definitely, if you are looking for a good dry shampoo, this is it.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more, would love to try other scents too!</li>
            <li>Love Baliste dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>LOVE this dry shampoo!  </li>
            <li>My favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>Love this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>LOVE this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>My favorite dry shampoo!  </li>
            <li>LOVE the smell of this dry shampoo and the way it makes my hair look!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and color treated, so it&#x27;s too fragile to wash every day, but it&#x27;s also oily, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, often ranging from $8-12 per can (the big one) and it can go quick depending on how often you use it and how much hair you have, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I absolute love this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>This is okay, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much your hair is damaged by washing and drying everyday...</li>
            <li>Very convenient when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>It really gets the excess oil out of your hair.</li>
            <li>To test this out I went a whole week without washing my hair and using this instead,</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t even use it that much bc</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really</li>
            <li>Your hair still FEELS like hair, it&#x27;s very touchable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Before discovering Batiste, I was buying stuff at my salon for twice as much.</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t need to use too much.</li>
            <li>It REALLY works.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need too much spray to really soak up the product &amp; it lasts for quite some time.</li>
            <li>PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- De-greases hair very well&lt;</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t even use it that much bc</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really</li>
            <li>Oh BTW the prices are MUCH cheaper elsewhere, like target, walmart and even cvs.</li>
            <li>I was washing my hair too often, and because I have so much of it, to stop washing it every day</li>
            <li>was a REAL relief.</li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that I straighten.</li>
            <li>One thing that I didn&#x27;t really like was that the powder is not transparent</li>
            <li>You really have to massage and work this product in your hair</li>
            <li>You shake the can really well, then spray the roots, rub with fingers and it works.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This saves me me so much time.</li>
            <li>My scalp is very greasy, so I have to wash my hair every morning.</li>
            <li>Takes the grease out of my hair and leaves me ready for almost any event in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have that intense spray.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I heard so much hype about it</li>
            <li>/&gt;HIGHLY, highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>Much needed as a mom of a toddler, on those mornings when washing and drying your hair just isn&#x27;t in the cards.</li>
            <li>I try and rub it in really well and eventually throughout the day it goes away.  </li>
            <li>this morning I have to say I expected more.</li>
            <li>Comes out very flaky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for months probably every week and really like it.</li>
            <li>Really helpful when you want to add some volume to your hair.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>This product was very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>really do well for styling,</li>
            <li>Probably wasn&#x27;t any powder residue at that point, but it hadn&#x27;t removed much (if any) oil and it still smelled like talcum powder.</li>
            <li>It is very noticeable as well.</li>
            <li>In short, go lightly, chill and shag / brush it through.</li>
            <li>I have really oily hair</li>
            <li>I can smell the odor of this stuff hours after I use it, and I really don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work very well-I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>I use this on the &#x27;off&#x27; days and my hair is very managable.  </li>
            <li>Even with a light application following the instructions, I found this product unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li>And really dulled my hair.</li>
            <li>THAT DONT HAVE THAT MUCH TIME TO WASH THEIR HEAD,</li>
            <li>If I wash my hair at night and sleep on it, it gets oily...that fast.</li>
            <li>and I do prefer the one with color added, as this color lightens my hair too much.  </li>
            <li>Very lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thin, straight, naturally light blonde hair and this product works great on those days when I don&#x27;t feel like washing my hair.</li>
            <li>I would keep spraying and still felt like it wasn&#x27;t doing much.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually much healthier.</li>
            <li>and I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>It feels like dried glue to be honest.</li>
            <li>When you spray it on your hair make sure you hold the can far enough away from your head and rub</li>
            <li>love this dry shampoo!!</li>
            <li>, I get dry ends and oily oily scalp, my hair is also dark so the white shows up more than if my hair would be fair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several dry shampoos ranging from inexpensive to pricey and this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>I have tried every dry shampoo possible and this is the best hand down.</li>
            <li>and they have a ton of different scents, although I&#x27;ve always been fine with the classic scent.</li>
            <li>Takes the shine away but super powerful coming out and turns my brown hair grey color.</li>
            <li>have fairly oily hair and only like to wash it every other day.</li>
            <li>I really love my Batiste Dry Shampoo because it actually works when I have greasy hair, and it works quickly.</li>
            <li>Or if you love dry shampoo but are looking to switch to a new one....</li>
            <li>I love it and can&#x27;t wait to try its other products.</li>
            <li>I like being able to shampoo every other day and use Batiste in between.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s not much of a complaint, just something I noticed!</li>
            <li>But I like other ones I have gotten better.</li>
            <li>I love washing my hair every other day...</li>
            <li>Smells great and freshens up hair at the roots without making  it stiff or flat.</li>
            <li>Favorite Dry Shampoo!!!</li>
            <li>I spent more time messing with it to make it look normal than just taking a shower and washing it.</li>
            <li>the hair does not have any effect to put the curls back to its clean curled shape.</li>
            <li>I spent more time messing with it to make it look normal than just taking a shower and washing it.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and fine but there is alot of it</li>
            <li>This is one of the few dry shampoos I have tried, but out of all of them I definitely like this one the best.</li>
            <li>This product Left my hair clean and flexible...</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be giving this dry shampoo a few more uses and maybe shake the bottle more, on the off</li>
            <li>Not only does it clean your hair</li>
            <li>It doesn’t clean well, doesn’t volumize, and only serves to deodorize the hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty useful ESPECIALLY if you use it before bedtime because that gives it time to set in.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good but have dark hair and it initially, makes my hair look gray, then dingy.</li>
            <li>I mean it has as much force as a hair dryer on high, but it is pretty easy to use, doesnt leave my brown hair looking gray, and it does look clean after a use.</li>
            <li>Based on the (largely) good reviews, I purchased Batiste Dry Shampoo for emergency touch ups to get the oily look out of my hair when I just have absolutely no time to wash and style it before I leave the house.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, my favorite dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have light brown hair and this stuff turned my hair grey.</li>
            <li>but, I found that it does disappear with a bristle brush better than a paddle brush if that helps some of you dark haired ones.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s 100x better than my dry shampoo from Herbal Essences which leaves my hair super dry and tangled.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the dreaded hot, oily scalp feeling when I go to bed at night, nor do I have the associated old scalp smell.</li>
            <li>Be sure you&#x27;re not wearing dark clothes when you use it</li>
            <li>It looks so natural and flowy and pretty and sooo</li>
            <li>I always make sure to, at the end, brush my hair down over my face to work it into the bangs</li>
            <li>The spray is very powerful, so you don&#x27;t need to keep spraying for a long time.</li>
            <li>It is vastly superior to any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>this one smelled great, but was just too hard to get all the white worked out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very greasy hair after a day, but this voodoo spray somehow fixes that completely, and I&#x27;m able to wash my hair every other day.  </li>
            <li>And I have to admit that I was very hesitant about trying something new.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different dry shampoo products and this is by far the best one out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different dry shampoos and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of spray dry shampoo &amp; always found that they either didn&#x27;t do a good job absorbing the oil, or stayed white no matter what I did to rub them in, often both.</li>
            <li>It absorbs oil very well, especially on the hair around the face and the scent is fresh, also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased about 4 more of these since first trying it this past summer.</li>
            <li>Now that I have found this product, I will keep it on hand for those quick fixes when short on time.</li>
            <li>It also smells decent.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Tigi dry shampoo ($15) and R &amp; Co Desert dry shampoo ($25) and the Batiste is better than both!</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel rough and stiff</li>
            <li>so I am happy with this dry shampoo for those lazy days, or days where I am in a rush.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the first dry shampoo to actually make me feel clean!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>so I have high hopes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>This was the only dry shampoo that sounded good enough to try.  </li>
            <li>It smells a little &amp;#34;producty&amp;#34; but nothing overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does not mean you can skip a shower or two.</li>
            <li>but I was able to get it out with a little tosseling.</li>
            <li>Was a bit hesitant at first since I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews on the visible residue on dark/black hair, but it works just fine for</li>
            <li>Does not smell (I got the original version because I don&#x27;t like scented dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;Batiste dry shampoo Original:</li>
            <li>The spray stream is pretty strong, so a few quick bursts go a long way.</li>
            <li>This works really well for 2 or 3 day old hair.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks, I am so glad I have it.</li>
            <li>The ONLY reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it gets used up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I run through about bottle a week, which is well worth the time it saves me from washing my hair daily, and the damage it prevents by spacing out washes as well.</li>
            <li>All of those ended up being flops that either left my hair greasy, or had an unbearable lingering powerful scent.</li>
            <li>Frustrating, because I was hopeful with all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>The good thing about this product is that it does seem to lift my hair (which is thin)</li>
            <li>Washing my hair every other day will be just fine and will help my colored hair retain its color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not my favorite of the different dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try to find another dry shampoo at the beginning of this year to cut back on washing my hair and fell in love with this brand.</li>
            <li>It left my hair super soft and silky</li>
            <li>I love dry shampoo, gives me that extra day, I used to use Redken,</li>
            <li>First time using dry shampoo, and it did exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll easily not have to wash and set more than 1-2x a week</li>
            <li>, my hair does NOT feel clean and fresh, but eh, whatever the object is for it to not look like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li>The only trick is, if you have dark hair, really make sure you brush it out well</li>
            <li>I live in United States in ohio area.</li>
            <li>I live with my family</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>So this is my new solution.</li>
            <li>I’m posting this review and will update it whenever I have any new product comparison to add to help those folks who need comparative feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Hair becomes slightly thickened due to leftover powder so this may be good news for those of you who seek to add volume to your hair.</li>
            <li>Hair becomes slightly thickened due to leftover powder so this may be good news for those of you who seek to add volume to your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and it has that typical hair spray smell</li>
            <li>If I haven&#x27;t washed me hair in several days it is heavy and kind of oily.  </li>
            <li>Trying out some other dry shampoos to compare but so far this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>/&gt;My only issue (and the reason for docking a star) is that it is really pricey for how much use I get out of it.</li>
            <li>Only wish the bottle were more of a pump; it espressos a lot of product with minimal pressure and cfc&#x27;s I believe are not an issue here.</li>
            <li>: Cleans effectively without leaving much of a residue behind.</li>
            <li>: Cleans effectively without leaving much of a residue behind.</li>
            <li>However, because my hair is such a light color, I could see some white powder-like marks throughout my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li>many potentially worthless products until you get to the good one.</li>
            <li>Shows the powder very clearly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for busy moms.</li>
            <li>I have tried other dry shampoo brands in the past and this is by far the best one I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>You can buy this at ulta for 7.99, but for a dollar more I didn&#x27;t have to go to the mall and waste time, plus it was prime!</li>
            <li>I use it, pretty regularly, for up to three days.</li>
            <li>If you noticed there is still a bit of white powder left on the root of the hair, simply massage it a bit more and brush.</li>
            <li>But again, it doesn&#x27;t effect the functionality so you can get past the smell. :)</li>
            <li>3) shake between short bursts as you apply so first, shake burst, shake, 4)</li>
            <li>and I definitely understand why so many people from other countries rave about it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try it a few more times, but it may end up in the garbage like most of the other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried....</li>
            <li>it leaves kind of a weird texture on the hair, kind of sticky and stiff.</li>
            <li>One didn&#x27;t make my hair look clean and the other made my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li>The dry shampoo worth buying.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Tresemme Fresh Start dry shampoo</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tresemme Fresh Start dry shampoo</li>
            <li>I also do a quick fix on my hair in the morning by getting it slightly wet and re-drying it</li>
            <li>I can even wear it down on the 2nd day if I want, I have never been able to find anything else like it.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling exactly the same but absorbing all the oils.</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate so if i was in a dryer area it might last longer.</li>
            <li>It definitely does the job of making hair less greasy and more presentable.</li>
            <li>Finding cruelty free dry shampoo is a hassle in of itself, but finding one that actually works was a challenge that took me well over a year to find.</li>
            <li>Addicted to this stuff - gives my hair volume, freshness, covers roots and super cheap.</li>
            <li>I hate strong smells, so this one is good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a college student, and I have to say that this dry shampoo is a life saver for all-nighters when you don&#x27;t have time to shower right away.  </li>
            <li>This makes you feel a little more human.</li>
            <li>Better than other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>For me this is better than any other dry shampoo I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoo that works much better.</li>
            <li>I have tried other dry shampoos that do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but this product really does leave your hair feeling and smelling clean  - even on day 3!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other dry shampoos over the years and this by far kicks all of their butts.</li>
            <li>(suave made me gag)&lt;br /&gt;but be careful to spray lightly because it does spray white.  </li>
            <li>and you have to really rub it in to get the white out,</li>
            <li>Wow I just got it</li>
            <li>As far as giving it a grayish cast...</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money buying this product.</li>
            <li>just go natural.</li>
            <li>At first there is a grey residue, but it goes away when it is massaged in.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair daily as my hair and skin are very oily, taking into consideration</li>
            <li>recently learned something really helpful:</li>
            <li>You really have to concentrate and not miss any spots, or else you&#x27;ll catch yourself in the mirror with a gray-brown patch later that day!</li>
            <li>But you gotta really massage it in after spraying or it looks white.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never noticed a spray can being this loud before.</li>
            <li>you used too much or you didn’t apply it properly.</li>
            <li>I think he is just sensitive to the chemicals in the formula.</li>
            <li>But I have blonde hair and it is not as much of an issue for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably on my 10th can of it so far.</li>
            <li>but this stuff completely solves it.</li>
            <li>Butane is the most commonly misused volatile substance in the UK, and was the cause of 52% of &amp;#34;solvent related&amp;#34; deaths in 2000.[11]</li>
            <li>Good for when I was ill.</li>
            <li>It does leave white residue (so apply it BEFORE you get dressed!), but pretty much all dry shampoos will.</li>
            <li>I also think this product is reasonably priced compared to most of the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve purchased in the past (Sephora, Drybar, etc.)</li>
            <li>I wish the smell was slightly pleasing, but after it goes on your hair, it pretty much just smells of just your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not familiar with the original scent.</li>
            <li>I mean it&#x27;s ok, but there&#x27;s a lot of hype around this stuff.</li>
            <li>only con about this is it didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other dry shampoos, but for the price and considering how great it worked for me, I can deal with that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Item arrived right on time and was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>The Batiste Dry Shampoo does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>First time user of dry shampoo but</li>
            <li>Please note that this was my first dry shampoo</li>
            <li>This is my first time using dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, this dry shampoo really holds it together!</li>
            <li>This stuff left my hair completely soft and normal, but no stiff residue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff left my hair completely soft and normal, but no stiff residue at all.</li>
            <li>the white makes your natural vibrant color go away.)</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different dry shampoos at various price points, and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I found that the dry shampoo merely makes your hair stick together better (similar to hair spray) and makes your hair smell better.</li>
            <li>By spraying butane directly into the throat, the jet of fluid can cool rapidly to −20 °C by expansion, causing prolonged laryngospasm.[12] &amp;#34;Sudden sniffer&#x27;s death&amp;#34; syndrome, first described by Bass in 1970,[13] is the most common single cause of &amp;#34;solvent related&amp;#34; death, resulting in 55% of known fatal cases.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>So many other dry shampoos smell like I dumped a bottle of bad perfume on my scalp, and this is a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Clean and dry - doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and the bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li>Works decently well, but definitely use before bed to allow it to work itself into your hair.  </li>
            <li>My only advice would be to cover your mouth and nose when you use it, aerosol tends to be a little strong.  </li>
            <li>Scent is also a little too sweet and overpowering for me.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t  really flake or dry out my scalp and puts even 2 and 3 day hair back to a normal feel!</li>
            <li>Shake it even between sprays or you might get a high concentration of white on your hair.</li>
            <li>have very dark brown hair and while it turns my hair white initially, it&#x27;s easy to get rid of it when you spread it around and comb it through.</li>
            <li>If that happens it usually brushes out pretty well but may remove a little more shine than you&#x27;d like from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Fresh Scent - works as well as dry shampoo&#x27;s double the price.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this and also that you can&#x27;t smell it later in the day like other dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other dry shampoos and always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>Since getting the Batiste Dry Shampoo, my second day hair has been looking just as fresh as it would have had I taken a full shower and dried out my hair.</li>
            <li>With that said it DOES leave a powdery film on hair that you have to work through and if you used too much product it will leave a grey cast.  </li>
            <li>so if not careful in completely massaging it in, parts of my hair would appear lighter.</li>
            <li>Tried corn starch - yes, it absorbs oil very well, but it also adds a greyish hue to my hair dark hair, which can be &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; removed with a lot of brushing, but I don&#x27;t think it exactly makes me look younger.</li>
            <li>I usually bend my head over and then spray and just lightly brush.</li>
            <li>I like the powder based dry shampoos a little better, this one seemed harder to rub into hair and left more residual than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It goes on white, but once I brush her hair, it is fine even on her very dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of dry shampoo, but I hadn&#x27;t been able to find one that doesn&#x27;t build up and leave my hair stiff, until BATISTE.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it, but it just keeps turning my red hair lighter and dull.  </li>
            <li>After using it, my hair looked fluffy and not as flat, but on my medium brown hair, it left me looking more gray.  </li>
            <li>Now, I do live in a low humidity climate</li>
            <li>This is definitely going into the new &#x27;must have&#x27; for me.</li>
            <li>I started a new job with longer hours last year</li>
            <li>Seriously,  I was able to got out in public, run errands, complete a work-out without being concerned about the look, odor, or feel of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo REALLY works.  </li>
            <li>However the whole day I left white fingerprints all over everything.</li>
            <li>ESPECIALLY when I can put straight up cornstarch on my hair and achieve the same effect.</li>
            <li>This works really well, but it definitely leaves a white residue.  </li>
            <li>Also, I do a Brazilian Blowout 3 times a year to keep it long and strong and every wash removes a little of the treatment, so</li>
            <li>Mine is vivid red.</li>
            <li>For my naturally black hair I prefer the dark hair version more.</li>
            <li>It is better for my very dark hair than all the other drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this dry shampoo to anyone considering it!</li>
            <li>I tried bunch of other dry shampoo and didn&#x27;t get to feel as clean as using this product.</li>
            <li>I have black to blonde ombre hair which I can&#x27;t wash very often because of how much bleaching and dying it has gone through.</li>
            <li>The product works just fine, but the size was a little smaller than I had hoped and it only lasted me a couple months.  </li>
            <li>I previously used Blow Pro&#x27;s dry shampoo, but it wasn&#x27;t available on Prime, so I gave Batiste a try.</li>
            <li>so I only wash it with shampoo/conditioner 2-3x a week to keep the red vibrant.  </li>
            <li>when I skip a day I look a right mess.</li>
            <li>I recently went blonde and my hair is super dry and fragile.  </li>
            <li>I can spray this in my hair in the morning, go to work all day, go out for drinks after, not get home until late, and my hair still looks oil free.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a huge head of thick hair.  </li>
            <li>The white residue was clearly visible.</li>
            <li>Two of the four cans from this vendor were defective, and they only sprayed a clear liquid.</li>
            <li>I am platinum blonde naturally</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember the last time I wrote a review, but WOW</li>
            <li>I can barely go one day without washing my hair.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by another reviewer&#x27;s comment about it being flammable as basic hairspray is flammable.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft after using it and not gritty like others have made it feel.  </li>
            <li>But i suggest you are careful and don&#x27;t use much if you have darker hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better (Not your mothers) but I have also used worse.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re tired of hearing about it):</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fresh and the powder isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  </li>
            <li>I ran to my local walgreens and grabbed this dry shampoo in hopes of looking a little more presentable in the short amount of time I had.</li>
            <li>Toxic smell and not great results with my hair (which is fine and straight and tends to get flat and greasy).  </li>
            <li>This leaves very little white residue when I spray it, and the white that does appear is easily worked in and disappears.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell (I abhorred the smell of the suave keratin dry shampoo), and while it&#x27;s a little strong going on it fades quickly enough to me.</li>
            <li>I bought a different one when I was testing out the whole dry shampoo thing</li>
            <li>I bought a different one when I was testing out the whole dry shampoo thing</li>
            <li>good dry shampoo just smells weird</li>
            <li>It looks slightly white-ish when you first spray it</li>
            <li>even then It still makes your hair look a little dull (kind of like your aging cause</li>
            <li>I have pretty thick heavy volume hair that gets oily at the roots pretty much the day after I wash it.</li>
            <li>only complaint is that when you spray it its super LOUD!</li>
            <li>for those trying it for the first time - don&#x27;t put the nozzle right at your hair or you&#x27;ll get a ton of white product that will be hard to brush away and will leave you looking like you have grey hair.</li>
            <li>Works great, just a little too expensive for me.</li>
            <li>With other products, no matter how much I spray, my daughter&#x27;s hair still looks greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily hair and have to wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li>I have used other dry shampoos with varying degrees of success.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as my first dry shampoo and had no problems using it as long as I sprayed, worked it in my roots with my fingers, then brushed or sprayed and went to bed.</li>
            <li>I would use it again for a day of just running errands, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a work day or before social engagements.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive brands and not gotten near the results.</li>
            <li>It is not a dry shampoo, It is powder, doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>you can go a few days without shampooing in the shower which saves your hair from getting dried out, and it gives your hair more volume too.</li>
            <li>Also, if your hair is baby fine like mine, add a little to dry hair even if it’s clean and blow-dry upside down to maximize the volume!!!!</li>
            <li>When I use it it gets really white on my roots right after I spray it, but if I leave it for a few minutes or try to rub it in then it&#x27;ll go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can always add more, but you can’t take it out unless you have time to shower so try a little and do a second round if needed</li>
            <li>Suave is a close second though, even though I generally don&#x27;t care for their products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a darker blonde, but even at that -- this left a clearly visible white residue on my hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue.</li>
            <li>Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue.</li>
            <li>(read the first few ingredients if you want to cringe.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different dry shampoos, from high end to Dove at the grocery store to try and help my 10 year olds greasy 2nd day hair.  </li>
            <li>I notice it when I spray it, but within minutes there is no lingering smell, which I really really appreciate, as I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes and the smell of some of the other dry shampoos i&#x27;ve used really got to me after a few hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wish we could give half stars, because I would have given a 3.5.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not worth it to me to pick white flakes out of my hair the whole day after I use it.</li>
            <li>It goes on in a thin layer and then brushes easily through your hair.</li>
            <li>Besides, My hairs are permed/curled, the curls are usually gone the second day of washing, dry clean</li>
            <li>Upon first try, this spray has made my hair look grey, likely because my hair is dark.</li>
            <li>I never expected much from dry shampoos, the ones I tried were so so, and not worth the 20+ price.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, medium-dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>am very particular about smell and this one I can deal with everyday.  </li>
            <li>I tried spraying out a little and the whole bathroom started to fill up with a Lysol spray type of smell.  </li>
            <li>Every other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried without hurting my wallet wouldn&#x27;t help my bangs from looking greasy, which was the part I really wanted to fix.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> but it does a great job for its purpose.</li>

            <li> I wouldn’t call this a juicy fruity smell that you sometimes get from good shampoos.</li>
            <li> It makes it feel clean, adds softness, and smells great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light weight and smells great.  </li>

            <li> Makes my straight hair perfect even when I don&#x27;t have time to wash it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely thrilled with how well it works as well as the price.  </li>

            <li> Look out for updates as I continue to search for a great dry shampoo that doesn’t leave residue, cleans effectively, doesn’t make the hair rigid, smells awesome and,</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strong but pleasant and lasts well over the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for those with light hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very easy product to apply.</li>
            <li> Came out very easily and never had it happen again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong AND persistent - you have been warned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong AND persistent - you have been warned.</li>
            <li> but it came early so the shipping is definitely great!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product.</li>
            <li> Not the &#x27;Magic&#x27; shower replacement I was kind of hoping for,</li>
            <li> and this works the best by far.  </li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for a night out if you want to make your hair smell fresh and add some volume.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Wow, is this stuff incredible!</li>

            <li> I have very fine oily hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li> You have to shake it good or it will be clumpy, but it leaves my hair with a fresh scent, movement and body!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super cheap, works amazingly well and smells great.</li>
            <li> I thought this will work perfectly but not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> Ok so far of all the products I have tried I do like this best.  </li>
            <li> Smells exactly like HE Color me Happy shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smells like bright, sweet citrus.</li>
            <li> Smells like bright, sweet citrus.</li>
            <li> I have very fine blonde hair and this product is perfect..</li>
            <li> A huge life saver for a girl that spends many days in the gym and can&#x27;t wash my hair after each workout!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always going to have dry shampoo in my life from now on, and I&#x27;ve heard this is the best brand from a couple of popular YouTube beauty gurus.</li>
            <li> Handy for fine hair that needs washing every day.</li>
            <li> so the dryness is huge!</li>
            <li> Though make sure to hold your breath after spraying as it can be a bit asphyxiating for a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Then after some more time passes I rub it into my scalp with my fingers again.</li>
            <li> Better than some of the store brands.  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair a refreshing look and scent.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work and even made my hair look and feel more greasy.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> People seem to love it.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to use this product two days in a row.  </li>
            <li> give your hair a rest :]  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to avoid washing my hair for a couple more days and keep it healthy from this product.</li>
            <li> I like to use it before I work out to maintain my hairstyle and in my roots after a blowout (especially if it&#x27;s hot)</li>
            <li> Yea I enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li> like i hoped it would :)</li>
            <li> okay*</li>
            <li> so make sure you work it into the scalp and brush it through your  hair</li>
            <li> The product works okay, but could definitely be better.</li>
            <li> Make sure you comb through</li>
            <li> You want to spray your hair in sections and rub out any whiteness, but then just toss your hair and love yourself.</li>
            <li> I thought I would like this more....</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> ok.  </li>
            <li> The good news is that my hair smelled quite fresh and my hair almost regained the fullness that it has when it&#x27;s just shampooed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for a product for years that gives my hair more volume and this defiantly helps.</li>
            <li> Also, the Batiste does a better job of making my hair feel cleaner...</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful because I had heard so many great things</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s better suited for those with lighter hair colors.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it so I tried and love it too.</li>
            <li> It may be deemed &#x27;safe&#x27;, but it&#x27;s not something that I want to put on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I used this on a day off work when I wouldn&#x27;t see many people.</li>
            <li> Psssst was so much better.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Baby powder does better then</li>
            <li> I prefer their brunette version better.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> (you can always add more</li>
            <li> Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i like this scent more because it&#x27;s not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> I know they tell you how many Fl Oz are in it</li>
            <li> It works great, but is very smelly.</li>
            <li> I can still feel the &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; feeling more than halfway through my day.</li>
            <li> batiste is the best- you just need to use a hair dryer to blow out the white powder.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, this is my second time buying it.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot. :)</li>
            <li> My hair already feels more</li>
            <li> Has a bit of a learning curve to use, but I love the smell</li>
            <li> Pretty nice results from this product!</li>
            <li> Even better than the pricier counterparts.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and it really works.  </li>
            <li> It would probably work better for people with lighter, thinner hair than mine.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have been having issues with hair fall because I wash it every day, not any more</li>
            <li> This one has more aerosol than the others and helps spread it throughout my roots.</li>
            <li> removing bedtime cowlicks.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is OK, wish I had chosen apple or something though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for about a month now and am so glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t lingering, but I like the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent one the most.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make my hair feel better, and</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> love the tropical scent...</li>
            <li> though I would try one more time to find an alternative.</li>
            <li> I am glad I</li>
            <li> I was able to do my hair 3 days in a row!!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to use a lot more of the Batiste.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s OK for emergency use, say, for keeping in the car; but you never know whom else you will offend with the smell.</li>
            <li> So maybe the formula is not fantastically healthy, it&#x27;s just the rest of us go symptom-free?&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love them all.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to rub the product in well.</li>
            <li> I apply this to the top of my hair and the hairline, let it sit a minute, rub it in, and then brush it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better for my hair to be able to go a day or two before washing it again....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I can do that now.</li>

            <li> I have tried Dove, Tressemme(?), &amp;#34;Pfft&amp;#34;, and many others.</li>
            <li> cant you tell :)</li>
            <li> Mi tried this stuff on a whim when I was on vacation, and I was able to go THREE DAYS without washing my hair....</li>
            <li> and I was not incredibly disgusting at the end of those three days.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair sticky on top of being oily.</li>
            <li> It also smells clean and fresh, a welcome change.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair look clean and fresh; does a GREAT job soaking up oil.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the original, even though it still works amazing.</li>
            <li> Has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> It hides itself well in even dark hair, smells good and clean and reduces grease perfectly.</li>

            <li> I def enjoy the cherry one more.</li>
            <li> most important, one that is affordable.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and works like magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll often spray this along my roots at the start of the day, and my hair stays looking fresh and tidy even when I&#x27;ve been sweating on the NYC subway.</li>
            <li> Fair job of absorbing oil.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> BEST DRY SHAMPOO EVER!!</li>
            <li> In buying this one before I had bought several bottles, this time for a friend to buy, very good smell taste, easy to carry.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely one of my most favorite products in my beauty arsenal!</li>
            <li> I tried the original formula/scent, &amp; I think it smells lovely.</li>
            <li> The reviews of others are indeed true!</li>
            <li> Keep trying other products, but Batiste is the best.</li>
            <li> I love the original scent.  </li>
            <li> Tried other brands, this is the best.</li>
            <li> I used this to clean some doll faces safely.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo leaves my hair feeling lightweight, lasts all day, smells great, and is inexpensive - perfect for 3rd day hair.</li>
            <li> ~6 inches away--doing this, the residue easily comes out by just rubbing my hair with my fingers.</li>
            <li> It is easy to be applied and makes your hair nicer during the day.</li>
            <li> This one is easily the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My oily hair gets greasy easily.</li>
            <li> Hair becomes silky and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> Hair becomes silky and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong, just right!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they make it so strong.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell to it on your hair and does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> I must say, I enjoy the texture of my hair after 3 days of not washing versus freshly clean!</li>
            <li> I have used some of the more popular brands of dry shampoo and this one has been the best so far.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not bad or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used - gives hair lots of volume and feels very fresh and clean</li>
            <li> The TresSemme dry shampoo leaves a super powdery but the Batiste is the best!</li>
            <li> Excellent product to keep from washing hair daily and priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li> It was the very first dry shampoo that I ever tried and it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> It does dry up the oil &amp; give your hair volume which is especially great if you have very fine straight hair like myself, but it leaves a ashy residue.</li>
            <li> ; It&#x27;s always worked into my hair just fine.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product would make my hair look fine and not oily.</li>
            <li> My hair looks fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It worked fine.  </li>
            <li> I have oily fine</li>
            <li> Works fine with my short-ish medium weight</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, hair</li>
            <li> nothing else will give my fine hair volume without making it look greasy.  </li>
            <li> most important, one that is affordable.ance is that of sweet roses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for the price</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing, but it&#x27;s got the most cloyingly sweet smell and if you use as much as I do</li>
            <li> I have finely textured light blond hair, and this doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or film.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product for touching up hair quickly by adding volume and eliminating some grease.</li>
            <li> It is half the price of most and works just as good, or better than most.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo on the market, and I have tried many many brands.</li>
            <li> however, if you have a little gray in your hair, this would be the perfect shade.  </li>
            <li> Great product but not that good when you have dark hair, put it on my roots and was like spraying baby powder on it!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t deposit a huge amount of powder but still seems to do the job</li>
            <li> so I would recommend it for people with light colored hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> but once you rub it in with your hands it goes away and leaves your hair with great texture and volume without any 3rd day without a shower grease!</li>
            <li> Just spray lightly at scalp and work through the hair and brush.  </li>
            <li> It is a great price and a big bottle.</li>
            <li> It also is unscented which is a big win for me.</li>
            <li> I section off the crown of my head and lightly spray at the roots.</li>
            <li> The primary ingredient (as listed on the can) is butane.  </li>
            <li> I have light brown hair and the powder</li>
            <li> It has a light scent that is not offensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just about fragrance free, and it leaves no residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> This also comes in a tropical scent which is fabulous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product , especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I kept seeing people talk about how great it was and for some reason, I&#x27;d always end up getting a different brand at the store-</li>
            <li> Not a disappointment but could be better.</li>
            <li> It is also a great texturizer that provides extra hold for up dos.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t produce the same results that I experienced with the Blow Pro product.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky smooth with no oil at all.</li>
            <li> I really only use it at the crown at the roots and it works great.</li>
            <li> This product is far superior</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re willing to drop $25 on dry shampoo, then this is the best stuff you can buy.</li>
            <li> Now if only I could find one with free shipping - or better yet, find it in the store!!  </li>
            <li> it brushes out fairly easily, but based on all the positive reviews I was hoping that this brand would be better in that way.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good but did very little good for my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and light after I use it, which allows me to use it for 2 days in a row if needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The smell is fine, just a fresh scent, nothing strong or overly fragrant.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and smells so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo ever, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Good aerosol power, easy to work through hair, adds volume and texture on that second day after washing.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute BEST dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Was not disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh!</li>
            <li> Really useful for me!</li>
            <li> Totally refreshes my hair and smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like most Garnier Fructis products; like tropical fruits &amp; citrus.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient is butane, though, so you need to be ok with that.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend thought my hair was freshly washed that morning!</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best dry shampoo on the market without a doubt!</li>
            <li> Also, the Original Clean doesn&#x27;t leave a distinctive smell or anything.</li>
            <li> I spray it in all the roots and all over the top of my head lightly, then go about my business getting ready.</li>
            <li> Gives me a clean hair look in a jiffy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;fresh washed&amp;#34; hair on day 3 using this product, but it still looks and feels clean.</li>
            <li> Hair looks clean, not oily.  </li>
            <li> great dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is great.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair look fresh and lessens how often I actually need to wash my hair which is great because it has allowed my hair to grow longer and look healthier.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look and feel clean in minutes.  </li>
            <li> There is no residue, it smells clean, and my hair looks and feels clean.</li>
            <li> It provides volume and clean hair on those between shampoo days.</li>
            <li> If your head is great and your ends are dry</li>
            <li> This product gives me clean, volumized hair</li>
            <li> Great dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> you scalp clean.</li>
            <li> Happy dry shampoo:</li>
            <li> I use baking soda as well to clean my hair.</li>
            <li> A clean smell and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work to make hair feel clean.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong for my preference, but the product works well and keeps my hair feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> It also has a fairly pleasant smell of all the different kinds we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My second day hair looks better than my freshly washed hair!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I tried this Batiste Dry shampoo!  </li>
            <li> This is great dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love love love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> but it massages right in!</li>
            <li> smell is light and has the smell of soap--very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean smell and made my hair soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Love love love this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> My hair looks pretty clean!</li>
            <li> Bright white.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair bright red</li>
            <li> I wish the can was larger for the price, but I got maybe 10 or so good uses out of it.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good buy</li>
            <li> If I accidentally spray too much, meh, that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I also love that I can&#x27;t really feel it in my hair after use.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair full of body and eliminates grease</li>
            <li> I wish the can was larger for the price, but I got maybe 10 or so good uses out of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a miracle worker and the next day your hair still looks good.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> love the way it smells and really works with my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried only two others before this one and they didn&#x27;t do as nearly a good job as this one does.</li>
            <li> It really gets the job done and I will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you spray it on at the roots and really brush it all out.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is that of sweet roses.</li>
            <li> The smell is a syrupy sweet mango/vanilla concoction.</li>
            <li> The smell is a syrupy sweet mango/vanilla concoction.</li>
            <li> I wanted a more lifting &amp;#34;va va voom&amp;#34; , but no matter how much I teased with this product, all I got was &amp;#34;va&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Overall product was good.</li>
            <li> The original has this supposed-to-be fresh and clean scent to it.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my hair look less oily, but it doesn&#x27;t make it look as good as I thought it would since I had read so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> but I honestly don&#x27;t understand how it has such good reviews because Oscar blandi or drybar dry shampoos are much better</li>
            <li> I have never found a dry shampoo that does what this can do, it leaves my hair soft and full and smelling great!  </li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;d bought batiste and the clean and classic is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed to product, it is a pretty good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I have dark hair and when spraying it initially, I got a real good idea what I&#x27;d look like as a graying granny. :D</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best of the dry shampoos she has tried.  </li>
            <li> Of all the dry shampoos I have tried, this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot).</li>
            <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used so far, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  </li>
            <li> Just restyle a little and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others and this is the only one that feels clean and refreshing and doesn&#x27;t leave buildup in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li> It also created a lot of volume which is amazing especially when you have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> Smell is a bit strong at first but quickly goes away.</li>
            <li> Other than that one thing it was great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly curly hair that I wash out and flat iron every.single.day.  </li>
            <li> and it smells fresh and clean</li>
            <li> looks fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t be washing it all the time if I hope to keep the color in because they fade super quick, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than most I&#x27;ve tried, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> then my hair gets super oily.</li>
            <li> Great product, you really have to rub it in to get rid of the white</li>
            <li> Shipped quick.</li>
            <li> I think the tresemm&amp;eacute; brand does a better job, without drying out scalp and it pretty much lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I seem to go through a can quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use it instead of showering if I had the time but woulds well as a quick fix if your in a rush.</li>
            <li> Smelled like mildly scented talcum powder on my head.  </li>
            <li> but my ends frizz and my roots get oily quickly</li>
            <li> super powers-</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY, Wonderful treatment and I like the dry shampoo so much thank you.</li>
            <li> But if you need a quick fix now and then, this is the stuff to use.</li>
            <li> Luckily, my wife is.  </li>
            <li> Your hair feels more refreshed and leaves the hair feeling VERY soft and smelling clean.</li>
            <li> First time trying dry shampoo and am very pleased!</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I have tried and it works great for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have brown hair and at first it does leave a light color</li>
            <li> It helps keep my hair looking great on the 2nd or 3rd day (don&#x27;t judge) after shampooing and gives my hair more volume and control.</li>
            <li> the silvery tint it gave to my hair was actually very pretty.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs the oil well as long as you dump a fair amount of the product into your hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair super dry which is good</li>
            <li> Just wish they sold it at more stores where I live.</li>
            <li> It has a nice slight scent and makes your hair good as new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and my hair styles very well after massaging it in and combing through.</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t easily remove too much).</li>
            <li> Highly highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;ve bought original</li>
            <li> First dry shampoo that I have tried (I&#x27;ve tried many different types) that smells good and works well!</li>
            <li> Simply the best dry shampoo I have found.</li>
            <li> After buying a different dry shampoo, found at walmart, we now understand why this is one of the best selling ones out there.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best dry shampoo product on the market.</li>
            <li> With that being said, it was less greasy and did feel &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; had more movement to it as well and smelled nice.</li>
            <li> The best way to use dry shampoo is to spray sections of hair from below, and let sit (don&#x27;t brush or touch) for ten minutes.</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo :)</li>
            <li> My hair is blond, fine, and straight so this helps between shampoos.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of dry shampoo, it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t leave a gross residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> but I personally prefer Klorane dry shampoo (the best one I&#x27;ve ever used and well worth the price).</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s tried at least half a dozen different ones, and the Batiste smells the best and works the best, period.</li>
            <li> my little helper on my rush day, works great.</li>
            <li> Love the refreshing original scent and keeps my hair less greasy looking for hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, I just wish there were bigger</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist, I found a great shampoo to use and it usually works great, but when it doesn&#x27;t my greasy spot ruins my day.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just fresh smelling but not over powering.</li>
            <li> To date this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The spray goes on white (I didn&#x27;t try the tinted kind)</li>
            <li> This is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My hair feels freshly washed immediately after use, and it has a delightfully fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Definitely handy for someone like myself who only washed their hair 1-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> It had a fresh look and a washed scent.  </li>
            <li> This stuff wins-</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s citrusy and fresh</li>
            <li> I recommended this to my best friend and she is addicted to it as well.</li>
            <li> A decent dry shampoo with a clean pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of grabbing all of the oil in my hair, doesn&#x27;t leave any weird residue, and smells nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it -</li>
            <li> Baby powder soaks up far more oil</li>
            <li> I spray it in my hair before I go to bed so that by morning the powder is all absorbed</li>
            <li> any oil is absorbed and leaves hair looking fresh.</li>
            <li> Not a problem if you&#x27;re a blond, and actually useful if, like me, you&#x27;re a highlighted blond, as it helps cover as my roots are growing out.</li>
            <li> As a brunette, I do have to brush or shake it out with my hands to diffuse the powdery residue it can leave if you spray it too closely, but afterwards the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> keeps it looking and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li> But I still use it rarely when I need to hurry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Truly looks like you have freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is not oily at all and looks fresh.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a kid because chemicals get absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> The scent of the dry shampoo is very light and pleasant as well which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> The spray is very powerful and goes straight to your roots.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this dry shampoo has been a holy grail for my hair as it otherwise needs a full washing every day.</li>
            <li> She tells me that this is the best dry shampoo she&#x27;s ever used, by a long shot.  </li>
            <li> I like this product better than some of the other brands out there, and we&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li> Fine, but ran out pretty quickly - only got 2 weeks of use (at most) out of one bottle.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets oily at the roots pretty quickly in the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hunting for the perfect dry shampoo for a very long time now.</li>
            <li> If you have really dark hair you may have a harder time making it not look like you put powder in your hair but for medium to light hair, this is awesome.</li>
            <li> then right before I get dressed</li>
            <li> Right when you spray this stuff into your hair you can automatically feel the difference.</li>
            <li> to think, I don&#x27;t think &amp;#34;allergic&amp;#34; is the right word.</li>
            <li> But do not expect your hair to feel like it does right after washing it.</li>
            <li> Note that this bottle size is not the right size for carrying on to a plane.</li>
            <li> It works right away to get rid of the oily roots, and as the day goes on I find my hair gets nicer and nicer.</li>
            <li> I loved the light, not overwhelming lemon scent.</li>
            <li> By far the best dry shampoo I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li> However, this comes out more whitish so it may not be appropriate for dark hair.</li>
            <li> I replced the oily look with a slight overcast of powder that, I&#x27;m sure, was most noticeable to me.</li>
            <li> My favorite is Simply Smooth Xtend Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li> With all this in mind the price is great and compared to other dry shampoos Batiste was OK.</li>
            <li> works pretty well, but run out fast, would be nicer if it&#x27;s pretty cheap</li>
            <li> This is great for someone who wants to keep their hair looking fresh a few days longer between washes.</li>
            <li> This is the first type of dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s been working great so far.  </li>
            <li> She uses the original, my older daughter uses the brunette/dark brown variety.  </li>
            <li> I have used other dry shampoos, this one works the best for me, and doesnt leave my hair feeling chalking like others.</li>
            <li> Fantastic gift for a new mom care</li>
            <li> With this amazing dry spray I can go days without washing my hair.</li>
            <li> Plus don&#x27;t spray it wearing your good clothes, as a slight powdery residue will form.</li>
            <li> It is the most clean feeling dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Works great, no smell later on and easier to not have the white powder residue.</li>
            <li> Really works super</li>
            <li> I tried &#x27;Not Your Mothers&#x27; Clean Freak Refreshing Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> not only do you not have to wash your hair everyday, it gives you wonderful volume.  </li>
            <li> First dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever liked.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is not the best for individuals with dark hair.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo my wife has ever had, hands down.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo ever hands down.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best dry shampoo in the world.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo I have used, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use it all the time or it will dry out your scalp too much, but my friend joked that she was never going to wash her hair again because she loved it so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried an easy half dozen, more</li>
            <li> I have super fine, super blonde hair that gets greasy if you look at it too long, and this stuff is like magic.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product since it is so popular - but it actually could not handle the oily-ness to my hair.  </li>
            <li> My bangs &amp; top of my head get oily so fast, and I love how I can just spray a little of this on</li>
            <li> Love how this product takes away the oil, but I have brown hair and this type leaves white in</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t need so much spray on the hair!  </li>
            <li> It is a pretty aggressive spray, and by that</li>
            <li> the spray will leave a dusting of white all over your bathroom, so beware of that.  :)</li>
            <li> I wish I would have found this one first.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and always come back to this.</li>
            <li> would definitely buy this product again :)</li>
            <li> This works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> but it looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> The first time that I used this product I had not washed my hair in two days and three nights.  </li>
            <li> My hair had been through 2 work-outs, 1 hot tubbing session (up in a pony tail) , and a day of gardening prep (think, potting soil and dirt).  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> love that batiste comes in various scents and even shades!</li>
            <li> I like how it smells at first.</li>
            <li> It does give my hair extra body and the smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I got this product yesterday and I&#x27;m using for the first time today.</li>
            <li> After a couple days of not washing my hair my roots get pretty oily, while the rest of my hair is is normal/dry.</li>
            <li> Probably would be better in a different scent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s finally for sale in Walgreens</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty fine/</li>
            <li> I have gone 3 WHOLE NIGHTS without water washing my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product and can&#x27;t image my daily routine without it!</li>
            <li> I think I will know better after several uses.</li>
            <li> Thanks Batiste!</li>
            <li> With this stuff, I can make it through a whole day and sometimes two!</li>
            <li> Great for late in the day when my hair starts getting grease just spray it in and helps.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite beauty product I have ever owned, and believe me, that is a BIG statement.</li>
            <li> I would have to say that after several uses of this item, it works better than PSSSTT did for me.  </li>
            <li> sure while you apply the product your parting your hair and only spraying the scalp!</li>
            <li> this version is much better, but i do wish that it sometimes didn&#x27;t spray as much white powder.</li>
            <li> It still doesn&#x27;t beat a hot shower though</li>
            <li> also there is so much product!</li>
            <li> Smells generic but refreshing nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells generic but refreshing nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does leave some white residue after using it but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Delivery was Fast and Furious!  </li>
            <li> I have to really brush it out!</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> When my roots are oily, i spray a little of this dry shampoo on and it looks perfectly matte!  </li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found, just a little pricy.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I ever tried - i bought few more for future use.&lt;br /&gt;Why</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had more success with a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be getting this again, and have just as good results using plain corn starch the night before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in the original, cherry, wild scents, as well as in the brown spray.</li>
            <li> Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing dry shampoo: Cleans very effectively without leaving any residue behind.</li>
            <li> Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing dry shampoo: Cleans very effectively without leaving any residue behind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a whole new era!!!  </li>
            <li> - great if you are a natural blonde or pretty much totally blonde.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t emphasize this enough, I have used it on clean hair just to boost the volume!</li>
            <li> Also, when you use it your hair actually feels clean!</li>
            <li> Actually leaves my hair looking like it is clean!</li>
            <li> Leaves a strong white residue in your hair at first.</li>
            <li> This product has majorly positively impacted my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos and I have to say this is the best, by far.  </li>
            <li> I can use this product 2 days in a row and not have to worry about chalky residue as long as I make sure to run my fingers through it a couple of times and comb it through.</li>
            <li> Quite a bit of it does come out in spray and it&#x27;s pretty fast, do what it says and spray from a distance.</li>
            <li> Unlike two other brands I have used, the fragrance of this one is very mild and dissipates pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it- especially for the price. :)</li>
            <li> I love Batiste dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Batiste is the top dry shampoo on the market.  </li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am now a fan of Dry Shampoo :)</li>
            <li> Favorite dry shampoo to use.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> It seems like a spray gel more than dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on white, but blends easily if I have oil in my hair to soak it up.</li>
            <li> batiste is my favorite brand of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave the whiteness on your hair like most dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> and I have to wait for it to dry before massaging in and styling, so it takes more time to use.</li>
            <li> There are much better dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> reslly the closest dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used without having to wash your hair again. :)</li>
            <li> Love this dry shampoo</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an ok dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I have tried Suave and Dove dry shampoos and this one is far better and worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> It leaves a strong white residue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different dry shampoos, sprays and powders, including Bumble &amp; bumble&#x27;s offerings at a much higher price point, and this Batiste is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> Seriously the best dry shampoo, for real!</li>
            <li> Seriously the best dry shampoo, for real!</li>
            <li> It looks fantastic on my dark brown hair, an instant washable highlight when I need it, adding warmth to my hair to match my warm skin tone and allowing for a lot of experimentation.</li>
            <li> I must admit ive tried many dry shampoos, just trying to find one that really does what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Just a quick few minutes and my hair is shiny and bouncy again.  :-).</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo does a good job on my short hair.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Transforms my slightly oily hair to fresh, light and bouncy!  </li>
            <li> Definitely, if you are looking for a good dry shampoo, this is it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more, would love to try other scents too!</li>
            <li> Love Baliste dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> LOVE this dry shampoo!  </li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> Love this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> LOVE this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo!  </li>
            <li> LOVE the smell of this dry shampoo and the way it makes my hair look!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and color treated, so it&#x27;s too fragile to wash every day, but it&#x27;s also oily, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, often ranging from $8-12 per can (the big one) and it can go quick depending on how often you use it and how much hair you have, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I absolute love this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> This is okay, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much your hair is damaged by washing and drying everyday...</li>
            <li> Very convenient when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> It really gets the excess oil out of your hair.</li>
            <li> To test this out I went a whole week without washing my hair and using this instead,</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t even use it that much bc</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really</li>
            <li> Your hair still FEELS like hair, it&#x27;s very touchable.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Before discovering Batiste, I was buying stuff at my salon for twice as much.</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t need to use too much.</li>
            <li> It REALLY works.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need too much spray to really soak up the product &amp; it lasts for quite some time.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- De-greases hair very well&lt;</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t even use it that much bc</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really</li>
            <li> Oh BTW the prices are MUCH cheaper elsewhere, like target, walmart and even cvs.</li>
            <li> I was washing my hair too often, and because I have so much of it, to stop washing it every day</li>
            <li> was a REAL relief.</li>
            <li> It really helps.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that I straighten.</li>
            <li> One thing that I didn&#x27;t really like was that the powder is not transparent</li>
            <li> You really have to massage and work this product in your hair</li>
            <li> You shake the can really well, then spray the roots, rub with fingers and it works.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This saves me me so much time.</li>
            <li> My scalp is very greasy, so I have to wash my hair every morning.</li>
            <li> Takes the grease out of my hair and leaves me ready for almost any event in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have that intense spray.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I heard so much hype about it</li>
            <li> /&gt;HIGHLY, highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> Much needed as a mom of a toddler, on those mornings when washing and drying your hair just isn&#x27;t in the cards.</li>
            <li> I try and rub it in really well and eventually throughout the day it goes away.  </li>
            <li> this morning I have to say I expected more.</li>
            <li> Comes out very flaky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for months probably every week and really like it.</li>
            <li> Really helpful when you want to add some volume to your hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> This product was very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> really do well for styling,</li>
            <li> Probably wasn&#x27;t any powder residue at that point, but it hadn&#x27;t removed much (if any) oil and it still smelled like talcum powder.</li>
            <li> It is very noticeable as well.</li>
            <li> In short, go lightly, chill and shag / brush it through.</li>
            <li> I have really oily hair</li>
            <li> I can smell the odor of this stuff hours after I use it, and I really don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work very well-I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> I use this on the &#x27;off&#x27; days and my hair is very managable.  </li>
            <li> Even with a light application following the instructions, I found this product unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li> And really dulled my hair.</li>
            <li> THAT DONT HAVE THAT MUCH TIME TO WASH THEIR HEAD,</li>
            <li> If I wash my hair at night and sleep on it, it gets oily...that fast.</li>
            <li> and I do prefer the one with color added, as this color lightens my hair too much.  </li>
            <li> Very lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight, naturally light blonde hair and this product works great on those days when I don&#x27;t feel like washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I would keep spraying and still felt like it wasn&#x27;t doing much.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually much healthier.</li>
            <li> and I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li> It feels like dried glue to be honest.</li>
            <li> When you spray it on your hair make sure you hold the can far enough away from your head and rub</li>
            <li> love this dry shampoo!!</li>
            <li> , I get dry ends and oily oily scalp, my hair is also dark so the white shows up more than if my hair would be fair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos ranging from inexpensive to pricey and this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> I have tried every dry shampoo possible and this is the best hand down.</li>
            <li> and they have a ton of different scents, although I&#x27;ve always been fine with the classic scent.</li>
            <li> Takes the shine away but super powerful coming out and turns my brown hair grey color.</li>
            <li> have fairly oily hair and only like to wash it every other day.</li>
            <li> I really love my Batiste Dry Shampoo because it actually works when I have greasy hair, and it works quickly.</li>
            <li> Or if you love dry shampoo but are looking to switch to a new one....</li>
            <li> I love it and can&#x27;t wait to try its other products.</li>
            <li> I like being able to shampoo every other day and use Batiste in between.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not much of a complaint, just something I noticed!</li>
            <li> But I like other ones I have gotten better.</li>
            <li> I love washing my hair every other day...</li>
            <li> Smells great and freshens up hair at the roots without making  it stiff or flat.</li>
            <li> Favorite Dry Shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> I spent more time messing with it to make it look normal than just taking a shower and washing it.</li>
            <li> the hair does not have any effect to put the curls back to its clean curled shape.</li>
            <li> I spent more time messing with it to make it look normal than just taking a shower and washing it.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and fine but there is alot of it</li>
            <li> This is one of the few dry shampoos I have tried, but out of all of them I definitely like this one the best.</li>
            <li> This product Left my hair clean and flexible...</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be giving this dry shampoo a few more uses and maybe shake the bottle more, on the off</li>
            <li> Not only does it clean your hair</li>
            <li> It doesn’t clean well, doesn’t volumize, and only serves to deodorize the hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty useful ESPECIALLY if you use it before bedtime because that gives it time to set in.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good but have dark hair and it initially, makes my hair look gray, then dingy.</li>
            <li> I mean it has as much force as a hair dryer on high, but it is pretty easy to use, doesnt leave my brown hair looking gray, and it does look clean after a use.</li>
            <li> Based on the (largely) good reviews, I purchased Batiste Dry Shampoo for emergency touch ups to get the oily look out of my hair when I just have absolutely no time to wash and style it before I leave the house.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, my favorite dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have light brown hair and this stuff turned my hair grey.</li>
            <li> but, I found that it does disappear with a bristle brush better than a paddle brush if that helps some of you dark haired ones.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s 100x better than my dry shampoo from Herbal Essences which leaves my hair super dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the dreaded hot, oily scalp feeling when I go to bed at night, nor do I have the associated old scalp smell.</li>
            <li> Be sure you&#x27;re not wearing dark clothes when you use it</li>
            <li> It looks so natural and flowy and pretty and sooo</li>
            <li> I always make sure to, at the end, brush my hair down over my face to work it into the bangs</li>
            <li> The spray is very powerful, so you don&#x27;t need to keep spraying for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is vastly superior to any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> this one smelled great, but was just too hard to get all the white worked out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very greasy hair after a day, but this voodoo spray somehow fixes that completely, and I&#x27;m able to wash my hair every other day.  </li>
            <li> And I have to admit that I was very hesitant about trying something new.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different dry shampoo products and this is by far the best one out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different dry shampoos and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of spray dry shampoo &amp; always found that they either didn&#x27;t do a good job absorbing the oil, or stayed white no matter what I did to rub them in, often both.</li>
            <li> It absorbs oil very well, especially on the hair around the face and the scent is fresh, also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased about 4 more of these since first trying it this past summer.</li>
            <li> Now that I have found this product, I will keep it on hand for those quick fixes when short on time.</li>
            <li> It also smells decent.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Tigi dry shampoo ($15) and R &amp; Co Desert dry shampoo ($25) and the Batiste is better than both!</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel rough and stiff</li>
            <li> so I am happy with this dry shampoo for those lazy days, or days where I am in a rush.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the first dry shampoo to actually make me feel clean!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> so I have high hopes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This was the only dry shampoo that sounded good enough to try.  </li>
            <li> It smells a little &amp;#34;producty&amp;#34; but nothing overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does not mean you can skip a shower or two.</li>
            <li> but I was able to get it out with a little tosseling.</li>
            <li> Was a bit hesitant at first since I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews on the visible residue on dark/black hair, but it works just fine for</li>
            <li> Does not smell (I got the original version because I don&#x27;t like scented dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Batiste dry shampoo Original:</li>
            <li> The spray stream is pretty strong, so a few quick bursts go a long way.</li>
            <li> This works really well for 2 or 3 day old hair.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks, I am so glad I have it.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it gets used up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I run through about bottle a week, which is well worth the time it saves me from washing my hair daily, and the damage it prevents by spacing out washes as well.</li>
            <li> All of those ended up being flops that either left my hair greasy, or had an unbearable lingering powerful scent.</li>
            <li> Frustrating, because I was hopeful with all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> The good thing about this product is that it does seem to lift my hair (which is thin)</li>
            <li> Washing my hair every other day will be just fine and will help my colored hair retain its color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite of the different dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try to find another dry shampoo at the beginning of this year to cut back on washing my hair and fell in love with this brand.</li>
            <li> It left my hair super soft and silky</li>
            <li> I love dry shampoo, gives me that extra day, I used to use Redken,</li>
            <li> First time using dry shampoo, and it did exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll easily not have to wash and set more than 1-2x a week</li>
            <li> , my hair does NOT feel clean and fresh, but eh, whatever the object is for it to not look like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> The only trick is, if you have dark hair, really make sure you brush it out well</li>
            <li> I live in United States in ohio area.</li>
            <li> I live with my family</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> So this is my new solution.</li>
            <li> I’m posting this review and will update it whenever I have any new product comparison to add to help those folks who need comparative feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Hair becomes slightly thickened due to leftover powder so this may be good news for those of you who seek to add volume to your hair.</li>
            <li> Hair becomes slightly thickened due to leftover powder so this may be good news for those of you who seek to add volume to your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and it has that typical hair spray smell</li>
            <li> If I haven&#x27;t washed me hair in several days it is heavy and kind of oily.  </li>
            <li> Trying out some other dry shampoos to compare but so far this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> /&gt;My only issue (and the reason for docking a star) is that it is really pricey for how much use I get out of it.</li>
            <li> Only wish the bottle were more of a pump; it espressos a lot of product with minimal pressure and cfc&#x27;s I believe are not an issue here.</li>
            <li> : Cleans effectively without leaving much of a residue behind.</li>
            <li> : Cleans effectively without leaving much of a residue behind.</li>
            <li> However, because my hair is such a light color, I could see some white powder-like marks throughout my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li> many potentially worthless products until you get to the good one.</li>
            <li> Shows the powder very clearly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for busy moms.</li>
            <li> I have tried other dry shampoo brands in the past and this is by far the best one I have used so far.  </li>
            <li> You can buy this at ulta for 7.99, but for a dollar more I didn&#x27;t have to go to the mall and waste time, plus it was prime!</li>
            <li> I use it, pretty regularly, for up to three days.</li>
            <li> If you noticed there is still a bit of white powder left on the root of the hair, simply massage it a bit more and brush.</li>
            <li> But again, it doesn&#x27;t effect the functionality so you can get past the smell. :)</li>
            <li> 3) shake between short bursts as you apply so first, shake burst, shake, 4)</li>
            <li> and I definitely understand why so many people from other countries rave about it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it a few more times, but it may end up in the garbage like most of the other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried....</li>
            <li> it leaves kind of a weird texture on the hair, kind of sticky and stiff.</li>
            <li> One didn&#x27;t make my hair look clean and the other made my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> The dry shampoo worth buying.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tresemme Fresh Start dry shampoo</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tresemme Fresh Start dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I also do a quick fix on my hair in the morning by getting it slightly wet and re-drying it</li>
            <li> I can even wear it down on the 2nd day if I want, I have never been able to find anything else like it.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling exactly the same but absorbing all the oils.</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid climate so if i was in a dryer area it might last longer.</li>
            <li> It definitely does the job of making hair less greasy and more presentable.</li>
            <li> Finding cruelty free dry shampoo is a hassle in of itself, but finding one that actually works was a challenge that took me well over a year to find.</li>
            <li> Addicted to this stuff - gives my hair volume, freshness, covers roots and super cheap.</li>
            <li> I hate strong smells, so this one is good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student, and I have to say that this dry shampoo is a life saver for all-nighters when you don&#x27;t have time to shower right away.  </li>
            <li> This makes you feel a little more human.</li>
            <li> Better than other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> For me this is better than any other dry shampoo I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoo that works much better.</li>
            <li> I have tried other dry shampoos that do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this product really does leave your hair feeling and smelling clean  - even on day 3!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other dry shampoos over the years and this by far kicks all of their butts.</li>
            <li> (suave made me gag)&lt;br /&gt;but be careful to spray lightly because it does spray white.  </li>
            <li> and you have to really rub it in to get the white out,</li>
            <li> Wow I just got it</li>
            <li> As far as giving it a grayish cast...</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money buying this product.</li>
            <li> just go natural.</li>
            <li> At first there is a grey residue, but it goes away when it is massaged in.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair daily as my hair and skin are very oily, taking into consideration</li>
            <li> recently learned something really helpful:</li>
            <li> You really have to concentrate and not miss any spots, or else you&#x27;ll catch yourself in the mirror with a gray-brown patch later that day!</li>
            <li> But you gotta really massage it in after spraying or it looks white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never noticed a spray can being this loud before.</li>
            <li> you used too much or you didn’t apply it properly.</li>
            <li> I think he is just sensitive to the chemicals in the formula.</li>
            <li> But I have blonde hair and it is not as much of an issue for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably on my 10th can of it so far.</li>
            <li> but this stuff completely solves it.</li>
            <li> Butane is the most commonly misused volatile substance in the UK, and was the cause of 52% of &amp;#34;solvent related&amp;#34; deaths in 2000.[11]</li>
            <li> Good for when I was ill.</li>
            <li> It does leave white residue (so apply it BEFORE you get dressed!), but pretty much all dry shampoos will.</li>
            <li> I also think this product is reasonably priced compared to most of the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve purchased in the past (Sephora, Drybar, etc.)</li>
            <li> I wish the smell was slightly pleasing, but after it goes on your hair, it pretty much just smells of just your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not familiar with the original scent.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s ok, but there&#x27;s a lot of hype around this stuff.</li>
            <li> only con about this is it didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other dry shampoos, but for the price and considering how great it worked for me, I can deal with that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Item arrived right on time and was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> The Batiste Dry Shampoo does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> First time user of dry shampoo but</li>
            <li> Please note that this was my first dry shampoo</li>
            <li> This is my first time using dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, this dry shampoo really holds it together!</li>
            <li> This stuff left my hair completely soft and normal, but no stiff residue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff left my hair completely soft and normal, but no stiff residue at all.</li>
            <li> the white makes your natural vibrant color go away.)</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different dry shampoos at various price points, and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I found that the dry shampoo merely makes your hair stick together better (similar to hair spray) and makes your hair smell better.</li>
            <li> By spraying butane directly into the throat, the jet of fluid can cool rapidly to −20 °C by expansion, causing prolonged laryngospasm.[12] &amp;#34;Sudden sniffer&#x27;s death&amp;#34; syndrome, first described by Bass in 1970,[13] is the most common single cause of &amp;#34;solvent related&amp;#34; death, resulting in 55% of known fatal cases.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So many other dry shampoos smell like I dumped a bottle of bad perfume on my scalp, and this is a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Clean and dry - doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and the bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Works decently well, but definitely use before bed to allow it to work itself into your hair.  </li>
            <li> My only advice would be to cover your mouth and nose when you use it, aerosol tends to be a little strong.  </li>
            <li> Scent is also a little too sweet and overpowering for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t  really flake or dry out my scalp and puts even 2 and 3 day hair back to a normal feel!</li>
            <li> Shake it even between sprays or you might get a high concentration of white on your hair.</li>
            <li> have very dark brown hair and while it turns my hair white initially, it&#x27;s easy to get rid of it when you spread it around and comb it through.</li>
            <li> If that happens it usually brushes out pretty well but may remove a little more shine than you&#x27;d like from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Fresh Scent - works as well as dry shampoo&#x27;s double the price.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this and also that you can&#x27;t smell it later in the day like other dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other dry shampoos and always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Since getting the Batiste Dry Shampoo, my second day hair has been looking just as fresh as it would have had I taken a full shower and dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> With that said it DOES leave a powdery film on hair that you have to work through and if you used too much product it will leave a grey cast.  </li>
            <li> so if not careful in completely massaging it in, parts of my hair would appear lighter.</li>
            <li> Tried corn starch - yes, it absorbs oil very well, but it also adds a greyish hue to my hair dark hair, which can be &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; removed with a lot of brushing, but I don&#x27;t think it exactly makes me look younger.</li>
            <li> I usually bend my head over and then spray and just lightly brush.</li>
            <li> I like the powder based dry shampoos a little better, this one seemed harder to rub into hair and left more residual than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It goes on white, but once I brush her hair, it is fine even on her very dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of dry shampoo, but I hadn&#x27;t been able to find one that doesn&#x27;t build up and leave my hair stiff, until BATISTE.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it, but it just keeps turning my red hair lighter and dull.  </li>
            <li> After using it, my hair looked fluffy and not as flat, but on my medium brown hair, it left me looking more gray.  </li>
            <li> Now, I do live in a low humidity climate</li>
            <li> This is definitely going into the new &#x27;must have&#x27; for me.</li>
            <li> I started a new job with longer hours last year</li>
            <li> Seriously,  I was able to got out in public, run errands, complete a work-out without being concerned about the look, odor, or feel of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo REALLY works.  </li>
            <li> However the whole day I left white fingerprints all over everything.</li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY when I can put straight up cornstarch on my hair and achieve the same effect.</li>
            <li> This works really well, but it definitely leaves a white residue.  </li>
            <li> Also, I do a Brazilian Blowout 3 times a year to keep it long and strong and every wash removes a little of the treatment, so</li>
            <li> Mine is vivid red.</li>
            <li> For my naturally black hair I prefer the dark hair version more.</li>
            <li> It is better for my very dark hair than all the other drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this dry shampoo to anyone considering it!</li>
            <li> I tried bunch of other dry shampoo and didn&#x27;t get to feel as clean as using this product.</li>
            <li> I have black to blonde ombre hair which I can&#x27;t wash very often because of how much bleaching and dying it has gone through.</li>
            <li> The product works just fine, but the size was a little smaller than I had hoped and it only lasted me a couple months.  </li>
            <li> I previously used Blow Pro&#x27;s dry shampoo, but it wasn&#x27;t available on Prime, so I gave Batiste a try.</li>
            <li> so I only wash it with shampoo/conditioner 2-3x a week to keep the red vibrant.  </li>
            <li> when I skip a day I look a right mess.</li>
            <li> I recently went blonde and my hair is super dry and fragile.  </li>
            <li> I can spray this in my hair in the morning, go to work all day, go out for drinks after, not get home until late, and my hair still looks oil free.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a huge head of thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The white residue was clearly visible.</li>
            <li> Two of the four cans from this vendor were defective, and they only sprayed a clear liquid.</li>
            <li> I am platinum blonde naturally</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember the last time I wrote a review, but WOW</li>
            <li> I can barely go one day without washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by another reviewer&#x27;s comment about it being flammable as basic hairspray is flammable.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft after using it and not gritty like others have made it feel.  </li>
            <li> But i suggest you are careful and don&#x27;t use much if you have darker hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better (Not your mothers) but I have also used worse.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re tired of hearing about it):</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fresh and the powder isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  </li>
            <li> I ran to my local walgreens and grabbed this dry shampoo in hopes of looking a little more presentable in the short amount of time I had.</li>
            <li> Toxic smell and not great results with my hair (which is fine and straight and tends to get flat and greasy).  </li>
            <li> This leaves very little white residue when I spray it, and the white that does appear is easily worked in and disappears.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell (I abhorred the smell of the suave keratin dry shampoo), and while it&#x27;s a little strong going on it fades quickly enough to me.</li>
            <li> I bought a different one when I was testing out the whole dry shampoo thing</li>
            <li> I bought a different one when I was testing out the whole dry shampoo thing</li>
            <li> good dry shampoo just smells weird</li>
            <li> It looks slightly white-ish when you first spray it</li>
            <li> even then It still makes your hair look a little dull (kind of like your aging cause</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick heavy volume hair that gets oily at the roots pretty much the day after I wash it.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that when you spray it its super LOUD!</li>
            <li> for those trying it for the first time - don&#x27;t put the nozzle right at your hair or you&#x27;ll get a ton of white product that will be hard to brush away and will leave you looking like you have grey hair.</li>
            <li> Works great, just a little too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> With other products, no matter how much I spray, my daughter&#x27;s hair still looks greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily hair and have to wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I have used other dry shampoos with varying degrees of success.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as my first dry shampoo and had no problems using it as long as I sprayed, worked it in my roots with my fingers, then brushed or sprayed and went to bed.</li>
            <li> I would use it again for a day of just running errands, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a work day or before social engagements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive brands and not gotten near the results.</li>
            <li> It is not a dry shampoo, It is powder, doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> you can go a few days without shampooing in the shower which saves your hair from getting dried out, and it gives your hair more volume too.</li>
            <li> Also, if your hair is baby fine like mine, add a little to dry hair even if it’s clean and blow-dry upside down to maximize the volume!!!!</li>
            <li> When I use it it gets really white on my roots right after I spray it, but if I leave it for a few minutes or try to rub it in then it&#x27;ll go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can always add more, but you can’t take it out unless you have time to shower so try a little and do a second round if needed</li>
            <li> Suave is a close second though, even though I generally don&#x27;t care for their products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a darker blonde, but even at that -- this left a clearly visible white residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue.</li>
            <li> Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue.</li>
            <li> (read the first few ingredients if you want to cringe.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different dry shampoos, from high end to Dove at the grocery store to try and help my 10 year olds greasy 2nd day hair.  </li>
            <li> I notice it when I spray it, but within minutes there is no lingering smell, which I really really appreciate, as I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes and the smell of some of the other dry shampoos i&#x27;ve used really got to me after a few hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wish we could give half stars, because I would have given a 3.5.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth it to me to pick white flakes out of my hair the whole day after I use it.</li>
            <li> It goes on in a thin layer and then brushes easily through your hair.</li>
            <li> Besides, My hairs are permed/curled, the curls are usually gone the second day of washing, dry clean</li>
            <li> Upon first try, this spray has made my hair look grey, likely because my hair is dark.</li>
            <li> I never expected much from dry shampoos, the ones I tried were so so, and not worth the 20+ price.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, medium-dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> am very particular about smell and this one I can deal with everyday.  </li>
            <li> I tried spraying out a little and the whole bathroom started to fill up with a Lysol spray type of smell.  </li>
            <li> Every other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried without hurting my wallet wouldn&#x27;t help my bangs from looking greasy, which was the part I really wanted to fix.  </li>
            <li> but honestly it made my dark hair look dusty and almost grey.</li>
            <li> It took me only a few tries to get the technique right.  </li>
            <li> I usually end up splurging for Amika&#x27;s buckthorn dry shampoo, which is expensive but smells great and leaves no trace.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair, so like the rest of the shampoos I&#x27;ve tried in the past, it just leaves a lot of white in my hair even after brushing...and probably more so than some of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have super thick, long hair and this stuff works like a miracle.</li>
            <li> I ran out too quickly and it was hard to fix oversprays...switched to powder dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not only does it make my hair not look greasy, but it makes it look so full and thick!  </li>
            <li> My dark brown hair is baby fine and too delicate to wash every day</li>
            <li> I have fine, oily hair and in the past have had to wash almost everyday.</li>
            <li> It does have that usual white residue which I don&#x27;t really care about (I&#x27;m blonde)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others and they don&#x27;t last through the day or make my hair flat.</li>
            <li> :) The inexplicably high price makes it this a bad purchase for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :) The inexplicably high price makes it this a bad purchase for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that usually stays pretty clean if I wash it every other day, but I&#x27;ve been trying to make curls last the elusive third day...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no thick layer of gunk/thick texture like the other dry shampoos</li>
            <li> This definitely soaks up the oil and helps fluff up dull hair quickly.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have any problems with it looking ashy or gray on my hair as long as I spray from a reasonable distance and then take a few seconds to rub it in.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair and try to only wash it 2 or 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> It sprays white initially, but when you brush it through your hair a little, the white goes away and your hair looks grease-less (natural redhead).  </li>
            <li> I had previously tried other dry shampoos that left my hair chalky either the first or second day of use and once the residue was there, there was nothing to be done about it.  </li>
            <li> I doubt any other dry shampoo will live up to this.</li>
            <li> Others leave my hair feeling coarse, but this keeps my hair soft while also keeping down the oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive dry shampoos and didn&#x27;t like any of them</li>
            <li> I will try a different dry shampoo next time.</li>
            <li> I wash and blow dry my hair every 2nd to 3rd day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of dry shampoo, none hold a candle to this brand.</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair, but it is less oily now that I only wash every other day.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, buy this right now.  </li>
            <li> OR FOR THOSE WHO TAKE CARE OF THEIR HAIR TO MUCH AND DONT WASH IT TOO OFTEN, OR FOR LAZY PPL</li>
            <li> (I also have no problems using a flat iron after I&#x27;ve worked it into my hair).</li>
            <li> a can doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I used to use it a lot went back when I had long hair.</li>
            <li> Especially if you are trying to grow your hair long.  </li>
            <li> I got this for a long international trip, to help keep my hair from looking too greasy.</li>
            <li> I normally have oily hair and have to wash it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other dry shampoos besides this one and so far, this one&#x27;s still the winner.</li>
            <li> My only very minor issue with it is the smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried every dry shampoo out on the market as I was only allowed to shower periodically.</li>
            <li> I bought this dry shampoo last month, and now I swear by it.</li>
            <li> It comes out feeling dry which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> I will go back to buying my dry shampoo at Walgreens or Target.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair look white and dry.</li>
            <li> Expect to feel like you have dry shampoo in your hair, not that you&#x27;ve recently actually washed.</li>
            <li> but the next day when I use this dry shampoo I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Not only is it a dry shampoo, it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;a styling product, too.  </li>
            <li> This is the 2nd dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful to this shampoo for the instant makeover it did and for its emergency value, but I am on the market for organic dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> With this dry shampoo I can get an extra day out of  wash if needed.</li>
            <li> It is the only dry shampoo I will use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this dry shampoo only twice.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple dry shampoos and none of them compare to Batiste.</li>
            <li> Smell is not awesome, but not as strong as others.</li>
            <li> It takes me a long time to wash and dry hair, and when you&#x27;re busy/sleep deprived, an extra 10-15 minutes makes all the difference in the world.</li>
            <li> I causes my scalp to be overtly dry, and it doesn&#x27;t last for long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to another dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I was a little taken aback at first when it went on so gray, but after a little rubbing it looked like we had just washed it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn’t clean extremely well and thickens the hair due to the powdery deposit that’s hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Doesn’t clean extremely well and thickens the hair due to the powdery deposit that’s hard to remove.</li>
            <li> What I really like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel hard</li>
            <li> My hair was notably oily and definitely dirty.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for dirty hair days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the expensive stuff, the cheap stuff, and everything in between.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark in color, and this sprays white, but if you comb it through well enough</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> however minor.  </li>
            <li> and I will update with how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Let me say I have long hair.</li>
            <li> I can leave a minimal powder residue but being blonde, it hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me.</li>
            <li> The freshness faded in a few hours though and I needed to reapply frequently throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Elsewise, it did wonders to my hair, I had to use a wet brush to comb the white out</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product, once I did not wash my hair for a week, but it is completely not oily or dirty, after you spray them in the hair and massage for 30 sec, hairs will be fluffy and smell good.</li>
            <li> even my mom did not notice I did not wash my hair for a long time...</li>
            <li> I have long, oily hair that I have to wash every night.</li>
            <li> How have I gone this long without this stuff?</li>
            <li> , drowsiness, narcosis, asphyxia, cardiac arrhythmia, fluctuations in blood pressure, temporary memory loss and frostbite, which can result in death from asphyxiation and ventricular fibrillation.</li>
            <li> Additionally, her hair is quite thick, so it can be a real problem.  </li>
            <li> Leaves far less white residue than other dry shampoos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spray it on my roots the same way I used to do my previous ones and it leaves white powdery color on my hair with a sticky feeling, and my hair is as oily as before, It is not working</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that my hair is a bit flat, but it&#x27;s better than having to wash it every night.</li>
            <li> I also treated my ends and touched them up with a low heat flat iron prior to treatment, then blow dried</li>
            <li> (I think I&#x27;ve already used half in the last couple months), and I might consider getting one of their tinted versions for the benefit of my naturally jet black hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> And it is ok with the &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; it still feels somewhat dirty though, it looks good but feel dirty and somewhat dull.</li>
            <li> Nice and light and powdery vs the awful tresseme wet and heavy feel.  </li>
            <li> The other day I was in a hurry and did not have time to wash a dry my long hair, so I pulled it back in a twist and used this on my bangs.  </li>
            <li> I originally though this product would stiffen the hair, but i was wrong</li>
            <li> but if you work it into your roots and scrub it in like you do with regular shampoo, only not in the shower, and give it a little bit of time to absorb, it works miracles.</li>
            <li> I try to only wash my hair every other day, and I use this in the off days.</li>
            <li> With this product I only have to wash my hair every other day now.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple other dry shampoos costing upwards of $30, NONE of them work like Batiste.</li>
            <li> I have used other dry shampoo&#x27;s, this is the only one I will use now.</li>
            <li> only other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used is L&#x27;oreal - and that smells nicer, but this does the job.</li>
            <li> It sprays on powdery white and you work it through but hair still looks greasy, I&#x27;ve tried two other brands of dry shampoo</li>
            <li> (Granted my hair is very long</li>
            <li> My hair look just, so gray/dusty/unpolished after using this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> It seems to increase the volume of my hairs but the hairs look extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I use this Batiste dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like this dry shampoo...</li>
            <li> It is nicer than Suave dry shampoo...</li>
            <li> I used the dry shampoo on morning of day 3.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> my favourite dry shampoo</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my biggest thing for dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The Dove brand smell stayed in my hair and I felt like people could tell by smelling me that I had used a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It is all I could hope for in a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have not had one proble with this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like you put some hair spray on.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I don&#x27;t have time to shower, blow dry my hair and then iron it, so I just use this dry shampoo when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> The texture also felt really dry.</li>
            <li> Although your hair stays in place, it made my hair feel dry</li>
            <li> Someone said I should try dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> So this dry shampoo works.</li>
            <li> I like this dry shampoo</li>
            <li> You can find DIY dry shampoos by Googling.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> Batiste Dry Shampoo fills the bill.</li>
            <li> Considering I&#x27;ve never used a dry shampoo before.  </li>
            <li> My roots get oily, but the rest of my hair remains dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Then my friend told me she uses dry</li>
            <li> I did not care for this dry shampoo at all.</li>
            <li> And with Batiste Dry Shampoo, I can.</li>
            <li> I swore off dry shampoos years ago after trying products that my friends suggested to me (suave, dove, tresemme).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, if you aren&#x27;t a believer in dry shampoos yet, then try this and you will immediately change your mind.</li>
            <li> Maybe its just unavoidable with dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll pay for the shipping of the Blow Pro dry shampoo from now on--</li>
            <li> I will never buy another dry shampoo brand again.</li>
            <li> I used to rub baby powder into my hair as a dry shampoo, but I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Have tried probably every dry shampoo out there.</li>
            <li> If I have to rush to work, this dry shampoo saves my day.</li>
            <li> the brunette version will stain your hands brown if you try to rub the dry shampoo into the roots.  </li>
            <li> I had never used a dry shampoo before and this product has changed my life.</li>
            <li> Buying a dry shampoo can be a daunting task since it requires your going out and buying (and buying and buying and buying…)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Batiste dry shampoo Cherry:</li>
            <li> Volume Extend dry shampoo:</li>
            <li> Bed Head Matte dry shampoo</li>
            <li> Though, if you have wavy hair like me, you may not appreciate having to brush your dry, powdery roots.</li>
            <li> Bed Head Matte dry shampoo</li>
            <li> Though, if you have wavy hair like me, you may not appreciate having to brush your dry, powdery roots.</li>
            <li> I needed a dry shampoo and reviews and price lead me to this one.</li>
            <li> have really THICK and super oily dark dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> and it did not live up to others&#x27; praises for me.</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde, highlighted hair and haven&#x27;t had any problems with the white residue that other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of it, but I one day I told myself, this is probably not a good idea, as my hair resembles a dry wheat field.</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde to brown hair</li>
            <li> I also bought the dark and deep brown too.</li>
            <li> Turns your hair white or gray if you have dark hair.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and this didn&#x27;t leave a noticeable white residue when I applied it the night before (gives it time to absorb).</li>
            <li> If you have dark hair it leaves no white residue at all!</li>
            <li> It leave a white residue on dark clothes sometimes.</li>
            <li> Seriously, not sure how I have gone through life so far without this product.</li>
            <li> Does not leave white residue in my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I use it the 3rd day after washing on my roots to cut oil down</li>
            <li> It does the trick and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling weighted down or gross.</li>
            <li> my head upside down on low heat after treatment,</li>
            <li> However, the scent is a bit chemically strong and it left my dark auburn hair a bit dull and dusty looking.</li>
            <li> Recommend this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> My favourite dry shampoo!  </li>
            <li> This leaves a slight white cast.</li>
            <li> The Redkin dry shampoo in the pink bottle doesn&#x27;t work at all with my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used others in the past that we way more expensive</li>
            <li> I am a black female.  </li>
            <li> I am not really into the dry shampoo thing, but when I need to, I use this one.</li>
            <li> it does leave my dark hair gray for few minutes, no matter how far I spray it.</li>
            <li> On the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair, it is slightly greasy looking, especially my bangs.</li>
            <li> I have black hair, and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with white cast.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with almost black hair; it makes my hair white when I spray it on, but just rub your fingers through your hair like you&#x27;re showering</li>
            <li> this is noticeable especially because i have nearly black</li>
            <li> I could not live without this dry shampoo!!  </li>
            <li> My hair is very dark brown and the dry shampoo gave me white residue</li>
            <li> I have light-colored, thin hair and my friend has dark brown, thick hair, and both of us use and love this product (the &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; look goes away when you brush it</li>
            <li> only used the dry shampoo a few times and nobody.</li>
            <li> Rather than leaving white powder, it fades the color of my hair a little bit when I put it in&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shook the bottle well and held it at the distance the instructions suggested, massaged and brushed my hair however my hair still appeared a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Leaves a little dustiness in my blonde hair but it shakes out after you brush it a bit.</li>
            <li> This little bottle definitely takes the cake!</li>
            <li> Even after following the directions it still leaves my hair looking a little lighter.</li>
            <li> A great product and no doubt the least expensive place to purchase!!  </li>
            <li> I have been buying my dry shampoos in Walmart, like Pantene or other brands...</li>
            <li> I have not tried other dry shampoo, so perhaps this is just the way they are.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spray too close to head like any other dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave a buildup like some other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have tried other dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I have black hair and haven&#x27;t noticed any white flakes or anything that I&#x27;ve seen people complain about when trying to use dry shampoo with dark hair.  </li>
            <li> Comparing to all the other dry shampoo&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look and feel cleaner, dries up the oil, and adds unexpected volume (which is hard for my hair to achieve).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to use, and makes you feel less disgusting until you can actually shower.</li>
            <li> No white residue (even on her very dark hair)</li>
            <li> We had one of those late night drinking nights where we had to wake up and go out early.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike some of the others I&#x27;ve tried, I don&#x27;t have to be terribly careful with the usage either.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> and this is the only product I can use that doesn&#x27;t make it feel heavy</li>
            <li> Really no smell...</li>
            <li> It might make dark hair look like it has grey roots, but that goes away if you rub it in.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use this product for &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34; in between hair washes, but it only works well for a few hours, and by the time I get home from school/work my hair already looks greasy again.</li>
            <li> Those never really took the greasy look out of my roots.</li>
            <li> well, like she you use  wet shampoo.</li>
            <li> Also, this goes on wet</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair, and yes it sprays on grey but comb your hair and its gone.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair a bit grey if you have dark hair</li>
            <li> Bottle lasts longer than expected.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s looking a little flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> It is the only one that does not make my hair waxy or stiff feeling.</li>
            <li> I see the reviews about the &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s what all dry shampoo has always been like for me since I have dark brown hair-</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily hair that needs to be washed at least every other day, so this product wasn&#x27;t as beneficial for me.</li>
            <li> not sure if there is such a thing as a moisturizing dry shampoo, but I will find it if there is!</li>
            <li> this is a third of the price (I actually bought my second can through Drugstore.com as it was several dollars less expensive) and works just as well.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down my favourite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair the next day but by the next day my hair feels heavy and goopy although it doesn&#x27;t look it.  </li>
            <li> so my hair was fairly dry and had an odd texture.</li>
            <li> Other dry shampoos left my hair very stiff and almost nastier than it started out.</li>
            <li> but I find that it turns my hair a little grey looking sometimes.</li>
            <li> I was recently shocked to discover that the dry shampoo I had been using forever was no longer available.</li>
            <li> I have been on total bedrest for the past 24 months.</li>
            <li> I have used tons of other brands and nothing even comes close to the Batiste.</li>
            <li> I would recommend looking at what is in the product before making this purchase, it is extremely flammable.</li>
            <li> and it usually keeps my hair well into the third day before I wash it again!</li>
            <li> I can now go every other with washing my hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I tried other brands but they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands, but never like how they feel.</li>
            <li> I usually do 4 sections, then once on the underside of the back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other brands and this one is towards the bottom.</li>
            <li> I have only gone a handful of times in the past year without washing my hair at night.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> Adds volumes AND comes in other colors.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day</li>
            <li> but I prefer other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other scents by this brand also</li>
            <li> The other brands give a visible difference that you just sprayed product into your hair.</li>
            <li> I understand and somewhat agree with other criticisms about the residue.</li>
            <li> It ran out rather quickly due to that issue..  </li>
            <li> When I know I&#x27;m going to have an active day</li>
            <li> I spray it and let it dry a few minutes then use my fingers to rub it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t overly oily but tends to separate when dirty (especially at the crown)and is very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a dry shampoo for months that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy and gunky.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, which may be something I did wrong during application, is that there was one time where I got a slight residue right after applying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: My hair is dark, thick, extremely long, and wavy with oily roots and dry ends.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and it left my hair with a dull whitish appearance.  </li>
            <li> Ordered from Amazon because I&#x27;m having a hard time finding it in the local stores.</li>
            <li> Just hard to find at my local drugstores.</li>
            <li> I have dark auburn hair</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> I have dark hair and this does not leave any visible residue.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown with highlights and either product does its job.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown/reddish hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I lived so long without it.</li>
            <li> Use the night before if you have dark hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the chemical &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> Average.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR DARK HAIR.</li>
            <li> If you have dark hair, do NOT get this one but get the colored one.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the one for dark hair because the reviews say that it stains a lot and, knowing myself</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll stick with &amp;#34;fresh.&amp;#34; If you follow the directions and spray at least 6 inches from your head (and shake it a lot, constantly), it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my dark hair look gray, the scent is not overpowering (can even be used by a guy).</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and did notice that there was a grayish residue but that cleared up after rubbing it into the hair.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair</li>
            <li> Usually, that&#x27;s not an issue for me, but sometimes when I&#x27;m running late, I find that there are sections of my hair that aren&#x27;t quite my natural hair color.</li>
            <li> I have none of the issues with white residue or stickiness from this product, but again I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick (male) shoulder-length hair that gets oily after a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I can wear my hair up or down after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I could wear it down without having to worry about greasy hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair also doesn&#x27;t feel like its being weighed down by product at all, which I love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For LAZY GIRLS who have LONG HAIR in WINTER!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents!</li>
            <li> have brown hair, but not super dark.  </li>
            <li> I have since switched the Batiste&#x27;s dry shampoo for brunettes as I have almost-black hair and the white dry shampoo unfortunately accentuates my gray</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used Oscar Blondi&#x27;s dry shampoo and a few other brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also about half the price of the ones I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li> Black pants</li>
            <li> I have black hair.</li>
            <li> Almost black .</li>
            <li> It also had less body than after washing &amp; blow drying.</li>
            <li> and it being slightly</li>
            <li> it keeps my hair less oily</li>
            <li> I was having a crazy busy day yesterday and was invited out by friends at the last minute.</li>
            <li> I am attempting to wash my hair less.  </li>
            <li> That is not a completely unusual effect, but it was worse than some of the other dry shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde with short hair that is very thin and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Full of chemicals and smelled really, really bad.  </li>
            <li> However, the packaging on this was really dirty and the bottle looked pretty beaten up when I received it.</li>
            <li> Both times it made a mess.  </li>
            <li> Many either make my hair stiff, smell horrible, or only work for a half hour or so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously saved many of my days from a bad hair day-</li>
            <li> and i let her in on my little secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I applied it onto my greasy roots and my hair looked cleaner but was still a little oily at the ends.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s little powdery.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll look a little gray.</li>
            <li> But I did a little research and found this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> I usually just lift up sections of my hair and spray the dry shampoo underneath those sections, wait about a minute, and then massage my head with my fingers before proceeding to brush out my hair as usual.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Never weighs my hair down!</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair</li>
            <li> Very dark.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recoomend with very dark hair</li>
            <li> I shower every other day and it helped with my oily hair!!</li>
            <li> After a bad color at the salon, my hair is completely damaged and can only be washed 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> use it in a real emergency dirty hair day</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to rinse and repeat, I don&#x27;t have buildup left behind, It just washes out like nothing, not effecting the lather of my shampoo at all.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I would go thru cans in just few uses....</li>
            <li> It works fantastically without leaving a film or your hair heavy.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy when i spray it on...</li>
            <li> I can reapply this again and again and not wash my hair for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes my hair can get a tad oily after a few days.  </li>
            <li> I have blond, thin hair that becomes greasy after only one day :</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone up to 5 days without washing my hair and a few spritz of Batiste and my hair</li>
            <li> Leaves behind quite a bit of white powdery streaks that can be eliminated by thorough brushing.</li>
            <li> Leaves behind quite a bit of white powdery streaks that can be eliminated by thorough brushing.</li>
            <li> and I think it went away after a few hours.</li>
            <li> But once you let it sit for a few minutes and then rub it in like you are washing your hair, it absorbs.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal-</li>
            <li> I had heard some  negative things about dry shampoo, but this product exceeded all of my expectations!!</li>
            <li> I have very thick somewhat frizzy hair, so a few spritzes is all it takes to get some bounce and volume when it&#x27;s gone flat from being unwashed.</li>
            <li> But with almost a foot and a half of thick, dark brown hair, I need it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, smell too perfumey, or leave behind a residue (or dry out my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spray it from slightly farther away and do small amounts at a time</li>
            <li> If I spray this stuff on at night before bed, I wake up with soft, fluffy, shampoo commercial hair instead of my usual greasy roots and bad attitude.</li>
            <li> The other complaint is that it smells like a grandmother&#x27;s house...</li>
            <li> I have oily hair that I need to wash at least every other day.</li>
            <li> Some made my hair sticky, some made my hair stiff, some just didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> I followed the advice and may try again, but i am not a fan of the texture and how stiff it is after i use it.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no strong scent that comes along with the product either.</li>
            <li> The smell is alright, so if that&#x27;s your concern, hold your breath for a few seconds and it goes away, but unfortunately there was barely any difference.</li>
            <li> I’m not easy to impress</li>
            <li> For $10 a can, I feel like that&#x27;s pretty bad,</li>
            <li> , I happened to glance at the ingredients and was shocked to see that the first three ingredients were butane, isobutane, and propane.  </li>
            <li> But a little brush through helps with that!</li>
            <li> Bought this to use when my unwashed hair gets a little greasy/flat on Day 2 (or Day 3 - don&#x27;t judge!)</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that if you use and then your hair gets wet, your hair is very hard and... Dusty?</li>
            <li> But when you have a long hair, you have to wash them at least twice or three times a week, especially mine, otherwise they will be oily and really dirty</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little expensive for how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I usually need to reapply midway through the day</li>
            <li> Not sure why it is a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it again if I have to, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to use nearly as much as usual</li>
            <li> I was in the hospital and had a friend spray it into my hair and then brush through small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> Not exactly sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Then, style as you usually would.</li>
            <li> my mom made me stay long hair, and it is really not convince for take a shower or washing them during winter, since during Dec will be really cold and freeze</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the hoopla is about.</li>
            <li> Just spray in and style as usual.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a fake blonde</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it works well with this type of hair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why is so expensive when I can get same thing</li>
            <li> Left grey residue on my roots :(</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and have not had this problem with dry shampoo was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have to wash every day, but I want to find a way to slowly extend the time between washes because I know it&#x27;s not healthy to wash it every day.</li>
            <li> However, when my hubby brought this home from the grocery store for me (upon my request--no, he doesn&#x27;t hate me ;) )</li>
            <li> Another tip: a little goes a long way...don&#x27;t go too crazy spraying it.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical when ordering my first dry shampoo, but since it wasn&#x27;t very expensive, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel that weird feeling after some dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> Even after I work it into my hair it leaves it looking dull.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to explain.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair that gets oily unless I wash it every single day.</li>
            <li> And honestly, no one can tell.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel icky all day when I use it if I haven&#x27;t washed my hair.</li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend used it--and he also has thick hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like white powder and smell bad like some others from the past.</li>
            <li> This brand doesn&#x27;t leave white residue in your hair which is annoying to get out when you have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos and hated them all.  </li>
            <li> but it does leave a small amount of residual behind.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am addicted to this stuff and even keep a small one in my purse.</li>
            <li> , they may be used because they&#x27;re &amp;#34;propellants&amp;#34;, but, seriously, check out what Wikipedia says about butane, as of the time of this posting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously....</li>
            <li> Hair becomes hard and tough to style.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product.  </li>
            <li> My hairstylists are always so amazed (and frustrated) by how thick my hair is, but I have had no problems with this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> i have used other dry shampoos and i hated them.</li>
            <li> the aerosol odor - being surrounded by a puff of chemical is never pleasant.</li>
            <li> the aerosol odor - being surrounded by a puff of chemical is never pleasant.</li>
            <li> She is not able to wash her hair as often as would  like during the week and beauty shop is too expensive, so she rally likes this.</li>
            <li> I have no reason to share this with you other than I drank too much wine and my husband is being really annoying by watching this stupid hockey game into overtime.</li>
            <li> As in the title, I feel like I can still tough my hair.</li>
            <li> After I used it, the second day my hair will very dirty</li>
            <li> Just try it - you&#x27;ll see what I mean!</li>
            <li> and i still that &amp;#34;just washed&amp;#34;  look after not washing my hair for a few days!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried other dry shampoos and hated them!</li>
            <li> I put it on at night and was hoping that the &#x27;dusty&#x27; looking would go away.</li>
            <li> After I found that I kept trying to find something else that worked so well and didn&#x27;t leave the fingerprints behind.</li>
            <li> seem to leave behind.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken.</li>
            <li> and it was even worse.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown, thin hair.</li>
            <li> (so you don&#x27;t get that one greasy-looking piece of hair that you have to tuck behind your ear).</li>
            <li> Game changer.</li>
            <li> you have thin hair, the colored versions help hide bald spots.</li>
            <li> White crap everywhere.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t add a weird texture or tint to my hair and sucks up oil like a pro.</li>
            <li> but I hate the stuff left behind.</li>
            <li> It helped me feel less disgusting amidst an already long journey!</li>
            <li> I previously bought the not your mothers and it was horrible, and then I bought the herbal essences dry shampoo</li>
            <li> It is for blonds , does not smell bad like other brands, gives your hair volume and eliminate 2-3 washes a week.</li>
            <li> Seriously it makes my hair look like I just got out of the shower/dried it!</li>
            <li> Basically all dry shampoos are worthless to me.</li>
            <li> did my research and learned the techniques for applying the product 1) Shake it hard!! 2)</li>
            <li> I mean it gets so oily and dirty within 12 hours of washing .</li>
            <li> when it comes to that, it has a scent, but nothing bad and its not strong.</li>
            <li> and I seriously can&#x27;t use this in the morning because I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll wake them</li>
            <li> I also hated the smell of other dry shampoos but this one is very faint and makes my hair not smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever leave bad reviews...</li>
            <li> I have tried all the expensive ones from Sephora.  </li>
            <li> Whatever, they weren&#x27;t wrong.</li>
            <li> I am one of those unfortunate souls plagued by greasy hair and before I discovered Batiste I would try to hide it in a pony tail.  </li>
            <li> Smells weird and works</li>
            <li> Unable to try out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Which was difficult to brush and blend into my hair.</li>
            <li> but oh so expensive.....</li>
            <li> It works but it smells weird.</li>
            <li> so maybe I&#x27;m just using it wrong.</li>
            <li> and i have blown thru tons of products that fail to meet expectations.</li>
            <li> When I had surgery and was unable to wash my hair for 12 days, I was hoping this would help.  </li>
            <li> and it does not feel weird like some of the drugstore brands I tried.</li>
            <li> The unfortunate consequence of this “dumping” however, thickens and volumizes the hair to a point where it hurts to comb fingers through.</li>
            <li> Since everyone else loves it maybe I am doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> Body &amp; volume like crazy, no greasy spots.</li>
            <li> Crazy, I know.  </li>
            <li> It soaked up some of the oil but not a lot which was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> always to my disappointment.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it just doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical but it works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Gets all over your clothes, and is very difficult to get out of your hair.  </li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad</li>
            <li> Smell is not too bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> A cowlick lifesaver on bad days.</li>
            <li> Bad hair day &#x3D; bad day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was seriously disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Once you manage your expectations I think you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate washing my hair and with this, I can go 3 days without washing.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s basically worthless to me.</li>
            <li> , I hate when you get out the shower and just... freeze in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I tried the Blush Floral &amp; Flirty scented version of this, but absolutely hated the smell</li>
            <li> Want to know the worst part?</li>
            <li> Awful</li>
            <li> I hate the feeling of unwashed hair!!</li>
            <li> it smells awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought it for friend. She didn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad</li>
            <li> My hair look just, so gray/dusty/unpolished after using this dry shampoo. I put it on at night and was hoping that the &#x27;dusty&#x27; looking would go away. Sadly, it just doesn&#x27;t! I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Clean and dry - doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and the bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li> works pretty well, but run out fast, would be nicer if it&#x27;s pretty cheap</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo ever, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have tried Suave and Dove dry shampoos and this one is far better and worth the higher price. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like straw and it works! It also smells clean and fresh, a welcome change. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  It actually works--and was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> The spray is very powerful and goes straight to your roots. Very convenient when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo my wife has ever had, hands down. She&#x27;s tried at least half a dozen different ones, and the Batiste smells the best and works the best, period.</li>
            <li> Love how this product takes away the oil, but I have brown hair and this type leaves white in and you have to really rub it in to get the white out, even then It still makes your hair look a little dull (kind of like your aging cause the white makes your natural vibrant color go away.)</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  Others leave my hair feeling coarse, but this keeps my hair soft while also keeping down the oil.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. I have been on total bedrest for the past 24 months. I have tried every dry shampoo out on the market as I was only allowed to shower periodically. This stuff is the best on the market. It really gets the excess oil out of your hair. Just make sure to follow directions, and you will get good result.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I normally have oily hair and have to wash it everyday. To test this out I went a whole week without washing my hair and using this instead, Just awesome! My hair felt and looked like I had just washed it, even at the end of the week. Though make sure to hold your breath after spraying as it can be a bit asphyxiating for a couple of seconds. Plus don&#x27;t spray it wearing your good clothes, as a slight powdery residue will form.</li>
            <li> Works great. Gets the shine out of my hair. Smells good.</li>
            <li> First dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever liked.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter has had a lot of problems with her hair getting oily almost immediately after washing.  Additionally, her hair is quite thick, so it can be a real problem.  This is, by far, the best of the dry shampoos she has tried.  No white residue (even on her very dark hair) and it doesn&#x27;t build up.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> It is not a dry shampoo, It is powder, doesn&#x27;t work at all. I spray it on my roots the same way I used to do my previous ones and it leaves white powdery color on my hair with a sticky feeling, and my hair is as oily as before, It is not working</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blown away by this product!  I was very skeptical but it works as advertised.  I will be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li> smell not so good, but is OK. looks good after use, but feels need to be wash the hair still</li>
            <li> Got this for my mother - 89 yrs. She is not able to wash her hair as often as would  like during the week and beauty shop is too expensive, so she rally likes this.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best dry shampoo, for real! I bought a different one when I was testing out the whole dry shampoo thing - it left my hair like wire, I couldn&#x27;t even use it that much bc I spent more time messing with it to make it look normal than just taking a shower and washing it. This stuff left my hair completely soft and normal, but no stiff residue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell on both of them was not that great, it&#x27;s really the aerosol odor - being surrounded by a puff of chemical is never pleasant. I wish the can was larger for the price, but I got maybe 10 or so good uses out of it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different dry shampoo products and this is by far the best one out there. It&#x27;s also about half the price of the ones I&#x27;ve tried... Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best dry shampoo on the market without a doubt! I have used tons of other brands and nothing even comes close to the Batiste. I have pretty thick hair and try to only wash it 2 or 3 times a week. With this product, I can easily get away 3 days between hair washes! It gives me extra volume and removes the oily look even using it 2 days in a row. Also, the Original Clean doesn&#x27;t leave a distinctive smell or anything. It&#x27;s just fresh smelling but not over powering. Now, I do live in a low humidity climate so I know that is a factor as well but it&#x27;s still an amazing product. I keep multiple cans on hand so I am never out.</li>
            <li> My hair is superrrr oily . I mean it gets so oily and dirty within 12 hours of washing . This does so a good job soaking up pil when you put it on . But for me it lasts maybe a couple hours . Then it starts getting greasy again . Overall it&#x27;s a good buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hunting for the perfect dry shampoo for a very long time now. I&#x27;ve tried an easy half dozen, more I&#x27;m sure. To date this is by far my favorite. I had found one other that I loved, my hair felt great, looked reat, and it lasted all day -- However the whole day I left white fingerprints all over everything. Black pants anyone? No. After I found that I kept trying to find something else that worked so well and didn&#x27;t leave the fingerprints behind. Some made my hair sticky, some made my hair stiff, some just didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. This Batiste is perfect. It does all of the things you would want, your hair looks as if you&#x27;ve washed it that morning. Your hair still FEELS like hair, it&#x27;s very touchable. I have dark auburn hair and you can&#x27;t see any residue in my hair at all. There&#x27;s no strong scent that comes along with the product either. I can spray this in my hair in the morning, go to work all day, go out for drinks after, not get home until late, and my hair still looks oil free. Also, unlike some of the others I&#x27;ve tried, I don&#x27;t have to be terribly careful with the usage either. If I accidentally spray too much, meh, that&#x27;s ok.; It&#x27;s always worked into my hair just fine. I spray it in all the roots and all over the top of my head lightly, then go about my business getting ready. after some time I rub my scalp with my fingers, then leave it alone again. Sometimes 2 minutes go by, sometimes 10, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. Then after some more time passes I rub it into my scalp with my fingers again. then right before I get dressed I run a brush through my hair. Perfect results every time. The best part is, I can use it several days in a row (3 to 4 with no problems) and it works great day after day with no washing in between. (I also have no problems using a flat iron after I&#x27;ve worked it into my hair). When I do wash my hair, it washes out with no problems. I don&#x27;t have to rinse and repeat, I don&#x27;t have buildup left behind, It just washes out like nothing, not effecting the lather of my shampoo at all.&lt;br /&gt;All around great product that I would recommend to anyone with a more oily scalping, not effecting the lather of my shampoo at all.&lt;br /&gt;All around great product that I would recommend to anyone with a more oily scalp</li>
            <li> For my naturally black hair I prefer the dark hair version more. This leaves a slight white cast. Love the refreshing original scent and keeps my hair less greasy looking for hours. I can go 2-3 days without washing.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of dry shampoos and this is the best I have found. It is affordable, smells great, and keeps me from having to shampoo my hair every day. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Just as described, thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product! Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> The product leaves a while residue in your hair that does not go away when you work it into hair. I have blonde hair and have not had this problem with dry shampoo was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I shower every other day and it helped with my oily hair!! Smells good too!</li>
            <li> Great product but not that good when you have dark hair, put it on my roots and was like spraying baby powder on it!!! Works better in light hair.</li>
            <li> I love Batiste dry shampoos. However, the packaging on this was really dirty and the bottle looked pretty beaten up when I received it.</li>
            <li> Love Baliste dry shampoo! By far my favorite I&#x27;ve tried. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel rough and stiff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos and I have to say this is the best, by far.  Better than some of the store brands.  Would definitely get it again and would recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li> Good product. It gives my hair a refreshing look and scent. I have black hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue on my hair. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite dry shampoo. Yes, it sprays on white but you have to hold the can at a distance. After, that you have to ruffle your hair around a bit and its gone. I have med/light brown hair.</li>
            <li> i have used other dry shampoos and i hated them. They didn&#x27;t work and even made my hair look and feel more greasy.  THIS PRODUCT WORKS!!! I will continue buying this product.</li>
            <li> Great smell and it works perfectly.  I like this product better than some of the other brands out there, and we&#x27;ve tried many.  Works best if you spray on the night before.</li>
            <li> It seems to increase the volume of my hairs but the hairs look extremely dry. Besides, My hairs are permed/curled, the curls are usually gone the second day of washing, dry clean the hair does not have any effect to put the curls back to its clean curled shape.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  On &amp;#34;wash my hair day&amp;#34; if I want to go somewhere I use this Batiste dry shampoo. Gives me a clean hair look in a jiffy. Really works. Y&#x27;all should try it. I always spray it outside.....the neighbors probably think I am nuts...who cares!!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo there is. Except, it&#x27;s cheaper at any big box store than on here.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical when ordering my first dry shampoo, but since it wasn&#x27;t very expensive, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Now that I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks, I am so glad I have it. I hate washing my hair and with this, I can go 3 days without washing. It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;fresh washed&amp;#34; hair on day 3 using this product, but it still looks and feels clean. I have dark blonde, highlighted hair and haven&#x27;t had any problems with the white residue that other reviewers have mentioned. Would highly recommend it- especially for the price. :)</li>
            <li> I thought this will work perfectly but not as good as I expected. However, it works. After I used it, the second day my hair will very dirty and it seems like my hair damaged.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered it in a tint color... I have dark blonde to brown hair</li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos and hated them all.  But I had a $10 gift card from a survey I did, so I thought &amp;#34;Oh, I will give it a try.. People seem to love it.&amp;#34; And now I know why - this stuff is awesome.  I have super fine, super blonde hair that gets greasy if you look at it too long, and this stuff is like magic.  I used it this morning (after washing my hair yesterday morning), then I traveled across the country (through three airports and two planes) and after 12+ hours traveling, my hair looks great.  Seriously, best purchase ever.</li>
            <li> Smells like a hospital.  Ew.</li>
            <li> Fantastic gift for a new mom care package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you have a newborn, you often don&#x27;t shower for days. This makes you feel a little more human.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different dry shampoos at various price points, and this one is my favorite. The spray stream is pretty strong, so a few quick bursts go a long way. The scent is a bit strong but pleasant and lasts well over the day. I have finely textured light blond hair, and this doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or film. It shakes/brushes in well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Best Dry Shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li> I loved the light, not overwhelming lemon scent. This spray also doesn&#x27;t make my scalp break out like others have. It works for all day matte finish. I buy this often when I need more!</li>
            <li> This product makes my head itch.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have tried several others - some pricey - and this one delivers.  Hair looks clean, not oily.  It lasts a long time.  With other products, no matter how much I spray, my daughter&#x27;s hair still looks greasy.  She uses the original, my older daughter uses the brunette/dark brown variety.  We are all very happy with these products.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Nice for when your bangs are greasy and you don&#x27;t feel like washing your hair.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> Works great. Smells yucky.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair.  It leaves a strong white residue.  Even after I work it into my hair it leaves it looking dull.  It smells nice and is functional beyond that so I would recommend it for people with light colored hair.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo out there.  We&#x27;ve purchased many brands and this one rocks!</li>
            <li> I ran out too quickly and it was hard to fix oversprays...switched to powder dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Tried the rest, this one is the best. I have long, thick hair that usually stays pretty clean if I wash it every other day, but I&#x27;ve been trying to make curls last the elusive third day... I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of spray dry shampoo &amp; always found that they either didn&#x27;t do a good job absorbing the oil, or stayed white no matter what I did to rub them in, often both. I tried the original formula/scent, &amp; I think it smells lovely. The spray goes on white (I didn&#x27;t try the tinted kind) &amp; then you massage it in for 30 seconds &amp; BOOM. Body &amp; volume like crazy, no greasy spots. This is definitely going into the new &#x27;must have&#x27; for me. I can&#x27;t emphasize this enough, I have used it on clean hair just to boost the volume!</li>
            <li> I have been buying my dry shampoos in Walmart, like Pantene or other brands... I would go thru cans in just few uses.... I&#x27;m so happy I tried this Batiste Dry shampoo!  One can of this Batiste is equivalent to about 5-6 cans of the stuff I bought before!  It doesn&#x27;t need so much spray on the hair!  It just works with just a tiny splash!  Even the next day, sometimes, I find myself looking in the mirror thinking and remembering in the night if I had showered my hair or just sprayed it with this... Lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better (Not your mothers) but I have also used worse. It is a pretty aggressive spray, and by that I mean it has as much force as a hair dryer on high, but it is pretty easy to use, doesnt leave my brown hair looking gray, and it does look clean after a use.</li>
            <li> Full of chemicals and smelled really, really bad.  I tried spraying out a little and the whole bathroom started to fill up with a Lysol spray type of smell.  I would recommend looking at what is in the product before making this purchase, it is extremely flammable.</li>
            <li> Before discovering Batiste, I was buying stuff at my salon for twice as much. I have dark hair and this does not leave any visible residue. I also love that I can&#x27;t really feel it in my hair after use. It&#x27;s light and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. My only very minor issue with it is the smell. The original has this supposed-to-be fresh and clean scent to it. I&#x27;d prefer unscented.</li>
            <li> works great!  the spray will leave a dusting of white all over your bathroom, so beware of that.  :)</li>
            <li> This works so well! I&#x27;ve tried others and they don&#x27;t last through the day or make my hair flat. This is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is always great.  It has a smell my husband doesn&#x27;t care for, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Of all the dry shampoos I have tried, this one is by far the best! I have tried several different brands. I wish I would have found this one first.</li>
            <li> Turned my hair powder color. No thanks.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot). Smells great, works perfectly, you don&#x27;t need to use too much. I recommend to all of my friends and they agree! Great price too.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo. Works well if you spray before bed and brush out. When you wake, beautiful hair that looks like you just washed! This is now a staple in my beauty care!!</li>
            <li> First dry shampoo that I have tried (I&#x27;ve tried many different types) that smells good and works well!</li>
            <li> I have used other dry shampoos, this one works the best for me, and doesnt leave my hair feeling chalking like others.</li>
            <li> my little helper on my rush day, works great.</li>
            <li> Lose the stank without breaking the bank!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo. I have tried many and always come back to this. Suave is a close second though, even though I generally don&#x27;t care for their products.</li>
            <li> I bought this dry shampoo last month, and now I swear by it. My hair feels freshly washed immediately after use, and it has a delightfully fresh scent. I&#x27;ve been recommending it to all of my friends (I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re tired of hearing about it): it&#x27;s super cheap, works amazingly well and smells great. 10/10, would spray again.</li>
            <li> Best brand of dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve found yet, but it does have a whitish finish on your hair if you spray too close!</li>
            <li> I have brown hair and at first it does leave a light color but once you rub it in with your hands it goes away and leaves your hair with great texture and volume without any 3rd day without a shower grease!</li>
            <li> This product might work well for blonde or gray hair, but not for any shades of brown or red since it is basically a spray white powder.  Remember the days when you put baby powder in your hair between shampoos?  This is basically the same thing but in a spray form.  After using it, my hair looked fluffy and not as flat, but on my medium brown hair, it left me looking more gray.  The white residue was clearly visible.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks perfect.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  It&#x27;s very light weight and smells great.  It prolongs your hair so you don&#x27;t have to wash it every day.  I&#x27;ve been able to use this product two days in a row.  It makes it feel clean, adds softness, and smells great!</li>
            <li> This smells SO fresh and is perfect for those days you skip a shower or just don&#x27;t have the time to wash your hair. It REALLY works. It makes your hair look clean and fresh; does a GREAT job soaking up oil. After I apply it to my roots, I let it sit for a minute and then tousle my hair and comb it in so it soaks everything up and evens out, that way it doesn&#x27;t give a white, chalky look to hair. Nobody would ever guess you didn&#x27;t shampoo your hair after you use this stuff lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con about this is it didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other dry shampoos, but for the price and considering how great it worked for me, I can deal with that.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this product again :)</li>
            <li> great dry shampoo.Keeps my hair full of body and eliminates grease</li>
            <li> Was not disappointed with this product. I love it and can&#x27;t wait to try its other products. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Batiste is the top dry shampoo on the market.  I have tried all the expensive ones from Sephora.  I use it the 3rd day after washing on my roots to cut oil down so I can go 4 or 5 without washing.  It&#x27;s amazing how much your hair is damaged by washing and drying everyday...give your hair a rest :]  I like all of their scents, cherry and the tropical one are great.</li>
            <li> Without using this shampoo, I turn into an immediate grease ball the next day! I&#x27;m able to avoid washing my hair for a couple more days and keep it healthy from this product. It&#x27;s amazing, I just wish there were bigger cans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dark brown hair and while it turns my hair white initially, it&#x27;s easy to get rid of it when you spread it around and comb it through.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent (baby powder-ish), and I don&#x27;t like that it leaves a white residue, however minor.  I usually end up splurging for Amika&#x27;s buckthorn dry shampoo, which is expensive but smells great and leaves no trace.</li>
            <li> This product has majorly positively impacted my life. It takes me a long time to wash and dry hair, and when you&#x27;re busy/sleep deprived, an extra 10-15 minutes makes all the difference in the world. I&#x27;m tempted to buy the mini can to keep in my desk at work. It&#x27;s really effective at addressing that oil/grease look. To be fair, your hair ends up looking just a tad bit duller but it&#x27;s a definite improvement. I would have given it a 5/5 but I find that it turns my hair a little grey looking sometimes.</li>
            <li> One of the best dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve tried roughly 3 different brands) You don&#x27;t need too much spray to really soak up the product &amp; it lasts for quite some time. Definitely handy for someone like myself who only washed their hair 1-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good but did very little good for my hair.  If I haven&#x27;t washed me hair in several days it is heavy and kind of oily.  After using this product I see no improvement whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Smelled good and worked well</li>
            <li> Awesomeness. Works like a charm!!</li>
            <li> Better than other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used. I like to use it before I work out to maintain my hairstyle and in my roots after a blowout (especially if it&#x27;s hot) and it usually keeps my hair well into the third day before I wash it again! It smells a little &amp;#34;producty&amp;#34; but nothing overwhelming. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders!!! Seriously it makes my hair look like I just got out of the shower/dried it! I have pretty thick heavy volume hair that gets oily at the roots pretty much the day after I wash it. Used this and was amazed how well it worked. My hair is dark in color, and this sprays white, but if you comb it through well enough you can&#x27;t tell at all. Trying out some other dry shampoos to compare but so far this is my favorite! The Redkin dry shampoo in the pink bottle doesn&#x27;t work at all with my hair.</li>
            <li> Yea I enjoyed it.  Try it</li>
            <li> I like this dry shampoo... doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue and helps degrease my roots in between washes... and helps to plump my hair also. It is nicer than Suave dry shampoo... that stuff was smelly and sticky and white colored etc... ick. But I am still looking for a product without alcohol in it... not sure if there is such a thing as a moisturizing dry shampoo, but I will find it if there is!</li>
            <li> This works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to. It does not leave a residue unless you accidentally hold the can too close to your head while spraying. I can now go every other with washing my hair.</li>
            <li> No build up in my hair.  Superb product!!!</li>
            <li> So i ordered this 5 days ago and it said it would be here on the 3rd of march but it came early so the shipping is definitely great! I havent had the chance to use it just yet but it looks exactly like the picture and it smells fresh and clean like i hoped it would :)</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- De-greases hair very well&lt;br /&gt;- Adds volume when applied at the roots&lt;br /&gt;- Does not smell (I got the original version because I don&#x27;t like scented dry shampoos)&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves far less white residue than other dry shampoos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Rather than leaving white powder, it fades the color of my hair a little bit when I put it in&lt;br /&gt;- I usually need to reapply midway through the day</li>
            <li> The first time that I used this product I had not washed my hair in two days and three nights.  My hair had been through 2 work-outs, 1 hot tubbing session (up in a pony tail) , and a day of gardening prep (think, potting soil and dirt).  Additionally, I highlight my hair and my roots are showing. My hair was notably oily and definitely dirty. I used the dry shampoo on morning of day 3.  Seriously,  I was able to got out in public, run errands, complete a work-out without being concerned about the look, odor, or feel of my hair.  It had a fresh look and a washed scent.  I have used other dry shampoos with varying degrees of success.  This stuff wins- I love it!</li>
            <li> Seriously the best dry shampoo, for real! I bought a different one when I was testing out the whole dry shampoo thing - it left my hair like wire, I couldn&#x27;t even use it that much bc I spent more time messing with it to make it look normal than just taking a shower and washing it. This stuff left my hair completely soft and normal, but no stiff residue at all.The smell on both of them was not that great, it&#x27;s really the aerosol odor - being surrounded by a puff of chemical is never pleasant. I wish the can was larger for the price, but I got maybe 10 or so good uses out of it.</li>
            <li> YESYESYES.&lt;br /&gt;This is my life saver!</li>
            <li> I hardly ever leave bad reviews...but this stuff is way overrated...and I&#x27;m not a picky gal. I have dark hair, so like the rest of the shampoos I&#x27;ve tried in the past, it just leaves a lot of white in my hair even after brushing...and probably more so than some of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s only *okay* with soaking up oil...but it kinda doesn&#x27;t matter if your hair is white, anyway. Frustrating, because I was hopeful with all the good reviews. Makes me wonder if some of the people weren&#x27;t paid or aren&#x27;t company employees.</li>
            <li> I used this to clean some doll faces safely. Works great with no residue.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong for my preference, but the product works well and keeps my hair feeling fresh. When I know I&#x27;m going to have an active day I&#x27;ll often spray this along my roots at the start of the day, and my hair stays looking fresh and tidy even when I&#x27;ve been sweating on the NYC subway. Great product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this product really does leave your hair feeling and smelling clean  - even on day 3!</li>
            <li> just get it. stop researching. let the bajillion reviews on amazon think for you. I bought this as my first dry shampoo and had no problems using it as long as I sprayed, worked it in my roots with my fingers, then brushed or sprayed and went to bed. no residue or gray hair if you use it correctly. On the other hand, I have dark hair and when spraying it initially, I got a real good idea what I&#x27;d look like as a graying granny. :D so make sure you work it into the scalp and brush it through your  hair and you&#x27;ll easily not have to wash and set more than 1-2x a week and you won&#x27;t feel gross. promise. PS, I have PURPLE hair.</li>
            <li> Gave it to a friend.  It sprays out white and sticks to my scalp and makes it look too white.  Have to brush it out.  This was recommended.  I won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!!  Works great for me.  Exactly as advertised.  I can go longer in between washes now because of this product - which is better for your scalp and hair!</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo. It does what I need it to do. Which is help with greasy hair in between washes.  I also bought the dark and deep brown too. My hair is dark brown with highlights and either product does its job.</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite of the different dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  The instructions on the bottle tell you to massage into the scalp, but I find when I do that, the product sort of clumps up.  The product works okay, but could definitely be better.</li>
            <li> leaves a white residue</li>
            <li> Ok so far of all the products I have tried I do like this best.  With that said it DOES leave a powdery film on hair that you have to work through and if you used too much product it will leave a grey cast.  I usually wash my hair the next day but by the next day my hair feels heavy and goopy although it doesn&#x27;t look it.  After I comb through this product I have lift to my hair and it looks washed.  I like the smell it&#x27;s citrusy and fresh, my hair does NOT feel clean and fresh, but eh, whatever the object is for it to not look like an oil slick.  I dye my hair purple and I can&#x27;t be washing it all the time if I hope to keep the color in because they fade super quick, so this product helps me.  My hair is long and fine but there is alot of it, I get dry ends and oily oily scalp, my hair is also dark so the white shows up more than if my hair would be fair.  Hope this helps, I know I went through lots of different products and this is my fav. Oh BTW the prices are MUCH cheaper elsewhere, like target, walmart and even cvs.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Love this! A little goes a long way! Make sure you comb through or you may see some residue, especially with darker hair. I like the smell of this too.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff, but a can doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Hair goes from looking oily to not oily in seconds! Wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have no reason to share this with you other than I drank too much wine and my husband is being really annoying by watching this stupid hockey game into overtime. ANYWAY. This is the most amazing product. I&#x27;m never giving it up. You want to spray your hair in sections and rub out any whiteness, but then just toss your hair and love yourself. Want to know the worst part? I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and got this tip from watching a video the Duggar girls made. I know. Shame upon my lineage. Whatever, they weren&#x27;t wrong.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo I have ever tried. I&#x27;ve tried various brands over the years with no luck so I just stuck with using baby power. I decided to try to find another dry shampoo at the beginning of this year to cut back on washing my hair and fell in love with this brand. I&#x27;ve used 3 cans already. I recommended this to my best friend and she is addicted to it as well. Both of us wish we could buy it in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Spray it in your hair in the morning and let it sit while you do the rest of your morning routine (wash face, get dressed, do make up and so on), then massage it in. After that run a brush through it. This should cut back on gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;You can also spray it on and sleep with it in. This works really well for 2 or 3 day old hair.</li>
            <li> Worked well.  Good for touching up.</li>
            <li> I have very fine blonde hair and this product is perfect.. It is the most clean feeling dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great product! Does the job.</li>
            <li> The Batiste Dry Shampoo does exactly what it says it will do. Right when you spray this stuff into your hair you can automatically feel the difference. Your hair feels more refreshed and leaves the hair feeling VERY soft and smelling clean. I originally though this product would stiffen the hair, but i was wrong i&#x27;m very impressed. I will definitely keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> Works great, no smell later on and easier to not have the white powder residue.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and easy to use.  Wish I had found this product years ago!</li>
            <li> Simply the best dry shampoo I have found.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown/reddish hair. Yes, this sprays on gray, but you just brush it and it goes away. Not sure why it is a problem. Really works super well. I was washing my hair too often, and because I have so much of it, to stop washing it every day was a REAL relief. It really helps. Not sure how I lived so long without it. But with almost a foot and a half of thick, dark brown hair, I need it.</li>
            <li> Turns your hair white or gray if you have dark hair. Not my pick. Fair job of absorbing oil.</li>
            <li> LOVE this dry shampoo!  It&#x27;s better than most I&#x27;ve tried, especially for the price.  Will keep ordering this brand.  It absorbs oil very well, especially on the hair around the face and the scent is fresh, also.</li>
            <li> A decent dry shampoo with a clean pleasant scent. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> After a bad color at the salon, my hair is completely damaged and can only be washed 2-3 times a week. I have always been a fan of dry shampoo, but I hadn&#x27;t been able to find one that doesn&#x27;t build up and leave my hair stiff, until BATISTE. You can buy this at ulta for 7.99, but for a dollar more I didn&#x27;t have to go to the mall and waste time, plus it was prime! You have to shake it good or it will be clumpy, but it leaves my hair with a fresh scent, movement and body! I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today after not washing my hair in 48 hours...TOTALLY worked and my hair felt great!!! went to work with confidence!</li>
            <li> Not the &#x27;Magic&#x27; shower replacement I was kind of hoping for, but it definitely will get you through an extra day or so in-between showers. It works well, the color from the powder disappears after rubbing it into my Brown hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used.  Smell is not too bad.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few dry shampoos I have tried, but out of all of them I definitely like this one the best. It has a soapy smell, but I like that :D It kind of take a lot to actually absorb everything, but still a great product. I will probably play around with some others but for now, this one will do.</li>
            <li> The good thing about this product is that it does seem to lift my hair (which is thin) And it is ok with the &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; it still feels somewhat dirty though, it looks good but feel dirty and somewhat dull.</li>
            <li> I must admit ive tried many dry shampoos, just trying to find one that really does what its suppose to do. Many either make my hair stiff, smell horrible, or only work for a half hour or so. I must admit i am very happy with this batiste dry shampoo. I know that i can just spray it in my hair and go, no need to fuss around with it or worry that i might need to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got my friend on the bandwagon as well. We had one of those late night drinking nights where we had to wake up and go out early. She made a comment that it looked like i had just showered and i let her in on my little secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that batiste comes in various scents and even shades! Very handy, i love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Do you want flammable products on your hair? If you do then this is the product for you. If you don&#x27;t, then stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dry shampoo specifically to use on my bangs, and it is excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased about 4 more of these since first trying it this past summer. I like that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, smell too perfumey, or leave behind a residue (or dry out my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is light and has the smell of soap--very fresh and clean. I tried the Blush Floral &amp; Flirty scented version of this, but absolutely hated the smell--it smelled like a public bathroom with areosole air freshner, just to give you an idea of the contrast.</li>
            <li> Works well. Great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive dry shampoos and didn&#x27;t like any of them but this one is a great price and I loved it immediately. No residue and greasy appearance of my hair is gone.</li>
            <li> I thought I would like this more....it leaves kind of a weird texture on the hair, kind of sticky and stiff. I have not tried other dry shampoo, so perhaps this is just the way they are. But I don&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li> my favourite dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that I straighten. My hair gets oily at the roots pretty quickly in the day. With this, my hair stays gorgeous for literally days at a time. I have tried so many other dry shampoos over the years and this by far kicks all of their butts. There&#x27;s no thick layer of gunk/thick texture like the other dry shampoos seem to leave behind. I even use this when my hair isn&#x27;t oily and I just want to add some volume. Just try it - you&#x27;ll see what I mean!</li>
            <li> Literally the best dry shampoo</li>
            <li> Bought for my teen with blue hair, on a stylist&#x27;s recco. Helps keep the color longer.</li>
            <li> I like how it smells at first. It is not too strong, just right!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used to my hair yet, but I will try someday when my hair&#x27;s greasy</li>
            <li> Honestly, this dry shampoo has been a holy grail for my hair as it otherwise needs a full washing every day. Since getting the Batiste Dry Shampoo, my second day hair has been looking just as fresh as it would have had I taken a full shower and dried out my hair. The scent of the dry shampoo is very light and pleasant as well which is a definite plus. I usually just lift up sections of my hair and spray the dry shampoo underneath those sections, wait about a minute, and then massage my head with my fingers before proceeding to brush out my hair as usual. One thing that I didn&#x27;t really like was that the powder is not transparent so if not careful in completely massaging it in, parts of my hair would appear lighter. Usually, that&#x27;s not an issue for me, but sometimes when I&#x27;m running late, I find that there are sections of my hair that aren&#x27;t quite my natural hair color. I would definitely purchase this product again when I run out (I think I&#x27;ve already used half in the last couple months), and I might consider getting one of their tinted versions for the benefit of my naturally jet black hair.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo ever hands down.  Just wish they sold it at more stores where I live.</li>
            <li> Great volume---- but rub and work this in!! This is not a spray n finish product. You really have to massage and work this product in your hair or you will leave the house looking like a powdered fool.</li>
            <li> Love the product. My hair is blond, fine, and straight so this helps between shampoos. We are in a drought so showers and hair washes are a luxury.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spray too close to head like any other dry shampoo.  Use the night before if you have dark hair.</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair and have to wash my hair every other day. With this product, I can wash my hair every 3 days! It&#x27;s great! And a very good price! I have tried multiple other dry shampoos costing upwards of $30, NONE of them work like Batiste. A must buy!</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is great.  For a time when you don&#x27;t want to take the time to wash your hair but it still needs help.  Just spray lightly at scalp and work through the hair and brush.  It&#x27;s a miracle worker and the next day your hair still looks good.</li>
            <li> I am one of those unfortunate souls plagued by greasy hair and before I discovered Batiste I would try to hide it in a pony tail.  No longer!  Just a quick few minutes and my hair is shiny and bouncy again.  :-). I&#x27;ll never be without this product again.</li>
            <li> Used this when I was in the hospital giving birth and it worked great</li>
            <li> Shows the powder very clearly. Awful</li>
            <li> The dry shampoo worth buying.  I have medium brown hair and when used properly leaves no white residue.  It does give my hair extra body and the smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product! Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Seriously an amazing product. I went 6 days without washing my hair!</li>
            <li> Smells weird and works ok.  I will try a different dry shampoo next time.</li>
            <li> Based on the (largely) good reviews, I purchased Batiste Dry Shampoo for emergency touch ups to get the oily look out of my hair when I just have absolutely no time to wash and style it before I leave the house. It does work to a degree, but I wasn&#x27;t necessarily proud of the appearance of my hair that night. I replced the oily look with a slight overcast of powder that, I&#x27;m sure, was most noticeable to me. The good news is that my hair smelled quite fresh and my hair almost regained the fullness that it has when it&#x27;s just shampooed. And I did work diligently to brush out the powder after using it, but it&#x27;s almost like I replaced one problem with another. I&#x27;ll use it again if I have to, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best dry shampoo&#x27;s I ever used. It is a great price and a big bottle. It is half the price of most and works just as good, or better than most. I have very dark hair and it does not leave a white chalky dust. It refreshes hair and lifts roots. It gives a good amount of volume. I will definitely buy again. Great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I got this product yesterday and I&#x27;m using for the first time today. It is vastly superior to any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used before. It comes out feeling dry which is a big plus for me. I can shower at night and wake up with visibly oily hair so the dryness is huge! It does have that usual white residue which I don&#x27;t really care about (I&#x27;m blonde) but, I found that it does disappear with a bristle brush better than a paddle brush if that helps some of you dark haired ones. It&#x27;s a good sized container and I will update with how long it lasts. I didn&#x27;t need to use nearly as much as usual so I have high hopes. As in the title, I feel like I can still tough my hair. That&#x27;s my biggest thing for dry shampoo. If it makes me feel like if I touch my hair the grease will come back then it&#x27;s basically worthless to me. Basically all dry shampoos are worthless to me.</li>
            <li> After buying a different dry shampoo, found at walmart, we now understand why this is one of the best selling ones out there. It works fantastically without leaving a film or your hair heavy. It also is unscented which is a big win for me.</li>
            <li> Works great, just a little too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> I am now a fan of Dry Shampoo :)</li>
            <li> Favorite Dry Shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used so far, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  I like the tropical scent, too.</li>
            <li> My husband had neck surgery and was told he could not take a shower or wash his hair until after his post op appointment.  Crazy, I know.  I remembered that years ago you could buy spray hair shampoo, so on to Amazon I went.  I found this product and based on the reviews bought it.  It&#x27;s done great to help him with his hair.  You shake the can really well, then spray the roots, rub with fingers and it works.  The other day I was in a hurry and did not have time to wash a dry my long hair, so I pulled it back in a twist and used this on my bangs.  Perfect!  Now that I have found this product, I will keep it on hand for those quick fixes when short on time.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I have tried and it works great for my hair. It&#x27;s easy to apply and my hair styles very well after massaging it in and combing through. I think next time I will try a different scent as &amp;#34;Clean &amp; Classic&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t smell like anything, hence the 4 star rating instead of 5.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo on the market, and I have tried many many brands. I love the scent of this and also that you can&#x27;t smell it later in the day like other dry shampoos.  Also, when you use it your hair actually feels clean! I can go several days without washing my hair, and I used to shampoo every day.  This is absolutely one of my most favorite products in my beauty arsenal!</li>
            <li> I have very fine oily hair and this is the only product I can use that doesn&#x27;t make it feel heavy or like I have a ton of hair spray in it.  I can even wear it down on the 2nd day if I want, I have never been able to find anything else like it.</li>
            <li> Excelent product. I recomended</li>
            <li> if you know how to use it the right way, this stuff is awesome. you can&#x27;t just spray it on like hairspray and expect it to work though because it is white, and it makes you hair look like you sprayed white baby powder on it. but if you work it into your roots and scrub it in like you do with regular shampoo, only not in the shower, and give it a little bit of time to absorb, it works miracles. you can go a few days without shampooing in the shower which saves your hair from getting dried out, and it gives your hair more volume too. great product, learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing, but it&#x27;s got the most cloyingly sweet smell and if you use as much as I do (I have a lot of hair), you get stuck in a cloud of powder that you can&#x27;t help but breathe in. It&#x27;s bad. Use somewhere that has good ventilation and keep your eyes shut. Also, the spray 6-8 inch distance from your head suggestion does help keep the white residue to a minimum. Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> If I skip one hair wash then my hair gets super oily. I was hoping that this product would make my hair look fine and not oily. It soaked up some of the oil but not a lot which was a disappointment. Other than that one thing it was great. Then scent was not overpowering which was defiantly a plus. It also created a lot of volume which is amazing especially when you have baby fine hair. I&#x27;ve looked for a product for years that gives my hair more volume and this defiantly helps.</li>
            <li> After a couple days of not washing my hair my roots get pretty oily, while the rest of my hair is is normal/dry. This dry shampoo is excellent for when you just don&#x27;t have time and need to get to work. I have very thick somewhat frizzy hair, so a few spritzes is all it takes to get some bounce and volume when it&#x27;s gone flat from being unwashed. I have none of the issues with white residue or stickiness from this product, but again I have thick hair. My only complaint is the chemical &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; smell. Probably would be better in a different scent. Definitely would recommend either way</li>
            <li> Wow I just got it and I tried it and it&#x27;s 100x better than my dry shampoo from Herbal Essences which leaves my hair super dry and tangled. Batiste is amazing!!! It left my hair super soft and silky I love it so much</li>
            <li> I really like this dry shampoo.  Unlike two other brands I have used, the fragrance of this one is very mild and dissipates pretty quickly.  The Dove brand smell stayed in my hair and I felt like people could tell by smelling me that I had used a dry shampoo.  Also, the Batiste does a better job of making my hair feel cleaner...any oily look goes away.  And it makes my hair seem fuller.  It is all I could hope for in a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used - gives hair lots of volume and feels very fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;ve used others in the past that we way more expensive and this works the best by far.  The fragrance is fresh and the powder isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  I wash and blow dry my hair every 2nd to 3rd day.  This saves me me so much time. I love it!</li>
            <li> I was not familiar with the original scent. I was hoping for something stronger and fresher.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s finally for sale in Walgreens so I just buy it there. It takes out excess oil and adds volume. I can finally go a day in between washes! Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I have dark hair and this didn&#x27;t leave a noticeable white residue when I applied it the night before (gives it time to absorb). I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a buildup like some other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful because I had heard so many great things but honestly it made my dark hair look dusty and almost grey. Yes if cleans up the grease but I think it&#x27;s better suited for those with lighter hair colors.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it so I tried and love it too. It is for blonds , does not smell bad like other brands, gives your hair volume and eliminate 2-3 washes a week. Save your hair by using it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this dry shampoo! No overbearing scent, and it makes my hair feel great!</li>
            <li> This sells at my ulta for 7.99.. I can get it at walgreens for around 6.00. I live in United States in ohio area. I LOVE this stuff!! It was the very first dry shampoo that I ever tried and it&#x27;s awesome! My hair gets very greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it everyday this stuff is a lifesaver. Love it! Let me say I have long hair. Very dark. Almost black . I have not had one proble with this dry shampoo. Yes it is white when you put it on. I like that because you can see where the product is going. You just let it sit, rub it in then brush. The white stuff goes away and it does not leave any build up in your hair at all!!!!! Def a plus! Love that!!! As far as giving it a grayish cast... I have had no problems at a with that. My hair looks fine. I doubt any other dry shampoo will live up to this. It&#x27;s that perfect. Highly highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Favorite dry shampoo to use.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! It&#x27;s the best dry shampoo ever.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo. I have black to blonde ombre hair which I can&#x27;t wash very often because of how much bleaching and dying it has gone through. This dry shampoo leaves my hair feeling lightweight, lasts all day, smells great, and is inexpensive - perfect for 3rd day hair. It&#x27;s also a very easy product to apply. I section off the crown of my head and lightly spray at the roots. Then, I use my fingers to massage my scalp.</li>
            <li> Left grey residue on my roots :(</li>
            <li> Great product! Best I&#x27;ve used so far. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Arrived broken. Unable to try out.</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> OMG! This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. I previously bought the not your mothers and it was horrible, and then I bought the herbal essences dry shampoo and it was even worse. This dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like you put some hair spray on. It really works! Sometimes I don&#x27;t have time to shower, blow dry my hair and then iron it, so I just use this dry shampoo when I&#x27;m in a hurry. It&#x27;s not like you are going to stop washing your hair because of this. Use it only in emergencies! Now, I want to dry the batiste, but with the cherry smell that I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s wonderful! Recommend this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried! Doesn&#x27;t  really flake or dry out my scalp and puts even 2 and 3 day hair back to a normal feel!</li>
            <li> Phenominal! Definitely the best dry shampoo product on the market. Love the smell too!</li>
            <li> Average. I like the powder based dry shampoos a little better, this one seemed harder to rub into hair and left more residual than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands but they don&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ll always buy this one. I spray it and let it dry a few minutes then use my fingers to rub it in. Viola! Great looking hair!</li>
            <li> The primary ingredient (as listed on the can) is butane.  It may be deemed &#x27;safe&#x27;, but it&#x27;s not something that I want to put on my scalp.  I threw it away without trying it.</li>
            <li> Refreshes my hair between shampoos and give me volume.</li>
            <li> The most inexpensive and best dry shampoo I have ever used, I order it all of the time.  Seller was out of 6.73 oz size.  She sold me the travel size, with extra bottles.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of the shine from my greasy hair and adds a nice scent.</li>
            <li> BEST DRY SHAMPOO EVER!!</li>
            <li> My client is bed bound quite often.  So she cannot just jump in the shower.  This dry shampoo REALLY works.  It goes on white, but once I brush her hair, it is fine even on her very dark brown hair.  So I tried it one day.  I LOVED IT.  I keep it as a staple so I can freshen my hair after fitness class.</li>
            <li> This product is a life changer. Makes my hair feel like i just washed it without ruining my straightened hair.</li>
            <li> best product out there in my opinion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few dry shampoos. This product Left my hair clean and flexible...Even after a workout. Worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> I Was hopeful that this product would allow me to skip a day in between washes.  I have medium brown, thin hair. I followed the directions and it left my hair with a dull whitish appearance.  My hair isn&#x27;t overly oily but tends to separate when dirty (especially at the crown)and is very noticeable.  Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> My scalp is very greasy, so I have to wash my hair every morning. I used this on a day off work when I wouldn&#x27;t see many people. It ate up the grease so my hair was fairly dry and had an odd texture. It also had less body than after washing &amp; blow drying. I would use it again for a day of just running errands, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a work day or before social engagements.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell of it. It gives me headache all day. I don&#x27;t understand why they make it so strong. Psssst was so much better. Also recently Batiste slipped from my hand and the spray broke (didn&#x27;t came off). I threw it to the trash and ordered Psssst again.</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands, but never like how they feel. This brand is the best.</li>
            <li> Takes the grease out of my hair and leaves me ready for almost any event in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Does not leave powdery residue and works well when using a straightener/curling iron afterwards.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde with short hair that is very thin and lifeless. My hair is NOT at it&#x27;s best when it is first washed. With this amazing dry spray I can go days without washing my hair. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR DARK HAIR.</li>
            <li> love the way it smells and really works with my hair. Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of dry shampoo.  This stuff is the best, and it&#x27;s so inexpensive.  Now if only I could find one with free shipping - or better yet, find it in the store!!  :)</li>
            <li> This is not a good product.  Baby powder does better then this product. It makes your hair look white and it does nothing for oily hair.  Do not waste your money buying this product.</li>
            <li> I prefer their brunette version better.  I&#x27;m a darker blonde, but even at that -- this left a clearly visible white residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was in the hospital and had a friend spray it into my hair and then brush through small areas at a time. I looked almost gray after using this product. The texture also felt really dry.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and this is by far the best. It&#x27;s pricey, often ranging from $8-12 per can (the big one) and it can go quick depending on how often you use it and how much hair you have, but it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;ve tried many others and this is the only one that feels clean and refreshing and doesn&#x27;t leave buildup in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip for those trying it for the first time - don&#x27;t put the nozzle right at your hair or you&#x27;ll get a ton of white product that will be hard to brush away and will leave you looking like you have grey hair. Spray it from slightly farther away and do small amounts at a time (you can always add more but you can&#x27;t easily remove too much). Let it sit for ~10 seconds and use a comb to brush it into the hair at your scalp and then into the length of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to do my hair in sections. I&#x27;ll flip all my hair to one side and spray underneath and work it in. Then I&#x27;ll flip over another section, work it in, and continue on. I usually do 4 sections, then once on the underside of the back. I always make sure to, at the end, brush my hair down over my face to work it into the bangs (so you don&#x27;t get that one greasy-looking piece of hair that you have to tuck behind your ear).</li>
            <li> Great product, you really have to rub it in to get rid of the white but it&#x27;s pretty easy. Makes my hair look fresh and lessens how often I actually need to wash my hair which is great because it has allowed my hair to grow longer and look healthier.</li>
            <li> Love it! Does a great job of grabbing all of the oil in my hair, doesn&#x27;t leave any weird residue, and smells nice and fresh. Hands down my favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> Excellent product to keep from washing hair daily and priced very reasonably. This gives nice volume and absorption of oily roots. However, this comes out more whitish so it may not be appropriate for dark hair. I am platinum blonde naturally so it&#x27;s perfect for those hair types :)</li>
            <li> I love this! I have light brown hair and the powder doesn&#x27;t show at all. I&#x27;ve never had more success with a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of dry shampoo, it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t leave a gross residue on your hair. This is a must have beauty product for any girl on the go! It&#x27;s also great for a night out if you want to make your hair smell fresh and add some volume.</li>
            <li> I found that the dry shampoo merely makes your hair stick together better (similar to hair spray) and makes your hair smell better. Although your hair stays in place, it made my hair feel dry and I don&#x27;t like the feeling of rubbing through my hair and it being slightly rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used the dry shampoo a few times and nobody. including me, noticed any difference. This shampoo does not mean you can skip a shower or two. It seems like a spray gel more than dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence, my vote is a no - go with regular shampoo and take the time for the shower. Even if you just want to use this when you&#x27;re in a hurry I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it - just go natural.</li>
            <li> Works decently well, but definitely use before bed to allow it to work itself into your hair.  Also, spray about a foot away from your hair, as it&#x27;ll show up as white on your hair when too concentrated/close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using baby powder on my hair for in between shower days for years. Someone said I should try dry shampoo. I was seriously disappointed. Baby powder soaks up far more oil and it doesn&#x27;t have that intense spray.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have found! I started a new job with longer hours last year and I have been grateful on the mornings that I get up later than I should, without time to wash my hair. The TresSemme dry shampoo leaves a super powdery but the Batiste is the best! I can leave a minimal powder residue but being blonde, it hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me.</li>
            <li> So this dry shampoo works. It&#x27;s fine. But it is by no means great. I bought this product because I heard so much hype about it and it did not live up to others&#x27; praises for me. My hair is very dark brown and the dry shampoo gave me white residue everywhere I put it. Bright white. Which was difficult to brush and blend into my hair. Even after several minutes of brushing the product in, my roots still looked grayish. However the grayish residue faded during the day and was not noticeable by the end of the day. Once brushed in the product did a substantial job of freshening my hair. The freshness faded in a few hours though and I needed to reapply frequently throughout the day. One can only lasts around a month for me. With all this in mind the price is great and compared to other dry shampoos Batiste was OK. Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> This product has honestly changed my life.  I have very greasy hair after a day, but this voodoo spray somehow fixes that completely, and I&#x27;m able to wash my hair every other day.  Seriously, buy this right now.  I don&#x27;t even understand how it works.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo around. I shake bottle, spray 6 inches away from hair, let the shampoo sit and then I rub into my hair and scalp and all done. I have clean looking hair!</li>
            <li> amazing. the best. i&#x27;ve tried many and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I like this dry shampoo it keeps my hair less oily so I don&#x27;t have to wash it every day.</li>
            <li> I have light-colored, thin hair and my friend has dark brown, thick hair, and both of us use and love this product (the &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; look goes away when you brush it in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t use it all the time or it will dry out your scalp too much, but my friend joked that she was never going to wash her hair again because she loved it so much.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Shipped quick.</li>
            <li> Works well for me. It goes on white, but blends easily if I have oil in my hair to soak it up. It probably helps that my hair is blonde-ish. I like the smell (I abhorred the smell of the suave keratin dry shampoo), and while it&#x27;s a little strong going on it fades quickly enough to me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It does leave white residue (so apply it BEFORE you get dressed!), but pretty much all dry shampoos will. The trick is to hold it ~6 inches away--doing this, the residue easily comes out by just rubbing my hair with my fingers. (Alternatively, put this in your hair before you go to sleep, and your hair will absorb all of the powder overnight.) The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue (and the reason for docking a star) is that it is really pricey for how much use I get out of it. I use this maaaaybe 1-2x a week on medium, shoulder-length hair, and this stuff doesn&#x27;t even last a month. For $10 a can, I feel like that&#x27;s pretty bad, ESPECIALLY when I can put straight up cornstarch on my hair and achieve the same effect. (That&#x27;s all this product is: cornstarch in a spray bottle. You can find DIY dry shampoos by Googling.) But for mornings when I don&#x27;t have enough time for cornstarch, this is my go-to.</li>
            <li> batiste is my favorite brand of dry shampoo. i also have one in cherry but i like this scent more because it&#x27;s not too overpowering. yeah, it&#x27;s kinda pricey but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy when i spray it on...</li>
            <li> Smells refreshing and does the job!</li>
            <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve tried only two others before this one and they didn&#x27;t do as nearly a good job as this one does. I also hated the smell of other dry shampoos but this one is very faint and makes my hair not smell bad at all. I really recommend this dry shampoo to anyone considering it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of dry shampoos. This one is the best. It has a light scent that is not offensive. It doesn&#x27;t deposit a huge amount of powder but still seems to do the job well. I used to use it a lot went back when I had long hair.</li>
            <li> Works well, turns your hair white temporarily... But a little brush through helps with that! Smells fresh!</li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos ranging from inexpensive to pricey and this is hands down the best. It is the only one that does not make my hair waxy or stiff feeling. I spray it in my hair before I go to bed so that by morning the powder is all absorbed and I don&#x27;t have to try to brush it out.</li>
            <li> Love this item. It makes my hair look and feel clean in minutes.  I have longer hair so washing everyday is very drying. At first there is a grey residue, but it goes away when it is massaged in. It may be obvious in people with darker hair</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully! Gets rid of the dirty/oily look between washes, restores volume, smells neutral and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking powdery white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important notes:&lt;br /&gt;1. The spray is very powerful, so you don&#x27;t need to keep spraying for a long time. Do it in short bursts until you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;2. Shake it even between sprays or you might get a high concentration of white on your hair. If that happens it usually brushes out pretty well but may remove a little more shine than you&#x27;d like from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. The ONLY reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it gets used up pretty fast. I know they tell you how many Fl Oz are in it but it&#x27;s a little expensive for how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favourite dry shampoo. I use it, pretty regularly, for up to three days. After three days you will have quite a bit of &#x27;debris&#x27; in your hair, and it will itch. I&#x27;ve used it in the original, cherry, wild scents, as well as in the brown spray. The brown gets under your nails, but doesn&#x27;t come off on clothing. One side note - this is sold at Walgreens, TJ Maxx, and Marshalls for six bucks a pop.. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it on here.</li>
            <li> For me this is better than any other dry shampoo I have used.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo does a good job on my short hair. Although a daily regular shampooing is not necessary for my hair, I was looking for something to remove the residue of blow-dry lotion and hair spray. Batiste Dry Shampoo fills the bill. I follow the use instructions, and Batiste removes any styling-product residue while restoring bounce. I like being able to shampoo every other day and use Batiste in between. It&#x27;s just about fragrance free, and it leaves no residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> In buying this one before I had bought several bottles, this time for a friend to buy, very good smell taste, easy to carry. The future will continue to buy</li>
            <li> Addicted to this stuff - gives my hair volume, freshness, covers roots and super cheap. I run through about bottle a week, which is well worth the time it saves me from washing my hair daily, and the damage it prevents by spacing out washes as well.</li>
            <li> It works great, but is very smelly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different dry shampoos, sprays and powders, including Bumble &amp; bumble&#x27;s offerings at a much higher price point, and this Batiste is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have brown hair, but not super dark.  My hair is pretty fine/ I don&#x27;t have a huge head of thick hair.  This leaves very little white residue when I spray it, and the white that does appear is easily worked in and disappears.  I can reapply this again and again and not wash my hair for a few days.  I can wear my hair up or down after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell/scent is virtually unnoticeable.  I notice it when I spray it, but within minutes there is no lingering smell, which I really really appreciate, as I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes and the smell of some of the other dry shampoos i&#x27;ve used really got to me after a few hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY, highly recommended!  Buy now for yourself and all your friends!</li>
            <li> An amazing product that truly delivers as promised. Smells great and freshens up hair at the roots without making  it stiff or flat. Tried them all and always come back to this one!!</li>
            <li> Leaves a strong white residue in your hair at first. If you have dark hair, do NOT get this one but get the colored one. However, I do like the product itself.</li>
            <li> Great for the days you forget/don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> I love dry shampoo, gives me that extra day, I used to use Redken, but oh so expensive.....this is a third of the price (I actually bought my second can through Drugstore.com as it was several dollars less expensive) and works just as well.  Really no smell...</li>
            <li> I bought this based off the reviews.  It worked fine.  Considering I&#x27;ve never used a dry shampoo before.  However, I can&#x27;t buy this in stores around me so I decided to try something different.  I tried &#x27;Not Your Mothers&#x27; Clean Freak Refreshing Dry Shampoo.  This actually made it look like I washed my hair and I could wear it down without having to worry about greasy hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy the Batiste again.  I dyed my hair bright red so I only wash it with shampoo/conditioner 2-3x a week to keep the red vibrant.  Try the Not Your Mother&#x27;s before you try this - and it&#x27;s cheaper $8.99 vs. $10.25</li>
            <li> Works great. Powder smell is nice. Much needed as a mom of a toddler, on those mornings when washing and drying your hair just isn&#x27;t in the cards. I see the reviews about the &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s what all dry shampoo has always been like for me since I have dark brown hair- you have to brush it through to get rid of the white which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I am a black female.  Sometimes my hair can get a tad oily after a few days.  I use this at night to help with that.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair super dry which is good but it does leave a small amount of residual behind.  It feels like a powder.  I try and rub it in really well and eventually throughout the day it goes away.  I like it because it does what it says but I hate the stuff left behind.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair daily as my hair and skin are very oily, taking into consideration I have only used this once, this morning I have to say I expected more. I shook the bottle well and held it at the distance the instructions suggested, massaged and brushed my hair however my hair still appeared a little greasy. With that being said, it was less greasy and did feel &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; had more movement to it as well and smelled nice. I can still feel the &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; feeling more than halfway through my day. I think I&#x27;ll be giving this dry shampoo a few more uses and maybe shake the bottle more, on the off chance my so/so take on this product might be user error.</li>
            <li> lifesaver for days I can&#x27;t wash hair</li>
            <li> batiste is the best- you just need to use a hair dryer to blow out the white powder.</li>
            <li> It works but it smells weird. Doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; as it claimed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student, and I have to say that this dry shampoo is a life saver for all-nighters when you don&#x27;t have time to shower right away.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to use, and makes you feel less disgusting until you can actually shower.</li>
            <li> I have tried this twice.  Both times it made a mess.  Comes out very flaky.  Gets all over your clothes, and is very difficult to get out of your hair.  I will go back to buying my dry shampoo at Walgreens or Target.  I have never had another brand do this.</li>
            <li> good dry shampoo just smells weird</li>
            <li> Love this dry shampoo! I&#x27;ve been using it for months probably every week and really like it. It&#x27;s easy to apply and it has that typical hair spray smell that I actually like (but if you don&#x27;t, maybe the product is not for you). It does leave a bit of white/gray residue on the hair if you hold it too close, but I think that&#x27;s by design. The residue disappears within seconds as you massage the product in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer washing my hair every 3-4 days, but the roots get a bit oily. This shampoo makes the roots looks like they&#x27;ve just been washed!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for dirty hair days. Need to rub it in</li>
            <li> Shipped in on time! Wonderful product, this is my second time buying it. Really helpful when you want to add some volume to your hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE this dry shampoo! It works great</li>
            <li> Smells very nice- any oil is absorbed and leaves hair looking fresh. I try to only wash my hair every other day, and I use this in the off days. Like it a lot. :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this.  Toxic smell and not great results with my hair (which is fine and straight and tends to get flat and greasy).  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other brands and this one is towards the bottom.</li>
            <li> works great but is gray in color</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember the last time I wrote a review, but WOW this product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly curly hair that I wash out and flat iron every.single.day.  I didn&#x27;t think much of it, but I one day I told myself, this is probably not a good idea, as my hair resembles a dry wheat field. My roots get oily, but the rest of my hair remains dry and brittle. What do I do!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loathe the idea of going one night without washing my hair because of the oils and smells that accumulate throughout the day. I have only gone a handful of times in the past year without washing my hair at night. I&#x27;m telling you I hate the feeling of unwashed hair!! Then my friend told me she uses dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product and tested my limits. I have gone 3 WHOLE NIGHTS without water washing my hair! A record!! I don&#x27;t have the dreaded hot, oily scalp feeling when I go to bed at night, nor do I have the associated old scalp smell. It&#x27;s a whole new era!!!  My hair already feels more healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this product, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> The reviews of others are indeed true! I can&#x27;t stop boasting how wonderful this dry shampoo is! It&#x27;s as simple as what the instruction has said - spray, massage it in, brush. My hair is beautiful lifted and the smell is wonderful. If you noticed there is still a bit of white powder left on the root of the hair, simply massage it a bit more and brush. I love this product and can&#x27;t image my daily routine without it!</li>
            <li> I causes my scalp to be overtly dry, and it doesn&#x27;t last for long. I think the tresemm&amp;eacute; brand does a better job, without drying out scalp and it pretty much lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I did not care for this dry shampoo at all. It makes my hair look white and dry. I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoo that works much better. My favorite is Simply Smooth Xtend Dry Shampoo. I made a mistake thinking I could save money by buying this cheaper product. Pay more for the superior product, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Would definitely buys this again.</li>
            <li> I have used other dry shampoo&#x27;s, this is the only one I will use now. Amazon has the best price on this product as well :)</li>
            <li> Works to freshen up your hair and remove all traces of oiliness perfectly without leaving any kind of residue, but doesnt add much volume and if you spray too close whitens your hair. Has a bit of a learning curve to use, but I love the smell so I keep coming back to this.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice results from this product! Good aerosol power, easy to work through hair, adds volume and texture on that second day after washing. I seem to go through a can quite quickly.</li>
            <li> didnt expect it too work actually)) waas mistaked&lt;br /&gt;got it on time</li>
            <li> Probably the best stuff for it&#x27;s price. Unless you&#x27;re willing to drop $25 on dry shampoo, then this is the best stuff you can buy. Smells nice. It might make dark hair look like it has grey roots, but that goes away if you rub it in.</li>
            <li> Love the price and the product works great for freshening up my roots on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair! Has a nice clean scent. I have dark brown hair and I don&#x27;t have any problems with it looking ashy or gray on my hair as long as I spray from a reasonable distance and then take a few seconds to rub it in. I also think this product is reasonably priced compared to most of the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve purchased in the past (Sephora, Drybar, etc.)</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews. I will probably go with a different brand next time. It left quite a white powdery reside but I was able to get it out with a little tosseling. Not a fan of the perfumy/powdery scent either. Did a good job of &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; the hair up though.</li>
            <li> This works really well, but it definitely leaves a white residue.  My hairbrush is coated in it. Not a problem if you&#x27;re a blond, and actually useful if, like me, you&#x27;re a highlighted blond, as it helps cover as my roots are growing out.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s ok, but there&#x27;s a lot of hype around this stuff. Expect to feel like you have dry shampoo in your hair, not that you&#x27;ve recently actually washed. It is better for my very dark hair than all the other drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried. I have not tried high-end yet.</li>
            <li> Great product. I am not really into the dry shampoo thing, but when I need to, I use this one. The smell is great, not too strong. It is easy to be applied and makes your hair nicer during the day.</li>
            <li> I have tried every dry shampoo possible and this is the best hand down. If you have dark hair it leaves no white residue at all! If you try it, you too will be hooked for life. Not only does it clean your hair it gives it so much extra volume and texture too! This product is amazing! I will never buy a different brand again!</li>
            <li> Not exactly sure what to expect. I think I will know better after several uses.</li>
            <li> I absolute love this dry shampoo! It leaves my hair spelling delicious and it looks great. I never get compliments on my hair when I wash it but the next day when I use this dry shampoo I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo. It does the trick and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling weighted down or gross. This also comes in a tropical scent which is fabulous.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I ever tried - i bought few more for future use.&lt;br /&gt;Why 4 stars:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Ulta has same brand for $1-2 cheaper and&lt;br /&gt; 2. it does leave my dark hair gray for few minutes, no matter how far I spray it.</li>
            <li> I never expected much from dry shampoos, the ones I tried were so so, and not worth the 20+ price. I read about this one and at $8 gave it a shot. It works great! Even better than the pricier counterparts. It makes my hair look and feel cleaner, dries up the oil, and adds unexpected volume (which is hard for my hair to achieve). As a brunette, I do have to brush or shake it out with my hands to diffuse the powdery residue it can leave if you spray it too closely, but afterwards the results are worth it. Perfect for those rushed, no-time-for-hair days.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend did not like this brand compared to others she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair that gets oily unless I wash it every single day. A hairdresser recommended this product to me. Though it hasn&#x27;t worked any miracles on my hopeless hair, it&#x27;s the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used. No white residue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently learned something really helpful: The best way to use dry shampoo is to spray sections of hair from below, and let sit (don&#x27;t brush or touch) for ten minutes. Then, style as you usually would. Game changer.</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo I ever used. Non sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave white residue</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  A friend recommended it. Not only is it a dry shampoo, it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;a styling product, too.  Adds volumes AND comes in other colors.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product to use on days I don&#x27;t feel like washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different dry shampoos and this one is by far the best! A huge life saver for a girl that spends many days in the gym and can&#x27;t wash my hair after each workout! Thanks Batiste!</li>
            <li> Only works for blonde hair. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really useful for me! Love it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! First time user of dry shampoo but it will not be my last. Shipped on time and grateful received.</li>
            <li> I was having a crazy busy day yesterday and was invited out by friends at the last minute. I ran to my local walgreens and grabbed this dry shampoo in hopes of looking a little more presentable in the short amount of time I had. This stuff is the first dry shampoo to actually make me feel clean! I love it. It really gets the job done and I will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li> Two of the four cans from this vendor were defective, and they only sprayed a clear liquid. When the packaging is working, the product itself is great.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!  I can barely go one day without washing my hair.  With this stuff, I can make it through a whole day and sometimes two! And it smells great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  The smell is great and it really works.  One thing to note - I found it at TJ Maxx for $5.99 - so check there before buying on amazon for $10.</li>
            <li> It got white powder on EVERYTHING within 5 feet of me when using it. Be sure you&#x27;re not wearing dark clothes when you use it or you&#x27;ll have to change. Elsewise, it did wonders to my hair, I had to use a wet brush to comb the white out but it works well .</li>
            <li> This product was very satisfactory. However, the scent is a bit chemically strong and it left my dark auburn hair a bit dull and dusty looking. Overall a great product for touching up hair quickly by adding volume and eliminating some grease. It would probably work better for people with lighter, thinner hair than mine. Please note that this was my first dry shampoo and I am not an expert.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using dry shampoo. so maybe I&#x27;m just using it wrong. I spray it throughout my roots after I go to the gym and before I go to bed if I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in a while. It definitely makes my hair look less oily, but it doesn&#x27;t make it look as good as I thought it would since I had read so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Second can for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use when my unwashed hair gets a little greasy/flat on Day 2 (or Day 3 - don&#x27;t judge!) after a shower. This definitely soaks up the oil and helps fluff up dull hair quickly. My only complaints are that it turns brown hair gray/white, even after tousling it into the scalp. You really have to concentrate and not miss any spots, or else you&#x27;ll catch yourself in the mirror with a gray-brown patch later that day! The other complaint is that it smells like a grandmother&#x27;s house...can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it. Spray deodorant meets potpourri. But again, it doesn&#x27;t effect the functionality so you can get past the smell. :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I use it every other day and I put it on before i go to sleep at night so I wont end up with white powder in my hair in the morning.  I have medium brown and it tends to look greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it every day.  When I use this stuff I can go two, maybe even three days without washing it.  I also do a quick fix on my hair in the morning by getting it slightly wet and re-drying it and it holds up to that.  The only bad thing is that my hair is a bit flat, but it&#x27;s better than having to wash it every night.</li>
            <li> I have never been compeled to write a review until now! This stuff changed my life!!! I have never found a dry shampoo that does what this can do, it leaves my hair soft and full and smelling great!  I have been having issues with hair fall because I wash it every day, not any more, I can go 3 days without washing and my hair is fuller and thicker than ever, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> my mom made me stay long hair, and it is really not convince for take a shower or washing them during winter, since during Dec will be really cold and freeze, I hate when you get out the shower and just... freeze in the bathroom. But when you have a long hair, you have to wash them at least twice or three times a week, especially mine, otherwise they will be oily and really dirty disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, once I did not wash my hair for a week, but it is completely not oily or dirty, after you spray them in the hair and massage for 30 sec, hairs will be fluffy and smell good. even my mom did not notice I did not wash my hair for a long time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD For LAZY GIRLS who have LONG HAIR in WINTER!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Tigi dry shampoo ($15) and R &amp; Co Desert dry shampoo ($25) and the Batiste is better than both! I wish I would&#x27;ve found it sooner, I&#x27;ve used Tigi brand for years. This one has more aerosol than the others and helps spread it throughout my roots. It looks slightly white-ish when you first spray it but that disappears when you run your fingers through your hair/style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents!</li>
            <li> I have blond, thin hair that becomes greasy after only one day :(&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, this dry shampoo really holds it together! I go an extra entire day without needing to wash my hair. Some days, you just want to get up and get out! And with Batiste Dry Shampoo, I can.</li>
            <li> Great for late in the day when my hair starts getting grease just spray it in and helps. Wouldn&#x27;t use it instead of showering if I had the time but woulds well as a quick fix if your in a rush.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used! No perfume smell or sticky feel. Absorbs excess oil easily and helps updos have more body. A must have for every bathroom cabinet!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use this product for &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34; in between hair washes, but it only works well for a few hours, and by the time I get home from school/work my hair already looks greasy again. I have naturally oily hair that needs to be washed at least every other day, so this product wasn&#x27;t as beneficial for me. My friend swears by it though so maybe its a hair type thing.</li>
            <li> I have oily fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every morning and it helps control oil and even helps add some volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am addicted to this stuff and even keep a small one in my purse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the expensive stuff, the cheap stuff, and everything in between. This is by far the best! It smells fresh, works great, gives good lift, and is a great price.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  Especially if you are trying to grow your hair long.  I used to wash my hair every day and it was just too damaging - causing all kinds of split ends.  I can go 3 days without washing and Batiste keeps it looking and smelling fresh.  But you gotta really massage it in after spraying or it looks white.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair looks like straw. Even though I am blonde, we could see the white powder even after brushing and brushing the hair.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Works fine with my short-ish medium weight hair.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really do well for styling, read:removing bedtime cowlicks.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is OK, wish I had chosen apple or something though.</li>
            <li> Leaves a little dustiness in my blonde hair but it shakes out after you brush it a bit. Smells good and works great!</li>
            <li> First time trying dry shampoo and am very pleased! Great scent, easy to use, quick, and gets the job done! Was a bit hesitant at first since I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews on the visible residue on dark/black hair, but it works just fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly oily hair and only like to wash it every other day. On the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair, it is slightly greasy looking, especially my bangs. I shake and spray in moderation and I instantly see the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for about a month now and am so glad I made the purchase. My only complaint, which may be something I did wrong during application, is that there was one time where I got a slight residue right after applying. It looked like tiny flakes in my hair. Honestly, barely noticeable. I just dabbed some water on a towel and wiped my hair on it. Came out very easily and never had it happen again.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite beauty product I have ever owned, and believe me, that is a BIG statement. I swore off dry shampoos years ago after trying products that my friends suggested to me (suave, dove, tresemme). All of those ended up being flops that either left my hair greasy, or had an unbearable lingering powerful scent. I was a religious daily shampoo-er until I found this beauty. I will NEVER go back. My second day hair looks better than my freshly washed hair!!! It looks so natural and flowy and pretty and sooo clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really THICK and super oily dark dark brown hair. My hairstylists are always so amazed (and frustrated) by how thick my hair is, but I have had no problems with this dry shampoo! The scent isn&#x27;t lingering, but I like the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent one the most. I haven&#x27;t tried the one for dark hair because the reviews say that it stains a lot and, knowing myself, I would get that **** everywhere. So I&#x27;ll stick with &amp;#34;fresh.&amp;#34; If you follow the directions and spray at least 6 inches from your head (and shake it a lot, constantly), it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. When I use it it gets really white on my roots right after I spray it, but if I leave it for a few minutes or try to rub it in then it&#x27;ll go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you aren&#x27;t a believer in dry shampoos yet, then try this and you will immediately change your mind. Or if you love dry shampoo but are looking to switch to a new one.... stop looking. This one is easily the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that when you spray it its super LOUD! I&#x27;ve never noticed a spray can being this loud before. I live with my family and I seriously can&#x27;t use this in the morning because I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll wake them lol. But that&#x27;s not much of a complaint, just something I noticed! This is still the best dry shampoo ever!</li>
            <li> So glad I found this dry shampoo. I love it! It&#x27;s a great product , especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Transforms my slightly oily hair to fresh, light and bouncy!  Gives me a couple extra days between washes.</li>
            <li> Absorbs oil but not the best product. Makes my hair (darker blonde) look gray even when I brush through and heat it up with the hairdryer. Seems to work well for others but I prefer other products.</li>
            <li> Smelled like mildly scented talcum powder on my head.  I have thick (male) shoulder-length hair that gets oily after a couple of days.  I should say that I only tried to use it once, and won&#x27;t again.  Didn&#x27;t make my hair feel better, and I felt like I was wearing a powdered wig, even after a &amp;#34;hundred-stroke&amp;#34; brush out (or two).  Probably wasn&#x27;t any powder residue at that point, but it hadn&#x27;t removed much (if any) oil and it still smelled like talcum powder.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product! It does take the oil out from not washing your hair but instead it gives you basically a white crusty dandruff. It&#x27;s just not worth it to me to pick white flakes out of my hair the whole day after I use it. It feels like dried glue to be honest. It is very noticeable as well. Just stay away from this stuff and try something else, you&#x27;ll regret it if you buy it</li>
            <li> Keep trying other products, but Batiste is the best. Adds volume between shampoos too.&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin hair, the colored versions help hide bald spots.</li>
            <li> I have tried other dry shampoos.  This is the winner!</li>
            <li> Fine, but ran out pretty quickly - only got 2 weeks of use (at most) out of one bottle.  Scent is also a little too sweet and overpowering for me.</li>
            <li> This was great for the hospital.  Worked great for the purpose it was serving.</li>
            <li> Stuffs the cure when you&#x27;ve bed head and a shower/shampoo is a no go. Only wish the bottle were more of a pump; it espressos a lot of product with minimal pressure and cfc&#x27;s I believe are not an issue here. In short, go lightly, chill and shag / brush it through. A cowlick lifesaver on bad days.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my dark hair look gray, the scent is not overpowering (can even be used by a guy). Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try this dry shampoo. I kept seeing people talk about how great it was and for some reason, I&#x27;d always end up getting a different brand at the store- always to my disappointment. Other dry shampoos left my hair very stiff and almost nastier than it started out. Not this one. It has a nice slight scent and makes your hair good as new. Just restyle a little and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> Very handy. Would buy again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I&#x27;ve gone up to 5 days without washing my hair and a few spritz of Batiste and my hair looks fresh and clean. There is no residue, it smells clean, and my hair looks and feels clean. This is great for someone who wants to keep their hair looking fresh a few days longer between washes. I live in a very humid climate so if i was in a dryer area it might last longer. Definitely worth your money!!!</li>
            <li> Left a white residue in my hair. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> The product works fairly well. I applied it onto my greasy roots and my hair looked cleaner but was still a little oily at the ends. I have dark hair and did notice that there was a grayish residue but that cleared up after rubbing it into the hair. Not a disappointment but could be better.</li>
            <li> I could not live without this dry shampoo!!  I recently went blonde and my hair is super dry and fragile.  I have really oily hair so i used to wash it almost every day.  I decided to only wash it twice a week from now on to battle dryness.  When my roots are oily, i spray a little of this dry shampoo on and it looks perfectly matte!  So amazing.  My only advice would be to cover your mouth and nose when you use it, aerosol tends to be a little strong.  Smells amazing though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never weighs my hair down! So affordable too!</li>
            <li> It works on greasy hair but it&#x27;s little powdery. It makes my hair turn to white. I do not like the odor. But I still use it rarely when I need to hurry.</li>
            <li> It works, it makes my hair functional and doesn&#x27;t make it look too gray.  My problem is with the smell of this stuff.  I can smell the odor of this stuff hours after I use it, and I really don&#x27;t like the smell.  When I do use it I can&#x27;t wait for the opportunity to have time later to wash it out.  I won&#x27;t be getting this again, and have just as good results using plain corn starch the night before.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! Totally refreshes my hair and smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work very well-I&#x27;d use it in a real emergency dirty hair day but it leaves a visible residue without substantially  reducing oil.</li>
            <li> It works. It leave a white residue on dark clothes sometimes. I&#x27;ll finish the one I ordered, but I am not going to buy this one again. I hate strong smells, so this one is good when it comes to that, it has a scent, but nothing bad and its not strong. But I like other ones I have gotten better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other dry shampoos besides this one and so far, this one&#x27;s still the winner. One didn&#x27;t make my hair look clean and the other made my hair feel like straw. I&#x27;ve even used Batiste two days in a row, which is impressive since I have oily skin and hair. The only trick is, if you have dark hair, really make sure you brush it out well or you&#x27;ll look a little gray. Sometimes I follow with a bit of glossing serum to counteract that issue.</li>
            <li> It definitely does the job of making hair less greasy and more presentable. However, it leaves white powder on your hair. Not a huge deal- it brushes out fairly easily, but based on all the positive reviews I was hoping that this brand would be better in that way. Maybe its just unavoidable with dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> I would have to say that after several uses of this item, it works better than PSSSTT did for me.  Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell to it on your hair and does what it is supposed to do.  Think I found a keeper!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave the whiteness on your hair like most dry shampoos. Actually leaves my hair looking like it is clean!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. never want to be caught without it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It provides volume and clean hair on those between shampoo days. It is also a great texturizer that provides extra hold for up dos. It smells good too!</li>
            <li> This product is the absolute best. I do have blonde hair so it blends nicely with my hair and i still that &amp;#34;just washed&amp;#34;  look after not washing my hair for a few days!!! Great purchase.</li>
            <li> love this dry shampoo!!</li>
            <li> I am attempting to wash my hair less.  This was the only dry shampoo that sounded good enough to try.  It took me only a few tries to get the technique right.  I have very oily hair, but it is less oily now that I only wash every other day.  I use this on the &#x27;off&#x27; days and my hair is very managable.  I love the original scent.  It&#x27;s great.  I would recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t love the tropical scent...it smells awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of dry shampoo, none hold a candle to this brand. I really love my Batiste Dry Shampoo because it actually works when I have greasy hair, and it works quickly. In the past I&#x27;ve used Oscar Blondi&#x27;s dry shampoo and a few other brands. Those never really took the greasy look out of my roots. I have fine hair, hair I have to wash every day, but I want to find a way to slowly extend the time between washes because I know it&#x27;s not healthy to wash it every day. So this is my new solution. And honestly, no one can tell. It also smells decent. Definitely, if you are looking for a good dry shampoo, this is it.</li>
            <li> I’m not easy to impress and i have blown thru tons of products that fail to meet expectations. I have tried other dry shampoos and hated them! My dark brown hair is baby fine and too delicate to wash every day but my ends frizz and my roots get oily quickly and I do not like going to work unmade. Also, I do a Brazilian Blowout 3 times a year to keep it long and strong and every wash removes a little of the treatment, so I though I would try one more time to find an alternative. I am glad I did!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my research and learned the techniques for applying the product 1) Shake it hard!! 2) use short bursts at the roots and do not hold can too close to your head! 3) shake between short bursts as you apply so first, shake burst, shake, 4) massage into scalp well, like she you use  wet shampoo. I also treated my ends and touched them up with a low heat flat iron prior to treatment, then blow dried my head upside down on low heat after treatment, VIOALA!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*(make sure while you apply the product your parting your hair and only spraying the scalp! It’s not hair spray, you don’t spray your entire head, only where you need it. As you brush it out the remaining oils will be removed. If your head is great and your ends are dry you used too much or you didn’t apply it properly. You can always add more, but you can’t take it out unless you have time to shower so try a little and do a second round if needed until you get used to the product!!! I was able to do my hair 3 days in a row!!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No great powdery appearance, no sticky residue just fresh clean hair like leaving the salon!!! I am impressed and will be an avid user from now on!!! Also, if your hair is baby fine like mine, add a little to dry hair even if it’s clean and blow-dry upside down to maximize the volume!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first type of dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s been working great so far.  I have black hair and haven&#x27;t noticed any white flakes or anything that I&#x27;ve seen people complain about when trying to use dry shampoo with dark hair.  This is my second bottle and I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. I previously used Blow Pro&#x27;s dry shampoo, but it wasn&#x27;t available on Prime, so I gave Batiste a try. It just doesn&#x27;t produce the same results that I experienced with the Blow Pro product. I feel like I have to use a lot more of the Batiste. Also, this goes on wet and I have to wait for it to dry before massaging in and styling, so it takes more time to use. I&#x27;ll pay for the shipping of the Blow Pro dry shampoo from now on--it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product because it leaves a lot of white residue. There are much better dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, my favorite dry shampoo.  And I&#x27;ve tried them all.  It hides itself well in even dark hair, smells good and clean and reduces grease perfectly.</li>
            <li> I wish different colors and types were sold separately, because they are so... different! Mine is vivid red. It looks fantastic on my dark brown hair, an instant washable highlight when I need it, adding warmth to my hair to match my warm skin tone and allowing for a lot of experimentation. Priceless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, my boyfriend loves the look, but hates hates hates the smell. So it&#x27;s OK for emergency use, say, for keeping in the car; but you never know whom else you will offend with the smell. (Which does not bother me btw).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come to think, I don&#x27;t think &amp;#34;allergic&amp;#34; is the right word. I think he is just sensitive to the chemicals in the formula. So maybe the formula is not fantastically healthy, it&#x27;s just the rest of us go symptom-free?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful to this shampoo for the instant makeover it did and for its emergency value, but I am on the market for organic dry shampoos. Tried corn starch - yes, it absorbs oil very well, but it also adds a greyish hue to my hair dark hair, which can be &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; removed with a lot of brushing, but I don&#x27;t think it exactly makes me look younger. Considering rye, rice, arrowhead root, cocoa powder as ingredients to play with.</li>
            <li> Finding cruelty free dry shampoo is a hassle in of itself, but finding one that actually works was a challenge that took me well over a year to find. This little bottle definitely takes the cake! I have dark brown hair, and yes it sprays on grey but comb your hair and its gone. The smell is great also!</li>
            <li> this is the best dry shampoo of all time. it is the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cake up in my roots and I am able to run my fingers through my hair easily after using. I&#x27;ve tried the other scents by this brand also and I love them all.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another dry shampoo brand again. This was the first time I&#x27;d bought batiste and the clean and classic is an amazing product. I have since switched the Batiste&#x27;s dry shampoo for brunettes as I have almost-black hair and the white dry shampoo unfortunately accentuates my gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if my hair isn&#x27;t greasy, I&#x27;ve found myself using this on a daily basis for some extra volume. It goes on in a thin layer and then brushes easily through your hair. I have a problem with this one greasy spot on my head (I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist, I found a great shampoo to use and it usually works great, but when it doesn&#x27;t my greasy spot ruins my day.) With Batiste- it&#x27;s like I have a sidekick with super powers- it blasts my greasiness away. It&#x27;s seriously saved many of my days from a bad hair day- which is a big deal. Bad hair day &#x3D; bad day. Batiste &#x3D; all the good days!</li>
            <li> I have tried other dry shampoo brands in the past and this is by far the best one I have used so far.  This brand doesn&#x27;t leave white residue in your hair which is annoying to get out when you have dark brown hair. I found it works best when I spray it on at night before I went to sleep. I will be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> Item arrived right on time and was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I used to rub baby powder into my hair as a dry shampoo, but I decided to give this a try. I think it&#x27;s fantastic. I have long, oily hair that I have to wash every night. With this product I only have to wash my hair every other day now. I spray around my roots and rub the product in to disperse it. My hair feels silky smooth with no oil at all. The smell is fine, just a fresh scent, nothing strong or overly fragrant. I have black hair, and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with white cast. Just make sure to rub the product in well. Will definitely keep this in my arsenal from now on.</li>
            <li> Too powdery! I might as well sprinkle talc on my head. Even with a light application following the instructions, I found this product unsatisfactory. The smell is great, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo on the market. Have tried probably every dry shampoo out there. Highly recommend. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel that weird feeling after some dry shampoos. Doesn&#x27;t make it greasy. reslly the closest dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used without having to wash your hair again. :)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo I have used, especially for the price. When you spray it on your hair make sure you hold the can far enough away from your head and rub/brush your hair out so no white residue remains. It also smells great and I will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> Tried other brands, this is the best. Truly looks like you have freshly washed hair. The other brands give a visible difference that you just sprayed product into your hair.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it and it gets rid of the grease.  My oily hair gets greasy easily. If I have to rush to work, this dry shampoo saves my day.</li>
            <li> I understand and somewhat agree with other criticisms about the residue. But I have blonde hair and it is not as much of an issue for me. It&#x27;s a good product on days that I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair. But do not expect your hair to feel like it does right after washing it. It works, but not as well as shampoo. Once you manage your expectations I think you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this dry shampoo. I&#x27;m probably on my 10th can of it so far. Ordered from Amazon because I&#x27;m having a hard time finding it in the local stores. It helps keep my hair looking great on the 2nd or 3rd day (don&#x27;t judge) after shampooing and gives my hair more volume and control. The smell is akin to fruit loops but I only find it noticeable when applying. I apply this to the top of my hair and the hairline, let it sit a minute, rub it in, and then brush it out. I have highlighted blonde hair so I only notice the slightest whiteish cast once it&#x27;s brushed out. I could defintely see how it would be a problem though for someone with darker hair. Know Batiste makes a darker version for brunettes. I&#x27;ve tried many other dry shampoos and always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair a bit grey if you have dark hair but that&#x27;s because you gotta kinda massage your hair for it to go away. After that my hair oiliness goes away (not as much as actual shampoo, obviously) so I am happy with this dry shampoo for those lazy days, or days where I am in a rush. It does get the job done.</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo!  Every other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried without hurting my wallet wouldn&#x27;t help my bangs from looking greasy, which was the part I really wanted to fix.  It sprays white initially, but when you brush it through your hair a little, the white goes away and your hair looks grease-less (natural redhead).  I am definitely buying this again!</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the hoopla is about. This is okay, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used. In fact, I&#x27;d even say that Suave&#x27;s is better--and it&#x27;s cheaper too.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works great</li>
            <li> When I had surgery and was unable to wash my hair for 12 days, I was hoping this would help.  I had heard some  negative things about dry shampoo, but this product exceeded all of my expectations!! Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Perfect for when showering is not an option</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best that I have used.  The quality and the  scent was very appealing.</li>
            <li> I have fine, oily hair and in the past have had to wash almost everyday. This works surprisingly well....it gets rid of the oiliness and my hair looks as though it was washed!  It&#x27;s so much better for my hair to be able to go a day or two before washing it again....I&#x27;m so glad I can do that now.</li>
            <li> not only do you not have to wash your hair everyday, it gives you wonderful volume.  nothing else will give my fine hair volume without making it look greasy.  i just wish they could make a translucent powder somehow.  i&#x27;ve purchased this and the brunette version.  the brunette version will stain your hands brown if you try to rub the dry shampoo into the roots.  this version is much better, but i do wish that it sometimes didn&#x27;t spray as much white powder.</li>
            <li> White crap everywhere. And really dulled my hair. Smells good, though.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, easy to use and with a clean scent  it allows you to rush in those mornings or trips you just don&#x27;t have the time to wash and style you hair, of if you need to keep an expert hair do for an extra day!</li>
            <li> IT HELPS ALOT FOR PPL THAT DONT HAVE THAT MUCH TIME TO WASH THEIR HEAD, OR FOR THOSE WHO TAKE CARE OF THEIR HAIR TO MUCH AND DONT WASH IT TOO OFTEN, OR FOR LAZY PPL THT JUST DONT WANT TO WASH THEIR HEAD.IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I could never follow the &amp;#34;don&#x27;t wash your hair every day&amp;#34; rule because of how oily my scalp gets - but this stuff completely solves it.</li>
            <li> great stuff! I can see why it&#x27;s Britain&#x27;s #1 seller. I use this on my off-wash days and it keeps my bangs from looking greasy, doesn&#x27;t make my hair look powdery, and it smells nice. So many other dry shampoos smell like I dumped a bottle of bad perfume on my scalp, and this is a nice fresh scent. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t look like white powder and smell bad like some others from the past. I would definitely buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Works but spray it close to your hair as it spays everywhere!</li>
            <li> How have I gone this long without this stuff? I&#x27;m always going to have dry shampoo in my life from now on, and I&#x27;ve heard this is the best brand from a couple of popular YouTube beauty gurus. My bangs &amp; top of my head get oily so fast, and I love how I can just spray a little of this on and I&#x27;m good to go. I am Caucasian with almost black hair; it makes my hair white when I spray it on, but just rub your fingers through your hair like you&#x27;re showering and it goes away. Another tip: a little goes a long way...don&#x27;t go too crazy spraying it. I probably do 3 sprays that last 1 second each.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. I have fine, thin, medium-dark brown hair. If I wash my hair at night and sleep on it, it gets oily...that fast. This product gives me clean, volumized hair and it does not feel weird like some of the drugstore brands I tried.This stuff is wonderful and works just like it says. If you have really dark hair you may have a harder time making it not look like you put powder in your hair but for medium to light hair, this is awesome. The fragrance is not bad or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Great dry shampoo. My favorite.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by another reviewer&#x27;s comment about it being flammable as basic hairspray is flammable. However, when my hubby brought this home from the grocery store for me (upon my request--no, he doesn&#x27;t hate me ;) ), I happened to glance at the ingredients and was shocked to see that the first three ingredients were butane, isobutane, and propane.  BACK TO THE STORE IT GOES!!!!  Ridiculous!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, they may be used because they&#x27;re &amp;#34;propellants&amp;#34;, but, seriously, check out what Wikipedia says about butane, as of the time of this posting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Inhalation of butane can cause euphoria [maybe that&#x27;s why everyone loves it!], drowsiness, narcosis, asphyxia, cardiac arrhythmia, fluctuations in blood pressure, temporary memory loss and frostbite, which can result in death from asphyxiation and ventricular fibrillation. Butane is the most commonly misused volatile substance in the UK, and was the cause of 52% of &amp;#34;solvent related&amp;#34; deaths in 2000.[11] By spraying butane directly into the throat, the jet of fluid can cool rapidly to −20 °C by expansion, causing prolonged laryngospasm.[12] &amp;#34;Sudden sniffer&#x27;s death&amp;#34; syndrome, first described by Bass in 1970,[13] is the most common single cause of &amp;#34;solvent related&amp;#34; death, resulting in 55% of known fatal cases.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere locally for this product, and couldn&#x27;t find it. This product is perfect and came in extra-safe packaging.</li>
            <li> While this is not going to take your hair from grease-bomb to a &amp;#34;just-washed&amp;#34; look, it will help you go an extra day without showering your hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo :)</li>
            <li> This is the best Dry Shampoo in the market. I tried bunch of other dry shampoo and didn&#x27;t get to feel as clean as using this product.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed to product, it is a pretty good dry shampoo. However, it arrived with a big hole/crack on the cap. So my review is for the seller, not just the product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good but have dark hair and it initially, makes my hair look gray, then dingy. I like Psssst better.</li>
            <li> I got this for a long international trip, to help keep my hair from looking too greasy. I had to spend a couple days on an airplane and didn&#x27;t want to look like a raggamuffin despite the journey. I have super thick, long hair and this stuff works like a miracle. Just make sure you spray it on at the roots and really brush it all out. It has a nice clean smell and made my hair soft to the touch. It helped me feel less disgusting amidst an already long journey! It still doesn&#x27;t beat a hot shower though (of course) but it does a great job for its purpose. Even my boyfriend used it--and he also has thick hair. Note that this bottle size is not the right size for carrying on to a plane. I had it in my luggage and between countries / customs, freshened up.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found, just a little pricy.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. I just recently went blonde from brunette and have been trying not to overwash my hair. I must say, I enjoy the texture of my hair after 3 days of not washing versus freshly clean! This stuff gives me TONS of volume and keeps my hair smelling nice as well. I really only use it at the crown at the roots and it works great.</li>
            <li> Seriously, not sure how I have gone through life so far without this product. Batiste has literally saved my life (or my hair for that matter). It doesn&#x27;t add a weird texture or tint to my hair and sucks up oil like a pro. Perfect for later day plans just spray and go!</li>
            <li> I can use this product 2 days in a row and not have to worry about chalky residue as long as I make sure to run my fingers through it a couple of times and comb it through. I had previously tried other dry shampoos that left my hair chalky either the first or second day of use and once the residue was there, there was nothing to be done about it.  This product is far superior and I definitely understand why so many people from other countries rave about it.  Wish it was available here in the states!</li>
            <li> Love this dry shampoo and I love the price even more!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! Not only does it make my hair not look greasy, but it makes it look so full and thick!  Sometimes I use this even when I&#x27;ve just washed my hair but it&#x27;s looking a little flat and lifeless.  This will now be a staple in my house.  I have dark hair and I do prefer the one with color added, as this color lightens my hair too much.  But it still works in a pinch.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and is perfect for those touch up moments or when life gets busy.  I wish that I had known of this sooner.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the original, even though it still works amazing. I def enjoy the cherry one more.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo at great price.Soaks up oil immediately. Makes hair thicker and more manageable. Bottle lasts longer than expected.</li>
            <li> I really wish we could give half stars, because I would have given a 3.5.  The product works just fine, but the size was a little smaller than I had hoped and it only lasted me a couple months.  (Granted my hair is very long and I have a lot of it.)  If you don&#x27;t shake enough or spray too close you will get some white residue, but nothing that you can&#x27;t brush out or towel off.</li>
            <li> My hair looks pretty clean!</li>
            <li> I have used some of the more popular brands of dry shampoo and this one has been the best so far.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have tried.  It has a nice light clean scent that does not overpower.  It makes a noticeable difference in my fine hair and gives it more body and the appearance of thickness.</li>
            <li> Love love love this dry shampoo. I had never used a dry shampoo before and this product has changed my life. I have oily hair that I need to wash at least every other day. With this dry shampoo I can get an extra day out of  wash if needed. It works right away to get rid of the oily roots, and as the day goes on I find my hair gets nicer and nicer. You cant feel it in, and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy or crusty or anything. Just spray in and style as usual. I will be using this for the rest of my life. I love it.</li>
            <li> my hair is as clean as it was when i got out of the shower! also there is so much product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Batiste products. It is the only dry shampoo I will use. Definitely happy with my purchase and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This was okay. Good for when I was ill.</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY, Wonderful treatment and I like the dry shampoo so much thank you.</li>
            <li> Buying a dry shampoo can be a daunting task since it requires your going out and buying (and buying and buying and buying…) many potentially worthless products until you get to the good one. I’m posting this review and will update it whenever I have any new product comparison to add to help those folks who need comparative feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: My hair is dark, thick, extremely long, and wavy with oily roots and dry ends. So please keep in mind the results may not be the same for you if your hair is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batiste dry shampoo Original: Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue. Doesn’t clean extremely well and thickens the hair due to the powdery deposit that’s hard to remove. Smells like nondescript citrus, unisex fragrance, similar to generic hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batiste dry shampoo Cherry: Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue. Doesn’t clean extremely well and thickens the hair due to the powdery deposit that’s hard to remove. Smells like red fruits but somewhat synthetic. I wouldn’t call this a juicy fruity smell that you sometimes get from good shampoos. The fragrance is on the feminine side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier Volume Extend dry shampoo: Leaves white residue but goes away as you massage you scalp clean. It doesn’t clean well, doesn’t volumize, and only serves to deodorize the hair. Smells exactly like most Garnier Fructis products; like tropical fruits &amp; citrus. Lovely &amp; refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbal Essences Color Me Happy dry shampoo: Absorbs the oil well as long as you dump a fair amount of the product into your hair. The unfortunate consequence of this “dumping” however, thickens and volumizes the hair to a point where it hurts to comb fingers through. Hair becomes hard and tough to style. Some folks with fine/limp hair may actually appreciate this. Smells exactly like HE Color me Happy shampoo. The fragrance is that of sweet roses. It is on the perfume-y and feminine side. Very lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing dry shampoo: Cleans very effectively without leaving any residue behind. Hair becomes silky and easy to comb through. Truly a “just washed and done” effect. Smells like nondescript powdery citrus. Smells generic but refreshing nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tresemme Fresh Start dry shampoo: Cleans effectively without leaving much of a residue behind. Hair becomes slightly thickened due to leftover powder so this may be good news for those of you who seek to add volume to your hair. Smells like bright, sweet citrus. The price point and availability at every corner makes this an attractive choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIGI Bed Head Matte dry shampoo: Cleans with low-to-mediocre effectiveness. Leaves behind quite a bit of white powdery streaks that can be eliminated by thorough brushing. Though, if you have wavy hair like me, you may not appreciate having to brush your dry, powdery roots. I always end up looking like part-broccoli / part-hedgehog after that is done. The smell is a syrupy sweet mango/vanilla concoction. It&#x27;s very strong AND persistent - you have been warned. :) The inexplicably high price makes it this a bad purchase for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this comparison helped you. Look out for updates as I continue to search for a great dry shampoo that doesn’t leave residue, cleans effectively, doesn’t make the hair rigid, smells awesome and, most important, one that is affordable.ance is that of sweet roses.

            <li> I have thin, straight, naturally light blonde hair and this product works great on those days when I don&#x27;t feel like washing my hair. However, because my hair is such a light color, I could see some white powder-like marks throughout my hair after using this product. It wasn&#x27;t too noticeable and I think it went away after a few hours.</li>
            <li> By far the best dry shampoo I have tried so far.  My hair feels soft after using it and not gritty like others have made it feel.  I would buy this again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> This is my perfect dry shampoo! Makes my straight hair perfect even when I don&#x27;t have time to wash it. It removes excess oil and smells amazing. The best part is that I can use it once in the morning and it lasts all day. I am considering buying this shampoo in bulk.</li>
            <li> This stuff gave my scalp frost bite. My skin hurt for a week after using it. NEVER AGAIN! (read the first few ingredients if you want to cringe.)</li>
            <li> Works great.  Smell is a bit strong at first but quickly goes away.</li>
            <li> This has changed my life.  Allows you to definitely extend the life of your blow out.  Highly recommended for busy moms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this dry shampoo only twice. I followed the directions to spray the shampoo, massage and then brush out my hair. I usually bend my head over and then spray and just lightly brush. My hair is not oily at all and looks fresh. I wish the smell was slightly pleasing, but after it goes on your hair, it pretty much just smells of just your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to describe its effect is that after using this product, my hair looks like it looks in the evening after a morning shampoo. My hair also doesn&#x27;t feel like its being weighed down by product at all, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think with this product I could go into 3rd day territory, but that might be risky for me. Washing my hair every other day will be just fine and will help my colored hair retain its color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used is L&#x27;oreal - and that smells nicer, but this does the job. May be I&#x27;ll try using both together.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  The first ingredient is butane, though, so you need to be ok with that.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a kid because chemicals get absorbed into the skin.  But if you need a quick fix now and then, this is the stuff to use.</li>
            <li> i like the product&#x27;s behavior a lot.  i did find the tinted version easier to work with though.  this one smelled great, but was just too hard to get all the white worked out of my hair.  however, if you have a little gray in your hair, this would be the perfect shade.  the silvery tint it gave to my hair was actually very pretty.  i hope my gray looks like that when it comes time!!</li>
            <li> it works and smells better than others i&#x27;ve tried (suave made me gag)&lt;br /&gt;but be careful to spray lightly because it does spray white.  this is noticeable especially because i have nearly black hair.&lt;br /&gt;other brands haven&#x27;t been quite as white but all the ones i tried did have some whiteness</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for the price but I personally prefer Klorane dry shampoo (the best one I&#x27;ve ever used and well worth the price).</li>
            <li> Excellent dry shampoo. I use baking soda as well to clean my hair. Both get the job done and takes any oil out of my hair instantly.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product since it is so popular - but it actually could not handle the oily-ness to my hair.  I would keep spraying and still felt like it wasn&#x27;t doing much.  It ran out rather quickly due to that issue..  I have tried other dry shampoos that do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I am very particular about smell and this one I can deal with everyday.  A clean smell and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> It does leave some white residue after using it but that&#x27;s OK. It removes extra oil from the hair. Just use a towel to get rid of the residue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a dry shampoo for months that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy and gunky. I&#x27;ve tried about 4 different products until I came upon this one. This is the absolute BEST dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair feels clean and light after I use it, which allows me to use it for 2 days in a row if needed. I try to wash my hair every 2-3 days, so this product is perfect. I&#x27;ll never go back to another dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> Nice product, it helps to keep your hair oil free for the day, in case you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty useful ESPECIALLY if you use it before bedtime because that gives it time to set in. And yes, it can put a cloudy color sometimes (if you spray too close) in your hair but I&#x27;m a fake blonde so when my roots are overgrown, this actually does me a favor! Also, I quit buying this on Amazon because it&#x27;s only like 6 bucks at TJ MAXX and they have a ton of different scents, although I&#x27;ve always been fine with the classic scent.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> It works...if you&#x27;re in between shampoos (not showers....please) it will freshen you up.</li>
            <li> Works as it should--such a life saver for after a morning workout and need to be places</li>
            <li> The only pros to this product are the smell  and the price. It doesn&#x27;t work to make hair feel clean. It sprays on powdery white and you work it through but hair still looks greasy, I&#x27;ve tried two other brands of dry shampoo and they both work wonderfully to take away the greasy hair look, I gave this a shot because of the reviews and the price but I honestly don&#x27;t understand how it has such good reviews because Oscar blandi or drybar dry shampoos are much better</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!! It is a must have! I have tried multiple dry shampoos and none of them compare to Batiste. They all left my hair feeling gritty and adding volume (kinda would feel like water was coming out too). This stuff I swear is just baby powder in a bottle. It left my hair feeling exactly the same but absorbing all the oils. Quite a bit of it does come out in spray and it&#x27;s pretty fast, do what it says and spray from a distance. But once you let it sit for a few minutes and then rub it in like you are washing your hair, it absorbs. I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Best Dry Shampoo yet! I have tried Dove, Tressemme(?), &amp;#34;Pfft&amp;#34;, and many others. Just hard to find at my local drugstores.</li>
            <li> I was recently shocked to discover that the dry shampoo I had been using forever was no longer available. And I have to admit that I was very hesitant about trying something new. But I did a little research and found this product on Amazon. The reviews were amazing so I decided to give it a try. Wow, is this stuff incredible! It smells fantastic and works like magic. I love washing my hair every other day...it&#x27;s actually much healthier. With Batiste no one is any the wiser. This dry shampoo is the BEST! My hair looks and smells so fresh and clean! Totally fantastic product....that would be even better (with a lower price)!!</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is not the best for individuals with dark hair. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for those with light hair. Even after following the directions it still leaves my hair looking a little lighter. I&#x27;m also not crazy about the smell. It smells like pine trees.</li>
            <li> A great product and no doubt the least expensive place to purchase!!  Delivery was Fast and Furious!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier....cant you tell :)</li>
            <li> Takes the shine away but super powerful coming out and turns my brown hair grey color. I have to really brush it out!</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell of this dry shampoo and the way it makes my hair look! I will definitely be buying more, would love to try other scents too!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it, but it just keeps turning my red hair lighter and dull.  I followed the advice and may try again, but i am not a fan of the texture and how stiff it is after i use it.  Since everyone else loves it maybe I am doing something wrong.  But i suggest you are careful and don&#x27;t use much if you have darker hair.</li>
            <li> definitely not for brown hair - great if you are a natural blonde or pretty much totally blonde. any sign of brown and you will end up with white blotches around your head!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several and I have greasy hair so this product works best and I don&#x27;t feel icky all day when I use it if I haven&#x27;t washed my hair. Not everyone likes the powder but I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is the best ! The Original Clean and Classic has a very pleasant smell, not overpowering. My new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Handy for fine hair that needs washing every day. Let&#x27;s me skip a day.l</li>
            <li> This is the very best hair shampoo! I found it at Urban Outfitters but buy it all the time now.  This was the first time I&#x27;ve bought original and I really like the smell.  Happy consumer.</li>
            <li> Fresh Scent - works as well as dry shampoo&#x27;s double the price. Does not leave white residue in my dark brown hair. Great value product.</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair and this stuff turned my hair grey. I brushed it and used the blow dryer on it to try and shake it out a bit, but still looked &amp;#34;touch of grey.&amp;#34; Going to try a different brand.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel a little greasy.  I have very fine hair so I&#x27;m not sure if it works well with this type of hair.</li>
            <li> I needed a dry shampoo and reviews and price lead me to this one. I wanted a more lifting &amp;#34;va va voom&amp;#34; , but no matter how much I teased with this product, all I got was &amp;#34;va&amp;#34;. The smell is alright, so if that&#x27;s your concern, hold your breath for a few seconds and it goes away, but unfortunately there was barely any difference. I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars because I&#x27;ll still keep it for those days when you can&#x27;t shower and those &amp;#34;desperate measures&amp;#34; days.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ANAZING.  I&#x27;m the pm type of gal who HAS to wash her hair every day, or else I risk being the gross greasy-haired lady.  Mi tried this stuff on a whim when I was on vacation, and I was able to go THREE DAYS without washing my hair....and I was not incredibly disgusting at the end of those three days.  Seriously....this is the greatest product ever.</li>
            <li> Upon first try, this spray has made my hair look grey, likely because my hair is dark. That is not a completely unusual effect, but it was worse than some of the other dry shampoos I have tried. I use water to lessen the effect, but I think I&#x27;m just removing the product. I&#x27;ll try it a few more times, but it may end up in the garbage like most of the other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried....</li>
            <li> It does dry up the oil &amp; give your hair volume which is especially great if you have very fine straight hair like myself, but it leaves a ashy residue.</li>
            <li> My favourite dry shampoo!  Nice and light and powdery vs the awful tresseme wet and heavy feel.  Trust me, you won&#x27;t go back!</li>
            <li> If you read my review of HeadBlade products, you know I&#x27;m not qualified to review this.  Luckily, my wife is.  She tells me that this is the best dry shampoo she&#x27;s ever used, by a long shot.  She&#x27;s recommended it to everyone including her hairdresser.</li>
            <li> It works wondefully. The only complaint I have is that if you use and then your hair gets wet, your hair is very hard and... Dusty? Its hard to explain. All in all I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different dry shampoos, from high end to Dove at the grocery store to try and help my 10 year olds greasy 2nd day hair.  This stuff is magic! I was a little taken aback at first when it went on so gray, but after a little rubbing it looked like we had just washed it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely thrilled with how well it works as well as the price.  It also has a fairly pleasant smell of all the different kinds we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an ok dry shampoo don&#x27;t know why is so expensive when I can get same thing same results way cheaper</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best dry shampoo in the world. My hair is fine and color treated, so it&#x27;s too fragile to wash every day, but it&#x27;s also oily, so when I skip a day I look a right mess. If I spray this stuff on at night before bed, I wake up with soft, fluffy, shampoo commercial hair instead of my usual greasy roots and bad attitude. I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive brands and not gotten near the results. Smell is not awesome, but not as strong as others.</li>
            <li> Works great. Comparing to all the other dry shampoo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried this one is the best. What I really like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel hard and my scalp doesn&#x27;t get itchy. I didn&#x27;t really like the smell, I think that&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 4 stars. Overall product was good. Just placed an order for another one of these but with a different scent.</li>
            <li> Made my hair sticky on top of being oily. Throwing it out.</li>
            <li> This is great dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> First time using dry shampoo, and it did exactly what I was expecting. Only wish I could have bought a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> Works very well! Comes out kinda powdery but it massages right in! My boyfriend thought my hair was freshly washed that morning! Wouldn&#x27;t recoomend with very dark hair</li>
