            <li>Very nice on the scalp...  </li>
            <li>Good quality, works great</li>
            <li>The applicator feels good against my scalp; it doesn&#x27;t scratch like a brush-style model and the rubber makes it easier to use.</li>

            <li>I have owned a Finn Scalp Invigorator and Shampoo Brush for most of my seventy-one years!  </li>
            <li>OMG, this brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>Buy one if you want to make your head feel amazing every morning and increase the value of your shampoo bottle 1000%</li>
            <li>Very good for promoting healthy new hair growth.</li>
            <li>(I am able to detangle by conditioning afterwards.)</li>
            <li>It has also been helpful with a flaky skin condition that I have on top of my forehead.</li>
            <li>Works on the dog as well so better get two...</li>
            <li>And the price is so cheap!</li>
            <li>Some might prefer more rigid or pointed teeth on a scalp brush, but it you like a milder experience</li>
            <li>Buy more than one.</li>
            <li>but I doubt they would work better, if not as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not scratchy at all and provides a lovely scalp massage plus, thoroughly cleans the scalp as well.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this brush</li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>The ring works better for holding in soapy conditions.</li>
            <li>Most would catch my hair</li>
            <li>Brush is ok.  </li>
            <li>I got hooked on shampoo brushes while in the Marines many years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love a shampoo brush</li>
            <li>Our dog loves these too so bath time for her is enjoyable too &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Glad I brought two.  </li>
            <li>(Why do I have to write two more words, it is just a shampoo brush and scalp invigorator)?</li>
            <li>I wish it had a better handle.</li>
            <li>That being said, however, it is not bad, and is still a nice addition to my shampooing routine.</li>
            <li>After trying the cheap plastic shampoo massage brushes, this was so much better that I tossed the plastic ones and kept this.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I was able to really get to my scalp with it and use it in every direction, with care-- mostly doing a kind of double-swipe over one area at a time, changing direction as I worked around my head.  </li>
            <li>and really like a good wash and something to stimulate the scalp.</li>
            <li>This product on the other hand is perfect!  </li>
            <li>Does a much better job  than fingertips can as it spins between my fingers to really clean my scalp during shampooing.</li>
            <li>it cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>THIS BRUSH MAY BE FINE FOR YOU</li>
            <li>I swear the scalp stimulation has increased my hair growth as confirmed by my beautician.</li>
            <li>It needs to be made of plastic to move smoothly through the hair.</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t get a good massaging action,</li>
            <li>If the ends of the bristles were pointed, this would be an excellent product because the bristles are not too stiff.</li>
            <li>NOW THAT&#x27;S A BRUSH THAT REALLY SCRATCHES MY ITCH !!!</li>
            <li>Easy grip and quick release.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the plastic brushes because for one thing, most of them  have finger rings or &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; on the handle making it easy to hold on to while in use.  </li>
            <li>--Original</li>
            <li>Originally made in Minnesota, they are now (like about everything else) manufactured in China,</li>
            <li>I originally had two -</li>
            <li>These feel good on the scalp and lets you get a deep clean.  </li>
            <li>Makes  a good personal gift...  </li>
            <li>Only diference a good one...</li>
            <li>Not a bad price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product where I used to get it in forever, but sure enough I found it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>It is the only one I have found that is gentle on the scalp, not scratchy like so many others, yet so effective.</li>
            <li>This product seems like a great idea but is a little stiffer/harder than anticipated.</li>
            <li>Most scalp scrubbers are too soft.</li>
            <li>I could not have been more surprised to see it pop up on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Makes a great unexpected present@</li>
            <li>I can only speak from my own experience.</li>
            <li>Will continue and see if all of this whoopla was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>For my type of scalp this brush is just about right.  </li>
            <li>For my short hair, this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s slight curvature allows it to fit nicely against ones scalp.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had gotten this handy deal a long time ago...</li>
            <li>I have a great deal of thick hair</li>
            <li>Now, many years later, I wondered if anyone still made it.</li>
            <li>I was pretty stoked about using the brush, because I get flakes from time to time.</li>
            <li>but it still works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>He grew up using his Dad&#x27;s and was blown away when I gave him this one which was exactly like the childhood one.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t give it more than 3 stars for the above mentioned reasons.</li>
            <li>So if this something your interested in do not hesitate to get it.</li>
            <li>Love it, also works well as a back scratcher/massager.</li>
            <li>The modern version didn&#x27;t work out very well and quickly ended up in the trash</li>
            <li>A good stiff one to give the scalp</li>
            <li>and I liked it, so this one was a bit of a letdown after using my other one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on my scalp yet it still manages to give my scalp a much needed soothing massage.</li>
            <li>I LOVE, I mean really LOVE to have my head scratched, to the point of blood.</li>
            <li>I did try a circular scrubbing action just to see what would happen and didn&#x27;t get tangled at all, but my hair is short &amp; layered (6 inches at its longest), and in good condition (natural texture is smooth, wavy and somewhat coarse).</li>
            <li>They feel good &amp; firm, not hard &amp; scratchy.</li>
            <li>The problem with the plastic one is that it felt like it would break easily &amp; if you had a lot of hair, more than a buzz cut, it would have a hard time going through your hair.  </li>
            <li>This one is not too rough on the scalp and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Roughly, that means I&#x27;ve used this applicator more than 550 times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, does the job well, and feels like it&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t itch as much anymore, and is not as oily/flaky.</li>
            <li>Have to be gentle when using it</li>
            <li>Thanks for asking.</li>
            <li>but I think you&#x27;d just need to be careful, and this brush would still a better choice than the others described.  </li>
            <li>I could not believe I really found this shampoo brush.  </li>
            <li>but when I got this one I felt the ends of the &#x27;bristles&#x27; and they are blunt cut and would really rip on the scalp</li>
            <li>I have become use to it and really like using it now.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cerebral palsy, which makes my motor coordination not the greatest, and I&#x27;ve not experienced the same thing.</li>
            <li>Water got trapped inside of it and mold grew, which is why I no longer own it.</li>
            <li>gentle enough not to hurt the head but strong enough to give the scalp a workout and really get the hair clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like the one he had before, but new.</li>
            <li>I made sure not to lose the other on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have long, curly, fine hair</li>
            <li>Finally thought to check Amazon and got this one (traditional) and a more modern version from another vendor.</li>
            <li>I had previously bought a plastic one from Amazon that had quite a bit more bristles.  </li>
            <li>Compared to a bristled applicator, this is much easier to keep clean and dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of plastic, not rubber like Morocco Method&#x27;s scalp massager which I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The rubber rinses clean and air-dries rapidly, so it won&#x27;t go mouldy or develop strange smells over time, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had with the bristled applicators.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a little peg on the top and two extruded rings.</li>
            <li>I really love this little scrubber.</li>
            <li>The ends of the bristles are cut flat and not polished, so they feel kind of sharp.  </li>
            <li>, really got deep and massaged your scalp pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using different scalp massagers &amp; shampoo brushes before, without success.  </li>
            <li>I know you could easily get a shampoo applicator at the local drug store or in Chinatown; my family actually initially baulked at me for specifically ordering this one off Amazon.</li>
            <li>I like the way it conforms to my hand and to my head, and the short bristles are just the right size &amp; shape to do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>My husband claims he can&#x27;t live without this now.  </li>
            <li>He needed a new one of these after he lost his on vacation</li>
            <li>Still looks brand new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s remained exactly the same.</li>
            <li>This is a basic, affordable product that does its job pretty well.</li>
            <li>WOW, what a difference it makes!  </li>
            <li>I am a man, and when my hair is short, this works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This bends the applicator slightly so it can conform with my scalp and holds it securely in place.</li>
            <li>That was 5 years ago, it&#x27;s used everyday and is still going strong.</li>
            <li>I use this type of brush while shampooing to clean down to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I bought it after I realised that I hadn&#x27;t been able to keep my scalp very clean using just my fingers (I&#x27;m male, have relatively long and thick hair, and short nails).</li>
            <li>I really like this brush so far, though I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  </li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s been nearly three years</li>
            <li>So far, this applicator has stayed with me through three holiday getaways and seems like it&#x27;s here to stay.</li>
            <li>The shape and layout are identical, but the material is a bit stiffer than the old ones.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU LIKE SOFT ROUNDED RUBBING FINGERS,    </li>
            <li>When my hair gets to medium length, it is more clumsy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be surprised if anyone uses it and doesn&#x27;t do damage.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, it arrived a couple of days later than promised, but it&#x27;s just what I wanted to massage my scalp during shampooing.</li>
            <li>The only issue I had is that I have a lot of long fine straight hair, and it was difficult to move the brush from place to place on my scalp as I would be able to were</li>
            <li>I would prefer the teeth to be a little more firm, the shape to be less concave, and for there to be more of a handle to hold onto, but that&#x27;s just my preference.</li>
            <li>The price is right, it&#x27;s simple, and it provides a nice little scalp massage without being too hard on the scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, all right, but the bristles are very wide at the tip, so it doesn&#x27;t give the stimulation to the scalp that I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li>My only suggestion is, if you have long hair that tangles easily, use it carefully or select another product.</li>
            <li>(Fitch) finally I thought it was time for a new one looker around</li>
            <li>This is such a simple device, but it really helps cleanse your scalp.</li>
            <li>It gives me more scrubbing power than using my nails, but not so much that it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Brush has short, hard rubber fingers more like that for pet care than human use.  </li>
            <li>38 year old son had looked for these locally.  </li>
            <li>nice, firm rubber rather than the usual plastic ones.  </li>
            <li>It does get tangled a bit in my crazy hair, but that&#x27;s because it moves stuff around, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I first bought one of these 25 yrs ago, and have been wnating a new one for the past 10 years or so.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the William Marvy Company&#x27;s products actually include barber poles (!), along with Mar-V-Side, that vivid blue liquid that the neighborhood barber stored his combs in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I said in my original review, there&#x27;s nothing really that can go wrong with a hunk of rubber.     </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do much research prior to buying this, and it may be the case that this is the wrong kind of brush for my hair (banana curls, very thin fine strands), but either way with the flat, stubby bristles</li>
            <li>this is cool but a little rough on my head.</li>
            <li>It really does invigorate your morning shower, and being made of a single piece of pliable rubber, should last a long time.</li>
            <li>tried it based on some other high rated reviews.  </li>
            <li>I find that makes me use less product than if I apply the shampoo or conditioner straight to my head.</li>
            <li>may work for long hair but for me, it was worse than my old cheap plastic one.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid hunk of rubber with no strange indentations where water or product could settle.    </li>
            <li>This scalp brush has large rubber knobby bristles which is not comfortable for my scalp.</li>
            <li>I tried another with fat, round \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; made of hard  plastic which didn&#x27;t have enough grip to do more than slide over/under my hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was able to really get to my scalp with it and use it in every direction, with care-- mostly doing a kind of double-swipe over one area at a time, changing direction as I worked around my head.  </li>
            <li> and really like a good wash and something to stimulate the scalp.</li>
            <li> This product on the other hand is perfect!  </li>
            <li> Does a much better job  than fingertips can as it spins between my fingers to really clean my scalp during shampooing.</li>
            <li> it cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> THIS BRUSH MAY BE FINE FOR YOU</li>
            <li> I swear the scalp stimulation has increased my hair growth as confirmed by my beautician.</li>
            <li> It needs to be made of plastic to move smoothly through the hair.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t get a good massaging action,</li>
            <li> If the ends of the bristles were pointed, this would be an excellent product because the bristles are not too stiff.</li>
            <li> NOW THAT&#x27;S A BRUSH THAT REALLY SCRATCHES MY ITCH !!!</li>
            <li> Easy grip and quick release.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the plastic brushes because for one thing, most of them  have finger rings or &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; on the handle making it easy to hold on to while in use.  </li>
            <li> --Original</li>
            <li> Originally made in Minnesota, they are now (like about everything else) manufactured in China,</li>
            <li> I originally had two -</li>
            <li> These feel good on the scalp and lets you get a deep clean.  </li>
            <li> Makes  a good personal gift...  </li>
            <li> Only diference a good one...</li>
            <li> Not a bad price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product where I used to get it in forever, but sure enough I found it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> It is the only one I have found that is gentle on the scalp, not scratchy like so many others, yet so effective.</li>
            <li> This product seems like a great idea but is a little stiffer/harder than anticipated.</li>
            <li> Most scalp scrubbers are too soft.</li>
            <li> I could not have been more surprised to see it pop up on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Makes a great unexpected present@</li>
            <li> I can only speak from my own experience.</li>
            <li> Will continue and see if all of this whoopla was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> For my type of scalp this brush is just about right.  </li>
            <li> For my short hair, this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s slight curvature allows it to fit nicely against ones scalp.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had gotten this handy deal a long time ago...</li>
            <li> I have a great deal of thick hair</li>
            <li> Now, many years later, I wondered if anyone still made it.</li>
            <li> I was pretty stoked about using the brush, because I get flakes from time to time.</li>
            <li> but it still works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> He grew up using his Dad&#x27;s and was blown away when I gave him this one which was exactly like the childhood one.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t give it more than 3 stars for the above mentioned reasons.</li>
            <li> So if this something your interested in do not hesitate to get it.</li>
            <li> Love it, also works well as a back scratcher/massager.</li>
            <li> The modern version didn&#x27;t work out very well and quickly ended up in the trash</li>
            <li> A good stiff one to give the scalp</li>
            <li> and I liked it, so this one was a bit of a letdown after using my other one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on my scalp yet it still manages to give my scalp a much needed soothing massage.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, I mean really LOVE to have my head scratched, to the point of blood.</li>
            <li> I did try a circular scrubbing action just to see what would happen and didn&#x27;t get tangled at all, but my hair is short &amp; layered (6 inches at its longest), and in good condition (natural texture is smooth, wavy and somewhat coarse).</li>
            <li> They feel good &amp; firm, not hard &amp; scratchy.</li>
            <li> The problem with the plastic one is that it felt like it would break easily &amp; if you had a lot of hair, more than a buzz cut, it would have a hard time going through your hair.  </li>
            <li> This one is not too rough on the scalp and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Roughly, that means I&#x27;ve used this applicator more than 550 times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, does the job well, and feels like it&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t itch as much anymore, and is not as oily/flaky.</li>
            <li> Have to be gentle when using it</li>
            <li> Thanks for asking.</li>
            <li> but I think you&#x27;d just need to be careful, and this brush would still a better choice than the others described.  </li>
            <li> I could not believe I really found this shampoo brush.  </li>
            <li> but when I got this one I felt the ends of the &#x27;bristles&#x27; and they are blunt cut and would really rip on the scalp</li>
            <li> I have become use to it and really like using it now.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cerebral palsy, which makes my motor coordination not the greatest, and I&#x27;ve not experienced the same thing.</li>
            <li> Water got trapped inside of it and mold grew, which is why I no longer own it.</li>
            <li> gentle enough not to hurt the head but strong enough to give the scalp a workout and really get the hair clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly like the one he had before, but new.</li>
            <li> I made sure not to lose the other on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, fine hair</li>
            <li> Finally thought to check Amazon and got this one (traditional) and a more modern version from another vendor.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought a plastic one from Amazon that had quite a bit more bristles.  </li>
            <li> Compared to a bristled applicator, this is much easier to keep clean and dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of plastic, not rubber like Morocco Method&#x27;s scalp massager which I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The rubber rinses clean and air-dries rapidly, so it won&#x27;t go mouldy or develop strange smells over time, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had with the bristled applicators.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little peg on the top and two extruded rings.</li>
            <li> I really love this little scrubber.</li>
            <li> The ends of the bristles are cut flat and not polished, so they feel kind of sharp.  </li>
            <li> , really got deep and massaged your scalp pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using different scalp massagers &amp; shampoo brushes before, without success.  </li>
            <li> I know you could easily get a shampoo applicator at the local drug store or in Chinatown; my family actually initially baulked at me for specifically ordering this one off Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like the way it conforms to my hand and to my head, and the short bristles are just the right size &amp; shape to do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> My husband claims he can&#x27;t live without this now.  </li>
            <li> He needed a new one of these after he lost his on vacation</li>
            <li> Still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s remained exactly the same.</li>
            <li> This is a basic, affordable product that does its job pretty well.</li>
            <li> WOW, what a difference it makes!  </li>
            <li> I am a man, and when my hair is short, this works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This bends the applicator slightly so it can conform with my scalp and holds it securely in place.</li>
            <li> That was 5 years ago, it&#x27;s used everyday and is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I use this type of brush while shampooing to clean down to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I bought it after I realised that I hadn&#x27;t been able to keep my scalp very clean using just my fingers (I&#x27;m male, have relatively long and thick hair, and short nails).</li>
            <li> I really like this brush so far, though I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  </li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s been nearly three years</li>
            <li> So far, this applicator has stayed with me through three holiday getaways and seems like it&#x27;s here to stay.</li>
            <li> The shape and layout are identical, but the material is a bit stiffer than the old ones.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU LIKE SOFT ROUNDED RUBBING FINGERS,    </li>
            <li> When my hair gets to medium length, it is more clumsy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be surprised if anyone uses it and doesn&#x27;t do damage.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, it arrived a couple of days later than promised, but it&#x27;s just what I wanted to massage my scalp during shampooing.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had is that I have a lot of long fine straight hair, and it was difficult to move the brush from place to place on my scalp as I would be able to were</li>
            <li> I would prefer the teeth to be a little more firm, the shape to be less concave, and for there to be more of a handle to hold onto, but that&#x27;s just my preference.</li>
            <li> The price is right, it&#x27;s simple, and it provides a nice little scalp massage without being too hard on the scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, all right, but the bristles are very wide at the tip, so it doesn&#x27;t give the stimulation to the scalp that I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li> My only suggestion is, if you have long hair that tangles easily, use it carefully or select another product.</li>
            <li> (Fitch) finally I thought it was time for a new one looker around</li>
            <li> This is such a simple device, but it really helps cleanse your scalp.</li>
            <li> It gives me more scrubbing power than using my nails, but not so much that it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Brush has short, hard rubber fingers more like that for pet care than human use.  </li>
            <li> 38 year old son had looked for these locally.  </li>
            <li> nice, firm rubber rather than the usual plastic ones.  </li>
            <li> It does get tangled a bit in my crazy hair, but that&#x27;s because it moves stuff around, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I first bought one of these 25 yrs ago, and have been wnating a new one for the past 10 years or so.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the William Marvy Company&#x27;s products actually include barber poles (!), along with Mar-V-Side, that vivid blue liquid that the neighborhood barber stored his combs in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I said in my original review, there&#x27;s nothing really that can go wrong with a hunk of rubber.     </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do much research prior to buying this, and it may be the case that this is the wrong kind of brush for my hair (banana curls, very thin fine strands), but either way with the flat, stubby bristles</li>
            <li> this is cool but a little rough on my head.</li>
            <li> It really does invigorate your morning shower, and being made of a single piece of pliable rubber, should last a long time.</li>
            <li> tried it based on some other high rated reviews.  </li>
            <li> I find that makes me use less product than if I apply the shampoo or conditioner straight to my head.</li>
            <li> may work for long hair but for me, it was worse than my old cheap plastic one.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid hunk of rubber with no strange indentations where water or product could settle.    </li>
            <li> This scalp brush has large rubber knobby bristles which is not comfortable for my scalp.</li>
            <li> I tried another with fat, round \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; made of hard  plastic which didn&#x27;t have enough grip to do more than slide over/under my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not too hard, just right.</li>
            <li> At first I felt it was too hard</li>
            <li> A must if you get weekly blowout or just have super thick hair!</li>
            <li> The ends of the bristles are cut flat, thus preventing them from reaching my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I live with the fact that my body does not throw off dead skin.</li>
            <li> I have to carefully massage a tiny patch at a time and lift the brush away from my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a dry scalp this winter season and this has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> I had to pull the brush away and put it back into my hair a few inches lower before starting over with massage circles.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s little bit scratchy, have tooth with sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend it for sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> ; the Invigorator has the sentimental charm of an old barber shop.</li>
            <li> The rubber is not particularly supple.</li>
            <li> This little number helped clear up my mom&#x27;s dry scalp build up issues in less than a week!  </li>
            <li> This is a little thicker than I like and the handle is quite short</li>
            <li> a brisk massage is getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> You could spent a lot of money on products for hair growth</li>
            <li> I had a friend in the military that used one of these</li>
            <li> I think he started using these in the military.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s total rubber construction allows for a firm, but flexible feel.  </li>
            <li> As for human use, they would probably be O.K, especially for someone with a thick head of hair....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s top making it very difficult to hold onto with soapy hands, and the brush material is much to stiff not nearly as flexible as I had</li>
            <li> There is a little nub with no flair to hold onto--totally inadequate especially given that other manufacturers all have included some type of loop.  </li>
            <li> little &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; are quite firm but not sharp or scratchy.</li>
            <li> The tongs on this are thick, short, and completely flat on the bottom, as if someone cut the bristles with a scissor, and as a result using it to massage my scalp knots my hair and breaks my brittle strands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since moved to the other side of the globe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an extremely well-made hunk of vulcanised rubber.</li>
            <li> There are other brands as well</li>
            <li> the bristles would bend or feel too sharp.  </li>
            <li> I feel this brush is extremely overpriced for just recieving one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is completely due to the shampoo brush and the circulation, but I still like the product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my scalp, and this product helps work the shampoo into my hair and slough off dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Personally it&#x27;s not right to me.</li>
            <li> My last shampoo brush was made of at least two pieces.</li>
            <li> (For reference, I have bra strap length thick, coarse curly hair)</li>
            <li> the nubs are so short they don&#x27;t go thru my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I guess they&#x27;re called bristles, but whatever the rubbery little nubs are, they are too short to make it through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this brush has firm hard rubber bristles which cause pain.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I feel as though I use less shampoo with this brush because it gets under the hair to my scalp the way my fingers could not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit bendy too, which I like because my head is slightly oblong.    </li>
            <li> The rubbery texture of this particular shampoo brush makes it difficult to comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> This does the job, and I have long thick hair so that helps to cushion the pokies -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to doctors, some say this and some say that, but over the 68 years it just boils down to my dead skin doesn&#x27;t come off by itself.</li>
            <li> I have found these hard to find as they are usually sold only to wholesalers or salons/barbershops.  </li>
            <li> I would have given five stars if the tips of the teeth were just a little sharper, but I still recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Inc.  Unlike plastic, these rubber scalp brushes don&#x27;t create little scalp cuts.  </li>
            <li> - one of those little things that can stay around for a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do, invigorate the scalp, although the ends of the nubs could be a little rounded that would make them poifect.</li>
            <li> A little getting use to, but have notice cleaner hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> would probably go with one that has longer spikes that are a little softer.</li>
            <li> Really quite awkward.</li>
            <li> Not shown in the product picture is the stubby cylindrical handle (not a ring) which enables it to be firmly scissor gripped between ones fingers.</li>
            <li> I am redoing my review now that I have used this shampoo brush for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> Firm but not scratchy.  </li>
            <li> The brush itself was way too stiff for me to use, it would hurt my scalp whenever I applied it and tried to manipulate it.</li>
            <li> I am not able to use it at all.</li>
            <li> This shampoo brush works no better than the flimsy plastic ones that can be had at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I am not really sure what this thing does or is supposed to do</li>
            <li> once owned another shampoo brush/scalp massager that was made of hard plastic</li>
            <li> and/or (depending on the type of plastic, flexible or hard)</li>
            <li> I hardly ever see any hair in the hair catcher anymore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews where people&#x27;ve complained that it&#x27;s hard to hold.</li>
            <li> This brush was a total disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It is of thick rubber with no grip to hold on to.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair (I get blow outs once a week)</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit stiff, making it a little painful in some spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I appreciate how at least some things haven&#x27;t changed!     </li>
            <li> Material of the brush is very hard on a scalp.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; are not radiused on the end; they have somewhat sharp edges, making the brush rather painful to use.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t really much to go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> This feature makes holding on to the brush unnecessarily difficult.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to grip, and the rubber was cracking.  </li>
            <li> This has nothing to do with the seller, but this scalp massager was very painful to use and scratched my scalp badly.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My client that was expecting the scalp massage brush was very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, all right, but the bristles are very wide at the tip, so it doesn&#x27;t give the stimulation to the scalp that I&#x27;m looking for.  Most scalp scrubbers are too soft. A good stiff one to give the scalp a brisk massage is getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading a rave review on xoJane.com. I&#x27;m still getting the hang out if. I have a great deal of thick hair and so it tangles my hair in the process of scrubbing my scalp. (I am able to detangle by conditioning afterwards.) I feel as though I use less shampoo with this brush because it gets under the hair to my scalp the way my fingers could not. It has also been helpful with a flaky skin condition that I have on top of my forehead. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Very nice on the scalp...  Well made sturdy...  Makes  a good personal gift...  Wish I had gotten this handy deal a long time ago...Works on the dog as well so better get two...</li>
            <li> My dad had one of these and I still remember the day I tried it. When I needed to use the dandruff shampoo, this rubber brush worked so well. Now, many years later, I wondered if anyone still made it. I could not have been more surprised to see it pop up on Amazon. And the price is so cheap! You gotta try this.</li>
            <li> Update (Feb. 18, 2015): It&#x27;s been nearly three years and I still use the same shampoo applicator. Roughly, that means I&#x27;ve used this applicator more than 550 times. It&#x27;s remained exactly the same. As I said in my original review, there&#x27;s nothing really that can go wrong with a hunk of rubber.     I&#x27;ve since moved to the other side of the globe. I appreciate how at least some things haven&#x27;t changed!     --Original Review Below--    I&#x27;ve had this wonderful shampoo applicator for about six months now. I bought it after I realised that I hadn&#x27;t been able to keep my scalp very clean using just my fingers (I&#x27;m male, have relatively long and thick hair, and short nails). So far, this applicator has stayed with me through three holiday getaways and seems like it&#x27;s here to stay. It&#x27;s an extremely well-made hunk of vulcanised rubber. It&#x27;s a bit bendy too, which I like because my head is slightly oblong.    Personally, I like putting shampoo onto the applicator then using it against my scalp. I find that makes me use less product than if I apply the shampoo or conditioner straight to my head. The applicator feels good against my scalp; it doesn&#x27;t scratch like a brush-style model and the rubber makes it easier to use. It gives me more scrubbing power than using my nails, but not so much that it&#x27;s uncomfortable. It feels rather like going to the salon and getting my hair washed.    Compared to a bristled applicator, this is much easier to keep clean and dry. The rubber rinses clean and air-dries rapidly, so it won&#x27;t go mouldy or develop strange smells over time, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had with the bristled applicators. There isn&#x27;t really much to go wrong with this one. It&#x27;s a solid hunk of rubber with no strange indentations where water or product could settle.    I&#x27;ve read some reviews where people&#x27;ve complained that it&#x27;s hard to hold. I&#x27;ve cerebral palsy, which makes my motor coordination not the greatest, and I&#x27;ve not experienced the same thing. There&#x27;s a little peg on the top and two extruded rings. I slide the peg between my ring and middle fingers, and grip the body. This bends the applicator slightly so it can conform with my scalp and holds it securely in place. I&#x27;ve never had it slip out of my hand or anything like that.    I know you could easily get a shampoo applicator at the local drug store or in Chinatown; my family actually initially baulked at me for specifically ordering this one off Amazon. Trust me. Get this one. It&#x27;s comfortable, does the job well, and feels like it&#x27;ll last forever. I&#x27;m extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> The ends of the bristles are cut flat and not polished, so they feel kind of sharp.  And they are short, so they can&#x27;t reach my scalp.  Very disappointed.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shampooing brush and messages and cleans scalp well.  I always use it when shampooing.  These are the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; that your hair-dresser uses when shampooing your hair in a salon.  Easy grip and quick release.  I have found these hard to find as they are usually sold only to wholesalers or salons/barbershops.  Makes a great unexpected present@</li>
            <li> Material of the brush is very hard on a scalp. Also it&#x27;s little bit scratchy, have tooth with sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend it for sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> My husband claims he can&#x27;t live without this now.  He&#x27;s hooked.  He uses it on his scalp and beard.</li>
            <li> These rubber hair/scalp scrubbers are not quite what I was looking for.  I wanted them to use to brush/massage my cats and I needed the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; to be closer together.  As for human use, they would probably be O.K, especially for someone with a thick head of hair....nice, firm rubber rather than the usual plastic ones.  But they don&#x27;t work well for my cats&#x27; hair!</li>
            <li> For my type of scalp this brush is just about right.  Some might prefer more rigid or pointed teeth on a scalp brush, but it you like a milder experience then the Flinn is for you.  I would have given five stars if the tips of the teeth were just a little sharper, but I still recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I first bought one of these 25 yrs ago, and have been wnating a new one for the past 10 years or so.  The shape and layout are identical, but the material is a bit stiffer than the old ones.  I&#x27;m still incredibly happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I was pretty stoked about using the brush, because I get flakes from time to time. It did work fairly well, really got deep and massaged your scalp pretty well. The only issue I had is that I have a lot of long fine straight hair, and it was difficult to move the brush from place to place on my scalp as I would be able to were I just massaging the shampoo in with my fingers. I had to pull the brush away and put it back into my hair a few inches lower before starting over with massage circles. If you have short hair this would be perfer</li>
            <li> I use this type of brush while shampooing to clean down to my scalp.  This might be great for massage but didn&#x27;t work too well for my purpose.</li>
            <li> OMG, this brush is amazing. It&#x27;s very gentle on my scalp yet it still manages to give my scalp a much needed soothing massage. Great for removing product buildup on the scalp.</li>
            <li> After trying the cheap plastic shampoo massage brushes, this was so much better that I tossed the plastic ones and kept this.&lt;br /&gt;The little &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; are quite firm but not sharp or scratchy. This is the pick of the litter of shampoo massage brushes,</li>
            <li> My husband likes the rubber scalp brush, he just wishes it had a finger hole instead of the post in the middle.</li>
            <li> These rubber brushes are the greatest thing since candy.  I have been using the same one for 30 years.  Originally made in Minnesota, they are now (like about everything else) manufactured in China, Inc.  Unlike plastic, these rubber scalp brushes don&#x27;t create little scalp cuts.  I buy them as gifts for people and family - one of those little things that can stay around for a lifetime.  Probably one of the best dandruff treatments you can find.  Buy more than one.</li>
            <li> The tongs on this are thick, short, and completely flat on the bottom, as if someone cut the bristles with a scissor, and as a result using it to massage my scalp knots my hair and breaks my brittle strands. I didn&#x27;t do much research prior to buying this, and it may be the case that this is the wrong kind of brush for my hair (banana curls, very thin fine strands), but either way with the flat, stubby bristles I cannot imagine how it&#x27;d reach anyone&#x27;s scalp through their hair.</li>
            <li> These are the best! I swear the scalp stimulation has increased my hair growth as confirmed by my beautician. It is the only one I have found that is gentle on the scalp, not scratchy like so many others, yet so effective. You could spent a lot of money on products for hair growth but I doubt they would work better, if not as well. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Does a much better job  than fingertips can as it spins between my fingers to really clean my scalp during shampooing.</li>
            <li> This is such a simple device, but it really helps cleanse your scalp. It doesn&#x27;t itch as much anymore, and is not as oily/flaky. It does get tangled a bit in my crazy hair, but that&#x27;s because it moves stuff around, which is a good thing. Kudos to whoever invented it. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the name: &amp;#34;marvy-cide&amp;#34; sounds like an insect spray.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Finn Scalp Invigorator and Shampoo Brush for most of my seventy-one years!  I originally had two - I got them as \\&quot;premiums\\&quot; when I bought Fitch Dandruff Remover Shampoo.  I somehow left one at a resort in Jamaica, when we headed home from vacation.  I made sure not to lose the other on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just today, I decided to see if there was anywhere that might still show this massager for sale.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered them on Amazon.Com!  I just ordered two and I&#x27;ll look forward to getting them in a couple of days!</li>
            <li> THIS BRUSH MAY BE FINE FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE SOFT ROUNDED RUBBING FINGERS,    BUT I NEED THE HEAD SCRATCHIN FEELING YOU GET WITH SCALP MASSAGE BRUSH BY \\&quot;DIANE\\&quot;. NOW THAT&#x27;S A BRUSH THAT REALLY SCRATCHES MY ITCH !!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product where I used to get it in forever, but sure enough I found it on Amazon!  This is a little thicker than I like and the handle is quite short but it still works pretty well.  There are other brands as well and I might try one of them in the future.</li>
            <li> Works great at exfoliating the scalp while shampooing.</li>
            <li> I really love this little scrubber. It&#x27;s not scratchy at all and provides a lovely scalp massage plus, thoroughly cleans the scalp as well. Very good for promoting healthy new hair growth. Perfect!</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do, invigorate the scalp, although the ends of the nubs could be a little rounded that would make them poifect.</li>
            <li> This does the job, and I have long thick hair so that helps to cushion the pokies - I want invigoration, but I don&#x27;t want to damage my scalp or hair.</li>
            <li> This is a basic, affordable product that does its job pretty well. My only suggestion is, if you have long hair that tangles easily, use it carefully or select another product. I can only speak from my own experience. The rubbery texture of this particular shampoo brush makes it difficult to comb through my hair. I have to carefully massage a tiny patch at a time and lift the brush away from my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once owned another shampoo brush/scalp massager that was made of hard plastic and I liked it, so this one was a bit of a letdown after using my other one. That being said, however, it is not bad, and is still a nice addition to my shampooing routine. The price is right, it&#x27;s simple, and it provides a nice little scalp massage without being too hard on the scalp. I would prefer the teeth to be a little more firm, the shape to be less concave, and for there to be more of a handle to hold onto, but that&#x27;s just my preference. I like that it cleans up easily. My last shampoo brush was made of at least two pieces. Water got trapped inside of it and mold grew, which is why I no longer own it. That is not a problem with this brush.</li>
            <li> This product seems like a great idea but is a little stiffer/harder than anticipated. Have to be gentle when using it</li>
            <li> I had a similar one for 40+ years (Fitch) finally I thought it was time for a new one looker around and this was the only one that came close.</li>
            <li> I just wanted a light-weight brush like I have had before.  Something that would stay on my hand while using it.  It is of thick rubber with no grip to hold on to.  Really quite awkward.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my scalp, and this product helps work the shampoo into my hair and slough off dead skin.  I&#x27;ve been really happy with this product...simple design, great price.  I think they&#x27;ve been making this brush for decades.</li>
            <li> I had a friend in the military that used one of these and I flashed back to that memory one day and ordered; and never been happier. I live with the fact that my body does not throw off dead skin. I use a file on my hands and feet, a scrubbie when showering and my nails on my scalp. I&#x27;ve been to doctors, some say this and some say that, but over the 68 years it just boils down to my dead skin doesn&#x27;t come off by itself. I LOVE, I mean really LOVE to have my head scratched, to the point of blood. I LOVE this brush, I will scratch and the prongs are rubber and blunted meaning less/no damage to my scalp. My morning shower is Heaven. It is beyond my expectation!</li>
            <li> A friend turned me onto this.  WOW, what a difference it makes!  My scalp tends to get flaky, but now that I use this, I notice that I can go longer between hair washings and there&#x27;s no flakes.  It feels great, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got happy scalp !</li>
            <li> Good quality, works great</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  Buy one if you want to make your head feel amazing every morning and increase the value of your shampoo bottle 1000%</li>
            <li> These have the larger bristles. I am a man, and when my hair is short, this works pretty well. When my hair gets to medium length, it is more clumsy to use. Personally it&#x27;s not right to me.</li>
            <li> The brush itself was way too stiff for me to use, it would hurt my scalp whenever I applied it and tried to manipulate it. I am not able to use it at all.Thanks for asking.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this brush has firm hard rubber bristles which cause pain.&lt;br /&gt;This may work for long hair but for me, it was worse than my old cheap plastic one.&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is that it does not have a finger ring like others I have used, rather it has a protrusion to hold between your fingers. The ring works better for holding in soapy conditions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using different scalp massagers &amp; shampoo brushes before, without success.  Most would catch my hair so I couldn&#x27;t get a good massaging action, and/or (depending on the type of plastic, flexible or hard) the bristles would bend or feel too sharp.  I tried another with fat, round \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; made of hard  plastic which didn&#x27;t have enough grip to do more than slide over/under my hair.  I really like this brush so far, though I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  I was able to really get to my scalp with it and use it in every direction, with care-- mostly doing a kind of double-swipe over one area at a time, changing direction as I worked around my head.  I did try a circular scrubbing action just to see what would happen and didn&#x27;t get tangled at all, but my hair is short &amp; layered (6 inches at its longest), and in good condition (natural texture is smooth, wavy and somewhat coarse). So I can&#x27;t say how this would work for someone with really long, thick, fine, or dry hair, etc. but I think you&#x27;d just need to be careful, and this brush would still a better choice than the others described.  I like the way it conforms to my hand and to my head, and the short bristles are just the right size &amp; shape to do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  They feel good &amp; firm, not hard &amp; scratchy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo brush works no better than the flimsy plastic ones that can be had at Walgreens. The rubber is not particularly supple. The \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; are not radiused on the end; they have somewhat sharp edges, making the brush rather painful to use. There is no ring on the back to put a finger through. Instead, there is a short rubber stud that goes between the fingers. This feature makes holding on to the brush unnecessarily difficult.</li>
            <li> This scalp brush has large rubber knobby bristles which is not comfortable for my scalp. Quality manufacture though. Not a bad price.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair (I get blow outs once a week) and really like a good wash and something to stimulate the scalp. This does the trick. Scald feels great after. A must if you get weekly blowout or just have super thick hair!</li>
            <li> 38 year old son had looked for these locally.  Not found.  He grew up using his Dad&#x27;s and was blown away when I gave him this one which was exactly like the childhood one.  Not too hard, just right.</li>
            <li> Brush is ok.  Brush has short, hard rubber fingers more like that for pet care than human use.  I did not like it and returned it.</li>
            <li> My husband likied the brush that we purchased.  We bought several different kinds and it was one of his favorites</li>
            <li> I feel this brush is extremely overpriced for just recieving one. It doesn&#x27;t come with a ring/loop to put a finger through to make it easier to handle. It does however do it&#x27;s purpose. I&#x27;ve had a dry scalp this winter season and this has helped a lot. (For reference, I have bra strap length thick, coarse curly hair)</li>
            <li> For me the performance is not to my liking.  I much prefer the plastic brushes because for one thing, most of them  have finger rings or &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; on the handle making it easy to hold on to while in use.  This one only has a rounded peg type handle centered on it&#x27;s top making it very difficult to hold onto with soapy hands, and the brush material is much to stiff not nearly as flexible as I had desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it based on some other high rated reviews.  I got hooked on shampoo brushes while in the Marines many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Can&#x27;t give it more than 3 stars for the above mentioned reasons.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo brush I have ever used! This one is not too rough on the scalp and very comfortable. Trust me some are not.</li>
            <li> I guess they&#x27;re called bristles, but whatever the rubbery little nubs are, they are too short to make it through my thick hair. Plus, they&#x27;re &amp;#34;squared off&amp;#34; on the tips so they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;penetrate&amp;#34; and I doubt my scalp will be getting the benefits of this &amp;#34;invigorator.&amp;#34; Unless this is something you specifically know you want, my vote would be to save your money.</li>
            <li> I  received 5 disposable shaving brushes. My client that was expecting the scalp massage brush was very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I could not believe I really found this shampoo brush.  It is just like the one I used at home when I was a kid...even the color is the same.  Only diference a good one...it was rubber then and vinyl now.  And it works the same...gentle enough not to hurt the head but strong enough to give the scalp a workout and really get the hair clean. Oh....and that was 70 years ago when I last used one.  Great product still!!</li>
            <li> Love a shampoo brush but when I got this one I felt the ends of the &#x27;bristles&#x27; and they are blunt cut and would really rip on the scalp so I returned it. I&#x27;d be surprised if anyone uses it and doesn&#x27;t do damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tried several brands of scalp scrubbers. For my short hair, this is hands down the best. (Sort &#x3D; 1-inch.)</li>
            <li> I tried working my scalp with it, but it wouldn&#x27;t go to my scalp.  It just laid on my hair and rubbed my hair around.  I wanted it to stimulate my scalp.  Maybe I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to do it properly.</li>
            <li> We have lots of these, 1 for each family member including our dog ^^  These feel good on the scalp and lets you get a deep clean.  Our dog loves these too so bath time for her is enjoyable too &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Bought the brush as a friend recommended it. In terms of washing the scalp/dead skin nothing beats it. However, you will still need to lather your hair separately if you want to remove all the dirt and oil from your hair. Great product.</li>
            <li> this is cool but a little rough on my head. I wish it were softer.</li>
            <li> DAMM WHERES THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE</li>
            <li> I have no idea who would use something like this...oh wait, that would be my husband.I think he started using these in the military. He needed a new one of these after he lost his on vacation and I had to search the earth to find one to no avail. Finally thought to check Amazon and got this one (traditional) and a more modern version from another vendor. The modern version didn&#x27;t work out very well and quickly ended up in the trash but this one was just what he wanted. That was 5 years ago, it&#x27;s used everyday and is still going strong. Still looks brand new. So if this something your interested in do not hesitate to get it.</li>
            <li> There is a little nub with no flair to hold onto--totally inadequate especially given that other manufacturers all have included some type of loop.  It is difficult to grip, and the rubber was cracking.  I returned it for a refund.  Definitely would not recommend this one at all--definitely happier with the Denman Be-Bop brush.</li>
            <li> Love it, also works well as a back scratcher/massager.</li>
            <li> Yes charm. Made for the &amp;#34;WM MARVY CO. ST. PAUL MN,&amp;#34; the Invigorator has the sentimental charm of an old barber shop. In fact, the William Marvy Company&#x27;s products actually include barber poles (!), along with Mar-V-Side, that vivid blue liquid that the neighborhood barber stored his combs in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sentimentality aside, the Invigorator works. It really does invigorate your morning shower, and being made of a single piece of pliable rubber, should last a long time.</li>
            <li> A little getting use to, but have notice cleaner hair and scalp.  Will continue and see if all of this whoopla was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, it arrived a couple of days later than promised, but it&#x27;s just what I wanted to massage my scalp during shampooing. It&#x27;s total rubber construction allows for a firm, but flexible feel.  The needles stimulate, but do not scratch and it&#x27;s slight curvature allows it to fit nicely against ones scalp.  Not shown in the product picture is the stubby cylindrical handle (not a ring) which enables it to be firmly scissor gripped between ones fingers.</li>
            <li> I am not really sure what this thing does or is supposed to do but my wife seems happy with it and she has no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years now. Good quality and durable.</li>
            <li> This has nothing to do with the seller, but this scalp massager was very painful to use and scratched my scalp badly.  It&#x27;s made of plastic, not rubber like Morocco Method&#x27;s scalp massager which I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am redoing my review now that I have used this shampoo brush for a few months now.  At first I felt it was too hard and I didn&#x27;t like it.  I have become use to it and really like using it now.  I use it to shampoo my hair, but I also use it to use my vinegar rinse and then my cream rinse.  It distributes it all through the scalp and hair evenly.  I do have short hair, though.  It also gives a good massage and gets the blood flowing to the scalp to help with hair growth.  I hardly ever see any hair in the hair catcher anymore.  I don&#x27;t know if it is completely due to the shampoo brush and the circulation, but I still like the product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This brush was a total disappointment.  The ends of the bristles are cut flat, thus preventing them from reaching my scalp.  If the ends of the bristles were pointed, this would be an excellent product because the bristles are not too stiff.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, fine hair so when I shampoo I have to move this brush all over  from point to point otherwise it will tangle my hair like a rats nest!  The bristles are a bit stiff, making it a little painful in some spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would probably go with one that has longer spikes that are a little softer.</li>
            <li> It needs to be made of plastic to move smoothly through the hair. Rubber snags the hair. I bought a plastic one from Diane which works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, since he left the one he got from his father in a hotel room. This is great!  It&#x27;s exactly like the one he had before, but new. He uses it daily and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  Invigorates scalp. Helps with hair washing and hair growth.</li>
            <li> Firm but not scratchy.  Just what I was looking for.  Glad I brought two.  (Why do I have to write two more words, it is just a shampoo brush and scalp invigorator)?</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> the nubs are so short they don&#x27;t go thru my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Just like I used as a kid.  I had previously bought a plastic one from Amazon that had quite a bit more bristles.  The problem with the plastic one is that it felt like it would break easily &amp; if you had a lot of hair, more than a buzz cut, it would have a hard time going through your hair.  This product on the other hand is perfect!  I don&#x27;t know what possessed me to go with the plastic one.  I highly recommend this product!  It works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a better handle.</li>
            <li> This little number helped clear up my mom&#x27;s dry scalp build up issues in less than a week!  Awesome product!</li>
