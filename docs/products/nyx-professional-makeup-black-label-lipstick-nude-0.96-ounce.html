            <li>Perfect nude for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>This NYX lipstick is PERFECT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find the perfect nude lip stick to put under by lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for that perfect nude lipstick.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, they say my skin looks like a porcelain doll type skin.</li>
            <li>It was a beautiful color, and looked beautiful on her.</li>
            <li>color is beautiful but doesn&#x27;t blend evenly.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li>I saw this on a blond on YouTube, and it looked GREAT.</li>
            <li>Wanted to add these colors worked great for me</li>
            <li>It was creamy and the color pay-off was great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great opaque nude lipstick</li>
            <li>The color looks great on me.</li>
            <li>i was quite impressed, no need to put a gloss on top as it is moist.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lipstick and the color is soooo great and perfect if you want a warm toned look.</li>
            <li>this nude is really bright</li>
            <li>The color is hideous, I can&#x27;t imagine it looking good on anyone, even with skin as fair as mine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I just felt like it was just as good as putting concealer over my lips.</li>
            <li>Creamy, but just doesn&#x27;t look good on me.</li>
            <li>Product came in good shape.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of texture, it glides on fairly well</li>
            <li>And this doesn&#x27;t look good on me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but it isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good quality and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>The color is universally lovely and looks great on its own or under a variety of glosses.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to buy more to be honest!</li>
            <li>Applies somewhat chalky, but a lovely color!</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice peachy/nude color when its on</li>
            <li>was nice</li>
            <li>So if a warm summery nude is what you seek, this color is for you.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the awesome product</li>
            <li>I was looking for a nice nude lipstick</li>
            <li>and I really liked that.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought two years ago and they are still good.</li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>nice application, very smooth, just not the correct tone</li>
            <li>Nice rich nude color looks good with any lip liner and all by its self .</li>
            <li>More of a warm based nude.</li>
            <li>This lipstick goes on very very very smooth.</li>
            <li>Such a great nude color!</li>
            <li>I already bought the India color from this brand. :)</li>
            <li>and I love the color.</li>
            <li>I love the smell too, smells like grapes :)</li>
            <li>I love this nude lipstick.</li>
            <li>love the colour, love the packaging, love the formula.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>I was expecting ALOT more than I got with this lipstick.</li>
            <li>Just love it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>gonna have to get me two more .</li>
            <li>Even with lip gloss on top</li>
            <li>The consistency is ok  </li>
            <li>I love NYX and this is another shade that reminds me of that.  </li>
            <li>I also have this nude shade in NYX matte formula which I like a tad more.  </li>
            <li>I should know better than to buy makeup online, without checking it out in person.</li>
            <li>LOVE this color</li>
            <li>I love NYX cosmetics</li>
            <li>I GIVE THIS 5* FOR FAST SHIPPING AND GREAT QUALITY ...</li>
            <li>Love all colors.</li>
            <li>This lipstick was fantastic!</li>
            <li>I would love to buy this product again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only color I can wear that seems to flatter me, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the perfect nude.</li>
            <li>I watched a YouTube video a girl made on her favorite nude lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I decided to look into it some more and</li>
            <li>It is my all time favorite</li>
            <li>and it goes better on her lips.  </li>
            <li>also it&#x27;s more like a lipgloss then a lipstick.  </li>
            <li>My favorite nude, but you have to keep re-applying it.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Cute lip stick.</li>
            <li>and I heard this one was one of the best; extremely affordable price &amp; nice color.  </li>
            <li>Best advice on this is to let it dry and then apply a gloss over it.</li>
            <li>for!&lt;br /&gt;Packaging super cute, love love love how i can see color of lipstick on bottom of tube&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Looks really cheap, is more pearlescent than shiny.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice nude lipstick, it goes on super smooth</li>
            <li>It cracks easily on my lips.</li>
            <li>The color is great but definitely make sure to exfoliate, moisturizer and prime before application.</li>
            <li>loved this lipstick NYX he has a beautiful color and super super long duration</li>
            <li>IT DOWN TO MAKE THE PERFECT COLOR</li>
            <li>A very bright nude color with a pink tint...</li>
            <li>and I like light lipstick color,</li>
            <li>goes on a light peachy/coral nude.</li>
            <li>Coquette.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful full opaque coverage with only one or two swipes, leaves an attractive satin finish on lips.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty darn light and this lip shade is lighter than my skin!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a perfect pale color !</li>
            <li>Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that if you have any kind of chapped lips, it makes it more noticable that they&#x27;re chapped.  </li>
            <li>It dried them out and doesn&#x27;t look very good at all.</li>
            <li>the color looks like a bright light pink (nikki minaj in my opinion) and it shows cracks on my lips.</li>
            <li>The matte formulas are more conveniently found in many local stores too.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly but took 4-5 days to come after the estimated arrival time.  </li>
            <li>The color is very pretty.</li>
            <li>They are very light, natural looking.</li>
            <li>Creamy lipstick with a lovely spring summer pink color, more choices of color you can choose from.  </li>
            <li>Favorite shade by far</li>
            <li>Gives you an even better natural look &amp; fills in wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It stayed on almost all night, even after drinking, and left a really nice, even color on my lips.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>and they always seem very pretty at first glance</li>
            <li>love to wear on its own or ill combine with NYX Black label INDIA to make the worlds perfect nude lip.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right nude for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>This one goes on really smooth, but you def have to blot a few times before you put any kind of lip gloss over it.  </li>
            <li>While the color is decent and the texture is great, the lipstick just arrived in a mess from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>When I put this lipstick on, it came on very very Orange on me.</li>
            <li>However, this particular lipstick has found a nice balance between a lipstick and a gloss, leaving my lips feeling smooth and moisturized, not overly weighed down.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to order this on on Amazon because of a youtube video review I had watched and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I cannot count how many different types I have bought thinking it would be what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a pretty shade of nude.</li>
            <li>May appear slightly different depending on skin tone and type, but I believe this is a nude lip color that will flatter most.  </li>
            <li>FIRST TIME NYX LIPSTICK BUYER&lt;</li>
            <li>Pretty color though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d expected it to be a nice medium toned nude color</li>
            <li>but it was way too bright for an everyday look.</li>
            <li>I really had high expectations for this color, but when I applied it, it was really really chalky light pink/white.</li>
            <li>yes I like this very much and would certainly buy from this seller again .......and have.</li>
            <li>Also my lips are very bright pink sometimes rosey pink.</li>
            <li>, it glides right on, has such a smooth wear, and it isn&#x27;t drying at all.</li>
            <li>It has a really pretty matte color and it also stays really well &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>It came fast and was exactly what it said.</li>
            <li>It was supposed to be a pretty nude in all type of skins and well, for starters; I have light skin and this lipstick is too white for me.</li>
            <li>First the color is more frosted pink</li>
            <li>Anyways I do love the creaminess of this lipstick but also if you have very dry lips</li>
            <li>but it has a really peachy color to it witch</li>
            <li>and it feels very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Very 90s look.</li>
            <li>I have to apply lip gloss so it can look more of a pink</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a pink tone like many others claim</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a very bra nude color.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The lipstick does not come out of the tube straight and is already smeared on the inside of the tube.  </li>
            <li>I expected a nude lipstick that was more beige</li>
            <li>the neg reviews here on amazon were right on the money as far as my experience.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also on the moister side, so it didn&#x27;t leave me craving chapstick all night (which many other lipsticks do).</li>
            <li>Applies smoothly with a luxurious feel, long wearing.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a neutral or cool based nude this is definitely not it.</li>
            <li>love nyx black labels.</li>
            <li>Its ok.shipping was easy and as expected.</li>
            <li>Very light for my pale complexion.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a very light, pale color</li>
            <li>I do normally use 2 dif colors to achieve look</li>
            <li>I think the color is off, and it simply doesn&#x27;t look right on me.</li>
            <li>Very slick and doesn&#x27;t stick to the lips, kind of smears around and looks patchy.  </li>
            <li>And these lip covers are my new favs.</li>
            <li>expected better, makes my lips loook chapped and gross.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite :/</li>
            <li>Rip off not worth it I ordered in nude and it comes off as white and looks cracked could&#x27;ve got a better one from the dollar store never buying from nyx products again of</li>
            <li>I waited a long time for this lipstick to be in stock and finally bought it due to the amazing reviews it had.</li>
            <li>, more pink then I expected, might be my skin tone...</li>
            <li>he soft feel putting it on</li>
            <li>This NYX lipstick is so creamy and soft.</li>
            <li>its almost like a soft lip protector.</li>
            <li>it is too soft.</li>
            <li>Perfect base coat to any lip gloss.</li>
            <li>i hoped it too be its a light orange color and its very dry !!!!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a neutral or cool based nude lipstick but Black Label Nude</li>
            <li>Lucky I have a dark lipstick to go over it to take away the orange tint and suit my lips as a nude that goes with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>True to the reputation of NYX Black Label, this feels/</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this color for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li>Give this brand a try , I normally only buy high end products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>The thing that&#x27;s really driven me to grade it as 2 stars is that I find it too sheer on my lips, you can definitely see the lines underneath</li>
            <li>but once I tried them on they are so translucent that they barely showed up!</li>
            <li>but in general, I don&#x27;t recommend this...</li>
            <li>At least for me (super pale Asian, black hair with naturally bright pink toned</li>
            <li>My lips are very pigmented so this wears as a pretty pale nude with pink undertones.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Cute lip stick.</li>
            <li> and I heard this one was one of the best; extremely affordable price &amp; nice color.  </li>
            <li> Best advice on this is to let it dry and then apply a gloss over it.</li>
            <li> for!&lt;br /&gt;Packaging super cute, love love love how i can see color of lipstick on bottom of tube&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Looks really cheap, is more pearlescent than shiny.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice nude lipstick, it goes on super smooth</li>
            <li> It cracks easily on my lips.</li>
            <li> The color is great but definitely make sure to exfoliate, moisturizer and prime before application.</li>
            <li> loved this lipstick NYX he has a beautiful color and super super long duration</li>
            <li> IT DOWN TO MAKE THE PERFECT COLOR</li>
            <li> A very bright nude color with a pink tint...</li>
            <li> and I like light lipstick color,</li>
            <li> goes on a light peachy/coral nude.</li>
            <li> Coquette.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful full opaque coverage with only one or two swipes, leaves an attractive satin finish on lips.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty darn light and this lip shade is lighter than my skin!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a perfect pale color !</li>
            <li> Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that if you have any kind of chapped lips, it makes it more noticable that they&#x27;re chapped.  </li>
            <li> It dried them out and doesn&#x27;t look very good at all.</li>
            <li> the color looks like a bright light pink (nikki minaj in my opinion) and it shows cracks on my lips.</li>
            <li> The matte formulas are more conveniently found in many local stores too.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly but took 4-5 days to come after the estimated arrival time.  </li>
            <li> The color is very pretty.</li>
            <li> They are very light, natural looking.</li>
            <li> Creamy lipstick with a lovely spring summer pink color, more choices of color you can choose from.  </li>
            <li> Favorite shade by far</li>
            <li> Gives you an even better natural look &amp; fills in wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It stayed on almost all night, even after drinking, and left a really nice, even color on my lips.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> and they always seem very pretty at first glance</li>
            <li> love to wear on its own or ill combine with NYX Black label INDIA to make the worlds perfect nude lip.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right nude for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This one goes on really smooth, but you def have to blot a few times before you put any kind of lip gloss over it.  </li>
            <li> While the color is decent and the texture is great, the lipstick just arrived in a mess from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> When I put this lipstick on, it came on very very Orange on me.</li>
            <li> However, this particular lipstick has found a nice balance between a lipstick and a gloss, leaving my lips feeling smooth and moisturized, not overly weighed down.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to order this on on Amazon because of a youtube video review I had watched and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I cannot count how many different types I have bought thinking it would be what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this lipstick.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a pretty shade of nude.</li>
            <li> May appear slightly different depending on skin tone and type, but I believe this is a nude lip color that will flatter most.  </li>
            <li> FIRST TIME NYX LIPSTICK BUYER&lt;</li>
            <li> Pretty color though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d expected it to be a nice medium toned nude color</li>
            <li> but it was way too bright for an everyday look.</li>
            <li> I really had high expectations for this color, but when I applied it, it was really really chalky light pink/white.</li>
            <li> yes I like this very much and would certainly buy from this seller again .......and have.</li>
            <li> Also my lips are very bright pink sometimes rosey pink.</li>
            <li> , it glides right on, has such a smooth wear, and it isn&#x27;t drying at all.</li>
            <li> It has a really pretty matte color and it also stays really well &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It came fast and was exactly what it said.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be a pretty nude in all type of skins and well, for starters; I have light skin and this lipstick is too white for me.</li>
            <li> First the color is more frosted pink</li>
            <li> Anyways I do love the creaminess of this lipstick but also if you have very dry lips</li>
            <li> but it has a really peachy color to it witch</li>
            <li> and it feels very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Very 90s look.</li>
            <li> I have to apply lip gloss so it can look more of a pink</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a pink tone like many others claim</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a very bra nude color.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The lipstick does not come out of the tube straight and is already smeared on the inside of the tube.  </li>
            <li> I expected a nude lipstick that was more beige</li>
            <li> the neg reviews here on amazon were right on the money as far as my experience.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also on the moister side, so it didn&#x27;t leave me craving chapstick all night (which many other lipsticks do).</li>
            <li> Applies smoothly with a luxurious feel, long wearing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a neutral or cool based nude this is definitely not it.</li>
            <li> love nyx black labels.</li>
            <li> Its ok.shipping was easy and as expected.</li>
            <li> Very light for my pale complexion.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a very light, pale color</li>
            <li> I do normally use 2 dif colors to achieve look</li>
            <li> I think the color is off, and it simply doesn&#x27;t look right on me.</li>
            <li> Very slick and doesn&#x27;t stick to the lips, kind of smears around and looks patchy.  </li>
            <li> And these lip covers are my new favs.</li>
            <li> expected better, makes my lips loook chapped and gross.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite :/</li>
            <li> Rip off not worth it I ordered in nude and it comes off as white and looks cracked could&#x27;ve got a better one from the dollar store never buying from nyx products again of</li>
            <li> I waited a long time for this lipstick to be in stock and finally bought it due to the amazing reviews it had.</li>
            <li> , more pink then I expected, might be my skin tone...</li>
            <li> he soft feel putting it on</li>
            <li> This NYX lipstick is so creamy and soft.</li>
            <li> its almost like a soft lip protector.</li>
            <li> it is too soft.</li>
            <li> Perfect base coat to any lip gloss.</li>
            <li> i hoped it too be its a light orange color and its very dry !!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a neutral or cool based nude lipstick but Black Label Nude</li>
            <li> Lucky I have a dark lipstick to go over it to take away the orange tint and suit my lips as a nude that goes with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> True to the reputation of NYX Black Label, this feels/</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this color for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> Give this brand a try , I normally only buy high end products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> The thing that&#x27;s really driven me to grade it as 2 stars is that I find it too sheer on my lips, you can definitely see the lines underneath</li>
            <li> but once I tried them on they are so translucent that they barely showed up!</li>
            <li> but in general, I don&#x27;t recommend this...</li>
            <li> At least for me (super pale Asian, black hair with naturally bright pink toned</li>
            <li> My lips are very pigmented so this wears as a pretty pale nude with pink undertones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much too pale and white-based.</li>
            <li> The only thing I will say is that it&#x27;s pretty thick after application.</li>
            <li> The only issues I have with it is it doesn&#x27;t last very long, and it smudges.</li>
            <li> but it is easily fixed with a dark lip liner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting through the day too.</li>
            <li> Its very peachy but with a hint of pink and a little coral.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted a very nude lipstick because I have very pale skin and anything else</li>
            <li> I usually wear the cover girl lip setting over all my lips sticks and this one is so thick that it wipes off easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t suit olive skin tones due to the peachy pink tones in it and as its not a sheer lipstick and its very thick, its not a product that you can use lightly.</li>
            <li> It is a very pale pink &amp; makes my lips look very chapped.</li>
            <li> I have never really worn lipstick and was iffy about the mixed reviews, but I highly disagree with the negative comments.</li>
            <li> My one complaint about this product is that it can get a bit caky and has a tendency to produce a whitish build-up in the corners of my lips, especially if I  have been talking for a bit (which happens frequently as I work in a call center doing technical support).</li>
            <li> ok i am a big fan of nyx but this color is sooo bad</li>
            <li> If not, it will show every dry patch &amp; line on your lips.</li>
            <li> For the past couple of years I used Revlon&#x27;s Color Burst lipstick in soft nude</li>
            <li> She gave a short review on this NYX black label lipstick and swatched the color, saying this was her #1 lipstick.</li>
            <li> It is the only lipstick I&#x27;ve ever bought that doesn&#x27;t make my lips look dried out</li>
            <li> It has  a bit too much pink as well, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting</li>
            <li> Which is really not the lipsticks fault</li>
            <li> Everyone said it has a pink undertone</li>
            <li> Nude, silver stone vermeil, girly pink, earthy organique, bloom joli bouquet.</li>
            <li> but this was quite pink -</li>
            <li> not really a nude color on me.  </li>
            <li> I would look around for something with a more yellow or brown base instead of this peach.</li>
            <li> i recommended i will repuchase it in other colours</li>
            <li> It is long-lasting and only needs a small coating on the lips</li>
            <li> its not a pretty nude</li>
            <li> It does look a little dry without something else.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and eyes with lighter skin.</li>
            <li> Only negative I have on it though.</li>
            <li> Seven bucks down the drain.</li>
            <li> On me it almost looks neon, but I always tone it down with chapstick or lipgloss.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not pretty!</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;ll cost me too much to return it via international shipping.</li>
            <li> my daughter is slightly lighter skin than I am</li>
            <li> bought this and INDIA in the NYX Black label lipstick.  </li>
            <li> but i wish it was a little darker</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker than hoping.</li>
            <li> I try just makes me look too harsh.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t build it up either because it just gets messy.</li>
            <li> was hoping for a peachy color like an everyday look.</li>
            <li> My skin is usually medium beige in foundation colors with dark hair and eyes.  </li>
            <li> 1 to blurr any harsh lines and 2 to pat color in to lip.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it leave this nasty looking crusty build up on the sides of your mouth and its super noticeable because of the color.</li>
            <li> It is typically too thick for my liking.</li>
            <li> I literally use this lipstick everyday!</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> The only problem was that it sunk into the lines in my lips and exaggerated my chapped areas.</li>
            <li> I have a very pale face and this lipstick is not the color of nude that I was expecting</li>
            <li> then nude ( not good for my coloring)</li>
            <li> this may work for other skin tones but it looks horrible against my tanned asian skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from Revlon, Rimmel, and E.L.F to MAC and Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li> and I got a compliment of the color from a random person I didn&#x27;t even know.</li>
            <li> not a perfect nude for me...</li>
            <li> makes me look like I&#x27;m horribly sick ..</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sort of disappointed in this lipstick.</li>
            <li> I think maybe it&#x27;s just the color that I&#x27;m disappointed with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed at the condition of the product on arrival.  </li>
            <li> I use this lipstick as a BASE to put another color on OVER IT.....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s this horrible off-pink color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looked horrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Such a great nude color!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is too creamy, it broke off immediately. The color is hideous, I can&#x27;t imagine it looking good on anyone, even with skin as fair as mine. It&#x27;s much too pale and white-based.</li>
            <li> Creamy lipstick with a lovely spring summer pink color, more choices of color you can choose from.  I like he soft feel putting it on and I like light lipstick color, so yes I like this very much and would certainly buy from this seller again .......and have.</li>
            <li> this a &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; color give me a fresher look...I LIKE IT!</li>
            <li> Very light for my pale complexion. Wish i could have tried before i bought it. Seems to be a good quality and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite :/ I have a very pale face and this lipstick is not the color of nude that I was expecting, it&#x27;s a very light, pale color but it has a really peachy color to it witch I don&#x27;t like. I would look around for something with a more yellow or brown base instead of this peach.</li>
            <li> expected better, makes my lips loook chapped and gross.</li>
            <li> I have never really worn lipstick and was iffy about the mixed reviews, but I highly disagree with the negative comments. This NYX lipstick is so creamy and soft. The color is just perfect! I was complimented on the color ALL day at work by coworkers and customers. This nude color is honestly perfect for any age. I can&#x27;t wait to buy more to be honest! I already bought the India color from this brand. :)</li>
            <li> I am Asian, and on the darker side. Did not go well with my skin color at all. Shows up as a pasty, white color on my lips.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted a very nude lipstick because I have very pale skin and anything else I try just makes me look too harsh. I&#x27;ve tried &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; lipsticks at the drugstore and they always seem very pretty at first glance but once I tried them on they are so translucent that they barely showed up! I finally decided to order this on on Amazon because of a youtube video review I had watched and I&#x27;m glad I did. It is the only lipstick I&#x27;ve ever bought that doesn&#x27;t make my lips look dried out and I love the color. It&#x27;s a nice peachy/nude color when its on and it feels very moisturizing. I love the smell too, smells like grapes :)</li>
            <li> Item as described. I love this nude lipstick. It&#x27;s perfect and goes on smooth. It&#x27;s long lasting through the day too. I actually fell asleep with it on and woke up with some it still on. LOL</li>
            <li> love the colour, love the packaging, love the formula. love nyx black labels. i recommended i will repuchase it in other colours</li>
            <li> As a girl who has been looking for the perfect nude color lipstick, this one nailed it! I cannot count how many different types I have bought thinking it would be what I wanted. This one is perfect and I will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> I waited a long time for this lipstick to be in stock and finally bought it due to the amazing reviews it had. It was supposed to be a pretty nude in all type of skins and well, for starters; I have light skin and this lipstick is too white for me. It has  a bit too much pink as well, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting but it&#x27;s OK I guess if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.. The thing that&#x27;s really driven me to grade it as 2 stars is that I find it too sheer on my lips, you can definitely see the lines underneath and it&#x27;s not pretty! You can&#x27;t build it up either because it just gets messy. I will not be using this...</li>
            <li> was nice but i wish it was a little darker this nude is really bright</li>
            <li> The color does not go with my skin complextion. Which is really not the lipsticks fault however I do not like the application. It cracks easily on my lips.</li>
            <li> I was expecting ALOT more than I got with this lipstick. The color is NOT NUDE.....it&#x27;s this horrible off-pink color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do work as a make-up artist, so I use this lipstick as a BASE to put another color on OVER IT.....but in general, I don&#x27;t recommend this...</li>
            <li> Looks really cheap, is more pearlescent than shiny. Very 90s look.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I am traditionally not a fan of lipstick. It is typically too thick for my liking. However, this particular lipstick has found a nice balance between a lipstick and a gloss, leaving my lips feeling smooth and moisturized, not overly weighed down. My one complaint about this product is that it can get a bit caky and has a tendency to produce a whitish build-up in the corners of my lips, especially if I  have been talking for a bit (which happens frequently as I work in a call center doing technical support). Overall, I love this lipstick. The color is universally lovely and looks great on its own or under a variety of glosses. It is long-lasting and only needs a small coating on the lips so I imagine I will have this tube for a while to come.</li>
            <li> Just love it &amp;#60;3 gonna have to get me two more . Nice rich nude color looks good with any lip liner and all by its self .</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty darn light and this lip shade is lighter than my skin! makes me look like I&#x27;m horribly sick ..No buying again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lipstick and the color is soooo great and perfect if you want a warm toned look. Its very peachy but with a hint of pink and a little coral. ITS BEAUTIFUL!! The only problem is that it leave this nasty looking crusty build up on the sides of your mouth and its super noticeable because of the color.</li>
            <li> I literally use this lipstick everyday! It has a really pretty matte color and it also stays really well &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this I just felt like it was just as good as putting concealer over my lips. It dried them out and doesn&#x27;t look very good at all. Maybe i&#x27;m not into nude lipstick but this just didn&#x27;t do it for me. Even with lip gloss on top I wasn&#x27;t happy. Threw it away.</li>
            <li> the color looks like a bright light pink (nikki minaj in my opinion) and it shows cracks on my lips. the color  doesn&#x27;t look like in the picture . was hoping for a peachy color like an everyday look. I have to apply lip gloss so it can look more of a pink</li>
            <li> The consistency is ok  and I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell of it. It doesn&#x27;t suit olive skin tones due to the peachy pink tones in it and as its not a sheer lipstick and its very thick, its not a product that you can use lightly.</li>
            <li> Creamy, but just doesn&#x27;t look good on me. It doesn&#x27;t have a pink tone like many others claim, it&#x27;s a very bra nude color.</li>
            <li> I love NYX and this is another shade that reminds me of that.  I also have this nude shade in NYX matte formula which I like a tad more.  The matte formulas are more conveniently found in many local stores too. Favorite shade by far</li>
            <li> The color is great but definitely make sure to exfoliate, moisturizer and prime before application. If not, it will show every dry patch &amp; line on your lips.</li>
            <li> I saw this on a blond on YouTube, and it looked GREAT. In fact, she had stated it was her &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; lipstick at the moment.  It was a beautiful color, and looked beautiful on her. I couldn&#x27;t wait to put it on, as I&#x27;m ALWAYS looking for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; nude lipstick.  It looked horrible! And nothing like how it looked on the blonde woman&#x27;s lips. I think the color is off, and it simply doesn&#x27;t look right on me. I should know better than to buy makeup online, without checking it out in person. Blah. Seven bucks down the drain.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. A very bright nude color with a pink tint... On me it almost looks neon, but I always tone it down with chapstick or lipgloss. It does look a little dry without something else. I have dark hair and eyes with lighter skin.</li>
            <li> possible to use in future</li>
            <li> Not the color I was hoping for, but it&#x27;s still a pretty shade of nude. It&#x27;s a little darker than hoping.</li>
            <li> Not the same color as pictures show. It is a very pale pink &amp; makes my lips look very chapped. I was looking for a color in which shows in the pictures but not even close.</li>
            <li> I love NYX cosmetics but I&#x27;m sort of disappointed in this lipstick. I think maybe it&#x27;s just the color that I&#x27;m disappointed with. I was looking for a neutral or cool based nude lipstick but Black Label Nude goes on a light peachy/coral nude. More of a warm based nude. So if a warm summery nude is what you seek, this color is for you. If you&#x27;re looking for a neutral or cool based nude this is definitely not it.</li>
            <li> This lipstick goes on very very very smooth. The color is very pretty. The only issues I have with it is it doesn&#x27;t last very long, and it smudges. Best advice on this is to let it dry and then apply a gloss over it.</li>
            <li> Applies somewhat chalky, but a lovely color!</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a nude colour but it wasnt.I didn&#x27;t like the colour at all.am not buying from you again</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, they say my skin looks like a porcelain doll type skin. Also my lips are very bright pink sometimes rosey pink. When I put this lipstick on, it came on very very Orange on me. Everyone said it has a pink undertone but I beg to differ. Anyways I do love the creaminess of this lipstick but also if you have very dry lips every chapped area will show. Lucky I have a dark lipstick to go over it to take away the orange tint and suit my lips as a nude that goes with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> PERFECT COLOR FOR THE LOOK I WAS GOING FOR ! I WOULD BUY AGAIN FOR GIFTS ! I GIVE THIS 5* FOR FAST SHIPPING AND GREAT QUALITY ... YOU CAN ALSO USE OVER A BRIGHTER COLOR TO TONE  IT DOWN TO MAKE THE PERFECT COLOR</li>
            <li> color is beautiful but doesn&#x27;t blend evenly.Its ok.shipping was easy and as expected.I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.I like the feel of it! its almost like a soft lip protector.</li>
            <li> not quite what I was expecting</li>
            <li> loved this lipstick NYX he has a beautiful color and super super long duration nominate for everyone perfect this item</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money! It doesn&#x27;t look the same as it does in the bottle.  It looks like my lips are white and chapped when I put this on my lips</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Perfect base coat to any lip gloss. Thanks for the awesome product it&#x27;s a perfect pale color !</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice nude lipstick and I heard this one was one of the best; extremely affordable price &amp; nice color.  Shipped quickly but took 4-5 days to come after the estimated arrival time.  Product came in good shape.</li>
            <li> I ordered 5 colors. Nude, silver stone vermeil, girly pink, earthy organique, bloom joli bouquet. Love all colors. They are very light, natural looking. And I found color didn&#x27;t change when I put on.  I do normally use 2 dif colors to achieve look I&#x27;m going for. Also want to suggest using Chapstick b/4 or after apply ( blistex deep renewal SPF 15). Gives you an even better natural look &amp; fills in wrinkles.  Wanted to add these colors worked great for me I have med tone skin, lt. Blonde, &amp; dk blue eyes. Give this brand a try , I normally only buy high end products. And these lip covers are my new favs.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this color for everyday wear.  While the color is decent and the texture is great, the lipstick just arrived in a mess from Amazon.  The lipstick does not come out of the tube straight and is already smeared on the inside of the tube.  I&#x27;m really disappointed at the condition of the product on arrival.  I would buy this product again, just not from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This lipstick was fantastic! It stayed on almost all night, even after drinking, and left a really nice, even color on my lips. It&#x27;s also on the moister side, so it didn&#x27;t leave me craving chapstick all night (which many other lipsticks do). Highly recommend, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> It came fast and was exactly what it said. I would love to buy this product again. Perfect nude for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> My lips are very pigmented so this wears as a pretty pale nude with pink undertones. May appear slightly different depending on skin tone and type, but I believe this is a nude lip color that will flatter most.  Extremely similar to Lime Crime Coquette.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful full opaque coverage with only one or two swipes, leaves an attractive satin finish on lips. Applies smoothly with a luxurious feel, long wearing. True to the reputation of NYX Black Label, this feels/looks/wears like a luxury lipstick! No disappointments.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of nude lipsticks. It&#x27;s the only color I can wear that seems to flatter me, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the perfect nude. Well, I found it! I&#x27;ve tried everything from Revlon, Rimmel, and E.L.F to MAC and Victoria&#x27;s Secret. I watched a YouTube video a girl made on her favorite nude lipsticks. She gave a short review on this NYX black label lipstick and swatched the color, saying this was her #1 lipstick. I decided to look into it some more and all the reviews I found raved about this lipstick. For the past couple of years I used Revlon&#x27;s Color Burst lipstick in soft nude and I really liked that. It was creamy and the color pay-off was great. The only problem was that it sunk into the lines in my lips and exaggerated my chapped areas. This NYX lipstick is PERFECT. It&#x27;s a great opaque nude lipstick, it glides right on, has such a smooth wear, and it isn&#x27;t drying at all. I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It is my all time favorite and I will definitely keep buying this lipstick again and again!</li>
            <li> I expected a nude lipstick that was more beige but this was quite pink - so as a nude colour, it did not meet my expectations. this may work for other skin tones but it looks horrible against my tanned asian skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of texture, it glides on fairly well but then it creases. Too bad it&#x27;ll cost me too much to return it via international shipping.</li>
            <li> Not my color at all but it is easily fixed with a dark lip liner. I just don&#x27;t like the texture of this lipstick bc it is too soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find the perfect nude lip stick to put under by lip gloss. This one goes on really smooth, but you def have to blot a few times before you put any kind of lip gloss over it.  Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that if you have any kind of chapped lips, it makes it more noticable that they&#x27;re chapped.  Only negative I have on it though.</li>
            <li> too white on my lips.  not really a nude color on me.  my daughter is slightly lighter skin than I am and it goes better on her lips.  I need a different nude. My skin is usually medium beige in foundation colors with dark hair and eyes.  And this doesn&#x27;t look good on me.  the neg reviews here on amazon were right on the money as far as my experience.  I&#x27;ll try another color.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick! It&#x27;s the right nude for my skin tone. It is creamy and I got a compliment of the color from a random person I didn&#x27;t even know. Definitely recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Rip off not worth it I ordered in nude and it comes off as white and looks cracked could&#x27;ve got a better one from the dollar store never buying from nyx products again of I could rate 0 stars believe me I would</li>
            <li> First the color is more frosted pink then nude ( not good for my coloring) also it&#x27;s more like a lipgloss then a lipstick.  Very slick and doesn&#x27;t stick to the lips, kind of smears around and looks patchy.  I&#x27;m still searching for that perfect nude lipstick.</li>
            <li> not a perfect nude for me... nice application, very smooth, just not the correct tone, more pink then I expected, might be my skin tone...</li>
            <li> My favorite nude, but you have to keep re-applying it. Glad I bought two years ago and they are still good.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this product. The color looks great on me. It is moisturizing, but some times  I still need to apply chapstick before from getting stuck in the Crack of my lips.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice nude lipstick, it goes on super smooth i was quite impressed, no need to put a gloss on top as it is moist.</li>
            <li> FIRST TIME NYX LIPSTICK BUYER&lt;br /&gt;I bought this and INDIA in the NYX Black label lipstick.  I am in love!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Smells awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Highly Pigmented!&lt;br /&gt;Color to die for!&lt;br /&gt;Packaging super cute, love love love how i can see color of lipstick on bottom of tube&lt;br /&gt;I love to wear on its own or ill combine with NYX Black label INDIA to make the worlds perfect nude lip.  At least for me (super pale Asian, black hair with naturally bright pink toned lips)&lt;br /&gt;FYI... I like to apply product on my lip then patt and blend product on with finger.  1 to blurr any harsh lines and 2 to pat color in to lip.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the texture or the smell of this lipstick.  I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but it isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> Nice but I wish it would stay on longer.</li>
            <li> Cute lip stick. The only thing I will say is that it&#x27;s pretty thick after application. I usually wear the cover girl lip setting over all my lips sticks and this one is so thick that it wipes off easily. Pretty color though.</li>
            <li> ok i am a big fan of nyx but this color is sooo bad its not a pretty nude i hoped it too be its a light orange color and its very dry !!!!</li>
            <li> I really had high expectations for this color, but when I applied it, it was really really chalky light pink/white. I&#x27;d expected it to be a nice medium toned nude color but it was way too bright for an everyday look. I recommend wearing a nude lip gloss over it to contrast the brightness of the lip stick. Overall it was not what it looked like it would be in the picture. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
