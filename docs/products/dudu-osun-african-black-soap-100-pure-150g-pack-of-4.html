            <li>This is one the most effective products for rashes, pimples and over all good health</li>
            <li>This soap smells nice and it cleanses quite well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for great service,  Amazon!</li>
            <li>I must say one thing, it sure smells good.</li>
            <li>It smells nice also.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s nothing spectacular about this soap.</li>
            <li>cause I&#x27;ve read too many good reviews about this product</li>
            <li>If you do they kind of melt.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice aroma.</li>
            <li>My face felt softer and cleaner and the soap makes a nice, scented lather.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the soap this much to be honest.  </li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t the best idea because now my face is lighter than my body and you can really see a difference between my neck and face.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t justify the price for it, honestly.</li>
            <li>I get complements all the time on how nice my skin looks.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m home all day I may use it again just for good measure.  :)&lt;</li>
            <li>The soap smells really nice, and it somehow also manages to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful soap and really cleans.  </li>
            <li>and I liked that it said &amp;#34;Tropical&amp;#34; hinting to a tropical-type smell.</li>
            <li>Anyway I love it &amp; it also smells so good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I have not reordered this soap as it was really nice.</li>
            <li>Not over drying and quite effective for preventing acne breakout.  </li>
            <li>The smell is quite nice, not earthy as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have already had a couple of comments on the nice improvement my skin has made.  </li>

            <li>It has a nice mist to it as well.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and tried this, and to be honest</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely the best product for acne.</li>
            <li>Use this soap at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t honestly say why I settled on this</li>
            <li>but it is a really nice soap,</li>
            <li>Ended up buying a 12 pack after using these four up, it helps my complexion and acne as well as being nice smelling.</li>
            <li>Quite honestly, I couldn&#x27;t use the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled I discovered this.</li>
            <li>Love love love this soap!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of the bar is great, nice a clean.</li>

            <li>When we first started using it we experienced some irritation and dryness</li>
            <li>While your skin will feel clean with Dudu-Osun, you won&#x27;t have the refreshing quality that a good exfoliant produces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Bought this wonderfully scented soap to give to family because it keeps skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the great reviews I read about it; I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed that during that time of the month when I would break out on my face, the pimples don&#x27;t stay around for more than 2 days.</li>
            <li>Also, I LOVE the smell of it.</li>
            <li>So you would think the seller would had packaged it better so in case of weather.</li>
            <li>so it just sat in water most of day</li>
            <li>so just more process</li>
            <li>Also, if you buy this soap, make sure you buy face lotion too</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>This soap works better and faster and its CHEAPER which</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure everyone can appreciate.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t got rid of all of my pimples and blackheads, but basically most of them.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those items that some love and some don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like that because I love my glow</li>
            <li>so I wanted to make sure that it would continue to work days later before I made my decision if this was a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>My skin has continued to get better and better by day and night.  </li>
            <li>Love it, and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments on my complexion.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>My wife says this soap is better than all the acne face soaps she&#x27;s ever bought.</li>
            <li>and if we run out of this soap I&#x27;m sure to hear about it.</li>
            <li>and they aren&#x27;t as prominent as they used to be.</li>
            <li>What more can you want?  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS SOAP....</li>
            <li>There is a very specific problem with this otherwise wonderful product: the added fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>but this does work better.</li>
            <li>So....wish it smelled better</li>
            <li>Then I can give a better review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it more time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>this is affordable and does the job better than anything else that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Use a chamomile wipe after use to add an even better glow!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen many reviews about its lightening properties or it making scars/</li>
            <li>It does have a drying effect so make sure to follow up with lotion or butter.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I came across this product.</li>
            <li>I do love the soap.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>

            <li>plus i love the scent.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s just more noticeable because it&#x27;s brown versus white/ivory.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and it works wonders for your skin!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m spending a lot more time in the shower with it</li>

            <li>and it was way better.</li>

            <li>I love this soap I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now</li>
            <li>and my skin is so much more even.</li>
            <li>and I have more radiance and glow on my face now.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>It was okay not what I expect</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>This is OK soap.</li>
            <li>This also washes my hair better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>but i am so glad that we kept using it bc</li>
            <li>and I cant tell you how many people have told me my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>this works better.</li>
            <li>I had soo many whiteheads  </li>
            <li>But considering how many over the counter acne medication I used that didnt work this got rid of wayy more</li>
            <li>Nothing too appealing.</li>
            <li>Love the tropical scent.  </li>
            <li>Most of which I have yet to experience.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>this stuff will get more Dudu when I run out</li>
            <li>This is the best deep cleansing!</li>
            <li>This is now my signature soap, I shower with it all the time, love the smell.</li>
            <li>It lathers wonderfully and the only con to using it</li>
            <li>More reviews on fulfillment of claims &amp; not fulfillment of wishfull thinking.</li>
            <li>Soap is okay</li>
            <li>To be sure I&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this ok, but I didn&#x27;t like the burn.</li>
            <li>I might would buy this again, because maybe the burn is removing the top layer of skin and imperfections.</li>
            <li>the smell is ok but it works so it makes up for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start off by saying that this is possibly the BEST cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li>And have already noticed the most drastic improvement in my skin ever.</li>
            <li>Be sure to purchase an organic, unfiltered apple cider vinegar (with &amp;#34;the mother&amp;#34; in it).</li>
            <li>Niacin has probably helped my skin more than anything.</li>
            <li>My face is also so much better</li>
            <li>:)</li>

            <li>Smells amazing and leaves my skin so clean.</li>
            <li>Nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Great vibrant smell and because of the texture</li>
            <li>Maybe it did help prevent some from appearing, and it did make my face feel clean, and I actually liked the smell.</li>
            <li>Nice clean feeling.</li>

            <li>I love this soap...as I feel really clean!</li>
            <li>Black soap is the best for every skin type, help with acne and softens skins, it does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>Also easy transaction with quick shipping!!  </li>
            <li>Made our skin very soft and it smells really great :-)</li>
            <li>He felt it was soothing to the skin and got him very clean.</li>
            <li>It will get you very clean but dries out your skin use with a exfoliating glove twice a week</li>
            <li>It smells like a cross between dove&amp;ivory, very pleasant.</li>
            <li>However, if you just want to go more natural/organic and have a nice smelling soap that does make your skin feel soft, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this soap is how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I tried it the first night and it cleansed my face as good as a exfoliator without the harshness.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good soap.</li>

            <li>This would be very good if it does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>When my family bought dudu-osun soap (we called it dudu soap for short when we first heard of it and then the magical dudu after we had experienced the great benefits)</li>
            <li>But after a week or so of using this wonderful product - no dry skin, and any skin irritations or rashes fade away or are reduced significantly.  </li>
            <li>but I used a oil free moisturizer from neutrogena best kind for me due combination/oily skin .</li>

            <li>The black soap has a very pleasant scent and once you use it your skin invigorates with a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>Although Dudu-Osun is not a miracle cure, it is a great soap with a nice fragrance (sort of has an incense scent, sort of hard to explain, but it&#x27;s pleasant).</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel squeaky clean without over drying!</li>
            <li>Can feel the clean!</li>

            <li>I think that this seems to be a really great natural soap.</li>
            <li>This soap has a great scent to it and also it leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li>This is a good cleansing soap, but it really dries out your skin after cleansing with this soap.  </li>
            <li>I used a whole bar and didn&#x27;t notice any difference except my skin being drier and tighter (not in a good way).</li>
            <li>If you have acne and trying to find a good soap without having to spend so much, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>but she uses everyday and follows with a good moisturizer and after just 3 weeks she looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>I love this soap sooooo much, it makes your skin so clear and soap, the best about it</li>
            <li>She loved them so much.</li>
            <li>It really smells good when I grabbed it from my mailbox.</li>
            <li>I love this soap, it cleans well and smell very fresh.  </li>
            <li>OK... so I always knew black soap was the best but never tried it until I purchased on Amazon.com...</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to strong smells, but this soap is just great).</li>
            <li>Mild and lightly scented, this soap is really nice.</li>
            <li>Which is definitely a good thing because it means it is easy to be gentle with it.</li>
            <li>They arrived as expected, made the box smell REALLY LOVELY!!!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love its unique scent.</li>
            <li>True Diva!</li>
            <li>I would expect that it works excellently on acne on other parts of the body also.  </li>
            <li>Other than that its perfect!!!</li>
            <li>I have dreadlocks so the organic elements of the soap work wonderfully to clean mi locks :)</li>
            <li>and I feel so healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love the smell and how it leaves my skin clean but still moisturized with out the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>In fact, that alone would have made the purchase worth it.&lt;br /&gt;However, the real truth is that the soap smells and feels great, and leaves my skin feeling and looking healthier.</li>
            <li>It really is the best, all natural soap you can get for your body.  </li>
            <li>I have experienced mild acne for most of my adult life, but since I have been over 50 it has changed in nature.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this smells and how clean it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li>You get 4 bars, it&#x27;s cheap, natural, and lathers really great, it makes things feel &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It lathers up very quickly and cleans well.</li>
            <li>I had very mild acne</li>
            <li>and I covered it easily with makeup.</li>
            <li>but it does clean good and gives you a fresh clean feel.</li>
            <li>Amazon easily refunded my money, though.</li>
            <li>BEST SMELLING NATURAL SOAP THAT IS REASONABLE IN PRICE</li>
            <li>Starting to use the soap, feel great just need more time to juge the effects....</li>
            <li>but if you have oily skin like me and break out easy get this soap and it will stop pimples before the fully form</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s THAT strong.    </li>
            <li>thing you should keep in mind is that it is really strong.</li>
            <li>So if strong musky scents is not for you then this soap may not be either.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this soap is too strong.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance was so strong I could smell it through the plastic bag.</li>
            <li>The soap has a strong aroma to it</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>It also has a strong smell (like incense almost).</li>
            <li>I like the light, fresh scent and abundant lather.</li>
            <li>I had read that some of the reviewers mentioned the strong smell and in part that is why I didn&#x27;t buy them sooner</li>
            <li>and then, the smell was sooo strong.</li>
            <li>It is strong on the skin...</li>
            <li>I will say not to use a scrubber with this soap as it is fairly strong and could cause irritation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that strong.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Firstly; Hair, I use it on my hair and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this kind of soap.  </li>
            <li>your face first, Lather it in your hands with the soap and apply it on, rinse your face, and make pats on your face with a warm towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lime juice in it</li>
            <li>I was able to get through three bars before coming to my full opinion on it: it&#x27;s cons out</li>
            <li>Love the stuff, an true answer to ALL my skin issues.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true Dove user and I have fallen in love with this soap.</li>
            <li>After the first shower I actually liked the after-smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is pretty nice though</li>
            <li>Once my face recovered from the first wash - about 15 minutes - I liked how my skin looked.  </li>
            <li>Not bad at all, I&#x27;ve never, ever used a soap that smells so refreshing, and cleanse your skin well and not OVER-DRYING.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face acne free and squeaky clean :)</li>
            <li>Love this soap and it smells very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>and then they were fine)</li>
            <li>People, this soap is for everyone, not just black people (do you know how incredibly ignorant that sounds?!</li>
            <li>my son thinks it&#x27;s awesome that it&#x27;s black, and we havent had any staining problems in our shower.</li>
            <li>, I might just keep a bar here and there through the house hidden as air-freshener LOL!</li>
            <li>I checked the expiration date and it was fine.</li>
            <li>This is fine with me, but I know it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
            <li>The fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes have shrunk as well.  </li>
            <li>It washed off fine though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read excellent things about black soap</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with how quickly I received my package</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>In return that customer will stay loyal and buy more product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural, pleasant smelling, soap.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my skin feel super smooth!</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better and it has helped me tremendously with some skin problems that I have.</li>
            <li>While the name is little funny (honestly, my husband laughs every time I call it just du du), it has been wonderful for my skin.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for body soap, as it leaves you extremely squeakily clean, however I was using it as a cleanser as well.</li>
            <li>But it does lather really well, better than I thought it would!</li>
            <li>I was concerned about the 100% pure claim when I read the ingredients and fragrance was listed, but I know it&#x27;s a popular brand</li>
            <li>aroma will be very strong the first week</li>
            <li>After using on my face I always moisturize because its a little drying...but its always good to moisturize after cleansing your face!!</li>
            <li>Strong rich soap...</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing; nice light scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been this enthusiastic about a product before, and I&#x27;m convinced that nothing is better for your skin than natural products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been this enthusiastic about a product before, and I&#x27;m convinced that nothing is better for your skin than natural products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a huge difference on my skin and my break outs.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I bought this soap when I was on an intoxicated Amazing shopping binge (yes, I do that sometimes), simply because it is called &amp;#34;dudu&amp;#34; and it looks like turd in the pictures.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even started using it for the acne around his shoulders and back, and has had great results.</li>
            <li>MAKES MY WHOLE BATHROOM SMELL NICE</li>

            <li>It lathers great and kicks dirt and oil into next week.  </li>
            <li>I use this primarily on my face....</li>
            <li>And my skin is smooth like a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am light skinned AA and the soap</li>
            <li>The soap is also great for the eh em private parts...especially the coconut papaya...</li>

            <li>I use this daily as a face cleaner/scrub and it does great for any acne problems you may have.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and looks radiant after I cleanse with this soap.  </li>
            <li>This soap does stain light colored clothes so I&#x27;d recommend having separate clothes for your face.</li>
            <li>Also, because of Dave Chapelle, when I opened it, I would say, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Dudu, baby!&amp;#34; Anyway, the aroma was light.</li>

            <li>Then the light bulb in my head went off.</li>

            <li>and my skin is always smooth.</li>
            <li>This is also a great facial soap!!!</li>

            <li>I recommend skipping a day as you see fit whenever you feel some dryness.</li>
            <li>Works great if you have acne on back !</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even wear foundation most days anymore, my skin is that clear and even (and I&#x27;m not one of those people with naturally perfect skin, as I said above-</li>

            <li>so that&#x27;s good but haven&#x27;t noticed anything that great as far as fading acne scars and improving overall complexion.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m acne free..</li>

            <li>Good for the skin leaving it soft and comfortable.  </li>

            <li>I was looking for a good soap for my acne and sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>good all natural soap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, it smells good</li>
            <li>The Dudu-Osun is as good as the nubian in slightly different ways; more fragrant, dissolves faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great all-around soap for the whole family.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but it has helped clear my face up fairly well.</li>
            <li>so make sure you follow up with a light moisturizer right after.</li>
            <li>so your face won&#x27;t sting or burn and don&#x27;t wash with super hot water settle for warm</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for something more impressive based on the other reviews.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the results.</li>
            <li>I was so excited by just the smell of this soap</li>
            <li>everything went smoothly, so smooth that my soap came a day early, which was so perfect since I had a sliver of a piece left</li>
            <li>Definitely buying it again, I just love it! :)</li>
            <li>and I was excited to try it out since I read all of the benefits online about how get it was for your skin.</li>
            <li>At any rate, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>I have also started using this soap in the shower and have noticed a significant difference in the appearance of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>That stuff caused an allergic reaction and my skin to turn horridly red and thicken for days...not nice!  </li>
            <li>When I recieved the product I was so excited to see what type of results I would get.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my skin looks fresh and the tone looks even and creamy!  </li>
            <li>and I do see a significant improvement in that area.</li>
            <li>The only flaw is it really dries your skin so be sure to have a great moisturizer on hand.  </li>
            <li>It took about 1 month for me to see significant changes in my skin</li>

            <li>my face had significantly cleared up.</li>
            <li>I did use it and didn&#x27;t notice significant benefits</li>
            <li>Rinse it off quickly and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I originally found it on a travel blog and decided to try a bar for myself.</li>
            <li>and I am extremely excited to use this soap again.</li>
            <li>Amazingly rich lather.  </li>
            <li>This does depend on skin types, what works for me might not work for you but its def worth a try!</li>
            <li>I have to say at first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell</li>
            <li>Also my skin dryed out at first but seems to have got better with time</li>
            <li>first shower did give some tingles during rinsing but by day two I was ok.</li>
            <li>Five bucks for a year&#x27;s worth of cleanser!</li>
            <li>It can be a tad drying at first, but stick with it and be sure to moisturize (which you should do anyway, even with oily skin).  </li>
            <li>From antibiotics, to face washes to cleansers and nothing has worked significantly well for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>When I finished the first order I had to get some more.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Unlike Shea Moisture, this product is more affordable, four bars compared to one, available through Amazon, and does not stain the shower or certain wash clothes.  </li>
            <li>It does make very fine form and cleans very well..</li>
            <li>U feel so clean and fresh after using!</li>

            <li>This is good soap but it really didn&#x27;t do much for my skin...</li>
            <li>It cleans the skin very nicely and lasts a really long time..</li>
            <li>i decided to give this soap a whirl after so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Waiting for more positive changes as I just started.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t quite see why the overwhelming positive reviews on it.</li>
            <li>I am a victim (lol) of acne as well as bacne.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts from many of the popular over the counter skin products</li>
            <li>My skin that is sensitive to most soaps - not this one!</li>
            <li>the soap has a very nice different distinct fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very fragrant, leaves your skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>i use pure shea butter after for a moisturizer my skin has never felt better...</li>
            <li>But I felt like buying something special for my wife and decided to give this</li>
            <li>I will certainly order more.</li>
            <li>Be sure to buy pure Niacin (NOT no-flush, flush-free, or time-released varieties).</li>
            <li>figured when I ordered the soap that it would be nothing special.  </li>
            <li>It it almost as if the lather gives special attention to areas of the skin that need it.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this soap.</li>
            <li>Fantastic soap - my skin felt tighter after first use!</li>
            <li>my skin really liked the natural properties, and i would come out of the shower truly feeling clean.    </li>
            <li>You get a nice, clean feeling after using it and feel as though you&#x27;ve used a natural product instead of a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li>and it helps your skin still nice, soft and clean.</li>
            <li>So far so good; I have tried most acne treatments out there (Clean and Clear), but this seems to be working out of all that I have done to contain my acne problem.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, lathers great and seems to last longer than the other brands I ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It feels so soft and amazing on my skin</li>
            <li>I am not sure that it is the magical wonder product that some think it is, but my skin feels just great after using this.</li>
            <li>and it is even great in a closed closet..</li>
            <li>Thick lather, awesome smell, cleans well.  </li>
            <li>Bar dries quickly after shower or bath, shape holds up, rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>I hope that this is true since I brought four of them...</li>
            <li>But the soap smells nice and lathers well, considering it&#x27;s natural and has no sulfates.</li>
            <li>Anyway, three stars for a nice natural soap...no miracles here, though.</li>
            <li>I read about this product looking for more help for her and since the price of this soap was extremely reasonable, I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin smooth and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>I got it in the mail around Christmas time and joked that it looked like a BIG lump of coal that he had given everyone as a gift, but it smelled really good</li>
            <li>I read somewhere that it burns your face, so I was cautious using it on my face, the only time it burned is when I used a washcloth on my face, if i get a good lather and apply it to my face that way I have no problems.</li>
            <li>This soap looks handmade, it&#x27;s not mass produced and full of junk</li>
            <li>I laughed at the reviewers that suggested this product is somehow for African people.  </li>
            <li>I even got my boyfriend to wash his face with this last night and he loved it also.</li>
            <li>Also, I feel super clean and refreshed after using Dudu-osun.</li>
            <li>Liked the smell of this soap, and it made my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I have to buy more since it is going quite fast.</li>
            <li>So just about 15-20seconds of lathering seems like the sweet spot for</li>
            <li>I am still working on the red scars, but its fabulous to have nice smooth skin again.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product just to even out my skin some more</li>
            <li>love this soap so much.</li>
            <li>but overall a good product.  </li>
            <li>I ended up giving this soap away to a male who absolutely loved it and everythign about it.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice soap it helped clear my blemishes,  but for my postular psoriasis did not help, it drys  the skin a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% natural and is the closest oil to our own sebum that our skin produces.</li>
            <li>This is a seriously cool product and will be a staple in our home from now on.</li>
            <li>This Dudu makes my hands soft, and has a nice odor.</li>
            <li>Maybe if the magical dudu can absorb all the kaka-girly nasties that have been imbedded in his skin, then they will stop forcing him to do makeup commercials and sing soprano (unless he wants to, of course, then who am I to say he can&#x27;t)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about two weeks now, and there is sometimes a fluttery burn sensation that goes away once I splash cool water on my face to rinse it off.</li>
            <li>Good to order several bars at one time.</li>
            <li>even orders more for my whole family and friends</li>
            <li>This also a good facial cleaner</li>
            <li>Its gentle on my skin, and love the smell.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure if it was too much of a discomfort, I could use less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I made sure to really inspect my skin</li>
            <li>you have good skin and like fragrance in your soap (that you want to last), then this product is for you.</li>
            <li>Its not a bad smell</li>
            <li>I have no problem whatsoever with the smell, because it&#x27;s not a bad smell to me...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just not a natural-type smell.&lt;br /&gt;Soap</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
            <li>Great for dry, itchy skin!!</li>
            <li>Smells good and really makes your hair have a lot of volume if you use it on your scalp, but it does give it a new texture too.</li>
            <li>This soap does an amazing job of leaving you clean and refreshed, but not dried out(if used right).</li>
            <li>great product already starting to fade scars in combination with the 100% PURE SHEA BUTTER</li>
            <li>Certainly cleans and keeps my skin looking smooth and acne free.</li>
            <li>I have experienced no side effects, redness or other irritation that others have mentioned.</li>
            <li>GREAT BUY, JUST AS I EXPECTED!</li>
            <li>Its smells great and washes well like any other soap</li>
            <li>soap is cheap (2 dollars more than my old soap), smells great, and replaces other products I use.  </li>
            <li>This soap has a clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>but if I have just shaved my legs then I lather the soap in a wash cloth and then use the wash cloth to clean so that I won&#x27;t cause irritation to my freshly shaven legs.</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li>it smells so good,feels clean and fresh after using it..</li>
            <li>I smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh skin.</li>
            <li>after shower,feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Fresh citrusy clean smell.</li>
            <li>Well, i have been trying ever since and my skin is clearer and improving tremendously from the state my skin was in.</li>
            <li>Smells super, mildly exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>They went away quickly, however, and my skin is now firmer and clearer than before --</li>
            <li>Because of this, it does have a mild drying affect.</li>
            <li>Helped my acne problems tremendously.</li>
            <li>My older brother got my sister, mom and I this soap as part of our Christmas gift this year, telling us that he turned his girlfriend onto it and that I&#x27;d love it.  </li>
            <li>then that wore off quickly, and I am still waiting and using this.</li>
            <li>Finally this year after reading many reviews on this product I realized I needed more than just this soap.</li>
            <li>After many many years of searching I finally found what fits my skin.</li>
            <li>It quickly clears up problem areas on my face.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and on time.  </li>
            <li>rub one hand lightly on the bar and work up a light lather on my face and rinse, I might repeat if my skin was very oily or I&#x27;m removing makeup or sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for myself, I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who isn&#x27;t super picky about their soaps (ya, know, gluten-free organic, free-range, blessed by a priest, made-only-by-monks-in-tibet-fed-a-vegan-diet soap).</li>
            <li>and when they arrived I quickly opened one</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s super prone to acne.</li>
            <li>Lathers well and mildly scented.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I don&#x27;t have any skin issues that needs to be treated</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for mild cases of eczema.  </li>
            <li>but my skin got used of it quickly.</li>
            <li>But only thing is make sure you use a moisturizer afterwards :)</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft, smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>Now I will be sure to bring more back with me in the spring</li>
            <li>Dissolves quickly in the shower.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap for my mild psoriasis and now I don&#x27;t want another.</li>
            <li>I introduced it to my family and they&#x27;ve become quick fans too.</li>
            <li>If you leave it out and let the water run over it the soap will disintegrate quickly.</li>
            <li>Mild on the skin and cleans well.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, 2 days after purchase.</li>
            <li>The bar does not dissolve away quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells great, lathers well, all natural, but the downside of all natural is it doesn&#x27;t kill the bacteria.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it more time for the positive results, but I have used it for more 3 weeks so far</li>
            <li>The lather is abundant and the fragrance is like no other....</li>
            <li>i highly recommend for anyone suffering from acne or acne scars to give this soap a shot :)</li>
            <li>first off I give the soap 5 stars because it smells good, secondly I give the soap 5 stars because it does make me feel clean but having said that the soap does tend to cause me to caugh</li>
            <li>leaves a super clean feeling and makes the entire house smell amazing.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am VERY pleased with this bar of soap.</li>
            <li>I have been plagued with skin issue most of my adult life and so many of them have improved thanks to this soap.</li>
            <li>I was putting on more moisturizer than normal just to help with the dryness.</li>
            <li>it way more than the normal bars</li>
            <li>It lathers ok, but not as well as the other and the lather isn&#x27;t as nice.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I have no idea if one is authentic and the other is not.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and definitely purchasing this soap again.</li>
            <li>Smells good and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>in all, its a good soap if you want to feel clean, but as per other reviews I did expect something special.</li>
            <li>The scent is super strong and it really irritated my skin</li>
            <li>I could smell it out of the box, and it filled the bathroom with a subtle beautiful clean aroma.</li>
            <li>Our new favorite soap.  </li>
            <li>I love amazon reviews and look for them whenever I am opting to try a new product.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone, oily skin and wanted to see if something new would work better than what I was using.</li>
            <li>and so I told them to get this black soap, and they all have and was happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soap smells great, not like typical soap</li>
            <li>Even though it washes off it leaves a slight brown tint on the skin - great for those who want a sunless tan look.  </li>
            <li>I had read many reviews stating this soap should be kept away from water because it can dissolve pretty fast.</li>
            <li>i tried it out it smells great and left my skin soft and squeaky clean</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell -- it smells &#x27;natural&#x27;, clean, and light.</li>
            <li>Really good soap, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>This is a good soap to use for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smoother, evens out my complexion of dark spots which have faded considerably since I began using it in March, clears up acne and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>this is a very good soap now for those of you scared about the burning sensation that everyone else is worried about experiencing for the first time use, I just used it and did not experience such a thing probably because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very good soap for sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I do have light eczema, but I did not see positive results from using this soap.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment!!</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase, but I will be buying it again!</li>
            <li>soap worked wonders for me on the FIRST DAY!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am satisfied that it does a pretty good job of protecting my face from the ravages of harsh weather.</li>
            <li>The product would be great except it is like washing it bleeds color and will make a mess in the bathtub, soap dish, etc.</li>
            <li>I love this product and its all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>It gets every last ounce of makeup off; even the most stubborn mascara wipes away easily with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not dry up the skin, smell good and reasonable priced</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night, but I would make sure you use a moisturizer because it tends to dry my skin out a bit, though it seems to be adjusting the more</li>
            <li>Washing was great its really soapy and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out</li>
            <li>Good soap, but nothing special compared to other</li>
            <li>On a positive note, this is extremely good at clearing blackheads -- amazingly so, actually!</li>
            <li>I guess ya gotta love soap to take the time to critique it; but this soap is unusual and lives up to the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Water could have all kinds of contaminants, so when I&#x27;m looking for a pure product the type of water is important to me.</li>
            <li>Just get a little of this stuff and it lathers up great.</li>
            <li>My sister has a little girl (just turned 1) who has skin problems and she now uses this on her and has seen great results.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to buy this soap after reading all the positive reviews</li>
            <li>AMAZING totally transformed my skin</li>
            <li>It has a light smell and lathers really well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and works fast...</li>
            <li>I just ordered more of this soap because I also use a bar for my 4 year old that has eczema.</li>
            <li>a bit zesty but fresh smell alone sold me.</li>
            <li>even though the soap is in its own boxes and was in a bag inside of the big box!</li>
            <li>I believe it to be just as useful as the others</li>
            <li>I was pleased to discover that this soap contains natural ingredients</li>
            <li>After a while I noticed that her face was fresher and more clear and I asked her what she was doing.</li>
            <li>Tips:  -don&#x27;t apply to freshly shaved legs  -be</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many soaps claiming to be sensitive to the skin.</li>
            <li>I am sure this also comes from the natural ingredients as well&lt;</li>
            <li>So far, though it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much soap to create a good lather and one bar lasts longer than regular soap.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Here is my own analysis, based on chemistry and personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>There dont seem to be many checks and balances as far as anything goes in that country.</li>
            <li>Reading all the reviews on this soap make me laugh...</li>
            <li>After one use of this soap, I must say, it left me with an unfamiliar feeling compared to the popular soaps.  </li>
            <li>After making fun of it&#x27;s name and appearance all evening, my wife also noticed a differece in my skin.  </li>
            <li>: twice the work, but absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>RESULTS: twice the work, but absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>So far I love the combination of this soap with shea butter as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have used this soap now for 2 months , my skin is clear and lovely.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t even worth returning</li>
            <li>and I am still as enthusiastic about the product as I was when I wrote the initial review.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>You will have better results applying the soap directly to your skin.</li>
            <li>Love the results so far.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural and soap-free.</li>
            <li>Even tho i rarely get pimples now, its the scaring that will not fade.  </li>
            <li>I received the soap in a timely fashion and the soap is fresh.</li>
            <li>So far I really love this soap.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell, tried it, it just wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the investment and don&#x27;t forget to moisturize because your skin needs the moisture even if toy are oily like me.</li>
            <li>The smell stays on my skin throughout the day and leaves me smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>So, for face, any kind of regular non-fragrant moisturizer does the job.</li>
            <li>In my country(India), they sell a famous soap, Lifebuoy, a very basic and cheap, red-colored brick-like soap (it didn&#x27;t lather well).</li>
            <li>I love this soap because of its&#x27; ingredients and so far I have not died from it.</li>
            <li>it smells so fresh.</li>
            <li>It is a nice facial and body soap</li>
            <li>There are no artificial ingredients or preservatives to be found apart from \\&quot;fragrance,\\&quot; which I admit could be anything but</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>The soap has a nice smell, but the only downfall is that it leaves a puddle of brown suds and residue on the soap dish.  </li>
            <li>this soap better than old school soap</li>
            <li>Definitely use a nice moisturizer afterward like shea butter because it cleans off everything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Anything more frequent may harm your skin or compromise its disposition.  </li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in doubt, try it, stick with it, and marvel in the glory that is clear skin :)</li>
            <li>(i.e. &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;) I&#x27;m all about FULL disclosure on product ingredients</li>
            <li>It has a powerful perfume-y smell to it.</li>
            <li>and I want to find something that is more natural for long-term usage.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen all of the benefits that everyone claims yet, but i love the smell and the natural ingredient list.</li>
            <li>I was using a different kind</li>
            <li>Now my dog&#x27;s breath smells like plantains and will never be in danger of getting rare dog mouth acne.</li>
            <li>I love that it is a natural soap.</li>
            <li>I tried this soap due to the same reason I think most customers out here on Amazon do - the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Lasts longer than many soaps, you initially get a significant loss of</li>
            <li>but I would recommend just using it once when you are in shower because it is very potent and can dry off your skin.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today and it made my eczema patches super dry,but it did not itch.</li>
            <li>he thought it was a mild sunburn at first..</li>
            <li>When you use it you feel very clean and your face is soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m AA with 3c/4a thick hair and this feels so good!  </li>
            <li>All the other ingredients are good, though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very gentle soap, and I love the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>My face started burning right away</li>
            <li>after I statred using this soap, cleared it right up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Clears up my acne right away.</li>
            <li>With a name like &amp;#34;dudu&amp;#34; what should I expect right?  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of breakouts on my face right now, and I&#x27;m hoping that this soon will help with those soon</li>
            <li>I sometimes use the Bar soap (Coconut &amp; Papaya) right after for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I almost returned it right there</li>
            <li>During my quest for the right \\&quot;products\\</li>
            <li>I love to try new soaps and been in love with Aleppo soap which I use regularly on body and hair.  </li>
            <li>Dudu-Osun creates a highly alkaline environment which has a more highly disinfectant action than most soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff really makes you feel clean in the shower.  </li>
            <li>But the best part about this soap not speaking for all skin types, but for my extra dry skin it really helps softens and lighten the Skin up.</li>
            <li>OK I posted a old review about this in the first week of me using it</li>
            <li>love RAW black soap, but Dudu Osun is currently my &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; :) I love this stuff, works good!</li>
            <li>imparting sweet pure fragrance..</li>
            <li>But the major problem is the fact that many people are using a cloth towel/ shower puff to apply the product.</li>
            <li>But the major problem is the fact that many people are using a cloth towel/ shower puff to apply the product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad to have found a quality and authentic black soap that is delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li>By the way the bar is VERY large.</li>
            <li>I suffer from postherpetic neuralgia, and this Dudu-Osun African Black soap is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Not all black soap formulas are the same, Dudu Osun is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many things in my 29 yrs for mild acne,proactive was my last thing i researched this soap and never ever heard about it before after reading the reviews i decided why not give it a try.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant, and it creates a thick lather.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it&#x27;s such a lovely mild soap for one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural and looks hand-made as opposed to so many commercial products.  </li>
            <li>The soap gets out all the dirt and opens up your pores soothe the skin with some shea butter and say hallo to the gorgeous skin coming out.&lt;br /&gt;The buffer or loafer to use should not be of a light color white, peach or cream won&#x27;t look the same...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to know how good it is!</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a pretty good soap.</li>
            <li>I am a Caucasian woman aged 66 with very light, freckled skin and light hair and eyes.  </li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t used this long enough but we love what we have experienced so far.  </li>
            <li>After about two weeks of use, A rather large scar on my breast from surgery,has almost disappeared!It&#x27;s a blessing for me!</li>
            <li>Psoriasis, eczema and minor irritations of our skin has tremendously improved over the last three months that my family have used this soap, but it is very important to use good quality natural lotion to keep your skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Helped my skin and didn&#x27;t leave it dry, feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I tried the soap last night and so far so good.</li>
            <li>if I made a good choice my skin would have a burning sensation and would slightly peel</li>
            <li>the bubbles are white and when it rinses it looks like i was really diry lmao.</li>
            <li>The black soap was really good.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the can soap better, but the bars last forever and they smell so fresh</li>
            <li>and I wanted a soap that was effective and didn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>This soap stains my bathroom shower with black residue, Although it smells good, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li>It not only made my acne go away, but it tightened, firmed and gave my skin an overall great complexion.</li>
            <li>This is a strong soap that not only strips you clean but replenishes as well.</li>
            <li>Good for a harsher black soap.</li>
            <li>But, with just a few days of use, I have reordered 8 more bars on top of the 4 I just received since I intend to use it exclusively if it in fact works as well all over.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast...</li>
            <li>for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant and isn&#x27;t harsh for the nose at all.</li>
            <li>LOL, but other than that it is safe to use other places just not there.</li>
            <li>For all you other acne-sufferers out there, this soap is a very worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know anything about this stuff, but it&#x27;s cool looking, smells good and does everything a regular bar of soap does, except leaves a trail of brown suds instead of white.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I have finally found the right soap for me.</li>
            <li>got here quick great soap, makes my skin soft, has little ruff pieces in it that help exfoliate.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit odd at the beginning, but after the first use it smells good.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product as it helps me very much.</li>
            <li>And the price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>thank you very, very much.</li>
            <li>The soaps came in  very fast.</li>
            <li>I DO NOT recommend it for use near your &amp;#34;sensitive areas&amp;#34;, because it tends to sting and burn, everywhere else on the skin is fine, though.</li>
            <li>Like I said in my original review, my primary problem was severe acne on my back and shoulders.</li>
            <li>Like I said in my original review, my primary problem was severe acne on my back and shoulders.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps, and I would recommend this for a more natural healthy way of cleaning hair, and for those who have dry skin.    </li>
            <li>These soaps smell nice and organic, but honestly they leave my skin dry and bitter after I use them in the shower.</li>
            <li>I use it like every other day because it really drys out the skin for me good because skin is so oily</li>
            <li>so far I feel fresh and clean after I shower.</li>
            <li>IT SMELLS SO FRESH AND CLEAN AND MAKES MY SKIN SO SOFT</li>
            <li>You feel so clean and your skin feels so smooth after using it, that I will definitely make this my day to day</li>
            <li>I really like how gentle it is on my skin, and how clean my face feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is SO potent i would not recommend using it daily, because it &amp;#34;MAY&amp;#34; strip you of needed moisture.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on the first bar</li>
            <li>but I guess my expectation was higher based on the reviews and recommendations from people</li>
            <li>I also made that mistake during the first couple of months of my use.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>everything works at first, but soon becomes ineffective.    </li>
            <li>What I like most about this soap is that I can use it on my entire ody w/out irritation....</li>
            <li>The first time I used ot</li>
            <li>I even gave it as gifts, to only my favorite friends.  </li>
            <li>Most use marketing language and obscure ingredients to back those claims which in turn, prove to be misleading and prolonging your conditions.</li>
            <li>I was in love after only a week of using it and am hooked on it like it is crack.  </li>
            <li>It is very drying!   </li>
            <li>It looks like a turd at first, or a chocolate bar</li>
            <li>I ordered another dozen bars before I finished the first one.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s an exact list of the ingredients on the box:    </li>
            <li>the last 7yrs I&#x27;ve been using Baby Magic Hand &amp; Body Wash for My face</li>
            <li>Got my soap today and used it for the first time this evening.</li>
            <li>After reading the stellar reviews, I decided to give this soap a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first noticed the sores on my legs, I stopped using soap for 7 - 10 days.  </li>
            <li>I began using the soap again and sure enough more sores began on my legs and also one on the outline of my upper lip also began.  </li>
            <li>I tried many different cleansers, lotions, and potions to no avail.</li>
            <li>Not enough words to tell how I&#x27;m in love with this soap.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what I AM REALLY looking for!...</li>
            <li>I first kept it in the shower</li>
            <li>I have already replaced my first order.</li>
            <li>decided to try it as a body soap and my boyfriend started commenting on my skin&#x27;s smoothness and glow after the first week.</li>
            <li>I bought my first 4 bars with tad suspicion.</li>
            <li>This is my second order of Dudu-sun and I&#x27;ll order more when this runs out.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been suffering from moderate acne for over 10 years &amp; this soap is just OK.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem that much better than regular soap to me.</li>
            <li>It makes my whole bathroom smell fresh.  </li>
            <li>It was daring me 9the soap) to try it haha!</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and clear, and I believe it is because of using Dudu Osun, because of the ingredients is has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i did research first then ordered this brand</li>
            <li>At first my face burned from it</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more once I run out.</li>
            <li>would advise to be aware that it can leave stains if you don&#x27;t wash out the tub/shower immediately.</li>
            <li>I first tried it whan</li>
            <li>first ask the specialist to place some product in your skin</li>
            <li>The shippings really fast!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time I&#x27;ve been able to look in the mirror and not see any blemishes.</li>
            <li>So I knew exactly why I was breaking out.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time I&#x27;ve been able to look in the mirror and not see any blemishes.</li>
            <li>So I knew exactly why I was breaking out.</li>
            <li>-- I plan on updating weekly on this to tell you how my skin and face are doing with this product, but using it for the first time today, I wanted to write a review.</li>
            <li>Order got here in great time for ordering late Friday, it got here on Monday.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect at first.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>I was given this soap by a friend years ago and never used it consistently.</li>
            <li>I first used it, I rubbed the bar between my hands for a couple seconds then started to wash my face.  </li>
            <li>This soap is really something else!</li>
            <li>And  I would even put up with all of the above if the soap would make my skin feel better , but it don&#x27;t .</li>
            <li>It IS different; stronger than most</li>
            <li>Nature &amp; Herbs is a fantastic 5 STAR business, and I urge everyone to support them and check their complete online storefront.   ~DM</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t get discouraged the first time u use it and think your one of the unlucky ones who can&#x27;t use this soap.</li>
            <li>I first kept the bar of soap on a rack in my shower caddy hanging from my shower head.  </li>
            <li>First, This is my first review on a product I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only writing this because I am in LOVE with this soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, be aware that this soap WILL BURN YOUR SKIN (depending on your skin sensitivity that is).</li>
            <li>All skin is different though and some days will burn more than others</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really starting to believe in the magical dudu.  </li>
            <li>If you exfoliate with this and use hot water it may burn your skin.</li>
            <li>i  can  safely say the same  as for myself when i  first used it  while on  deployment  in  Afghanistan.</li>
            <li>I first came across this soap at an herbiary in Philadelphia selling for $5 each bar.</li>
            <li>so much what a deal!</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re gonna try it just buy one bar at first.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I am soon finished with my fourth bar and need to buy more.</li>
            <li>I have never felt so pretty til I stated using this soap.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes well, and its the first time I am using this product.</li>
            <li>Kinda burns when u first use it</li>
            <li>It was working for the first couple weeks</li>
            <li>The ingredients state \\&quot;fragrance,\\&quot; but doesn&#x27;t state what exactly is used for fragrance.</li>
            <li>It came in the mail sooooo fast!</li>
            <li>Ok stuff doesn&#x27;t necessarily prevents breakout but somehow it faded my acne scar.</li>
            <li>I was having real acne problems!).</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I would lather up my face and let it sit for about a minute before scrubbing it off with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>It burned the first time I used it but after that my skin adjusted.</li>
            <li>I use this on my toddler and it&#x27;s surprisingly gentle, despite its powerful healing effects.</li>
            <li>I have finally been able to cure my toe fungus.</li>
            <li>It smelled funny.</li>
            <li>Better than the morning burst I used to use on my face prior to receiving this.</li>
            <li>now, a month later, I can without a doubt tell you that I have found my favorite soap.</li>
            <li>I got this as a Christmas gift and at first I was like what the heck was my husband thinking......</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you put Apple cider vinegar on your face with cotton ball after washing it!!</li>
            <li>It looks like a turd at first, or a chocolate bar</li>
            <li>But I do like the smell of the soap still ;)</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to my family and friends and I will definitely will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love it as a body soap especially moisturizing with coco butter after, sticking to the Ghanaian version for my face though.</li>
            <li>first, I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me - just seeing what I wanted to see.  </li>
            <li>I have skin problems and have used a bunch of different products and this is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>but this was my first time using Dudu-Osun.</li>
            <li>I also made that mistake during the first couple of months of my use.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Not terrible acne, but enough to be embarrassed about when it happens.</li>
            <li>Ok so first the packaging was to my liking the boxes we stacked evenly inside a plastic vacuum sealed bag.</li>
            <li>I had ordered this soap because it was a good deal to be honest, I mean four bars of soap for ten dollars is a bargain</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this soap for teens (my son uses it) and adults who have mild to medium acne issues.</li>
            <li>, my black heads on my nose are almost gone, I have not had a huge pimple on my face this month and my acne scars seem to be alittle better but not gone.</li>
            <li>and when I say sliver I mean sliver (lol).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wish I can find the right treatment as I&#x27;m really lost..</li>
            <li>I was very glad to see this soap being sold on amazon in multi-packs for much less than $5 each bar.</li>
            <li>What did I care, as long as I got clean and the soap was cheap.</li>
            <li>Other than that this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>well so far i have not used it much and am about done with the first bar, but it seems to leave the skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>They are a nice change from the synthetic fragrances you get from a lot of other soaps.</li>
            <li>good price, fast shipping, however, the item itself is a little overrated</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every brand imaginable: Clinique, Clean and Clear, Proactiv, Neutrogena, Zapzyt, etc.</li>
            <li>I am very happy so far with the Dudu-osun African Black Soap.</li>
            <li>Lathers great and can last a while if you&#x27;re careful.</li>
            <li>My skin feels sooo soft after using that...yet clean when rinsing off, without the skin irritation...</li>
            <li>and I kept washing my hands over and over as my hands were so clean and soft</li>
            <li>i felt so clean yet so refreshed and so soft.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural soap that lathers well and hear African Black soap was the best choice.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling soft and clean and does not leave a slippery film in the shower.  </li>
            <li>This soap is natural and it leaves your skin feeling so clean and</li>
            <li>It makes the skin soft and you just feel so clean after a shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has faded my own acne scars, some that were over 10 years old and not only that, but I sometimes get cystic acne along my jaw but not with this soap.  </li>
            <li>If I do buy it again it will be because it is a natural soap and has such a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I wanted simple, natural, effective and affordable</li>
            <li>In a few more weeks I was completely free of acne and have been ever since.</li>
            <li>It is pretty pure</li>
            <li>It also has many other uses such as wards off bugs (hopefully not your mate), is very good for Psoriasis and other skin diseases.  </li>
            <li>I opened up a new bar and tried again this time I was a little more gentle and used the soap more sparingly when my face started to burn</li>
            <li>I been using the black soap I love it!</li>
            <li>soon as I used it, I felt it &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; on my skin and my skin felt smoother and overall just really clean!</li>
            <li>There is no excessively dry, tight feeling after using, but just nice and clean!</li>
            <li>but it was to a point where my skin would be beautiful one week and then black heads and acne the next.</li>
            <li>hasn&#x27;t had a positive effect on psoriasis.</li>
            <li>positive review.</li>
            <li>The scent (flowers) of the soap itself is a little strong for my taste, but it doesn&#x27;t leave you with a strong body scent.  </li>
            <li>after using the soap for about 2 weeks, (which is great because other soaps caused rashes within a day or two), we noticed red welts on his abdomen and legs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years, mostly the expensive stuff and nothing compares to this cheap soap.  </li>
            <li>have been using this for last 2 months, no soup could ever clean my face as good as black soup.&lt;br /&gt;combination of witch hazel and tea tree oil plus washing my face twice a day with this soup did wonder for my skin.</li>
            <li>as well :) It does have a drying effect at times though (the stretched face feeling?).</li>
            <li>Ok I read all the other reviews before we bought and decided it was worth a one time try.</li>
            <li>The first few times of using this soap, I fell in love!</li>
            <li>I have fallen completely in love with it and recommend it to all of my friends, and probably will never buy another type of soap as long as this continues to be made.</li>
            <li>As long as I maintain a healthy diet and use the soap I have not had problems with my skin.</li>
            <li>I am a guy who hates oily feeling on my skin and pretty much every bodywash I used</li>
            <li>The first thing that I notice is  that I don&#x27;t really have to scrub with this soap anymore.</li>
            <li>and it goes fast if water runs on it consistently.</li>
            <li>Yes, my skin is evening out and my pores are becoming smaller which makes my skin look</li>
            <li>But the price is not bad to find out if your are sensitive to the smell or not, because the SOAP WORKS on getting rid of acne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what, but this soap does something good to your skin.</li>
            <li>What it does do though is leave your skin feeling soft - that is true.  </li>
            <li>Nice stuff, but leaves dark messes in your soap dish.</li>
            <li>i am sold on it highly advise anyone to start by ordering and using  right away..</li>
            <li>I will use it a few more times because it made me feel really clean and it lathers well</li>
            <li>SKIN REALLY FEELS SOFT AND CLEAN  </li>
            <li>At first, it was a good soap that got me really clean,I liked the smell, and I could even overlook the fact that half of one of the bars turned into a small pool of mud</li>
            <li>, i am going to use it for the rest of my body which seems to be doing ok and stop using it on my face and see if the pimples will dissipate, that will mean i have to buy another facial wash and see if it will do a good job of clearing the pimples....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted, I may be in the minority of sensitive skin consumers but you need to have more concrete data and complete transparency of ingredients supporting your claims.</li>
            <li>I said earlier though, using African black soap alone is probably not going to clear your skin, so my best advice is to start using more natural products or homeopathic remedies.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using her first soap (from this package) and so far according to her, the skin is softer and feels more clean in comparison with other products.</li>
            <li>The acne scars have all but disappeared and it is extremely rare that I even have a new breakout.</li>
            <li>You definitely have to follow up with a moisturizer and lotion after but with the right products, this is all you need to keep your skin clean.</li>
            <li>Took the 2 that soap packaging was more affected by and laid it on a plate to air dry used 1 of them to immediately wash my makeup off</li>
            <li>a very decent so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Nubian Heritage black soap and really liked it.</li>
            <li>At first, I just used the soap on my problem areas then decided to start using it the shower for allover washing (do not use light or white washcloths with this soap, not even Clorox will get the brown tint out).  </li>
            <li>We also use the black soap shower gel which is nice too</li>
            <li>and he commented on my hair that it felt super soft</li>
            <li>and he commented on my hair that it felt super soft today.    </li>
            <li>Make sure after you shower that you place the soap on a dry paper towel.</li>
            <li>I really really love this product, however, I think it made my skin too dry or may have put something on my face that didnt do well with my skin type.</li>
            <li>I no longer have black heads and my skin has smoothed out nicely.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried many and nothing helped, or it would just dry him up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super self conscious about what I put on my face.</li>
            <li>However when I opened one of the packages I had this strong sniff of fragrance that is definitely not in the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; arena.</li>
            <li>These large bars last a long time so this is definitely a good purchase.   </li>
            <li>This is a large sized bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have oily acne pron a skin with large  pores .I</li>
            <li>{I tend to break out in a rash from certain chemicals in skin products}</li>
            <li>SOMETIMES CYSTIC LARGE</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this soap to anyone.</li>
            <li>And there is a certain spot that is &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; no matter how hoard I try to get it</li>
            <li>This soap is pure and you just feel your skin breathing after using it.</li>
            <li>I really love this productthe really makes your skin feel real goodI&#x27;ve tried other black African soapthis is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li>However, it has definitely kept the unaffected part of my skin healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Dudu-Osun makes a lather that feels rich and creamy but rinses off better than most national brand soaps, leaving behind just enough moisture to keep your skin fresh.    </li>
            <li>I wet my face and neck area with hot water to open my pores, work up a good lather</li>
            <li>Any blemishes or acne will scab up and healthily bring back new skin.</li>
            <li>I had heard about African Black Soap, and decided to give it a try; I am so happy I did.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use Carol&#x27;s Daughter \\&quot;Bring back the moisture\\&quot; liquid soap which is also great and works well with the black soap.  </li>
            <li>Great African Black soap in a bar.</li>
            <li>The Dudu-Osun African Black soap has worked great for keeping my acne at bay.  </li>
            <li>African black soap is great.</li>
            <li>I like it and my entire house smells super fresh</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural soap and always loved black soap.</li>
            <li>Smells good, makes my skin soft, but not like the typical soap that you buy in stores.  </li>
            <li>The soap smells fantastic and feels great, and I love using it, but my acne got no better or worse after three weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this African Black Soap product several times and have had excellent results.</li>
            <li>but one of my boxes was open on arrival (not the outer packaging), the soap was fine but...</li>
            <li>My face is amazingly soft and clean without any dryness plus the whole entire bathroom smells so fresh after every shower!</li>
            <li>I love how my skin looked the 2nd day and now it has been 5 days and see a brighter, clear  face and my pores minimized!  </li>
            <li>all the time now, I even give one to my son-in-law and he is now a lover of the african black soap really works great on our face.</li>
            <li>The water drains brown for a second but rinses off just fine.</li>
            <li>It causes a slight \\&quot;chemical peel\\&quot; action, so intense scrubbing isn&#x27;t a good idea, nor is leaving it on for an extended time.  </li>
            <li>The smell is neutral to nice, the bar size is fairly large, and it leaves you feeling squeaky clean but not dry or drawn tight.</li>
            <li>Right now this is my favorite brand of black soap.</li>
            <li>After I rinse it off, my skin feels soft and tight and most importantly:</li>
            <li>A little more cleaning in the shower but its well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have oily, sensitive skin and this helped to combat the oiliness, but it did it a little too good.</li>
            <li>will definitely keep you guys updated on how my skin does with this black soap, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>will definitely keep you guys updated on how my skin does with this black soap, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>This is good for cleansing your scalp and won&#x27;t make your hair smooth unfortunately.</li>
            <li>This product arrived in the mail today, and let me tell you, from the second I opened the box up, I could smell how AMAZING the soap smelled before I even actually opened a bar of soap.</li>
            <li>I didnt really care for this soap, it makes my family very itchy and REALLY dries out our skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t buy it though, the same way I don&#x27;t buy it when Asians talk about how amazing Asian products are.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin fresh and not at all dry and it feels clean.</li>
            <li>I used this soap a few years ago with wonderful results, but stopped because I thought it was too messy.</li>
            <li>When you dry yourself, the smell fades out and you end up smelling really clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Huge bars of soap that last for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>Package arrived really fast.</li>
            <li>Please try this if you&#x27;ve struggled with skin issues your whole life like me.</li>
            <li>Here is what I&#x27;ve noticed after using this every day for my body and twice a day for my face: My skin complexion is very even and the look and feel of</li>
            <li>I purchase mine from a seller on eBay but really want to review it for those who purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I bought it at Whole Foods Store in the beauty dept,  </li>
            <li>I will always buy this item its really does wonders for my skin</li>
            <li>There hasn&#x27;t really been any improvement.</li>
            <li>We have really noticed an improvement in all of my family&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li>My face, neck,fore-arms and hands are MUCH darker than the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>This soap really helps to improve the performance of your moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Also I had a blackhead that was very noticeable</li>
            <li>REALLY REALLY</li>
            <li>Skin is looking so refreshed and acne has improved so much</li>
            <li>I did shipping was fast and as soon as i got it</li>
            <li>Works well, leaves skin feeling clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>It lathers really well, cleans well,  and doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
            <li>They are still there though and very noticable at times</li>
            <li>I read the ingredients and one thing that really stuck out to me</li>
            <li>I could not wait to receive it, but was very thrown off when I did.</li>
            <li>A coworker of mine uses it in her hair and she absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really Dry&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t really have any skin problems to speak of)</li>
            <li>then I realized it is the soap which then made me wonder how much of that brown stuff just stays on my skin</li>
            <li>I use a gentle exfoliator and follow up with toner from Merle Norman as well.</li>
            <li>And RINSE really well</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been working very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even think about putting foundation on when I was getting ready for work this morning.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much this soap has helped my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get pimples, maybe 5 a year</li>
            <li>It lathers really well</li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t really itch because I use moisturizer on my face.</li>
            <li>Normally my brows go in all kinds of directions, and for once they were tamed (I might use it on my hair as I intended to do at first).    </li>
            <li>When I find something that works I run to write my review because they really help me discern what to spend money on, what works and what doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Cleared up my brothers acne fast and lasts about a month or so each bar.</li>
            <li>I had a rash on my skin that was very itchy.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is a bit much.</li>
            <li>It leaves too much oil on my face</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I tried a liquid pump brand from Whole foods, no to my liking.  </li>
            <li>My skin always thanks me when I use this soap.</li>
            <li>I admit, that isnt really a problem for me, but my girlfriend has some skin issues from time to time, and she absolutely loves this soap as well.</li>
            <li>He wants me to continue buying it...</li>
            <li>I dnt really care for the smell.</li>
            <li>with some really suspicious looking tunneling.  </li>
            <li>These bars r in a very convenient size &amp; shape.</li>
            <li>I have seen a real improvement in the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>I tried it as a shampoo and my hair has gotten so much thicker, and so much stronger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it up real well in the shower</li>
            <li>Now she wants to use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely using this routine the day before and the day of.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely using this routine the day before and the day of.</li>
            <li>My wife &amp; I really like this soap, we will buy it again.</li>
            <li>i really like it cleans well.</li>
            <li>I am afro Hispanic with olive complexion and really like this soap.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair with it and it cleans my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping I&#x27;d see some results in a week or two but nothing</li>
            <li>This soap is a real treat, I will be purchasing it again and again.</li>
            <li>I purchased it because I have very oily skin and was prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>AS MUCH MAKE UP</li>
            <li>He swears by this so much we buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li>really like it.</li>
            <li>This soap really is blackish brown and smells like Ivoey soap.</li>
            <li>I really really like this soap.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and helps keep the skin moist.</li>
            <li>I gave one soap to my sister (didn&#x27;t work too much for her), I kept one and hoped that I would rate this item as \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; within a matter of days.</li>
            <li>Rub gently, and rinse immediately, don&#x27;t let it sit there</li>
            <li>We also are Caucasian and found it very helpful.</li>
            <li>really it real.</li>
            <li>and you can then suffer it&#x27;s cons for that much longer...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the stains it leaves on the tub.</li>
            <li>It was an absolute disaster.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t see any mass improvements in my face.  </li>
            <li>I do really wish this worked for me though</li>
            <li>It arrived in a timely fashion and the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Avoid using a cloth, just lather with hands and rub it gently on your skin.  </li>
            <li>These vitamins DRASTICALLY helped my skin, and after roughly two months, my skin looked 75% better.</li>
            <li>My skin thanks me for it.</li>
            <li>like I said before, it has really helped.</li>
            <li>Of course, you should talk to your doctor about supplementing with any vitamins and research how much of each you really need or should take.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still can&#x27;t believe how well this soap has helped my skin and how much of a difference it really does make.</li>
            <li>Fast forward after vacation was over</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still can&#x27;t believe how well this soap has helped my skin and how much of a difference it really does make.</li>
            <li>Fast forward after vacation was over</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff.</li>
            <li>It is gradually fading away, thanks to this soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was shipped fast and in my house quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter how much I use</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this soap is very &amp;#34;leaky&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s how I found out how much cleaning power this soap has.  </li>
            <li>This soap really cleans my skin.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I showered with it, it lathered very well.</li>
            <li>I work at a fast food restaurant</li>
            <li>but it melts too fast in the shower.</li>
            <li>(I am a lady and very feminine at that).  </li>
            <li>It really depends on what you can and can&#x27;t tolerate and your beauty goals.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t use too much, once a day and don&#x27;t scrub it into your face just gentle</li>
            <li>thanks ,</li>
            <li>Though it has not yet proven to be affective in toning some of the blemishes I have on my skin, it lathers and cleanses very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why people say it smells ,,it really dont.</li>
            <li>This soap is the real deal...</li>
            <li>It really cleans and clears the skin .  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t take much to lather up; just one wipe across a moist washcloth or hand</li>
            <li>, I really think the smell will turn you off as it did with</li>
            <li>For body, I rely on Olay in-shower body lotion, it stays put really well.</li>
            <li>A very welcoming experience for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t help much...</li>
            <li>i used this soap on my whole body for two weeks</li>
            <li>Once I opened the box the cent filled the entire room.</li>
            <li>It helps with acne/scars more than I expected.</li>
            <li>I think anyone with acne and/or oily skin should really consider using this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this soap, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>and it also has worked very well.</li>
            <li>It really dries you out</li>
            <li>If you have skin issues, itching, dryness acne, or cannot find a soap that really works with your skin give this product a try.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for my broken out skin</li>
            <li>My whole bathroom now smells like it.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>really like it now.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the changes I see in my skin.</li>
            <li>so when I opened the box my whole room smelled like the soap even though I hadnt used it yet.  </li>
            <li>I used it on face too gently and this made me get rid of all of the 70 dollars kits that had been draining my pockets.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Man people really prey on us.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>The soaps smell too much.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This soap clears your skin so fast</li>
            <li>It cleans make-up very well.</li>
            <li>It really cleans the face.</li>
            <li>and it also got rid of that intense burning sensation and sensitivity.</li>
            <li>The sunspots and acne scars are fading and I&#x27;m currently acne free.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>but i was really looking forward to it being beneficial to my skin.</li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>but this dries it up fast.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my whole body.</li>
            <li>Simple smooth circular motions with your hands will do the trick.</li>
            <li>very cleansing...</li>
            <li>why I am really buying this again is what it does to my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing much a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice any benefits.</li>
            <li>I can really see a difference in the tone and texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I can really see a difference in my skin after using this soap.</li>
            <li>I will continue use this soap and recommend it to others as it really does work.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this soap, im 32 and still get pimples from having oily skin this soap really stops break outs.</li>
            <li>so I have been wanting something that will get rid of them for good or at least keep them at bay</li>
            <li>You still can&#x27;t skip good skin cleansing at least 2x a day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what this magic can do in the near future.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is true since I&#x27;m 41 with no wrinkles so far, so I say, cool, don&#x27;t have none, won&#x27;t be none especially if I use these products.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is true since I&#x27;m 41 with no wrinkles so far, so I say, cool, don&#x27;t have none, won&#x27;t be none especially if I use these products.  </li>
            <li>fragrance of this soap is an outdoorsy-type scent, kind of a pine, cedar, and green smell to it.</li>
            <li>Any business who strives to retain good paying customers should make it a common practice to \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Well I do love it&#x27;s scent, the lather and that it contains only natural products.</li>
            <li>I like all natural products and when I make my own lotions I use Essential Oils to add a natural scent.</li>
            <li>When I opened the individual soap box and sniffed the bar, the smell was so overwhelming it nearly knocked me over.</li>
            <li>It really helps with my Eczema and keeps my skin looking fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, tried many products and shower gels, nothing works as well as this African soap.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower everyday and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>I use regular soaps and never had this problem the only thing nice</li>
            <li>It smells good, and it slowly has helped me with my skin condition.  </li>
            <li>It does leave a bit of a film on the skin - not necessarily a bad thing, but for those who like coming out of the shower feeling squeaky clean, it is not exactly that feeling.</li>
            <li>and I am thinking that I am going to have an adult face for once!!!</li>
            <li>I reserached a few different kinds &amp; brands, and landed on the Dudu-Osun which was rated pretty highly, had good reviews, and was offered at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you really want to try a very good black soap, go for the Dermactin-TS Exfoliating Black Soap…</li>
            <li>I bought this soap because i was looking for a natural product that would help with my acne, and was eager to try this due to the good reviews, and customers saying how it helped to clear their skin.</li>
            <li>Although it made an improvement right away, it took a month or so to totally clear up her skin, but it did and she is hooked.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s has strange strong smell.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good soap, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me that other soaps didn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin very soft and can be used on sensitive and dry skin like my own.</li>
            <li>This soap makes my skin feel and look clean, clear and soft.</li>
            <li>I was surprised, it leaves my sink feeling clean, and soft.  </li>
            <li>I would only warn that you should really rinse the tub after using because it can up how often you need to clean it.</li>
            <li>This soap is more commercially processed the convenience is that you have no foreign particles within yourself.</li>
            <li>I have not used this with a loffah, I just rub it vigorously and it makes a really rich white lather.</li>
            <li>My husband also likes this soap, and says he feels like his skin is cleaner than with many other soaps.  </li>
            <li>I still use a cream for any small blemishes I get, but this soap has taken care of most of them!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s probably 12% better than the other bars of soap I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the possibly present lime may be acidic helping with acne and immediately soothing with the Aloe, but they may have been trying to cover up a smell or made a pretty big mistake.</li>
            <li>Not exactly what I thought it would be and do, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>But the same, rich lather and healing benefits.  </li>
            <li>But this  soap  does what  other soaps claim but at a  better price .If</li>
            <li>i like this soap, it doesn&#x27;t HELP my psoriasis, but i know it&#x27;s better than other soaps out there</li>
            <li>I have tried other bands but this stuff is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference immediately my skin cleared up and kept my oily skin problem under control I&#x27;m a man who sweats all the time this soap definitely cuts through my funk and makes me feel so clean</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something to deep clean troublesome skin...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m absolutely convinced this soap is the main reason why.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m absolutely convinced this soap is the main reason why.</li>
            <li>I used it again that same night and no redness just squeeky clean.</li>
            <li>I always feel extra clean , when i am done.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately if it sounds too good to be true.. then it probably is.</li>
            <li>Dudu Osun serves as the perfect base for the myriad of moisturizers I use (shea butter, sweet almond oil, lotion) and my Desert Essence deoderant.  </li>
            <li>During my first year of using this product, I loved that it completely rid my face of the dark brown spots left over from years of acne</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who wants smoother, clearer, and cleaner skin.</li>
            <li>They are not overly special compared to a soap bar at your local Target/Walmart.</li>
            <li>Clears up adult &amp; teenage acne very quickly..</li>
            <li>It lathers up really well and has a slight fragrance making it OK for men as well as women ....&lt;</li>
            <li>Had patches of chronic dry skin for years and years that resisted any kind of medical treatment-</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin in my body and acne prone super sensitive skin in my face.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and have skin issues and are looking for a \\&quot;black soap\\&quot; since it&#x27;s supposed to be good for acne-prone/sensitive skin, then it&#x27;s not (as simple as that).</li>
            <li>best thing about this soap is that it is completely organic and has the ingredients, in plain english, printed on the back of the box.  </li>
            <li>I love the aroma and rich creamy feel of this product and it does not dry my skin out like harsh chemical cleansers.</li>
            <li>It blow dried how it would normally for the most past, but I was absolutely thrilled to feel normal textured hair, but it was SUPER SHINY and very very SOFT.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty sensitive nose</li>
            <li>and the spots and small pimple like grains seems to be receding somewhat into the skin...but who knows how effective it will be in the end when i used the 4 pack i bought.</li>
            <li>The morning after I used it for the first time, those bumps were GONE completely.</li>
            <li>So short and sweet, here we go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My already dark skin darkened more during the summer</li>
            <li>She is 10 years old and is not always consistent with cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>Personally the smellis not bad to me.</li>
            <li>Not necessarily bad, but if I needed any regular soap I would just go to grocery store or CVS.</li>
            <li>But even when I was breaking out some, my skin looked so nice that the very little acne wasn&#x27;t the main focus on my face.</li>
            <li>I went from having clear, perfect, glowing skin, to dry, pimply skin, with lots of black marks in a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>It does tend to dry out the skin a bit but only for the first week or so.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will be buying more.</li>
            <li>However, for those same reasons, it can dry out your skin, but then again who&#x27;s buying pure natural soaps without having some kind of moisturizing ritual.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to get rid of big pores, but this seems to be doing a great job.  </li>
            <li>that it does melt kind of fast but not much different than other soaps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still continue doing reviews, but as for this weekly update, it&#x27;s nothing new really.</li>
            <li>I will likely alternate between the two because the African raw soap is my favorite and makes my sensitive skin feel great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read such great reviews about African Black soap, and I was looking forward to seeing much clearer skin.</li>
            <li>I have always love black</li>
            <li>In the beginning many ppl have some slight side effect but they will subside eventually..</li>
            <li>While surfing the \\&quot;net\\&quot;, I came across a comment about DUDU OSUN Black soap that was so inspiring.</li>
            <li>I love black soap.  </li>
            <li>I love black soap &amp; it keeps my skin exfoliated.</li>
            <li>So, this is a slight better in cost if you want to save a bit.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love black soap.</li>
            <li>I love this  black  soap</li>
            <li>I love this soap, all my black heads are almost gone, and i have stopped breaking out.</li>
            <li>OK, yes, I kept a couple for myself as I wanted to try a black colored soap.  </li>
            <li>It does dry the body but the skin is still smooth.</li>
            <li>I have been using DUDU OSUN products for a while now, and I love the black soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this black soap.</li>
            <li>I love this black soap.</li>
            <li>but u reckon I&#x27;ll be ok since black soap is all I use but who knows because this one has lemon.</li>
            <li>question I have though, is if black soap is okay to use for a woman&#x27;s V?</li>
            <li>the downside is I do find this soap in particular</li>
            <li>The soap seems to double as a mild exfoliant and toner.</li>
            <li>I have focused getting rid of mainly the ones on my face.</li>
            <li>However my entire body quickly became an eczema and rosacea</li>
            <li>but the more I used it the drier my complexion looked, so i would ultimately discontinue usage for a short period of time.</li>
            <li>Well, since I was pregnant during the time I didn&#x27;t want to risk any medicine that was not  necessary.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m leaving 3 stars because it does a decent job with oily skin.</li>
            <li>It left my skin soft, and lightly scented.  </li>
            <li>have phsorisis and its only mild..</li>
            <li>I bought this particular brand because this is the one they sell in Lagos (I&#x27;m Nigerian).</li>
            <li>The soap have a mild smell that is bareable, yet it leaves your washcloth, shower and soap dish the same color as the soap.  </li>
            <li>no ugly  brown rings, does not melt and certainly no thick suds to make a facial mask.</li>
            <li>This will be my main soap along with ivory.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking about benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid in particular,</li>
            <li>I got pregnant and my back face and chest.</li>
            <li>You should use a soap dish though to make sure the soap isn&#x27;t kept in a constant state of dampness so that it can last longer.  </li>
            <li>This is my second or third time buying this soap, and I must say that I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This particular brand is a top seller on black soaps</li>
            <li>Used to purchase expensive facial wash, however have dropped them all for this wonderful soap.  </li>
            <li>smell decent and cleans well.</li>
            <li>It is drying but any decent moisturizer with take care if it.</li>
            <li>My skin has definitely gotten better and I will definitely be replenishing soon.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne in my face and back and this soap is helping a lot.</li>
            <li>As i grow older</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to since I am now on my all natural kick!!!</li>
            <li>After I FINALLY finished (it took quite a bit longer), it was very thick &amp; full, shiny, and a bright vibrant lighter brown color.</li>
            <li>The people on here saying it smells your whole room, you must have very very sensitive noses, because yes it does have a smell</li>
            <li>Wow, so cool, and here is the surprise - no dry skin afterwards!  </li>
            <li>I really like this natural soap!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get back with you and let you know what&#x27;s the deal 3/17 which will be 1 full month of using this new regime.</li>
            <li>Great on skin, leaves a very clean feel but can be messy in shower and on counter top leaving behind black residue!</li>
            <li>and at first it made my skin smooth and less irritated for about a week or so</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product for acne sufferers.  </li>
            <li>I grew up with acne from junior high to college</li>
            <li>Both are alkaline (high pH level).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>highly sugget this soap.</li>

            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess my expectations were just too high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it scalp, face, or an all over body soap.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, for this price you can&#x27;t go wrong!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this soap for acne, psoriasis, eczema, scars, or even just as a disinfectant.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this purchase to anyone.</li>
            <li>This soap is high in perfume scent, which I didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>was a high as the product, so</li>
            <li>This INCLUDES monthly cycle time, high stress level time, and even the summer when I tend to breakout from sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and so I tried out a couple different brands of black soap, hearing good things about it&#x27;s chemical exfoliation, and wanting to keep my skincare routine natural.</li>
            <li>, even my husband noticed it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been having so much problems with dry and itchy skin, I tried so many different product and if it wasn&#x27;t the product that gave me a rash, I didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft and smooth and I have noticed some old marks starting to fade away.</li>
            <li>The box says Pure Natural Ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Just ordered shea butter today with a double shipment of the Dudu soap ;) can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li>It cleared my son&#x27;s back acne almost immediately after the first use!  </li>
            <li>This soap exfoliates, fade dark spots, dries out your pimples which helps prevent other problems, and leaves your face feeling so refreshing and light.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the quality and was a little worried that it would fall apart in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It does stain your tub/soap holder - but nothing a little elbow grease cant remove :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes you feel fresh and clean but is not intended for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Having researched skin care options that are both natural and gentle (due to my eczema and sensitive skin), I&#x27;ve read plenty of reviews and tried many soaps.</li>
            <li>suds are creamy and rich, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>but it is a bit time consuming since the butter is kind of hard to apply to all of my skin evenly.  </li>
            <li>good reason to start using moisturizer which had not been my practice) and just a little burn around my sensitive skin (eyes) but only for the duration the soap was on my face.  </li>
            <li>I got a case of acne at 30 years old and this was the only thing that helped, and i seen a difference right away!</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and rinses off clean.</li>
            <li>I was just hoping it would give me a clean wash and help with my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Well it did give me a clean wash and help with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Why I was really impresses was the fact that it did clear up my skin in a matter of days.</li>
            <li>Happily I was wrong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will clean you well but will dry you up.</li>
            <li>really like it so far.</li>
            <li>Rinses off clean and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am a 40 year old Caucasian woman who has had acne almost my whole life.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see the soaps was not damaged or wasted.  </li>
            <li>I kinda found it messy and swore at it:)))</li>
            <li>Her skin has been lovely for a few months now.</li>
            <li>We are more than a few days into March, and I&#x27;m still waiting...</li>
            <li>I received my order within a few days :).  </li>
            <li>my normal soap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would tell you to try it you will love it,,,and it last for a long time...</li>
            <li>When they ask what I&#x27;ve changed, I simply tell them that I rub magical dudu on my face and they proceed to give me rather strange looks of jealousy and longing.  </li>
            <li>I am currently living in Costa Rica for a year and brought the bar with me, but after running out near the beginning of my trip I have been dying to get back home for winter to get some more.</li>
            <li>It dried out my face for the most part, and made me break out a bit and have whiteheads.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just for normal skin</li>
            <li>Soon I began liking the smell in general, it&#x27;s fresh, natural, not artificial/</li>
            <li>I have used this soap many times before in the past, my whole family loves this soap.</li>
            <li>Dudu-Osun moisturizes and cleans without stripping off normal amounts of skin oil, and without overmoisturizing.</li>
            <li>WOW WOW!!!</li>
            <li>This seems like more or less the same stuff, but more carefully processed.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap but it does&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 66 yr old male who doesn&#x27;t usually get excited over soap, but this is now my favorite.</li>
            <li>My mild acne initially seemed to clear up, but then about a week into it seemed to &#x27;purge&#x27; --</li>
            <li>I have used different black soaps and have always liked them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you like bathing in brown stinging water or your bathroom is just too white, boy did you find the right product.</li>
            <li>Let me explain: the soap didn&#x27;t tangle, but it felt like a huge solid wet clump of wet spaghetti &amp; got to the squeaky clean state right away</li>
            <li>At first I was a little skeptical,  but as it turned out, it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>The 2nd time I used it I didn&#x27;t follow up with moisturizing, but my face felt fine the next morning.    </li>
            <li>I have used it in the past and felt really clean and fresh after using.</li>
            <li>Thus, if you feel a slight \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; as he described while using the soap, please be aware that this might the beginning of a mild allergic reaction.    </li>
            <li>soap says natural, but what is natural OR pure about added fragrance?</li>
            <li>Also, due to extreme sun exposure (I live in sunny Southern California), I experienced unattractive discoloration.</li>
            <li>and I was determined to try then turns out my new BF uses it andhe told me it helped</li>
            <li>(this will be My New regime)</li>
            <li>I have it on autoship since I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I have it on autoship since I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts</li>
            <li>I live by it</li>
            <li>Like with anything your PH changes when you try something new.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing really new to add.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing really new to add.</li>
            <li>I guess if you&#x27;re new to this product just don&#x27;t buy a ton</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any new acne.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I believe the evening of the skin tone is due to the lime juice as it&#x27;s acidic and typically that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s good for.</li>
            <li>I could get facials and hope they will go away, but they are so expensive and the chemicals may not really be the best thing for my skin.</li>
            <li>8 hours later I went to bed, woke up 4 hours later sniffing the intense smelling soap fand feeling panicky, as in anxiety causing a mild panic attack.</li>
            <li>the person who said that if you are light skinned African American not to use this soap because it makes you lighter.  </li>
            <li>It only stains cheap, low count cotton cloths.  </li>
            <li>It only stains cheap, low count cotton cloths.  </li>
            <li>It took several more tries to get it</li>
            <li>I use morning and night and then air dry before applying a mild moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an all organic type of guy, but soap is something that I&#x27;m using on my body everyday, and It&#x27;s nice to know that that I can actually pronounce the stuff that I&#x27;m rubbing all over my body every morning in the</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it looks like a solid rock, it lathers rather very well and by that it also means that this soap runs out really fast, so</li>
            <li>Melts pretty fast if its in water too long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would mind the scent if I only smelled it when I used it, but it&#x27;s making my bathroom smell a bit reminiscent of a cheap hotel in a tropical locale.</li>
            <li>Granted, I do have a sensitive nose, but wow, I&#x27;ve never had soap make my whole bathroom smell.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are simple and chemical free, that is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li>I feel like maybe I&#x27;m the only confirmed Asian who has purchased this soap,</li>
            <li>The soap gets used up pretty quickly, so it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>This is great soap, I always thought that I was just destined to have dry chapped skin, but all of that is gone with Dudu_Osun African Black Soap!</li>
            <li>other reviewers have talked about irritation, but so far the soap has been fine for me.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my skin felt very soft.</li>
            <li>Since it is very natural, it tends to be a bit crumbly.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap for my daughter and me as we have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>(my skin is very sensitive).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I never suffered from acne throughout puberty or high school, and thought I would be blessed with clear skin.</li>
            <li>and yes I have very sensitive</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel very soft after using.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I have not had any problems using this soap.</li>
            <li>My hair is tightly coiled-kinky and this soap makes it so easy to comb.  </li>
            <li>Go ahead and giggle, people: this is my new favorite soap, and has a lovely fragrance, rather the opposite of the slang term it unfortunately brings to mind.</li>
            <li>Truly helps clear up skin and acne!</li>
            <li>First time buyer, so I may augment rating, to reflect overall performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally I have a {MCS} Multiple Chemical Sensitivity User Friendly Soap to Use.</li>
            <li>and I have used many types of products and masks in my past</li>
            <li>Within two weeks of using Dudu-Osun, my skin looked better than it has in the past year.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited because I paid standard and was not expecting the package to come until the following week...</li>
            <li>hopefully it treats it completely!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy so more after I open my last bar out of the this box.</li>
            <li>My first bar only lasted 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>At first I just felt it on my face, but the second time I used it I felted it on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li>My skin is amazingly soft!  </li>
            <li>I have 20 year old stretch marks from childbirth that are fading!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of soaps over the years, and I&#x27;m not usually picky.</li>
            <li>This is normal, the soap is natural, so it bleeds with vitamins and it&#x27;s elements.</li>
            <li>it does smell the same original packaging, but it not the same soap.</li>
            <li>so be prepared to scrub your tub more than usual.</li>
            <li>Either way, stay way from chemicals and buy natural products!</li>
            <li>am now a 23 year old, light complected, white male.</li>
            <li>They leave your skin so soft and moisturized!  </li>
            <li>However, recently I saw it in my make-up storage bin and decided to give it a try consistently.</li>
            <li>I normally use bar soap like Dove and Old Spice, so I figured I&#x27;d try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely noticed a difference within the first week.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>My brother in law in a marine, during training and drills when it is hot out, he sweats a lot which will cause his shoulders and back to break out.</li>
            <li>(not excessively of course.</li>
            <li>Natural products do wonders!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the creators are so sure of their product, they took the name challenge and added a prefix usually used to describe feces by my 4-year-old nephew.  </li>
            <li>natural and fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;I will repeat!</li>
            <li>Holy cow was my hair shiny, full, and soft!!</li>
            <li>Holy cow was my hair shiny, full, and soft!!</li>
            <li>( I think it got in my eyes a little or maybe the strong smell irritated my eyes, but I rinsed my eyew with water</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to try it on my hair but a little concerned, since I color my hair, as the soap seems a bit strong.  </li>
            <li>and it is a little strong but nothing that gives me a head ache.</li>
            <li>- Major plus!!!</li>
            <li>I really wish I could give this an enthusiastic review, because that would mean that it actually worked for me.</li>
            <li>any other soap leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>leaves skin soft/smooth and extremely squeaky clean</li>
            <li>scent is a little strange but feels nice.</li>
            <li>It does seem to be having a positive affect on keeping my dry skin at bay, but it melts so fast in the shower.</li>
            <li>It is really not necessary for it to be effective and this is probably a factor in other people&#x27;s various skin reactions that I have read here.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let it get near your eyes or other more fragile</li>
            <li>I remember it a huge block in less than 2 weeks it became a piece of sponge.   </li>
            <li>At less than $3.oo a bar, it is a HUGE savings to me.</li>
            <li>The bars are also huge and last a long time.</li>
            <li>After use, my skin feels like it&#x27;s slightly taught and smooth.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to buy this product as long as it&#x27;s available via Amazon.</li>
            <li>Seriously, after struggling for years to clear my skin, it is such a good feeling when you find a product that clears everything up in a matter of ~8 weeks.</li>
            <li>Seriously, after struggling for years to clear my skin, it is such a good feeling when you find a product that clears everything up in a matter of ~8 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and was quite conservative with it at first, only using it for showers..</li>
            <li>I figured that since everything I&#x27;ve tried is pretty much equally ineffective, I&#x27;d just stick to a natural routine.</li>
            <li>My psoriasis is clearing up on my arms and my hair on my legs isn&#x27;t growing back as fast as it normally does</li>
            <li>No, it&#x27;s no more effective than, say, Irish Spring.</li>
            <li>One bar lasts a long time, its gets really soapy and is pure so I like that it is natural, as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s calmed down my skin problems and is a much better alternative to commercial soaps that contain chemicals.</li>
            <li>Gives my skin a radiant glow, help clear up dark marks and leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Not good as expected, I was hoping the soap would be more fit for oil skin</li>
            <li>The very first time anyone tries it, there will always be a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;m going to stop rambling, but please if you have any problems w/ skin, such as rash, acne, blemishes, dark spots, etc please give Dudu Osun a shot, I&#x27;m not a professional nor can I guarantee that my results will be the same for you, but trust me its worth a shot!</li>
            <li>The very first time anyone tries it, there will always be a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>My skin is now silky to the touch and my dark spots are visibly fading I also use REAL shea butter right after I wash my face</li>
            <li>I bought this after hearing African Black soap worked for acne-prone skin, and I was not disappointed!!</li>
            <li>, I do also have raw shea butter too and make sure that after I apply the black soap to my face I follow up with a minuscule amount of shea butter (a little goes a long way) to eliminate drying as some have experienced.</li>
            <li>I would like to report that those large stretch marks I had on my upper thighs are just about gone.  </li>
            <li>I would like to report that those large stretch marks I had on my upper thighs are just about gone.  </li>
            <li>I did when I was younger, I would certainly give this soap a try.</li>
            <li>I heard about africn black soap, but was concerned about the roughness of its natural form on my childrens delicate young skin, so I was happy to find this soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After cleansing, gently PAT your face dry with a clean, soft towel (don&#x27;t rub dry).</li>
            <li>It has been a little over a month now, and my face looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and last a very long time!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, on your path to getting clear skin, I would definitely recommend supplementing with certain vitamins and encourage you to do research into them.</li>
            <li>and it has significantly controlled my breakouts, giving my skin a chance to heal and black marks to fade.  </li>
            <li>It melts a little too fast for me, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>My face, back and shoulders have dramatically cleared up within a matter of days, and it seems like older acne marks are fading already!</li>
            <li>Also I did notice when I washed my face with it, my face starting feeling warm and turned a little red.</li>
            <li>and I had generally liked the other black soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is because the black soap is slightly exfoliating and deep cleans the skin in a relatively gentle way and keeps sebum production under control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is because the black soap is slightly exfoliating and deep cleans the skin in a relatively gentle way and keeps sebum production under control.</li>
            <li>It truly is an amazing beauty secret.</li>
            <li>I experienced no burning or crazy drying effects.</li>
            <li>BUT I HAD TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THAT AND JUMP ON MY NEUTROGENA BODY CLEAR BODY WASH.</li>
            <li>Instead of helping clear my daughter&#x27;s skin, she broke out severely on her</li>
            <li>and I could see my skin transforming into what I have been trying to accomplish forever, a clear glowing complexion.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this soap I had a huge flared cyst on my cheek and subsequently to using the soap it minimized it so much, enough that I&#x27;m not so self conscious about it.  </li>
            <li>This soap is heavy, thick etc which is great</li>
            <li>My face is 100% clear of blemishes, and my complexion is even and skin is like silk.</li>
            <li>My face is 100% clear of blemishes, and my complexion is even and skin is like silk.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>If I notice that my skin becomes too sensitive after using it consecutively I will use my over the counter gentle skin cleaner for a day or so before going back to this product.</li>
            <li>and I purchased this soap based on reviews claiming that this soap helped to clear acne and acne scars.  </li>
            <li>This soap evens out my skin and helps to clear my pimples.  </li>
            <li>I bought the St ives apricot scrub and it helped clear some of the pimples, but i am not out of the woods as yet, so been trying castor oil as well.</li>
            <li>It works so well to clear up acne and acne scars</li>
            <li>helped her clear her face without over drying it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but i do see my skin clear up</li>
            <li>My skin still didn&#x27;t clear up and it was still breaking out.</li>
            <li>My wife has even started using it on her face and it has started to clear up her breakouts.  </li>
            <li>After 2 months of continuous use, I one day woke up with clear skin.</li>
            <li>Me, clear skin.</li>
            <li>With him in about 3 days his skin was completely clear and has been since he started using it once a day at night.</li>
            <li>It really helped clear up my face up of occasional acne.</li>
            <li>This soap keeps my oils balanced and keeps my face clear.</li>
            <li>My face feels really clean and slightly tingly when I wash with it.</li>
            <li>id steer clear</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Also I don&#x27;t put the soap directly on my face either.  </li>
            <li>maybe I developed  non-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Smells really masculine too.</li>
            <li>It really makes such a difference!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>anyone that has acne problem as an adult will try just about everything.</li>
            <li>As far as cleaning</li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning to my skin being very luminous</li>
            <li>And it is supposed to be a natural product with no chemicals.</li>
            <li>I gave this product 4 stars only because it is very drying for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be all natural, sensitive to skin and have health benefits like clearing acne, delays aging, curing cancer etc.</li>
            <li>Is it all natural?</li>
            <li>but I figured they make it a point to be all natural and sensitive</li>
            <li>I suspect the fragrance in the soap is the cause of my irritation of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you claim to use all natural ingredients AND be sensitive to skin, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be putting obscure fragrance in there or whatever</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I just wish they didn&#x27;t add so much fragrance -- not only</li>
            <li>but it destroys sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old son uses it also for itchy skin.</li>
            <li>I use coconut oil on my body afterwards and my skin is so soft and</li>
            <li>but that is the price you pay for all natural.</li>
            <li>I will still use this soap until it is completely gone.</li>
            <li>though it&#x27;s unusual mixed with the \\&quot;ash\\&quot; ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I can imagine some people with sensitive skin might want to test a bit before throwing themselves into using it frequently.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no mention of 100% on the box, so I don&#x27;t know, 100%, if the fragrance is all natural like they claim in the product description on Amazon&#x27;s website.   </li>
            <li>I also use it on my skin along with natural shea butter.</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive, and as a baby I couldn&#x27;t wear diapers (I wore cloth diapers).</li>
            <li>leaves my skin clear and soft too.</li>
            <li>Anti-bacterial action.</li>
            <li>The soap is not for fragrance sensitive people.</li>
            <li>Does anyone know if this soap is really natural?</li>
            <li>As far as I know  anything that you add a fragrance to, it is not organic/natural.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because I didn&#x27;t want to start putting chemical type products on her young skin to combat her acne.  </li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t rub the soap directly on my face since it has stuff in it, I guess for exfoliation</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put the bar directly on your face and scrub.</li>
            <li>I never put any bar directly on my face anyway.</li>
            <li>It cleans the skin very well and deep.</li>
            <li>So, I think I&#x27;ll stick to my old regimen of oatmeal baths and sarna lotion to relieve my skin.</li>
            <li>It works on old scars and those are disappearing.</li>
            <li>Well, I bought the soap because it is all natural, and because ppl claimed that it cleared up acne.  </li>
            <li>IT WILL LEAVE YOUR SKIN BABY SOFT.</li>
            <li>NO chemicals etc used ; just all natural.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this may not be the soap for you.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend to use it on the whole body, avoid the private part (for females), because I got uti and had to take antibiotics for it.</li>
            <li>I bought it because it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>I found since using the soap I don&#x27;t have to shave my legs near as often as I did when not using this soap.</li>
            <li>but so far I haven&#x27;t seen a change in my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and moist from using this soap.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for nearly 3 months and it has also started to fade some brown spots on my face</li>
            <li>I like that this soap is natural.  </li>
            <li>This smells like old homes</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still too early to tell all I know is my face</li>
            <li>No chemicals and all natural..</li>
            <li>I have suffered from adult acne for years, but since I have been using this soap my skin glows</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for making it possible .</li>
            <li>There are alot of natural soaps out there</li>
            <li>I bathe and wash my natural hair with it.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to get away from anything that isnt natural.</li>
            <li>AFTER 2 WEEKS MY SKIN WAS SMOOTH AND FIRM .</li>
            <li>We do not have what you would call sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Has worked wonders on my adult sons with exzema.</li>
            <li>helps prevent pimples and naturally cleans with these organic ethnic soap.</li>
            <li>I used it to wash my face, I&#x27;ve also used it to wash my hair because the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and it works wonders on my face and body.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel extremely soft.</li>
            <li>It is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>we will see if it works for old lady spots.</li>
            <li>natural, I use to use counter soaps</li>
            <li>But this soap wow, wow,</li>
            <li>It burns your skin where you are sensitive (read that again and think about it), this did not cease for me even after a month.</li>
            <li>an make you sensitive to sunburn  </li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I like that it is natural and has cleared blemishes on my skin.</li>
            <li>And the way it made hands, forearms and elbows feel out-weighed the very temporary issue, especially being a bar soap.</li>
            <li>but my skin is still soft and I like the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for, but I guess I must have been sensitive to this product because if I got it in my eyes it would burn, or accidentally up my nose it would sting and sometimes bleed.  </li>
            <li>Feet felt almost instantly soft even after I got up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Stay away from this product if you have sensitive.</li>
            <li>GO NATURAL.</li>
            <li>Any soap strips away the natural acidity of your skin and can allow free-radicals to damage your skin.</li>
            <li>Same deal: soak some onto a cotton ball and gently rub across my face and shoulders.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>and I like it so far</li>
            <li>As far as acne goes, it didn&#x27;t help the problem, but it does help fade the blemishes that I  have.</li>
            <li>Even though I filter shower water, this soap leaves my skin so soft and doesn&#x27;t need tons of lotion.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with a problem with acne all my life.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to see what all natural soap was like.  </li>
            <li>but, i have sensitive skin and my skin loves this soap.</li>
            <li>Lol...and natural....</li>
            <li>Will stick to my Dove sensitive skin .</li>
            <li>I bought this soap A) because it&#x27;s all natural and B) because some reviewers had said that it helped clear their acne and scars.</li>
            <li>All ingredients are natural, except for the fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you like really natural, organic, etc.</li>
            <li>If your skin  is sensitive try if you feel a tingle leave  </li>
            <li>I also have begun using it as a shampoo, and it makes my hair shiny, soft and manageable without weighing it down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far whatever it is has not irritated my skin in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teenage son has very oily skin</li>
            <li>i use it on my 5 year old, my 9 month old (both boys) and me.</li>
            <li>AVOID sensitive areas&lt;</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>Makes the skin on my body feel toned and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have acneic skin on my face, and after ONE USE, my skin was brighter and it made my zits mature by the end of the day so that they could be extracted.  </li>
            <li>Also, my skin is baby soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>I bought this soap on advice from a friend who was getting adult acne.  </li>
            <li>Our skin is soooo soft and it has done wonders for our acne.  </li>
            <li>And using it on my scalp has completely eliminated my dandruff as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have oily, acne prone, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so this is helpful stuff.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using my Old Spice body wash and started using this on my body and face.</li>
            <li>Old scars that I have from playing football have begun to fade.  </li>
            <li>and recently I&#x27;ve developed hormonal acne around my monthly visitor time.</li>
            <li>I read a million reviews on natural soaps before buying this one.</li>
            <li>I use this soap to bathe with and to wash my face and my skin is soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>Either way, I like it so far.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I started using the soap and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This soap has helped my adult daughter lessen acne caused by a medication.</li>
            <li>My daughters just turned 9 and 10 years old, and about a year ago</li>
            <li>I like it so far, just started using it</li>
            <li>well I have acne since 9 years old and now I&#x27;m 33!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Over the years I have developed a sensitivity to soaps that results in a contact dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>My husband is sensitive to perfumes and it does bother him.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle enough for the face as well</li>
            <li>this product made my skin bumpy, and discolored a bit, which threw me off because the ingredients have natural elements.</li>
            <li>I decided that it was time to venture to the natural approach for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh and it removes everything....</li>
            <li>I have been usingit for a mouth now and didn&#x27;t notice any difference so far.</li>
            <li>so far it seems to be improving my adult acne.  </li>
            <li>And knowing that it&#x27;s all natural is a plus.</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t recommend using it in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this soap on sensitive areas as my face..</li>
            <li>This soap is marketed as all natural.</li>
            <li>The whole bathroom smells, when you open it; and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t dissipate for days.</li>
            <li>It lasts a really long time, I am still on my first bar.</li>
            <li>My three year old daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural fruit based ingredients.</li>
            <li>This soap appears to be working so far on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 10 days now and my skin is so soft</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s because my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that is prone to eczema</li>
            <li>It really makes such a difference!</li>
            <li>By the way, I do not have a sensitive nose, it is truly just that</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural and even the address on the soap box is from Lagos, Nigeria.</li>
            <li>but this had completely erased it.</li>
            <li>All natural soap that cleans and leaves you completely refreshed.</li>
            <li>The only thing negative is that it kind of burns a bit on your nether regions.  </li>
            <li>I tried it a few more times, but ultimately had to throw it out because it was hurting my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also am able to use a thick moisturizer (night cream) by merle norman day and night to counter act the dryness.</li>
            <li>It rinsed completely out hence verifying that if you use expensive, good quality washcloths it won&#x27;t stain.  </li>
            <li>It rinsed completely out hence verifying that if you use expensive, good quality washcloths it won&#x27;t stain.  </li>
            <li>The smell is okay but not really amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, definitely flowery but also definitely not natural.</li>
            <li>Personally, I love the big chunk of Black soap they sell here on Amazon, *with the Shea butter in it!*...</li>
            <li>Our face felt very clean and once it started to burn a little we washed it off, no big deal.</li>
            <li>But I can say that I have noticed my acne getting much better over the past couple of months, too!  </li>
            <li>I would say be careful to use the right mixture of products with this bar.</li>
            <li>I started breaking out (for the first time in a very long time, mind you).</li>
            <li>I started breaking out (for the first time in a very long time, mind you).</li>
            <li>( I was sure to be VERY gentle as I&#x27;d read many times where a person was rough and it was painful)</li>
            <li>After I use this soap, I try to moisturize face/body pretty well, but since my skin is on the dry side, it&#x27;s still drying out my skin even with shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I had heard good things about African Black Soap and after perusing Amazon I decided on the Dudu-Osun Black Soap by Tropical Naturals.</li>
            <li>Small price to pay for something so reasonable in price and does such a fine job.</li>
            <li>Because our hair is naturally dry, I immediately added shea butter and oils to my scalp first and then to my strands to replenish moisture and avoid breakage.      </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for having other comments on products because it helped me to purchase this product and give it a try.</li>
            <li>true black soap.  </li>
            <li>I think I like the raw African soap better, but I like that this is already in bar form</li>
            <li>Before I made my first purchase, I read every single review.</li>
            <li>I placed the soap outside my main door, so that it would not be nowhere near me.</li>
            <li>Immediately after I get out of the shower my skin feels healthy, firm and soft all day long.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s helpful being able to always tell when there&#x27;s soap left behind ;)</li>
            <li>It is messy but totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I purchased it because of the natural ingredients, but am slowly learning that it is good for eczema, psoriasis, acne, (I use it as a preventative measure), and fading dark spots.</li>
            <li>While my sisters would use their high priced natural soaps, I&#x27;d be using my &amp;#34;gross&amp;#34; Irish Spring soap.</li>
            <li>I am a African American women in early 30&#x27;s and have suffered with mild acne since my teenage years.  </li>
            <li>I switched to &amp;#34;African Black Soap Raw Organic Natural Pure 1lb&amp;#34; (which is sold here on Amazon) and I like it better than Dudu-Osun.</li>
            <li>You will love Dudu-osun African Black Soap even if you are not african.</li>
            <li>but it has seriously changed my skin for the better.</li>
            <li>but if you have dry skin I really don&#x27;t suggest this for you as it can be very drying even leaving your skin white afterwards until you apply some type of moisturizer</li>
            <li>I have used natural black soap before with much success and can attest that this soap is in no way natural.  </li>
            <li>After letting it lather for a few minutes, you feel almost abnormally clean.</li>
            <li>I seriously can&#x27;t say how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>2)it is the grossest thing you will ever have in your shower - it is not a black soap, it is DUDU brown, literally.</li>
            <li>/makes your sting peel and dry, and yes this is true, but I recommend that you bare through it as it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do and will ultimately benefit you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People with sensitive skin should be careful when first using this, it can burn you/</li>
            <li>It also became apparent to me how much residue regular soaps leave on my skin.</li>
            <li>Once I stopped using it and used my old cleanser, my face turned back to normal.</li>
            <li>smell is a little strong for my taste, but this is only when using it in the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about African Black soap and heard this was supposed to be the original one behind all the other ones out there.</li>
            <li>using it on my body, same for the face, my skin became smooth, but using it for my head, I noticed tight areas on the back of my head near the top wasn&#x27;t as tight after I washed me hair, cut it, and watched it grow back.</li>
            <li>highly recommend trying this soap - you will never go back to chemicals and fragrance again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Dudu-Osun soap contains different forms of wood ash, which in turn has a high percentage of calcium carbonate (used in agricultural lime) and potash (used in lye).</li>
            <li>I bought these for psoriasis relative with a high hope they will help ...</li>
            <li>I love what its doing to my skin although it can make your skin very dry yet tight.</li>
            <li>USE THE LATHER FROM THE SOAP WITH YOUR BARE HANDS!!</li>
            <li>Major self-esteem boost!</li>
            <li>Major self-esteem boost!</li>
            <li>Now granted, there are 4 soap bars in the sealed plastic wrap, but upon opening it I felt like I had walked by the perfume counter of a major department store and had every scent sprayed on me at once!  </li>
            <li>and then it disappears, being gentle &amp; patting dry with your towel is your sensitive, ect).</li>
            <li>Well not quite that quick, but the bar lasts a lot shorter than other bars I&#x27;ve tried (compared to standard soaps and natural ones).</li>
            <li>I had a slight (but consistent) acne problem, and wow was I ever surprised at the results!  </li>
            <li>Very large bars last for a long time.</li>
            <li>I had been using Raw African Black Soap for about three months and loved it.</li>
            <li>I was really disappointed because this not only did not help with my acne but caused more!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it before its great especially now since I&#x27;m getting into my African roots so ill be using this soap a lot now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with intense acne for so long</li>
            <li>So, there were a few people wondering if it was ok for white ppl to use an African soap.  </li>
            <li>I have posted a review about a week ago on the general outstanding performance and some tips about the soap (such as sensitive skin experiencing \\&quot;burning\\&quot; the first few times if you are not gentle, brief breakout period</li>
            <li>Also, it retained enough of the soap that it was fuller and thicker than normal.</li>
            <li>Buy it, buy it!Also, it retained enough of the soap that it was fuller and thicker than normal.</li>
            <li>purchased the soap in a pack of 4 and have barely even made a dent in the first bar considering that I&#x27;ve used it mostly several times daily for 2 months.  </li>
            <li>The son that I originally found this soap for, his face was a mess when I first started ordering, he had so many scars and was constantly breaking out, it was sad.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of my normal soap and had no choice but to pull out one of these bars and actually use it.</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks I was confident enough to go out in public without ANY makeup!!!!!</li>
            <li>As regular soap use, not bad but...my husband told me he loves other brand.</li>
            <li>and as I got older i barely had breakouts now I&#x27;m 35 and its like all of a sudden puberty hit!</li>
            <li>My only issue, minor, is the soap, if left in any amount of standing water dissolves quickly.</li>
            <li>I like this soap more than any other black soap I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The price of the 1 Lb chunk is also very good..and it lasts a LONG TIME!</li>
            <li>But shortly after I graduated, went to college, and moved to a new city, my skin went haywire.</li>
            <li>cause I&#x27;ve gotten new ones on my face, neck, chest, and back, but not a ton, just a couple here and there.</li>
            <li>I live it and have left some for my mother to try.</li>
            <li>If you are the maker of this soap and you want to use that last sentence as a new business motto... please give me a job and pay me well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon..for printing both the good and the bad.</li>
            <li>Now as soon as I washed off soap it felt so clean like no residue feeling left after I dried my face with a soft cloth</li>
            <li>I really like it for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>He been having eczema for years and this really works in softening, his itchiness, and dry skin.</li>
            <li>the bubbles dont really turn that brown, you only notice it rinsing, on my skin (and I&#x27;m white)</li>
            <li>More people reviewing this product had complained of the same issue.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely looove this soap it has gotten rid of my back acne, and i was starting to get pimples on my thighs</li>
            <li>I bought this soap after some heavy research to cure my ongoing problem of a mild case of eczema.</li>
            <li>The more sensitive your skin, the worse this will be.</li>
            <li>Dudo osun is helping little fade a dark spots and keep soft skin in twice day, but I love it already.</li>
            <li>It burns like a mother especially on my cheeks which are rosey and very sensitive.</li>
            <li>It makes a muddy mess in the shower with use, it didn&#x27;t improve my skin at all, it stained some of my white wash clothes (brownish stains), and I had to clean my shower twice as often while I used my supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>Caused major flare-ups.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s usually not used by white people, but I tried it anyway.</li>
            <li>First off, it lathers extremely well.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I ran out of this soap, but I will definately be buying more soon!</li>
            <li>and we see a major improvement since he&#x27;s been using the soap.  </li>
            <li>I will say, I was hoping the black soap would help to even out my skin tone and help with fading some of my dark spots as so many reviews mention here and as the product description implies with the \\&quot;nature cures\\</li>
            <li>Extra clean feeling after use, but one MUST moisturize especially the face due to a drying effect that the soap has.</li>
            <li>The bar is a good size and the color looks like the other samples of black soap you may see that are square or odd shaped.  </li>
            <li>Some spots get a little dry at first, but then they must get used to the soap, because they get better in a few days.  </li>
            <li>I will also post other product links to the products I mentioned that I have really helped me achieve clear skin.</li>
            <li>I will also post other product links to the products I mentioned that I have really helped me achieve clear skin.</li>
            <li>During the second year I noticed a change in my skin, not as much oil production which made my face look dry and to me old.</li>
            <li>so it is better as use every other day or a few times per week.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you will find some large exfoliation bits that are rough.</li>
            <li>I was very leery about using &#x27;Black Soap&#x27;, in my new tub.</li>
            <li>ZITS.THAT LEAVE MY FACE WITH VERY LARGE BLACK SPOTS AND</li>
            <li>Like most black soaps, it does leave a black residue wherever you place it.</li>
            <li>it runs black when wet but washes away easily.</li>
            <li>it works so far it can burn little bit at first, just have to get used to it.</li>
            <li>I use a mosturizer right after because my face feels slightly tight if not.   </li>
            <li>makes more a baby black residue mess upon using it</li>
            <li>Since either way, she wasn&#x27;t using the black soaps, I decided to switch back since the other one felt more cleaner when I washed it off.</li>
            <li>Great for bad skin or acme or even eczema.</li>
            <li>Thought I would try this soap after perusing soaps and reading the generally favorable reviews.</li>
            <li>but as a general shower soap it leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>General effectiveness.</li>
            <li>General effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Or if your skin is just oily in general you might like it.  </li>
            <li>but then he started to really notice dark spots fading and completely disappearing as well</li>
            <li>I paid standard shipping, and when I posted my concerns Renee&#x27;s General Store said that I should have email my request to get my items early.</li>
            <li>This soap last a long time and lathers very well.</li>
            <li>wow, people you need to try it, you will not be disappointed, keep using it , you will see great results,</li>
            <li>My back and shoulders have not been this clear in years.</li>
            <li>My back and shoulders have not been this clear in years.</li>
            <li>I have fallen completely in love with it and recommend it to all of my friends, and probably will never buy another type of soap as long as this continues to be made.s has not irritated my skin in the least.  </li>
            <li>I used to rely on Neutrogena Body Clear to control my back and chest acne.</li>
            <li>I keep my unopened bars in a tightly closed bag and locked away in a drawer in the bedroom otherwise the whole room will smell like it.</li>
            <li>I do like that you can actually use as soap directly on your face without the worry stuff scratches but</li>
            <li>I use a lot of different natural bar soaps and this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>I am barely in my thirties</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell, but I am sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>everything was apparently brought to the surface</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had a long history of eczema, skin irritations due to sodium laurel sulfate found in many shampoos, soaps and toothpastes among other ingredients like \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I suffered from adult acne for last 3 years.</li>
            <li>Also got my teen and 22 year old to start using it.  </li>
            <li>or shall I say darker ones are barely visible.  </li>
            <li>or shall I say darker ones are barely visible.  </li>
            <li>It has worked wonders on my adult acne and my kids teenage acne.</li>
            <li>and it definitely leaves my skin soft and it has not stained my tub</li>
            <li>so far, I still have two bars left &amp; I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li>I then used it on my body and the soap left mine skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I have adult acne and this is the only soap that clears my face and fades the scars.</li>
            <li>it also melted if left near or around moisture.</li>
            <li>so I went back to my old face wash and haven&#x27;t had a breakout.</li>
            <li>now we barely need any lotion after showering and the acne on my face (although not</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s organic and uses only natural products;which</li>
            <li>Your skin produces natural oils that are suffice enough to replenish skin after use.</li>
            <li>But you must wash with your bare hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m out of the shower now, obviously, and my body feels SO soft.</li>
            <li>all natural - I am buying only products without fragrance or chemicals now.</li>
            <li>But all the ingredients in the Dude Osun soap are simple and natural.  </li>
            <li>my next step is a natural deodorant...</li>
            <li>I am a Caucasian female, early thirties, who has been suffering from hormonal acne for over a year now</li>
            <li>For barely over $10 this is a steal!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but like I said, bare through it</li>
            <li>It worked well enough for me to toss the old Benzoyl Peroxide in the trash.</li>
            <li>I have taken out everything from my old face washing routine and simply replaced it with this soap.</li>
            <li>I have natural, ethnic, coarse hair</li>
            <li>This is the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>This soap is lasting me about 90 days so far.</li>
            <li>I have tried mail order face systems, all natural face systems, over the counter, and regular drug store brand stuff.</li>
            <li>If left on the skin for even a minute, I can feel the burning for up to six hours later, and my skin sensitivity level is normal.</li>
            <li>I guess it gets worse before it gets better</li>
            <li>the danger of hormonal disruption from artificial fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother you than this is a good soap for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a change for the better or worse since using this skin.</li>
            <li>so it comes right out, but still a little perturbing.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this the seller told me to soap my cloth once and put the bar down....</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, make sure you get a moisturizer as well because it can leave your face feeling a little dry if you don&#x27;t have oily</li>
            <li>I tried various soaps, clensers, lotions and such, even made my own homemade lotion with shea butter and s few different oils (which did improve the softness of their skin and help a little with the bumps) but could not get rid of the bumps completely.</li>
            <li>So take it out and place it in a dry area until you are ready for your next use.</li>
            <li>this really softens skin - removes tiny bumps and dry spots.  </li>
            <li>My pores seem smaller, I get blemishes rarely, and I seem to have less redness.</li>
            <li>It makes your whole entire face feel opened up and refreshed, like every single pore you have is being cleansed.</li>
            <li>Because this soap is drying and I already live in a dry enough climate, but I like it thus far.</li>
            <li>and I did at first have some slight burning when I used on my cheek and forehead area.</li>
            <li>I have used black soaps before this was the first one that gave a skin reaction.  </li>
            <li>and it may have a slight burning sensation at first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used up my first black soap.</li>
            <li>First, it smells, to me, just slightly like Vicks cherry cough drops.</li>
            <li>other than that, hubby&#x27;s still in love with it and hasn&#x27;t been drying out as much as he usually does.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a few months now and my facial skin seems a bit better, so I&#x27;ll keep using it; one bar of soap can last a long time if you only use it to wash your face.</li>
            <li>Then, I used a small amount of shampoo and did a quick lather &amp; rinse.</li>
            <li>So far, after several months of use we&#x27;ve not had any dry skin issues, and we live in the Mile High dry zone and its brrrrrr...winter!</li>
            <li>I feel much more confident and have switched to a much lighter tinted moisturizer as a base instead of the heavy duty matte concealer I used before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I choose to rub it directly on the skin instead of taking the washcloth route, I just try not to apply with too much pressure as sometimes little particles can scratch.</li>
            <li>though dont scrub too hard with it, leaves you squeaky clean</li>
            <li>Other than the itch my face has a glow to it, and for once my SKIN can go the whole day looking how it looks in the morning</li>
            <li>My girlfriend said she didn&#x27;t care for it and didn&#x27;t like the smell as much as the other.</li>
            <li>is it dissolves much faster than any other soap I use.</li>
            <li>This is much cheaper that the other products I have used.</li>
            <li>It is a little more drying than I am used to, but my skin seems to have adapted after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>All this hype about how good this soap is for a persons skin and that it isn&#x27;t drying - WRONG!  </li>
            <li>It is \\&quot;unrefined\\&quot; and does have residue and deposits within the soap bar, including, but not limited to splinters, ash, etc.  </li>
            <li>morning: Dudu-osun soap to wash the face, mask of raw or clover honey and fresh lemon juice for 30 minutes, tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I had tinea versa color and the Dr. wanted to give me a medical shampoo and medical cream to help clear the spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently improved my diet (cut back on refined sugar, dairy, and gluten) in an attempt to clear my skin.</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice so far, but I will make further updates.</li>
            <li>I decided to only use it 3 times a week rather than daily because my skin is so sensitive.     </li>
            <li>my first order of this soap left dark brown rings around the facebowl.</li>
            <li>it to wash my feet paying particular attention to my heels which are dry and sometimes will even crack open.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have particularly sensitive skin, but this stings on application, especially on the skin around my eyes, nose, and mouth, and leaves those areas chapped and red afterwards.</li>
            <li>Does not dry my skin at all as others report.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my skin was so soft, I&#x27;m not sure if it was the soap over drying out my skin, or maybe it was the soap improving the texture  </li>
            <li>It does not dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li>It will  not  dry  out your skin either.  </li>
            <li>did not dry my skin out either</li>
            <li>And my dark spots due to acne fading significantly.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive, dry and flaky skin.</li>
            <li>This soap cleanses my skin so well that I am willing to deal with the little bit of dryness it causes.  </li>
            <li>It was a little drying at first</li>
            <li>first impression of the soap was that it was a little flaky.  </li>
            <li>However my skin has majorly improved, there are almost no marks or pimples on the left side of my face, even the indented scarring has gone away.</li>
            <li>One person recommended starting out on the hands first until some of the raw material became soft.</li>
            <li>it says \\&quot;Dudu-Osun is the age-long African black soap made the traditional way by hand from PURE NATURAL INGREDIENTS AND HERBS from the tropical rain forest and savannah regions.   </li>
            <li>The strong rule, the weak suffer.</li>
            <li>I was first introduce to Dudu-osun African Black soap by my daughter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been 2 months since I first started using this African black soap, and I still could not be happier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been 2 months since I first started using this African black soap, and I still could not be happier.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used the African black soap.</li>
            <li>However raw african black soap tends to be a better grade of soap.</li>
            <li>so I tend to like to have the raw african black soap better.</li>
            <li>Good for acne, and doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it made my skin feel so smooth after showing but the burning sensation was not good.</li>
            <li>I have been on the same bar for about a month now, and it barely looks used.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed the first few times I used this</li>
            <li>It smooths your skin to a small degree and makes your skin feel fresh, but it is horrid for what it&#x27;s bought for.</li>
            <li>, I get dry scalp and dandruff occasionally went testing out new products</li>
            <li>and i never really stick to any particular brand of facial wash</li>
            <li>it never let me down Thanks</li>
            <li>Really cuts down on shower time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mass straight away as it is hand packed, but once its been used that slows down</li>
            <li>but you will notice less new acne spots and black heads right away.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using African Black Soap, and I can tell won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li>The other thing that is true about this soap is that it leaves a black film on everything it touches including the skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in hopes it would get rid of new stretch marks and blemishes, I&#x27;ve been using it every day since mid July and the only thing it did was dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>It lathered a ridiculous amount, but I could definitely feel a HUGE difference upon the second rinse.</li>
            <li>leaves black color all over your tub and disintegrates fast</li>
            <li>All my skin felt soft except my face felt dry.</li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive or dry then this might not be the product for you.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the black soap is wholly responsible</li>
            <li>I really like the black soap I purchased at Amazon.</li>
            <li>It leaves his skin soft and it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li>this black stuff is either being uses by family or is just melt really fast</li>
            <li>cause it will wash off the natural oil on ur skin and making it dry.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get black heads as much as before.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than clinique or murad and less harsher than the presciption stuff I had from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I really like black soap.</li>
            <li>Especially the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t keep it on your face too long or it will begin to burn, and I&#x27;m sure if you leave on longer you would risk causing irritation to your skin, which could be worse than any acne you already have</li>
            <li>Some super sensitive people may find it slightly irritating on the first few uses, but that passes.</li>
            <li>You MUST try this soap!![[ASIN:B0023A7JF4 Dudu-osun African Black Soap (100% Pure) Pack of 4]]</li>
            <li>My back is absolutely, 100% clear, and like my face, the skin tone is even and no more hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>My back is absolutely, 100% clear, and like my face, the skin tone is even and no more hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>soap is a little more expensive than your average chemical filled soap</li>
            <li>soap is a little more expensive than your average chemical filled soap</li>
            <li>I do put the bar directly on my body and wash away since my body is less sensitive and can take the scrubbing</li>
            <li>My whole family uses this soap and we all have different skin disorders that has  been helped by using this brand of black soap.  </li>
            <li>the first couple of uses, my skin was red and had a very slight burnt appearance.</li>
            <li>and i started to see my skin was getting really weird and kind of dry and patchy.</li>
            <li>But it is bears a strong pungent fragrance that obviously is an unnatural, unnecessary ingredient.</li>
            <li>I have not had any new breakouts, my old ones are clearing up quite a bit and there is really only one little stubborn part left.  </li>
            <li>I am African American and have dry skin and natural hair(hair that is not chemically processed).</li>
            <li>The only con is the fact that it really looks gross and leave a black tar substance in my soap dish.</li>
            <li>and it is a bit strong, but nobody complained about it (and my family isn&#x27;t afraid to voice their opinions) : ) .</li>
            <li>I still buy soap like that in large packages for everyday use.</li>
            <li>After using up the entire bar, I went back to using regular soaps and I really missed my black soap.</li>
            <li>The color can look weird on white porcelain, especially if you let it dry, but damn is it nice.</li>
            <li>Made from pure and natural doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that everything single thing is 100% natural -maybe</li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t take the time to do this everyday, but if I have a big day or event</li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t take the time to do this everyday, but if I have a big day or event</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but I never had any irritation issues that other users have mentioned.</li>
            <li>If left to dry in sink its hard to clean it</li>
            <li>It does not waste so fast like other african black soaps that are out in the market.</li>
            <li>but you have to be careful to rinse it of quickly,  because it could burn and leave your face feeling raw and red.</li>
            <li>Like the employees of the company selling this product that get paid for going online and writing good reviews and rebutting on the bad ones?</li>
            <li>Been trying different expensive soap to help clear up my acne and return my face back to the smooth texture it was before I started breaking out, but none of these soap worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly two months now and it has made my dark spots from acne barely noticeable and are still fading.</li>

            <li> Quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> soap itself has a very pleasant herbal/earthy scent that stays with you throughout the day, but is not overpowering, so it is safe to use with colognes/perfumes and not be a distraction.  </li>
            <li> ON TIMES GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE I REALLY LOVE IT, GOOD PERFOMANCE, EXCELLENT JOB ,</li>
            <li> Cleans off easily, but doesn&#x27;t look the best.  </li>

            <li> I think it did a fair job of that.</li>

            <li> so I rub the soap in my hands and get a really good lather then wash my face with my hands that way</li>
            <li> This soap was good for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> , I wash my face at night with the soap and the tingling feels good, and</li>
            <li> The Dr. recommended cetaphil which is a good cleanser</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this soap is so good</li>
            <li> This soap works and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good.</li>

            <li> I noticed one reviewer mentioned the coconut papaya soap and rose water</li>
            <li> Honestly, before I took it out the box I could smell the aroma coming from it.  </li>
            <li> so, I decided to buy the soap after I read so many good reviews people wrote about it.</li>
            <li> i tried it on my face, and liked the results as well.      </li>
            <li> no matter what kind of soap it is.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s kind of citrusy, but the end result is a hotel soap scent.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t justify the price for it, honestly.</li>
            <li> I get complements all the time on how nice my skin looks.</li>

            <li> Not over drying and quite effective for preventing acne breakout.  </li>
            <li> The smell is quite nice, not earthy as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> When we first started using it we experienced some irritation and dryness</li>
            <li> While your skin will feel clean with Dudu-Osun, you won&#x27;t have the refreshing quality that a good exfoliant produces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Thanks to the great reviews I read about it; I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed that during that time of the month when I would break out on my face, the pimples don&#x27;t stay around for more than 2 days.</li>
            <li> Also, I LOVE the smell of it.</li>
            <li> So you would think the seller would had packaged it better so in case of weather.</li>
            <li> so it just sat in water most of day</li>
            <li> so just more process</li>
            <li> Also, if you buy this soap, make sure you buy face lotion too</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> This soap works better and faster and its CHEAPER which</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure everyone can appreciate.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t got rid of all of my pimples and blackheads, but basically most of them.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those items that some love and some don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that because I love my glow</li>
            <li> so I wanted to make sure that it would continue to work days later before I made my decision if this was a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> My skin has continued to get better and better by day and night.  </li>
            <li> Love it, and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments on my complexion.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> My wife says this soap is better than all the acne face soaps she&#x27;s ever bought.</li>
            <li> and if we run out of this soap I&#x27;m sure to hear about it.</li>
            <li> and they aren&#x27;t as prominent as they used to be.</li>
            <li> What more can you want?  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SOAP....</li>

            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> but this does work better.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll give it more time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> this is affordable and does the job better than anything else that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Use a chamomile wipe after use to add an even better glow!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen many reviews about its lightening properties or it making scars/</li>
            <li> It does have a drying effect so make sure to follow up with lotion or butter.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I came across this product.</li>
            <li> I do love the soap.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>

            <li> plus i love the scent.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s just more noticeable because it&#x27;s brown versus white/ivory.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and it works wonders for your skin!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m spending a lot more time in the shower with it</li>

            <li> To be sure I&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this ok, but I didn&#x27;t like the burn.</li>

            <li> And have already noticed the most drastic improvement in my skin ever.</li>
            <li> Be sure to purchase an organic, unfiltered apple cider vinegar (with &amp;#34;the mother&amp;#34; in it).</li>

            <li> and I can attest to the fact that the soap has many varying benefits.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li> but of course we ourselves notice things about us that bother us more than others.</li>
            <li> I purposely leave it on longer on acne prone areas to make sure the bacteria die a Dudu-inflicted death.</li>
            <li> I would suggest that everyone rub magical dudu on their skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed a very significant difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly an original kind of soap, unlike the brands over here.</li>
            <li> This quality is good and smell good, This is the best type of soap purchased the black, thanks ،</li>
            <li> Great new take on soap!</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more excited about a product!  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing and leaves my skin so clean.</li>
            <li> Nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Great vibrant smell and because of the texture</li>
            <li> Maybe it did help prevent some from appearing, and it did make my face feel clean, and I actually liked the smell.</li>
            <li> Nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean and has a nice citrusy scent.</li>
            <li> This particular soap has help me with hyperpigmentation and discoloration that a lot of people have experienced.</li>
            <li> I love this soap...as I feel really clean!</li>
            <li> Black soap is the best for every skin type, help with acne and softens skins, it does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> Also easy transaction with quick shipping!!  </li>
            <li> Made our skin very soft and it smells really great :-)</li>
            <li> He felt it was soothing to the skin and got him very clean.</li>
            <li> It will get you very clean but dries out your skin use with a exfoliating glove twice a week</li>
            <li> It smells like a cross between dove&amp;ivory, very pleasant.</li>
            <li> However, if you just want to go more natural/organic and have a nice smelling soap that does make your skin feel soft, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this soap is how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I tried it the first night and it cleansed my face as good as a exfoliator without the harshness.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good soap.</li>
            <li> I wish my skin loved it, because that would save me so much money!</li>
            <li> and all feedback was pretty doggone good</li>
            <li> Works pretty good .my</li>
            <li> This would be very good if it does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> When my family bought dudu-osun soap (we called it dudu soap for short when we first heard of it and then the magical dudu after we had experienced the great benefits)</li>
            <li> But after a week or so of using this wonderful product - no dry skin, and any skin irritations or rashes fade away or are reduced significantly.  </li>
            <li> but I used a oil free moisturizer from neutrogena best kind for me due combination/oily skin .</li>
            <li> easily remoes my makeup better then</li>
            <li> This is the best soap you can use if you are having problems with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t dry and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this soap it smells so good and really helps with acne.</li>
            <li> so far I LOVE the smell, the feel and hopefully the GREAT</li>
            <li> I use this with a rag on most days and exfoliation gloves some days, and so far my skin has been feeling great.</li>
            <li> The best way to use it is to wet your face, soap up your hands, wash your face with your soapy hands, let it sit just a minute, rinse and repeat once more.  </li>
            <li> So far my skin loved it and it has a really nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Other than that this soap is very nice and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It smells great, Takes away blemishes and evens out skin tone.not to mention how soft and shiny my hair is!</li>
            <li> this product has greatly helped clear my skin!</li>
            <li> The black soap has a very pleasant scent and once you use it your skin invigorates with a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> Although Dudu-Osun is not a miracle cure, it is a great soap with a nice fragrance (sort of has an incense scent, sort of hard to explain, but it&#x27;s pleasant).</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel squeaky clean without over drying!</li>
            <li> Can feel the clean!</li>
            <li> But being able to wake up without acne is fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt so clean!</li>
            <li> The soap has a unique and appealing scent that I love as well.</li>
            <li> Its a great soaps and does clean very well.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product and I will definitely buy it again, but I knocked one star off for price.</li>
            <li> But this soap smells very fresh and clean and makes my skin nice and silky,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great soap, helped me get cleAr skin.</li>
            <li> Remember this is a product that is made in Africa by the African women, the women in Africa do have some of the most beautiful skin in the world.</li>
            <li> Anyways I love this product and the smell is light and citrus</li>
            <li> Another great thing about this product is that it leaves your skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results thus far.</li>
            <li> Smells great and will clear your complexion over time.</li>

            <li> It is a fantastic feeling to be able to take off my shirt to go swimming or whatever and not be embarrassed.</li>
            <li> It works great to help clear skin.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes my skin feel...clean and smooth with no funky residue.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a great natural moisturizer</li>
            <li> I think that this seems to be a really great natural soap.</li>
            <li> This soap has a great scent to it and also it leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li> This is a good cleansing soap, but it really dries out your skin after cleansing with this soap.  </li>
            <li> I used a whole bar and didn&#x27;t notice any difference except my skin being drier and tighter (not in a good way).</li>
            <li> If you have acne and trying to find a good soap without having to spend so much, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> but she uses everyday and follows with a good moisturizer and after just 3 weeks she looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love this soap sooooo much, it makes your skin so clear and soap, the best about it</li>
            <li> She loved them so much.</li>
            <li> It really smells good when I grabbed it from my mailbox.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it cleans well and smell very fresh.  </li>
            <li> OK... so I always knew black soap was the best but never tried it until I purchased on Amazon.com...</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to strong smells, but this soap is just great).</li>
            <li> Mild and lightly scented, this soap is really nice.</li>
            <li> Which is definitely a good thing because it means it is easy to be gentle with it.</li>
            <li> They arrived as expected, made the box smell REALLY LOVELY!!!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love its unique scent.</li>
            <li> True Diva!</li>
            <li> I would expect that it works excellently on acne on other parts of the body also.  </li>
            <li> Other than that its perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I have dreadlocks so the organic elements of the soap work wonderfully to clean mi locks :)</li>
            <li> and I feel so healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I love the smell and how it leaves my skin clean but still moisturized with out the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> In fact, that alone would have made the purchase worth it.&lt;br /&gt;However, the real truth is that the soap smells and feels great, and leaves my skin feeling and looking healthier.</li>
            <li> It really is the best, all natural soap you can get for your body.  </li>
            <li> I have experienced mild acne for most of my adult life, but since I have been over 50 it has changed in nature.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and how clean it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li> You get 4 bars, it&#x27;s cheap, natural, and lathers really great, it makes things feel &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It lathers up very quickly and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I had very mild acne</li>
            <li> and I covered it easily with makeup.</li>
            <li> but it does clean good and gives you a fresh clean feel.</li>
            <li> Amazon easily refunded my money, though.</li>
            <li> BEST SMELLING NATURAL SOAP THAT IS REASONABLE IN PRICE</li>
            <li> Starting to use the soap, feel great just need more time to juge the effects....</li>
            <li> but if you have oily skin like me and break out easy get this soap and it will stop pimples before the fully form</li>
            <li> , it isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s THAT strong.    </li>
            <li> thing you should keep in mind is that it is really strong.</li>
            <li> So if strong musky scents is not for you then this soap may not be either.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this soap is too strong.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance was so strong I could smell it through the plastic bag.</li>
            <li> The soap has a strong aroma to it</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> It also has a strong smell (like incense almost).</li>
            <li> I like the light, fresh scent and abundant lather.</li>
            <li> I had read that some of the reviewers mentioned the strong smell and in part that is why I didn&#x27;t buy them sooner</li>
            <li> and then, the smell was sooo strong.</li>
            <li> It is strong on the skin...</li>
            <li> I will say not to use a scrubber with this soap as it is fairly strong and could cause irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that strong.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Firstly; Hair, I use it on my hair and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this kind of soap.  </li>
            <li> your face first, Lather it in your hands with the soap and apply it on, rinse your face, and make pats on your face with a warm towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lime juice in it</li>
            <li> I was able to get through three bars before coming to my full opinion on it: it&#x27;s cons out</li>
            <li> Love the stuff, an true answer to ALL my skin issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a true Dove user and I have fallen in love with this soap.</li>
            <li> After the first shower I actually liked the after-smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is pretty nice though</li>
            <li> Once my face recovered from the first wash - about 15 minutes - I liked how my skin looked.  </li>
            <li> Not bad at all, I&#x27;ve never, ever used a soap that smells so refreshing, and cleanse your skin well and not OVER-DRYING.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face acne free and squeaky clean :)</li>
            <li> Love this soap and it smells very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> and then they were fine)</li>
            <li> People, this soap is for everyone, not just black people (do you know how incredibly ignorant that sounds?!</li>
            <li> my son thinks it&#x27;s awesome that it&#x27;s black, and we havent had any staining problems in our shower.</li>
            <li> , I might just keep a bar here and there through the house hidden as air-freshener LOL!</li>
            <li> I checked the expiration date and it was fine.</li>
            <li> This is fine with me, but I know it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
            <li> The fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes have shrunk as well.  </li>
            <li> It washed off fine though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read excellent things about black soap</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with how quickly I received my package</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> In return that customer will stay loyal and buy more product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural, pleasant smelling, soap.  </li>
            <li> It also makes my skin feel super smooth!</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better and it has helped me tremendously with some skin problems that I have.</li>
            <li> While the name is little funny (honestly, my husband laughs every time I call it just du du), it has been wonderful for my skin.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for body soap, as it leaves you extremely squeakily clean, however I was using it as a cleanser as well.</li>
            <li> But it does lather really well, better than I thought it would!</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the 100% pure claim when I read the ingredients and fragrance was listed, but I know it&#x27;s a popular brand</li>
            <li> aroma will be very strong the first week</li>
            <li> After using on my face I always moisturize because its a little drying...but its always good to moisturize after cleansing your face!!</li>
            <li> Strong rich soap...</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing; nice light scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been this enthusiastic about a product before, and I&#x27;m convinced that nothing is better for your skin than natural products.</li>

            <li> To be honest, I bought this soap when I was on an intoxicated Amazing shopping binge (yes, I do that sometimes), simply because it is called &amp;#34;dudu&amp;#34; and it looks like turd in the pictures.</li>

            <li> My face feels smooth and looks radiant after I cleanse with this soap.  </li>
            <li> This soap does stain light colored clothes so I&#x27;d recommend having separate clothes for your face.</li>
            <li> Also, because of Dave Chapelle, when I opened it, I would say, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Dudu, baby!&amp;#34; Anyway, the aroma was light.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling really smooth.</li>
            <li> Then the light bulb in my head went off.</li>

            <li> and my skin is always smooth.</li>
            <li> This is also a great facial soap!!!</li>
            <li> Above all it&#x27;s a great product for those looking for some acne relief.</li>
            <li> I recommend skipping a day as you see fit whenever you feel some dryness.</li>
            <li> Works great if you have acne on back !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even wear foundation most days anymore, my skin is that clear and even (and I&#x27;m not one of those people with naturally perfect skin, as I said above-</li>

            <li> the important part: skin.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good but haven&#x27;t noticed anything that great as far as fading acne scars and improving overall complexion.</li>
            <li> When I did, it was confirmed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m acne free..</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent &amp; healty for the skin.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s important to know.</li>
            <li> Wow auntie whatever is in there smells really good ...</li>
            <li> Good for the skin leaving it soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s suppose to be and  in my younger very oily skin years that would have been wonderful.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good soap for my acne and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Acid also has an anti-bacterial action as well as being good for exfoliation.</li>

            <li> Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> good all natural soap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, it smells good</li>
            <li> The Dudu-Osun is as good as the nubian in slightly different ways; more fragrant, dissolves faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great all-around soap for the whole family.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but it has helped clear my face up fairly well.</li>
            <li> so make sure you follow up with a light moisturizer right after.</li>
            <li> so your face won&#x27;t sting or burn and don&#x27;t wash with super hot water settle for warm</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for something more impressive based on the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> And this soap has the best lather I have seen with any product of this type (natural)it leaves my skin clear, moisturized and blemish free which I get even as an adult from time to time, it leaves my skin feeling clean</li>
            <li> I tried it on my face and it has helped my acne so much!!!</li>
            <li> and I very rarely get breakouts or pimples anymore.</li>

            <li> This black soap produces the most luxurious lather I have ever experienced with any soap.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, makes a great gift, leaves skin feeling soft and lathers up very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the results.</li>
            <li> I was so excited by just the smell of this soap</li>
            <li> everything went smoothly, so smooth that my soap came a day early, which was so perfect since I had a sliver of a piece left</li>
            <li> Definitely buying it again, I just love it! :)</li>
            <li> and I was excited to try it out since I read all of the benefits online about how get it was for your skin.</li>
            <li> At any rate, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> I have also started using this soap in the shower and have noticed a significant difference in the appearance of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> That stuff caused an allergic reaction and my skin to turn horridly red and thicken for days...not nice!  </li>
            <li> When I recieved the product I was so excited to see what type of results I would get.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my skin looks fresh and the tone looks even and creamy!  </li>
            <li> and I do see a significant improvement in that area.</li>
            <li> The only flaw is it really dries your skin so be sure to have a great moisturizer on hand.  </li>
            <li> It took about 1 month for me to see significant changes in my skin</li>

            <li> Well, let me tell you, I was given this soap by a friend who normally uses it on his own skin, he told me it works, so I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> my face had significantly cleared up.</li>
            <li> I did use it and didn&#x27;t notice significant benefits</li>
            <li> Rinse it off quickly and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I originally found it on a travel blog and decided to try a bar for myself.</li>
            <li> and I am extremely excited to use this soap again.</li>
            <li> Amazingly rich lather.  </li>
            <li> This does depend on skin types, what works for me might not work for you but its def worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have to say at first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell</li>
            <li> Also my skin dryed out at first but seems to have got better with time</li>
            <li> first shower did give some tingles during rinsing but by day two I was ok.</li>
            <li> Five bucks for a year&#x27;s worth of cleanser!</li>
            <li> It can be a tad drying at first, but stick with it and be sure to moisturize (which you should do anyway, even with oily skin).  </li>
            <li> From antibiotics, to face washes to cleansers and nothing has worked significantly well for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> When I finished the first order I had to get some more.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Unlike Shea Moisture, this product is more affordable, four bars compared to one, available through Amazon, and does not stain the shower or certain wash clothes.  </li>
            <li> It does make very fine form and cleans very well..</li>
            <li> U feel so clean and fresh after using!</li>

            <li> i decided to give this soap a whirl after so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Waiting for more positive changes as I just started.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t quite see why the overwhelming positive reviews on it.</li>
            <li> I am a victim (lol) of acne as well as bacne.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts from many of the popular over the counter skin products</li>
            <li> My skin that is sensitive to most soaps - not this one!</li>
            <li> the soap has a very nice different distinct fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very fragrant, leaves your skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> i use pure shea butter after for a moisturizer my skin has never felt better...</li>
            <li> But I felt like buying something special for my wife and decided to give this</li>
            <li> I will certainly order more.</li>
            <li> Be sure to buy pure Niacin (NOT no-flush, flush-free, or time-released varieties).</li>
            <li> figured when I ordered the soap that it would be nothing special.  </li>
            <li> It it almost as if the lather gives special attention to areas of the skin that need it.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this soap.</li>
            <li> Fantastic soap - my skin felt tighter after first use!</li>

            <li> and it helps your skin still nice, soft and clean.</li>
            <li> So far so good; I have tried most acne treatments out there (Clean and Clear), but this seems to be working out of all that I have done to contain my acne problem.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, lathers great and seems to last longer than the other brands I ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It feels so soft and amazing on my skin</li>
            <li> I am not sure that it is the magical wonder product that some think it is, but my skin feels just great after using this.</li>
            <li> and it is even great in a closed closet..</li>
            <li> Thick lather, awesome smell, cleans well.  </li>
            <li> Bar dries quickly after shower or bath, shape holds up, rinses clean.  </li>
            <li> I hope that this is true since I brought four of them...</li>
            <li> But the soap smells nice and lathers well, considering it&#x27;s natural and has no sulfates.</li>
            <li> Anyway, three stars for a nice natural soap...no miracles here, though.</li>
            <li> I read about this product looking for more help for her and since the price of this soap was extremely reasonable, I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin smooth and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail around Christmas time and joked that it looked like a BIG lump of coal that he had given everyone as a gift, but it smelled really good</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that it burns your face, so I was cautious using it on my face, the only time it burned is when I used a washcloth on my face, if i get a good lather and apply it to my face that way I have no problems.</li>
            <li> This soap looks handmade, it&#x27;s not mass produced and full of junk</li>
            <li> I laughed at the reviewers that suggested this product is somehow for African people.  </li>
            <li> I even got my boyfriend to wash his face with this last night and he loved it also.</li>
            <li> Also, I feel super clean and refreshed after using Dudu-osun.</li>
            <li> Liked the smell of this soap, and it made my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I have to buy more since it is going quite fast.</li>
            <li> So just about 15-20seconds of lathering seems like the sweet spot for</li>
            <li> I am still working on the red scars, but its fabulous to have nice smooth skin again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product just to even out my skin some more</li>
            <li> love this soap so much.</li>
            <li> but overall a good product.  </li>
            <li> I ended up giving this soap away to a male who absolutely loved it and everythign about it.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice soap it helped clear my blemishes,  but for my postular psoriasis did not help, it drys  the skin a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% natural and is the closest oil to our own sebum that our skin produces.</li>
            <li> This is a seriously cool product and will be a staple in our home from now on.</li>
            <li> This Dudu makes my hands soft, and has a nice odor.</li>
            <li> Maybe if the magical dudu can absorb all the kaka-girly nasties that have been imbedded in his skin, then they will stop forcing him to do makeup commercials and sing soprano (unless he wants to, of course, then who am I to say he can&#x27;t)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about two weeks now, and there is sometimes a fluttery burn sensation that goes away once I splash cool water on my face to rinse it off.</li>
            <li> Good to order several bars at one time.</li>
            <li> even orders more for my whole family and friends</li>
            <li> This also a good facial cleaner</li>
            <li> Its gentle on my skin, and love the smell.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure if it was too much of a discomfort, I could use less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I made sure to really inspect my skin</li>
            <li> you have good skin and like fragrance in your soap (that you want to last), then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Its not a bad smell</li>
            <li> I have no problem whatsoever with the smell, because it&#x27;s not a bad smell to me...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, just not a natural-type smell.&lt;br /&gt;Soap</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
            <li> Great for dry, itchy skin!!</li>
            <li> Smells good and really makes your hair have a lot of volume if you use it on your scalp, but it does give it a new texture too.</li>
            <li> This soap does an amazing job of leaving you clean and refreshed, but not dried out(if used right).</li>
            <li> great product already starting to fade scars in combination with the 100% PURE SHEA BUTTER</li>
            <li> Certainly cleans and keeps my skin looking smooth and acne free.</li>
            <li> I have experienced no side effects, redness or other irritation that others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> GREAT BUY, JUST AS I EXPECTED!</li>
            <li> Its smells great and washes well like any other soap</li>
            <li> soap is cheap (2 dollars more than my old soap), smells great, and replaces other products I use.  </li>
            <li> This soap has a clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li> but if I have just shaved my legs then I lather the soap in a wash cloth and then use the wash cloth to clean so that I won&#x27;t cause irritation to my freshly shaven legs.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li> it smells so good,feels clean and fresh after using it..</li>
            <li> I smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh skin.</li>
            <li> after shower,feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Fresh citrusy clean smell.</li>
            <li> Well, i have been trying ever since and my skin is clearer and improving tremendously from the state my skin was in.</li>
            <li> Smells super, mildly exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> They went away quickly, however, and my skin is now firmer and clearer than before --</li>
            <li> Because of this, it does have a mild drying affect.</li>
            <li> Helped my acne problems tremendously.</li>
            <li> My older brother got my sister, mom and I this soap as part of our Christmas gift this year, telling us that he turned his girlfriend onto it and that I&#x27;d love it.  </li>
            <li> then that wore off quickly, and I am still waiting and using this.</li>
            <li> Finally this year after reading many reviews on this product I realized I needed more than just this soap.</li>
            <li> After many many years of searching I finally found what fits my skin.</li>
            <li> It quickly clears up problem areas on my face.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and on time.  </li>
            <li> rub one hand lightly on the bar and work up a light lather on my face and rinse, I might repeat if my skin was very oily or I&#x27;m removing makeup or sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for myself, I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who isn&#x27;t super picky about their soaps (ya, know, gluten-free organic, free-range, blessed by a priest, made-only-by-monks-in-tibet-fed-a-vegan-diet soap).</li>
            <li> and when they arrived I quickly opened one</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s super prone to acne.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and mildly scented.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I don&#x27;t have any skin issues that needs to be treated</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for mild cases of eczema.  </li>
            <li> but my skin got used of it quickly.</li>
            <li> But only thing is make sure you use a moisturizer afterwards :)</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft, smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> Now I will be sure to bring more back with me in the spring</li>
            <li> Dissolves quickly in the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for my mild psoriasis and now I don&#x27;t want another.</li>
            <li> I introduced it to my family and they&#x27;ve become quick fans too.</li>
            <li> If you leave it out and let the water run over it the soap will disintegrate quickly.</li>
            <li> Mild on the skin and cleans well.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, 2 days after purchase.</li>
            <li> The bar does not dissolve away quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells great, lathers well, all natural, but the downside of all natural is it doesn&#x27;t kill the bacteria.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it more time for the positive results, but I have used it for more 3 weeks so far</li>
            <li> The lather is abundant and the fragrance is like no other....</li>
            <li> i highly recommend for anyone suffering from acne or acne scars to give this soap a shot :)</li>
            <li> first off I give the soap 5 stars because it smells good, secondly I give the soap 5 stars because it does make me feel clean but having said that the soap does tend to cause me to caugh</li>
            <li> leaves a super clean feeling and makes the entire house smell amazing.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am VERY pleased with this bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with skin issue most of my adult life and so many of them have improved thanks to this soap.</li>
            <li> I was putting on more moisturizer than normal just to help with the dryness.</li>
            <li> it way more than the normal bars</li>
            <li> It lathers ok, but not as well as the other and the lather isn&#x27;t as nice.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have no idea if one is authentic and the other is not.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and definitely purchasing this soap again.</li>
            <li> Smells good and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> in all, its a good soap if you want to feel clean, but as per other reviews I did expect something special.</li>
            <li> The scent is super strong and it really irritated my skin</li>
            <li> I could smell it out of the box, and it filled the bathroom with a subtle beautiful clean aroma.</li>
            <li> Our new favorite soap.  </li>
            <li> I love amazon reviews and look for them whenever I am opting to try a new product.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone, oily skin and wanted to see if something new would work better than what I was using.</li>
            <li> and so I told them to get this black soap, and they all have and was happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soap smells great, not like typical soap</li>
            <li> Even though it washes off it leaves a slight brown tint on the skin - great for those who want a sunless tan look.  </li>
            <li> I had read many reviews stating this soap should be kept away from water because it can dissolve pretty fast.</li>
            <li> i tried it out it smells great and left my skin soft and squeaky clean</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell -- it smells &#x27;natural&#x27;, clean, and light.</li>
            <li> Really good soap, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good soap to use for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smoother, evens out my complexion of dark spots which have faded considerably since I began using it in March, clears up acne and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> this is a very good soap now for those of you scared about the burning sensation that everyone else is worried about experiencing for the first time use, I just used it and did not experience such a thing probably because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very good soap for sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I do have light eczema, but I did not see positive results from using this soap.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment!!</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase, but I will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> soap worked wonders for me on the FIRST DAY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am satisfied that it does a pretty good job of protecting my face from the ravages of harsh weather.</li>
            <li> The product would be great except it is like washing it bleeds color and will make a mess in the bathtub, soap dish, etc.</li>
            <li> I love this product and its all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> It gets every last ounce of makeup off; even the most stubborn mascara wipes away easily with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not dry up the skin, smell good and reasonable priced</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night, but I would make sure you use a moisturizer because it tends to dry my skin out a bit, though it seems to be adjusting the more</li>
            <li> Washing was great its really soapy and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out</li>
            <li> Good soap, but nothing special compared to other</li>
            <li> On a positive note, this is extremely good at clearing blackheads -- amazingly so, actually!</li>
            <li> I guess ya gotta love soap to take the time to critique it; but this soap is unusual and lives up to the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Water could have all kinds of contaminants, so when I&#x27;m looking for a pure product the type of water is important to me.</li>
            <li> Just get a little of this stuff and it lathers up great.</li>
            <li> My sister has a little girl (just turned 1) who has skin problems and she now uses this on her and has seen great results.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy this soap after reading all the positive reviews</li>
            <li> AMAZING totally transformed my skin</li>
            <li> It has a light smell and lathers really well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and works fast...</li>
            <li> I just ordered more of this soap because I also use a bar for my 4 year old that has eczema.</li>
            <li> a bit zesty but fresh smell alone sold me.</li>
            <li> even though the soap is in its own boxes and was in a bag inside of the big box!</li>
            <li> I believe it to be just as useful as the others</li>
            <li> I was pleased to discover that this soap contains natural ingredients</li>
            <li> After a while I noticed that her face was fresher and more clear and I asked her what she was doing.</li>
            <li> Tips:  -don&#x27;t apply to freshly shaved legs  -be</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many soaps claiming to be sensitive to the skin.</li>
            <li> I am sure this also comes from the natural ingredients as well&lt;</li>
            <li> So far, though it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much soap to create a good lather and one bar lasts longer than regular soap.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Here is my own analysis, based on chemistry and personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> There dont seem to be many checks and balances as far as anything goes in that country.</li>
            <li> Reading all the reviews on this soap make me laugh...</li>
            <li> After one use of this soap, I must say, it left me with an unfamiliar feeling compared to the popular soaps.  </li>
            <li> After making fun of it&#x27;s name and appearance all evening, my wife also noticed a differece in my skin.  </li>
            <li> : twice the work, but absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> RESULTS: twice the work, but absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> So far I love the combination of this soap with shea butter as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap now for 2 months , my skin is clear and lovely.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t even worth returning</li>
            <li> and I am still as enthusiastic about the product as I was when I wrote the initial review.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> You will have better results applying the soap directly to your skin.</li>
            <li> Love the results so far.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural and soap-free.</li>
            <li> Even tho i rarely get pimples now, its the scaring that will not fade.  </li>
            <li> I received the soap in a timely fashion and the soap is fresh.</li>
            <li> So far I really love this soap.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell, tried it, it just wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the investment and don&#x27;t forget to moisturize because your skin needs the moisture even if toy are oily like me.</li>
            <li> The smell stays on my skin throughout the day and leaves me smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li> So, for face, any kind of regular non-fragrant moisturizer does the job.</li>
            <li> In my country(India), they sell a famous soap, Lifebuoy, a very basic and cheap, red-colored brick-like soap (it didn&#x27;t lather well).</li>
            <li> I love this soap because of its&#x27; ingredients and so far I have not died from it.</li>
            <li> it smells so fresh.</li>
            <li> It is a nice facial and body soap</li>
            <li> There are no artificial ingredients or preservatives to be found apart from \\&quot;fragrance,\\&quot; which I admit could be anything but</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The soap has a nice smell, but the only downfall is that it leaves a puddle of brown suds and residue on the soap dish.  </li>
            <li> this soap better than old school soap</li>
            <li> Definitely use a nice moisturizer afterward like shea butter because it cleans off everything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Anything more frequent may harm your skin or compromise its disposition.  </li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in doubt, try it, stick with it, and marvel in the glory that is clear skin :)</li>
            <li> (i.e. &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;) I&#x27;m all about FULL disclosure on product ingredients</li>
            <li> It has a powerful perfume-y smell to it.</li>
            <li> and I want to find something that is more natural for long-term usage.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen all of the benefits that everyone claims yet, but i love the smell and the natural ingredient list.</li>
            <li> I was using a different kind</li>
            <li> Now my dog&#x27;s breath smells like plantains and will never be in danger of getting rare dog mouth acne.</li>
            <li> I love that it is a natural soap.</li>
            <li> I tried this soap due to the same reason I think most customers out here on Amazon do - the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than many soaps, you initially get a significant loss of</li>
            <li> but I would recommend just using it once when you are in shower because it is very potent and can dry off your skin.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today and it made my eczema patches super dry,but it did not itch.</li>
            <li> he thought it was a mild sunburn at first..</li>
            <li> When you use it you feel very clean and your face is soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m AA with 3c/4a thick hair and this feels so good!  </li>
            <li> All the other ingredients are good, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very gentle soap, and I love the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> My face started burning right away</li>
            <li> after I statred using this soap, cleared it right up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Clears up my acne right away.</li>
            <li> With a name like &amp;#34;dudu&amp;#34; what should I expect right?  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of breakouts on my face right now, and I&#x27;m hoping that this soon will help with those soon</li>
            <li> I sometimes use the Bar soap (Coconut &amp; Papaya) right after for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I almost returned it right there</li>
            <li> During my quest for the right \\&quot;products\\</li>
            <li> I love to try new soaps and been in love with Aleppo soap which I use regularly on body and hair.  </li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun creates a highly alkaline environment which has a more highly disinfectant action than most soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes you feel clean in the shower.  </li>
            <li> But the best part about this soap not speaking for all skin types, but for my extra dry skin it really helps softens and lighten the Skin up.</li>
            <li> OK I posted a old review about this in the first week of me using it</li>
            <li> love RAW black soap, but Dudu Osun is currently my &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; :) I love this stuff, works good!</li>
            <li> imparting sweet pure fragrance..</li>
            <li> But the major problem is the fact that many people are using a cloth towel/ shower puff to apply the product.</li>
            <li> But the major problem is the fact that many people are using a cloth towel/ shower puff to apply the product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad to have found a quality and authentic black soap that is delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li> By the way the bar is VERY large.</li>
            <li> I suffer from postherpetic neuralgia, and this Dudu-Osun African Black soap is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Not all black soap formulas are the same, Dudu Osun is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many things in my 29 yrs for mild acne,proactive was my last thing i researched this soap and never ever heard about it before after reading the reviews i decided why not give it a try.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasant, and it creates a thick lather.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it&#x27;s such a lovely mild soap for one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural and looks hand-made as opposed to so many commercial products.  </li>
            <li> The soap gets out all the dirt and opens up your pores soothe the skin with some shea butter and say hallo to the gorgeous skin coming out.&lt;br /&gt;The buffer or loafer to use should not be of a light color white, peach or cream won&#x27;t look the same...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to know how good it is!</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a pretty good soap.</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian woman aged 66 with very light, freckled skin and light hair and eyes.  </li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t used this long enough but we love what we have experienced so far.  </li>
            <li> After about two weeks of use, A rather large scar on my breast from surgery,has almost disappeared!It&#x27;s a blessing for me!</li>
            <li> Psoriasis, eczema and minor irritations of our skin has tremendously improved over the last three months that my family have used this soap, but it is very important to use good quality natural lotion to keep your skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Helped my skin and didn&#x27;t leave it dry, feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I tried the soap last night and so far so good.</li>
            <li> if I made a good choice my skin would have a burning sensation and would slightly peel</li>
            <li> the bubbles are white and when it rinses it looks like i was really diry lmao.</li>
            <li> The black soap was really good.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the can soap better, but the bars last forever and they smell so fresh</li>
            <li> and I wanted a soap that was effective and didn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> This soap stains my bathroom shower with black residue, Although it smells good, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> It not only made my acne go away, but it tightened, firmed and gave my skin an overall great complexion.</li>
            <li> This is a strong soap that not only strips you clean but replenishes as well.</li>
            <li> Good for a harsher black soap.</li>
            <li> But, with just a few days of use, I have reordered 8 more bars on top of the 4 I just received since I intend to use it exclusively if it in fact works as well all over.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast...</li>
            <li> for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant and isn&#x27;t harsh for the nose at all.</li>
            <li> LOL, but other than that it is safe to use other places just not there.</li>
            <li> For all you other acne-sufferers out there, this soap is a very worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about this stuff, but it&#x27;s cool looking, smells good and does everything a regular bar of soap does, except leaves a trail of brown suds instead of white.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I have finally found the right soap for me.</li>
            <li> got here quick great soap, makes my skin soft, has little ruff pieces in it that help exfoliate.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit odd at the beginning, but after the first use it smells good.</li>
            <li> and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as it helps me very much.</li>
            <li> And the price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> thank you very, very much.</li>
            <li> The soaps came in  very fast.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT recommend it for use near your &amp;#34;sensitive areas&amp;#34;, because it tends to sting and burn, everywhere else on the skin is fine, though.</li>
            <li> Like I said in my original review, my primary problem was severe acne on my back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Like I said in my original review, my primary problem was severe acne on my back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps, and I would recommend this for a more natural healthy way of cleaning hair, and for those who have dry skin.    </li>
            <li> These soaps smell nice and organic, but honestly they leave my skin dry and bitter after I use them in the shower.</li>
            <li> I use it like every other day because it really drys out the skin for me good because skin is so oily</li>
            <li> so far I feel fresh and clean after I shower.</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS SO FRESH AND CLEAN AND MAKES MY SKIN SO SOFT</li>
            <li> You feel so clean and your skin feels so smooth after using it, that I will definitely make this my day to day</li>
            <li> I really like how gentle it is on my skin, and how clean my face feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is SO potent i would not recommend using it daily, because it &amp;#34;MAY&amp;#34; strip you of needed moisture.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on the first bar</li>
            <li> but I guess my expectation was higher based on the reviews and recommendations from people</li>
            <li> I also made that mistake during the first couple of months of my use.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> everything works at first, but soon becomes ineffective.    </li>
            <li> What I like most about this soap is that I can use it on my entire ody w/out irritation....</li>
            <li> The first time I used ot</li>
            <li> I even gave it as gifts, to only my favorite friends.  </li>
            <li> Most use marketing language and obscure ingredients to back those claims which in turn, prove to be misleading and prolonging your conditions.</li>
            <li> I was in love after only a week of using it and am hooked on it like it is crack.  </li>
            <li> It is very drying!   </li>
            <li> It looks like a turd at first, or a chocolate bar</li>
            <li> I ordered another dozen bars before I finished the first one.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s an exact list of the ingredients on the box:    </li>
            <li> the last 7yrs I&#x27;ve been using Baby Magic Hand &amp; Body Wash for My face</li>
            <li> Got my soap today and used it for the first time this evening.</li>
            <li> After reading the stellar reviews, I decided to give this soap a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first noticed the sores on my legs, I stopped using soap for 7 - 10 days.  </li>
            <li> I began using the soap again and sure enough more sores began on my legs and also one on the outline of my upper lip also began.  </li>
            <li> I tried many different cleansers, lotions, and potions to no avail.</li>
            <li> Not enough words to tell how I&#x27;m in love with this soap.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what I AM REALLY looking for!...</li>
            <li> I first kept it in the shower</li>
            <li> I have already replaced my first order.</li>
            <li> decided to try it as a body soap and my boyfriend started commenting on my skin&#x27;s smoothness and glow after the first week.</li>
            <li> I bought my first 4 bars with tad suspicion.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of Dudu-sun and I&#x27;ll order more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from moderate acne for over 10 years &amp; this soap is just OK.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem that much better than regular soap to me.</li>
            <li> It makes my whole bathroom smell fresh.  </li>
            <li> It was daring me 9the soap) to try it haha!</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and clear, and I believe it is because of using Dudu Osun, because of the ingredients is has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i did research first then ordered this brand</li>
            <li> At first my face burned from it</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more once I run out.</li>
            <li> would advise to be aware that it can leave stains if you don&#x27;t wash out the tub/shower immediately.</li>
            <li> I first tried it whan</li>
            <li> first ask the specialist to place some product in your skin</li>
            <li> The shippings really fast!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I&#x27;ve been able to look in the mirror and not see any blemishes.</li>
            <li> So I knew exactly why I was breaking out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I&#x27;ve been able to look in the mirror and not see any blemishes.</li>
            <li> So I knew exactly why I was breaking out.</li>
            <li> -- I plan on updating weekly on this to tell you how my skin and face are doing with this product, but using it for the first time today, I wanted to write a review.</li>
            <li> Order got here in great time for ordering late Friday, it got here on Monday.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect at first.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I was given this soap by a friend years ago and never used it consistently.</li>
            <li> I first used it, I rubbed the bar between my hands for a couple seconds then started to wash my face.  </li>
            <li> This soap is really something else!</li>
            <li> And  I would even put up with all of the above if the soap would make my skin feel better , but it don&#x27;t .</li>
            <li> It IS different; stronger than most</li>
            <li> Nature &amp; Herbs is a fantastic 5 STAR business, and I urge everyone to support them and check their complete online storefront.   ~DM</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t get discouraged the first time u use it and think your one of the unlucky ones who can&#x27;t use this soap.</li>
            <li> I first kept the bar of soap on a rack in my shower caddy hanging from my shower head.  </li>
            <li> First, This is my first review on a product I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only writing this because I am in LOVE with this soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, be aware that this soap WILL BURN YOUR SKIN (depending on your skin sensitivity that is).</li>
            <li> All skin is different though and some days will burn more than others</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really starting to believe in the magical dudu.  </li>
            <li> If you exfoliate with this and use hot water it may burn your skin.</li>
            <li> i  can  safely say the same  as for myself when i  first used it  while on  deployment  in  Afghanistan.</li>
            <li> I first came across this soap at an herbiary in Philadelphia selling for $5 each bar.</li>
            <li> so much what a deal!</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re gonna try it just buy one bar at first.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I am soon finished with my fourth bar and need to buy more.</li>
            <li> I have never felt so pretty til I stated using this soap.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well, and its the first time I am using this product.</li>
            <li> Kinda burns when u first use it</li>
            <li> It was working for the first couple weeks</li>
            <li> The ingredients state \\&quot;fragrance,\\&quot; but doesn&#x27;t state what exactly is used for fragrance.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail sooooo fast!</li>
            <li> Ok stuff doesn&#x27;t necessarily prevents breakout but somehow it faded my acne scar.</li>
            <li> I was having real acne problems!).</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I would lather up my face and let it sit for about a minute before scrubbing it off with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> It burned the first time I used it but after that my skin adjusted.</li>
            <li> I use this on my toddler and it&#x27;s surprisingly gentle, despite its powerful healing effects.</li>
            <li> I have finally been able to cure my toe fungus.</li>
            <li> It smelled funny.</li>
            <li> Better than the morning burst I used to use on my face prior to receiving this.</li>
            <li> now, a month later, I can without a doubt tell you that I have found my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and at first I was like what the heck was my husband thinking......</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you put Apple cider vinegar on your face with cotton ball after washing it!!</li>
            <li> It looks like a turd at first, or a chocolate bar</li>
            <li> But I do like the smell of the soap still ;)</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to my family and friends and I will definitely will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love it as a body soap especially moisturizing with coco butter after, sticking to the Ghanaian version for my face though.</li>
            <li> first, I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me - just seeing what I wanted to see.  </li>
            <li> I have skin problems and have used a bunch of different products and this is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> but this was my first time using Dudu-Osun.</li>
            <li> I also made that mistake during the first couple of months of my use.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Not terrible acne, but enough to be embarrassed about when it happens.</li>
            <li> Ok so first the packaging was to my liking the boxes we stacked evenly inside a plastic vacuum sealed bag.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this soap because it was a good deal to be honest, I mean four bars of soap for ten dollars is a bargain</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this soap for teens (my son uses it) and adults who have mild to medium acne issues.</li>
            <li> , my black heads on my nose are almost gone, I have not had a huge pimple on my face this month and my acne scars seem to be alittle better but not gone.</li>
            <li> and when I say sliver I mean sliver (lol).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wish I can find the right treatment as I&#x27;m really lost..</li>
            <li> I was very glad to see this soap being sold on amazon in multi-packs for much less than $5 each bar.</li>
            <li> What did I care, as long as I got clean and the soap was cheap.</li>
            <li> Other than that this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> well so far i have not used it much and am about done with the first bar, but it seems to leave the skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> They are a nice change from the synthetic fragrances you get from a lot of other soaps.</li>
            <li> good price, fast shipping, however, the item itself is a little overrated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every brand imaginable: Clinique, Clean and Clear, Proactiv, Neutrogena, Zapzyt, etc.</li>
            <li> I am very happy so far with the Dudu-osun African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> Lathers great and can last a while if you&#x27;re careful.</li>
            <li> My skin feels sooo soft after using that...yet clean when rinsing off, without the skin irritation...</li>
            <li> and I kept washing my hands over and over as my hands were so clean and soft</li>
            <li> i felt so clean yet so refreshed and so soft.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural soap that lathers well and hear African Black soap was the best choice.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling soft and clean and does not leave a slippery film in the shower.  </li>
            <li> This soap is natural and it leaves your skin feeling so clean and</li>
            <li> It makes the skin soft and you just feel so clean after a shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has faded my own acne scars, some that were over 10 years old and not only that, but I sometimes get cystic acne along my jaw but not with this soap.  </li>
            <li> If I do buy it again it will be because it is a natural soap and has such a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I wanted simple, natural, effective and affordable</li>
            <li> In a few more weeks I was completely free of acne and have been ever since.</li>
            <li> It is pretty pure</li>
            <li> It also has many other uses such as wards off bugs (hopefully not your mate), is very good for Psoriasis and other skin diseases.  </li>
            <li> I opened up a new bar and tried again this time I was a little more gentle and used the soap more sparingly when my face started to burn</li>
            <li> I been using the black soap I love it!</li>
            <li> soon as I used it, I felt it &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; on my skin and my skin felt smoother and overall just really clean!</li>
            <li> There is no excessively dry, tight feeling after using, but just nice and clean!</li>
            <li> but it was to a point where my skin would be beautiful one week and then black heads and acne the next.</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t had a positive effect on psoriasis.</li>
            <li> positive review.</li>
            <li> The scent (flowers) of the soap itself is a little strong for my taste, but it doesn&#x27;t leave you with a strong body scent.  </li>
            <li> after using the soap for about 2 weeks, (which is great because other soaps caused rashes within a day or two), we noticed red welts on his abdomen and legs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years, mostly the expensive stuff and nothing compares to this cheap soap.  </li>
            <li> have been using this for last 2 months, no soup could ever clean my face as good as black soup.&lt;br /&gt;combination of witch hazel and tea tree oil plus washing my face twice a day with this soup did wonder for my skin.</li>
            <li> as well :) It does have a drying effect at times though (the stretched face feeling?).</li>
            <li> Ok I read all the other reviews before we bought and decided it was worth a one time try.</li>
            <li> The first few times of using this soap, I fell in love!</li>
            <li> I have fallen completely in love with it and recommend it to all of my friends, and probably will never buy another type of soap as long as this continues to be made.</li>
            <li> As long as I maintain a healthy diet and use the soap I have not had problems with my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a guy who hates oily feeling on my skin and pretty much every bodywash I used</li>
            <li> The first thing that I notice is  that I don&#x27;t really have to scrub with this soap anymore.</li>
            <li> and it goes fast if water runs on it consistently.</li>
            <li> Yes, my skin is evening out and my pores are becoming smaller which makes my skin look</li>
            <li> But the price is not bad to find out if your are sensitive to the smell or not, because the SOAP WORKS on getting rid of acne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what, but this soap does something good to your skin.</li>
            <li> What it does do though is leave your skin feeling soft - that is true.  </li>
            <li> Nice stuff, but leaves dark messes in your soap dish.</li>
            <li> i am sold on it highly advise anyone to start by ordering and using  right away..</li>
            <li> I will use it a few more times because it made me feel really clean and it lathers well</li>
            <li> SKIN REALLY FEELS SOFT AND CLEAN  </li>
            <li> At first, it was a good soap that got me really clean,I liked the smell, and I could even overlook the fact that half of one of the bars turned into a small pool of mud</li>
            <li> , i am going to use it for the rest of my body which seems to be doing ok and stop using it on my face and see if the pimples will dissipate, that will mean i have to buy another facial wash and see if it will do a good job of clearing the pimples....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted, I may be in the minority of sensitive skin consumers but you need to have more concrete data and complete transparency of ingredients supporting your claims.</li>
            <li> I said earlier though, using African black soap alone is probably not going to clear your skin, so my best advice is to start using more natural products or homeopathic remedies.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using her first soap (from this package) and so far according to her, the skin is softer and feels more clean in comparison with other products.</li>
            <li> The acne scars have all but disappeared and it is extremely rare that I even have a new breakout.</li>
            <li> You definitely have to follow up with a moisturizer and lotion after but with the right products, this is all you need to keep your skin clean.</li>
            <li> Took the 2 that soap packaging was more affected by and laid it on a plate to air dry used 1 of them to immediately wash my makeup off</li>
            <li> a very decent so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nubian Heritage black soap and really liked it.</li>
            <li> At first, I just used the soap on my problem areas then decided to start using it the shower for allover washing (do not use light or white washcloths with this soap, not even Clorox will get the brown tint out).  </li>
            <li> We also use the black soap shower gel which is nice too</li>
            <li> and he commented on my hair that it felt super soft</li>
            <li> and he commented on my hair that it felt super soft today.    </li>
            <li> Make sure after you shower that you place the soap on a dry paper towel.</li>
            <li> I really really love this product, however, I think it made my skin too dry or may have put something on my face that didnt do well with my skin type.</li>
            <li> I no longer have black heads and my skin has smoothed out nicely.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried many and nothing helped, or it would just dry him up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super self conscious about what I put on my face.</li>
            <li> However when I opened one of the packages I had this strong sniff of fragrance that is definitely not in the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; arena.</li>
            <li> These large bars last a long time so this is definitely a good purchase.   </li>
            <li> This is a large sized bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have oily acne pron a skin with large  pores .I</li>
            <li> {I tend to break out in a rash from certain chemicals in skin products}</li>
            <li> SOMETIMES CYSTIC LARGE</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this soap to anyone.</li>
            <li> And there is a certain spot that is &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; no matter how hoard I try to get it</li>
            <li> This soap is pure and you just feel your skin breathing after using it.</li>
            <li> I really love this productthe really makes your skin feel real goodI&#x27;ve tried other black African soapthis is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> However, it has definitely kept the unaffected part of my skin healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun makes a lather that feels rich and creamy but rinses off better than most national brand soaps, leaving behind just enough moisture to keep your skin fresh.    </li>
            <li> I wet my face and neck area with hot water to open my pores, work up a good lather</li>
            <li> Any blemishes or acne will scab up and healthily bring back new skin.</li>
            <li> I had heard about African Black Soap, and decided to give it a try; I am so happy I did.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use Carol&#x27;s Daughter \\&quot;Bring back the moisture\\&quot; liquid soap which is also great and works well with the black soap.  </li>
            <li> Great African Black soap in a bar.</li>
            <li> The Dudu-Osun African Black soap has worked great for keeping my acne at bay.  </li>
            <li> African black soap is great.</li>
            <li> I like it and my entire house smells super fresh</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural soap and always loved black soap.</li>
            <li> Smells good, makes my skin soft, but not like the typical soap that you buy in stores.  </li>
            <li> The soap smells fantastic and feels great, and I love using it, but my acne got no better or worse after three weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this African Black Soap product several times and have had excellent results.</li>
            <li> but one of my boxes was open on arrival (not the outer packaging), the soap was fine but...</li>
            <li> My face is amazingly soft and clean without any dryness plus the whole entire bathroom smells so fresh after every shower!</li>
            <li> I love how my skin looked the 2nd day and now it has been 5 days and see a brighter, clear  face and my pores minimized!  </li>
            <li> all the time now, I even give one to my son-in-law and he is now a lover of the african black soap really works great on our face.</li>
            <li> The water drains brown for a second but rinses off just fine.</li>
            <li> It causes a slight \\&quot;chemical peel\\&quot; action, so intense scrubbing isn&#x27;t a good idea, nor is leaving it on for an extended time.  </li>
            <li> The smell is neutral to nice, the bar size is fairly large, and it leaves you feeling squeaky clean but not dry or drawn tight.</li>
            <li> Right now this is my favorite brand of black soap.</li>
            <li> After I rinse it off, my skin feels soft and tight and most importantly:</li>
            <li> A little more cleaning in the shower but its well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have oily, sensitive skin and this helped to combat the oiliness, but it did it a little too good.</li>
            <li> will definitely keep you guys updated on how my skin does with this black soap, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> will definitely keep you guys updated on how my skin does with this black soap, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> This is good for cleansing your scalp and won&#x27;t make your hair smooth unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in the mail today, and let me tell you, from the second I opened the box up, I could smell how AMAZING the soap smelled before I even actually opened a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I didnt really care for this soap, it makes my family very itchy and REALLY dries out our skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy it though, the same way I don&#x27;t buy it when Asians talk about how amazing Asian products are.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin fresh and not at all dry and it feels clean.</li>
            <li> I used this soap a few years ago with wonderful results, but stopped because I thought it was too messy.</li>
            <li> When you dry yourself, the smell fades out and you end up smelling really clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Huge bars of soap that last for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> Package arrived really fast.</li>
            <li> Please try this if you&#x27;ve struggled with skin issues your whole life like me.</li>
            <li> Here is what I&#x27;ve noticed after using this every day for my body and twice a day for my face: My skin complexion is very even and the look and feel of</li>
            <li> I purchase mine from a seller on eBay but really want to review it for those who purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but I bought it at Whole Foods Store in the beauty dept,  </li>
            <li> I will always buy this item its really does wonders for my skin</li>
            <li> There hasn&#x27;t really been any improvement.</li>
            <li> We have really noticed an improvement in all of my family&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> My face, neck,fore-arms and hands are MUCH darker than the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> This soap really helps to improve the performance of your moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> Also I had a blackhead that was very noticeable</li>
            <li> REALLY REALLY</li>
            <li> Skin is looking so refreshed and acne has improved so much</li>
            <li> I did shipping was fast and as soon as i got it</li>
            <li> Works well, leaves skin feeling clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> It lathers really well, cleans well,  and doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
            <li> They are still there though and very noticable at times</li>
            <li> I read the ingredients and one thing that really stuck out to me</li>
            <li> I could not wait to receive it, but was very thrown off when I did.</li>
            <li> A coworker of mine uses it in her hair and she absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really Dry&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t really have any skin problems to speak of)</li>
            <li> then I realized it is the soap which then made me wonder how much of that brown stuff just stays on my skin</li>
            <li> I use a gentle exfoliator and follow up with toner from Merle Norman as well.</li>
            <li> And RINSE really well</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been working very well for me.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even think about putting foundation on when I was getting ready for work this morning.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how much this soap has helped my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get pimples, maybe 5 a year</li>
            <li> It lathers really well</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t really itch because I use moisturizer on my face.</li>
            <li> Normally my brows go in all kinds of directions, and for once they were tamed (I might use it on my hair as I intended to do at first).    </li>
            <li> When I find something that works I run to write my review because they really help me discern what to spend money on, what works and what doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my brothers acne fast and lasts about a month or so each bar.</li>
            <li> I had a rash on my skin that was very itchy.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is a bit much.</li>
            <li> It leaves too much oil on my face</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I tried a liquid pump brand from Whole foods, no to my liking.  </li>
            <li> My skin always thanks me when I use this soap.</li>
            <li> I admit, that isnt really a problem for me, but my girlfriend has some skin issues from time to time, and she absolutely loves this soap as well.</li>
            <li> He wants me to continue buying it...</li>
            <li> I dnt really care for the smell.</li>
            <li> with some really suspicious looking tunneling.  </li>
            <li> These bars r in a very convenient size &amp; shape.</li>
            <li> I have seen a real improvement in the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried it as a shampoo and my hair has gotten so much thicker, and so much stronger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it up real well in the shower</li>
            <li> Now she wants to use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely using this routine the day before and the day of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely using this routine the day before and the day of.</li>
            <li> My wife &amp; I really like this soap, we will buy it again.</li>
            <li> i really like it cleans well.</li>
            <li> I am afro Hispanic with olive complexion and really like this soap.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with it and it cleans my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping I&#x27;d see some results in a week or two but nothing</li>
            <li> This soap is a real treat, I will be purchasing it again and again.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because I have very oily skin and was prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> AS MUCH MAKE UP</li>
            <li> He swears by this so much we buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li> really like it.</li>
            <li> This soap really is blackish brown and smells like Ivoey soap.</li>
            <li> I really really like this soap.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and helps keep the skin moist.</li>
            <li> I gave one soap to my sister (didn&#x27;t work too much for her), I kept one and hoped that I would rate this item as \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; within a matter of days.</li>
            <li> Rub gently, and rinse immediately, don&#x27;t let it sit there</li>
            <li> We also are Caucasian and found it very helpful.</li>
            <li> really it real.</li>
            <li> and you can then suffer it&#x27;s cons for that much longer...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the stains it leaves on the tub.</li>
            <li> It was an absolute disaster.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t see any mass improvements in my face.  </li>
            <li> I do really wish this worked for me though</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely fashion and the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Avoid using a cloth, just lather with hands and rub it gently on your skin.  </li>
            <li> These vitamins DRASTICALLY helped my skin, and after roughly two months, my skin looked 75% better.</li>
            <li> My skin thanks me for it.</li>
            <li> like I said before, it has really helped.</li>
            <li> Of course, you should talk to your doctor about supplementing with any vitamins and research how much of each you really need or should take.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still can&#x27;t believe how well this soap has helped my skin and how much of a difference it really does make.</li>
            <li> Fast forward after vacation was over</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still can&#x27;t believe how well this soap has helped my skin and how much of a difference it really does make.</li>
            <li> Fast forward after vacation was over</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff.</li>
            <li> It is gradually fading away, thanks to this soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was shipped fast and in my house quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter how much I use</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this soap is very &amp;#34;leaky&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s how I found out how much cleaning power this soap has.  </li>
            <li> This soap really cleans my skin.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I showered with it, it lathered very well.</li>
            <li> I work at a fast food restaurant</li>
            <li> but it melts too fast in the shower.</li>
            <li> (I am a lady and very feminine at that).  </li>
            <li> It really depends on what you can and can&#x27;t tolerate and your beauty goals.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t use too much, once a day and don&#x27;t scrub it into your face just gentle</li>
            <li> thanks ,</li>
            <li> Though it has not yet proven to be affective in toning some of the blemishes I have on my skin, it lathers and cleanses very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people say it smells ,,it really dont.</li>
            <li> This soap is the real deal...</li>
            <li> It really cleans and clears the skin .  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t take much to lather up; just one wipe across a moist washcloth or hand</li>
            <li> , I really think the smell will turn you off as it did with</li>
            <li> For body, I rely on Olay in-shower body lotion, it stays put really well.</li>
            <li> A very welcoming experience for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t help much...</li>
            <li> i used this soap on my whole body for two weeks</li>
            <li> Once I opened the box the cent filled the entire room.</li>
            <li> It helps with acne/scars more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I think anyone with acne and/or oily skin should really consider using this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this soap, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> and it also has worked very well.</li>
            <li> It really dries you out</li>
            <li> If you have skin issues, itching, dryness acne, or cannot find a soap that really works with your skin give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for my broken out skin</li>
            <li> My whole bathroom now smells like it.</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> really like it now.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but I really like it.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the changes I see in my skin.</li>
            <li> so when I opened the box my whole room smelled like the soap even though I hadnt used it yet.  </li>
            <li> I used it on face too gently and this made me get rid of all of the 70 dollars kits that had been draining my pockets.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Man people really prey on us.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> The soaps smell too much.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This soap clears your skin so fast</li>
            <li> It cleans make-up very well.</li>
            <li> It really cleans the face.</li>
            <li> and it also got rid of that intense burning sensation and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> The sunspots and acne scars are fading and I&#x27;m currently acne free.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> but i was really looking forward to it being beneficial to my skin.</li>
            <li> It worked very well.</li>
            <li> but this dries it up fast.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my whole body.</li>
            <li> Simple smooth circular motions with your hands will do the trick.</li>
            <li> very cleansing...</li>
            <li> why I am really buying this again is what it does to my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing much a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any benefits.</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in the tone and texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in my skin after using this soap.</li>
            <li> I will continue use this soap and recommend it to others as it really does work.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this soap, im 32 and still get pimples from having oily skin this soap really stops break outs.</li>
            <li> so I have been wanting something that will get rid of them for good or at least keep them at bay</li>
            <li> You still can&#x27;t skip good skin cleansing at least 2x a day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what this magic can do in the near future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is true since I&#x27;m 41 with no wrinkles so far, so I say, cool, don&#x27;t have none, won&#x27;t be none especially if I use these products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is true since I&#x27;m 41 with no wrinkles so far, so I say, cool, don&#x27;t have none, won&#x27;t be none especially if I use these products.  </li>
            <li> fragrance of this soap is an outdoorsy-type scent, kind of a pine, cedar, and green smell to it.</li>
            <li> Any business who strives to retain good paying customers should make it a common practice to \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Well I do love it&#x27;s scent, the lather and that it contains only natural products.</li>
            <li> I like all natural products and when I make my own lotions I use Essential Oils to add a natural scent.</li>
            <li> When I opened the individual soap box and sniffed the bar, the smell was so overwhelming it nearly knocked me over.</li>
            <li> It really helps with my Eczema and keeps my skin looking fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, tried many products and shower gels, nothing works as well as this African soap.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower everyday and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> I use regular soaps and never had this problem the only thing nice</li>
            <li> It smells good, and it slowly has helped me with my skin condition.  </li>
            <li> It does leave a bit of a film on the skin - not necessarily a bad thing, but for those who like coming out of the shower feeling squeaky clean, it is not exactly that feeling.</li>
            <li> and I am thinking that I am going to have an adult face for once!!!</li>
            <li> I reserached a few different kinds &amp; brands, and landed on the Dudu-Osun which was rated pretty highly, had good reviews, and was offered at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you really want to try a very good black soap, go for the Dermactin-TS Exfoliating Black Soap…</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because i was looking for a natural product that would help with my acne, and was eager to try this due to the good reviews, and customers saying how it helped to clear their skin.</li>
            <li> Although it made an improvement right away, it took a month or so to totally clear up her skin, but it did and she is hooked.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s has strange strong smell.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good soap, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me that other soaps didn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin very soft and can be used on sensitive and dry skin like my own.</li>
            <li> This soap makes my skin feel and look clean, clear and soft.</li>
            <li> I was surprised, it leaves my sink feeling clean, and soft.  </li>
            <li> I would only warn that you should really rinse the tub after using because it can up how often you need to clean it.</li>
            <li> This soap is more commercially processed the convenience is that you have no foreign particles within yourself.</li>
            <li> I have not used this with a loffah, I just rub it vigorously and it makes a really rich white lather.</li>
            <li> My husband also likes this soap, and says he feels like his skin is cleaner than with many other soaps.  </li>
            <li> I still use a cream for any small blemishes I get, but this soap has taken care of most of them!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s probably 12% better than the other bars of soap I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the possibly present lime may be acidic helping with acne and immediately soothing with the Aloe, but they may have been trying to cover up a smell or made a pretty big mistake.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I thought it would be and do, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> But the same, rich lather and healing benefits.  </li>
            <li> But this  soap  does what  other soaps claim but at a  better price .If</li>
            <li> i like this soap, it doesn&#x27;t HELP my psoriasis, but i know it&#x27;s better than other soaps out there</li>
            <li> I have tried other bands but this stuff is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference immediately my skin cleared up and kept my oily skin problem under control I&#x27;m a man who sweats all the time this soap definitely cuts through my funk and makes me feel so clean</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to deep clean troublesome skin...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m absolutely convinced this soap is the main reason why.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m absolutely convinced this soap is the main reason why.</li>
            <li> I used it again that same night and no redness just squeeky clean.</li>
            <li> I always feel extra clean , when i am done.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately if it sounds too good to be true.. then it probably is.</li>
            <li> Dudu Osun serves as the perfect base for the myriad of moisturizers I use (shea butter, sweet almond oil, lotion) and my Desert Essence deoderant.  </li>
            <li> During my first year of using this product, I loved that it completely rid my face of the dark brown spots left over from years of acne</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who wants smoother, clearer, and cleaner skin.</li>
            <li> They are not overly special compared to a soap bar at your local Target/Walmart.</li>
            <li> Clears up adult &amp; teenage acne very quickly..</li>
            <li> It lathers up really well and has a slight fragrance making it OK for men as well as women ....&lt;</li>
            <li> Had patches of chronic dry skin for years and years that resisted any kind of medical treatment-</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin in my body and acne prone super sensitive skin in my face.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and have skin issues and are looking for a \\&quot;black soap\\&quot; since it&#x27;s supposed to be good for acne-prone/sensitive skin, then it&#x27;s not (as simple as that).</li>
            <li> best thing about this soap is that it is completely organic and has the ingredients, in plain english, printed on the back of the box.  </li>
            <li> I love the aroma and rich creamy feel of this product and it does not dry my skin out like harsh chemical cleansers.</li>
            <li> It blow dried how it would normally for the most past, but I was absolutely thrilled to feel normal textured hair, but it was SUPER SHINY and very very SOFT.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty sensitive nose</li>
            <li> and the spots and small pimple like grains seems to be receding somewhat into the skin...but who knows how effective it will be in the end when i used the 4 pack i bought.</li>
            <li> The morning after I used it for the first time, those bumps were GONE completely.</li>
            <li> So short and sweet, here we go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My already dark skin darkened more during the summer</li>
            <li> She is 10 years old and is not always consistent with cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> Personally the smellis not bad to me.</li>
            <li> Not necessarily bad, but if I needed any regular soap I would just go to grocery store or CVS.</li>
            <li> But even when I was breaking out some, my skin looked so nice that the very little acne wasn&#x27;t the main focus on my face.</li>
            <li> I went from having clear, perfect, glowing skin, to dry, pimply skin, with lots of black marks in a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> It does tend to dry out the skin a bit but only for the first week or so.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will be buying more.</li>
            <li> However, for those same reasons, it can dry out your skin, but then again who&#x27;s buying pure natural soaps without having some kind of moisturizing ritual.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to get rid of big pores, but this seems to be doing a great job.  </li>
            <li> that it does melt kind of fast but not much different than other soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still continue doing reviews, but as for this weekly update, it&#x27;s nothing new really.</li>
            <li> I will likely alternate between the two because the African raw soap is my favorite and makes my sensitive skin feel great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read such great reviews about African Black soap, and I was looking forward to seeing much clearer skin.</li>
            <li> I have always love black</li>
            <li> In the beginning many ppl have some slight side effect but they will subside eventually..</li>
            <li> While surfing the \\&quot;net\\&quot;, I came across a comment about DUDU OSUN Black soap that was so inspiring.</li>
            <li> I love black soap.  </li>
            <li> I love black soap &amp; it keeps my skin exfoliated.</li>
            <li> So, this is a slight better in cost if you want to save a bit.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love black soap.</li>
            <li> I love this  black  soap</li>
            <li> I love this soap, all my black heads are almost gone, and i have stopped breaking out.</li>
            <li> OK, yes, I kept a couple for myself as I wanted to try a black colored soap.  </li>
            <li> It does dry the body but the skin is still smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using DUDU OSUN products for a while now, and I love the black soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this black soap.</li>
            <li> I love this black soap.</li>
            <li> but u reckon I&#x27;ll be ok since black soap is all I use but who knows because this one has lemon.</li>
            <li> question I have though, is if black soap is okay to use for a woman&#x27;s V?</li>
            <li> the downside is I do find this soap in particular</li>
            <li> The soap seems to double as a mild exfoliant and toner.</li>
            <li> I have focused getting rid of mainly the ones on my face.</li>
            <li> However my entire body quickly became an eczema and rosacea</li>
            <li> but the more I used it the drier my complexion looked, so i would ultimately discontinue usage for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> Well, since I was pregnant during the time I didn&#x27;t want to risk any medicine that was not  necessary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving 3 stars because it does a decent job with oily skin.</li>
            <li> It left my skin soft, and lightly scented.  </li>
            <li> have phsorisis and its only mild..</li>
            <li> I bought this particular brand because this is the one they sell in Lagos (I&#x27;m Nigerian).</li>
            <li> The soap have a mild smell that is bareable, yet it leaves your washcloth, shower and soap dish the same color as the soap.  </li>
            <li> no ugly  brown rings, does not melt and certainly no thick suds to make a facial mask.</li>
            <li> This will be my main soap along with ivory.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking about benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid in particular,</li>
            <li> I got pregnant and my back face and chest.</li>
            <li> You should use a soap dish though to make sure the soap isn&#x27;t kept in a constant state of dampness so that it can last longer.  </li>
            <li> This is my second or third time buying this soap, and I must say that I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This particular brand is a top seller on black soaps</li>
            <li> Used to purchase expensive facial wash, however have dropped them all for this wonderful soap.  </li>
            <li> smell decent and cleans well.</li>
            <li> It is drying but any decent moisturizer with take care if it.</li>
            <li> My skin has definitely gotten better and I will definitely be replenishing soon.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne in my face and back and this soap is helping a lot.</li>
            <li> As i grow older</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to since I am now on my all natural kick!!!</li>
            <li> After I FINALLY finished (it took quite a bit longer), it was very thick &amp; full, shiny, and a bright vibrant lighter brown color.</li>
            <li> The people on here saying it smells your whole room, you must have very very sensitive noses, because yes it does have a smell</li>
            <li> Wow, so cool, and here is the surprise - no dry skin afterwards!  </li>
            <li> I really like this natural soap!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get back with you and let you know what&#x27;s the deal 3/17 which will be 1 full month of using this new regime.</li>
            <li> Great on skin, leaves a very clean feel but can be messy in shower and on counter top leaving behind black residue!</li>
            <li> and at first it made my skin smooth and less irritated for about a week or so</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product for acne sufferers.  </li>
            <li> I grew up with acne from junior high to college</li>
            <li> Both are alkaline (high pH level).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>

            <li> Highly recommended purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess my expectations were just too high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it scalp, face, or an all over body soap.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, for this price you can&#x27;t go wrong!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this soap for acne, psoriasis, eczema, scars, or even just as a disinfectant.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this purchase to anyone.</li>
            <li> This soap is high in perfume scent, which I didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> was a high as the product, so</li>
            <li> This INCLUDES monthly cycle time, high stress level time, and even the summer when I tend to breakout from sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and so I tried out a couple different brands of black soap, hearing good things about it&#x27;s chemical exfoliation, and wanting to keep my skincare routine natural.</li>
            <li> , even my husband noticed it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been having so much problems with dry and itchy skin, I tried so many different product and if it wasn&#x27;t the product that gave me a rash, I didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft and smooth and I have noticed some old marks starting to fade away.</li>
            <li> The box says Pure Natural Ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Just ordered shea butter today with a double shipment of the Dudu soap ;) can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> It cleared my son&#x27;s back acne almost immediately after the first use!  </li>
            <li> This soap exfoliates, fade dark spots, dries out your pimples which helps prevent other problems, and leaves your face feeling so refreshing and light.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the quality and was a little worried that it would fall apart in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It does stain your tub/soap holder - but nothing a little elbow grease cant remove :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes you feel fresh and clean but is not intended for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Having researched skin care options that are both natural and gentle (due to my eczema and sensitive skin), I&#x27;ve read plenty of reviews and tried many soaps.</li>
            <li> suds are creamy and rich, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> but it is a bit time consuming since the butter is kind of hard to apply to all of my skin evenly.  </li>
            <li> good reason to start using moisturizer which had not been my practice) and just a little burn around my sensitive skin (eyes) but only for the duration the soap was on my face.  </li>
            <li> I got a case of acne at 30 years old and this was the only thing that helped, and i seen a difference right away!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and rinses off clean.</li>
            <li> I was just hoping it would give me a clean wash and help with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Well it did give me a clean wash and help with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Why I was really impresses was the fact that it did clear up my skin in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> Happily I was wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will clean you well but will dry you up.</li>
            <li> really like it so far.</li>
            <li> Rinses off clean and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old Caucasian woman who has had acne almost my whole life.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see the soaps was not damaged or wasted.  </li>
            <li> I kinda found it messy and swore at it:)))</li>
            <li> Her skin has been lovely for a few months now.</li>
            <li> We are more than a few days into March, and I&#x27;m still waiting...</li>
            <li> I received my order within a few days :).  </li>
            <li> my normal soap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would tell you to try it you will love it,,,and it last for a long time...</li>
            <li> When they ask what I&#x27;ve changed, I simply tell them that I rub magical dudu on my face and they proceed to give me rather strange looks of jealousy and longing.  </li>
            <li> I am currently living in Costa Rica for a year and brought the bar with me, but after running out near the beginning of my trip I have been dying to get back home for winter to get some more.</li>
            <li> It dried out my face for the most part, and made me break out a bit and have whiteheads.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just for normal skin</li>
            <li> Soon I began liking the smell in general, it&#x27;s fresh, natural, not artificial/</li>
            <li> I have used this soap many times before in the past, my whole family loves this soap.</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun moisturizes and cleans without stripping off normal amounts of skin oil, and without overmoisturizing.</li>
            <li> WOW WOW!!!</li>
            <li> This seems like more or less the same stuff, but more carefully processed.  </li>
            <li> I love this soap but it does&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 66 yr old male who doesn&#x27;t usually get excited over soap, but this is now my favorite.</li>
            <li> My mild acne initially seemed to clear up, but then about a week into it seemed to &#x27;purge&#x27; --</li>
            <li> I have used different black soaps and have always liked them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you like bathing in brown stinging water or your bathroom is just too white, boy did you find the right product.</li>
            <li> Let me explain: the soap didn&#x27;t tangle, but it felt like a huge solid wet clump of wet spaghetti &amp; got to the squeaky clean state right away</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical,  but as it turned out, it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> The 2nd time I used it I didn&#x27;t follow up with moisturizing, but my face felt fine the next morning.    </li>
            <li> I have used it in the past and felt really clean and fresh after using.</li>
            <li> Thus, if you feel a slight \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; as he described while using the soap, please be aware that this might the beginning of a mild allergic reaction.    </li>
            <li> soap says natural, but what is natural OR pure about added fragrance?</li>
            <li> Also, due to extreme sun exposure (I live in sunny Southern California), I experienced unattractive discoloration.</li>
            <li> and I was determined to try then turns out my new BF uses it andhe told me it helped</li>
            <li> (this will be My New regime)</li>
            <li> I have it on autoship since I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> I have it on autoship since I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts</li>
            <li> I live by it</li>
            <li> Like with anything your PH changes when you try something new.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing really new to add.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing really new to add.</li>
            <li> I guess if you&#x27;re new to this product just don&#x27;t buy a ton</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any new acne.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I believe the evening of the skin tone is due to the lime juice as it&#x27;s acidic and typically that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s good for.</li>
            <li> I could get facials and hope they will go away, but they are so expensive and the chemicals may not really be the best thing for my skin.</li>
            <li> 8 hours later I went to bed, woke up 4 hours later sniffing the intense smelling soap fand feeling panicky, as in anxiety causing a mild panic attack.</li>
            <li> the person who said that if you are light skinned African American not to use this soap because it makes you lighter.  </li>
            <li> It only stains cheap, low count cotton cloths.  </li>
            <li> It only stains cheap, low count cotton cloths.  </li>
            <li> It took several more tries to get it</li>
            <li> I use morning and night and then air dry before applying a mild moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an all organic type of guy, but soap is something that I&#x27;m using on my body everyday, and It&#x27;s nice to know that that I can actually pronounce the stuff that I&#x27;m rubbing all over my body every morning in the</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it looks like a solid rock, it lathers rather very well and by that it also means that this soap runs out really fast, so</li>
            <li> Melts pretty fast if its in water too long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would mind the scent if I only smelled it when I used it, but it&#x27;s making my bathroom smell a bit reminiscent of a cheap hotel in a tropical locale.</li>
            <li> Granted, I do have a sensitive nose, but wow, I&#x27;ve never had soap make my whole bathroom smell.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are simple and chemical free, that is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> I feel like maybe I&#x27;m the only confirmed Asian who has purchased this soap,</li>
            <li> The soap gets used up pretty quickly, so it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> This is great soap, I always thought that I was just destined to have dry chapped skin, but all of that is gone with Dudu_Osun African Black Soap!</li>
            <li> other reviewers have talked about irritation, but so far the soap has been fine for me.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my skin felt very soft.</li>
            <li> Since it is very natural, it tends to be a bit crumbly.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for my daughter and me as we have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> (my skin is very sensitive).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I never suffered from acne throughout puberty or high school, and thought I would be blessed with clear skin.</li>
            <li> and yes I have very sensitive</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel very soft after using.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I have not had any problems using this soap.</li>
            <li> My hair is tightly coiled-kinky and this soap makes it so easy to comb.  </li>
            <li> Go ahead and giggle, people: this is my new favorite soap, and has a lovely fragrance, rather the opposite of the slang term it unfortunately brings to mind.</li>
            <li> Truly helps clear up skin and acne!</li>
            <li> First time buyer, so I may augment rating, to reflect overall performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally I have a {MCS} Multiple Chemical Sensitivity User Friendly Soap to Use.</li>
            <li> and I have used many types of products and masks in my past</li>
            <li> Within two weeks of using Dudu-Osun, my skin looked better than it has in the past year.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited because I paid standard and was not expecting the package to come until the following week...</li>
            <li> hopefully it treats it completely!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy so more after I open my last bar out of the this box.</li>
            <li> My first bar only lasted 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> At first I just felt it on my face, but the second time I used it I felted it on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> My skin is amazingly soft!  </li>
            <li> I have 20 year old stretch marks from childbirth that are fading!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of soaps over the years, and I&#x27;m not usually picky.</li>
            <li> This is normal, the soap is natural, so it bleeds with vitamins and it&#x27;s elements.</li>
            <li> it does smell the same original packaging, but it not the same soap.</li>
            <li> so be prepared to scrub your tub more than usual.</li>
            <li> Either way, stay way from chemicals and buy natural products!</li>
            <li> am now a 23 year old, light complected, white male.</li>
            <li> They leave your skin so soft and moisturized!  </li>
            <li> However, recently I saw it in my make-up storage bin and decided to give it a try consistently.</li>
            <li> I normally use bar soap like Dove and Old Spice, so I figured I&#x27;d try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a difference within the first week.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> My brother in law in a marine, during training and drills when it is hot out, he sweats a lot which will cause his shoulders and back to break out.</li>
            <li> (not excessively of course.</li>
            <li> Natural products do wonders!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the creators are so sure of their product, they took the name challenge and added a prefix usually used to describe feces by my 4-year-old nephew.  </li>
            <li> natural and fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;I will repeat!</li>
            <li> Holy cow was my hair shiny, full, and soft!!</li>
            <li> Holy cow was my hair shiny, full, and soft!!</li>
            <li> ( I think it got in my eyes a little or maybe the strong smell irritated my eyes, but I rinsed my eyew with water</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to try it on my hair but a little concerned, since I color my hair, as the soap seems a bit strong.  </li>
            <li> and it is a little strong but nothing that gives me a head ache.</li>
            <li> - Major plus!!!</li>
            <li> I really wish I could give this an enthusiastic review, because that would mean that it actually worked for me.</li>
            <li> any other soap leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> leaves skin soft/smooth and extremely squeaky clean</li>
            <li> scent is a little strange but feels nice.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be having a positive affect on keeping my dry skin at bay, but it melts so fast in the shower.</li>
            <li> It is really not necessary for it to be effective and this is probably a factor in other people&#x27;s various skin reactions that I have read here.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let it get near your eyes or other more fragile</li>
            <li> I remember it a huge block in less than 2 weeks it became a piece of sponge.   </li>
            <li> At less than $3.oo a bar, it is a HUGE savings to me.</li>
            <li> The bars are also huge and last a long time.</li>
            <li> After use, my skin feels like it&#x27;s slightly taught and smooth.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to buy this product as long as it&#x27;s available via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Seriously, after struggling for years to clear my skin, it is such a good feeling when you find a product that clears everything up in a matter of ~8 weeks.</li>
            <li> Seriously, after struggling for years to clear my skin, it is such a good feeling when you find a product that clears everything up in a matter of ~8 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and was quite conservative with it at first, only using it for showers..</li>
            <li> I figured that since everything I&#x27;ve tried is pretty much equally ineffective, I&#x27;d just stick to a natural routine.</li>
            <li> My psoriasis is clearing up on my arms and my hair on my legs isn&#x27;t growing back as fast as it normally does</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s no more effective than, say, Irish Spring.</li>
            <li> One bar lasts a long time, its gets really soapy and is pure so I like that it is natural, as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s calmed down my skin problems and is a much better alternative to commercial soaps that contain chemicals.</li>
            <li> Gives my skin a radiant glow, help clear up dark marks and leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Not good as expected, I was hoping the soap would be more fit for oil skin</li>
            <li> The very first time anyone tries it, there will always be a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m going to stop rambling, but please if you have any problems w/ skin, such as rash, acne, blemishes, dark spots, etc please give Dudu Osun a shot, I&#x27;m not a professional nor can I guarantee that my results will be the same for you, but trust me its worth a shot!</li>
            <li> The very first time anyone tries it, there will always be a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> My skin is now silky to the touch and my dark spots are visibly fading I also use REAL shea butter right after I wash my face</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing African Black soap worked for acne-prone skin, and I was not disappointed!!</li>
            <li> , I do also have raw shea butter too and make sure that after I apply the black soap to my face I follow up with a minuscule amount of shea butter (a little goes a long way) to eliminate drying as some have experienced.</li>
            <li> I would like to report that those large stretch marks I had on my upper thighs are just about gone.  </li>
            <li> I would like to report that those large stretch marks I had on my upper thighs are just about gone.  </li>
            <li> I did when I was younger, I would certainly give this soap a try.</li>
            <li> I heard about africn black soap, but was concerned about the roughness of its natural form on my childrens delicate young skin, so I was happy to find this soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After cleansing, gently PAT your face dry with a clean, soft towel (don&#x27;t rub dry).</li>
            <li> It has been a little over a month now, and my face looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and last a very long time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, on your path to getting clear skin, I would definitely recommend supplementing with certain vitamins and encourage you to do research into them.</li>
            <li> and it has significantly controlled my breakouts, giving my skin a chance to heal and black marks to fade.  </li>
            <li> It melts a little too fast for me, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> My face, back and shoulders have dramatically cleared up within a matter of days, and it seems like older acne marks are fading already!</li>
            <li> Also I did notice when I washed my face with it, my face starting feeling warm and turned a little red.</li>
            <li> and I had generally liked the other black soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is because the black soap is slightly exfoliating and deep cleans the skin in a relatively gentle way and keeps sebum production under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is because the black soap is slightly exfoliating and deep cleans the skin in a relatively gentle way and keeps sebum production under control.</li>
            <li> It truly is an amazing beauty secret.</li>
            <li> I experienced no burning or crazy drying effects.</li>
            <li> BUT I HAD TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THAT AND JUMP ON MY NEUTROGENA BODY CLEAR BODY WASH.</li>
            <li> Instead of helping clear my daughter&#x27;s skin, she broke out severely on her</li>
            <li> and I could see my skin transforming into what I have been trying to accomplish forever, a clear glowing complexion.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this soap I had a huge flared cyst on my cheek and subsequently to using the soap it minimized it so much, enough that I&#x27;m not so self conscious about it.  </li>
            <li> This soap is heavy, thick etc which is great</li>
            <li> My face is 100% clear of blemishes, and my complexion is even and skin is like silk.</li>
            <li> My face is 100% clear of blemishes, and my complexion is even and skin is like silk.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> If I notice that my skin becomes too sensitive after using it consecutively I will use my over the counter gentle skin cleaner for a day or so before going back to this product.</li>
            <li> and I purchased this soap based on reviews claiming that this soap helped to clear acne and acne scars.  </li>
            <li> This soap evens out my skin and helps to clear my pimples.  </li>
            <li> I bought the St ives apricot scrub and it helped clear some of the pimples, but i am not out of the woods as yet, so been trying castor oil as well.</li>
            <li> It works so well to clear up acne and acne scars</li>
            <li> helped her clear her face without over drying it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but i do see my skin clear up</li>
            <li> My skin still didn&#x27;t clear up and it was still breaking out.</li>
            <li> My wife has even started using it on her face and it has started to clear up her breakouts.  </li>
            <li> After 2 months of continuous use, I one day woke up with clear skin.</li>
            <li> Me, clear skin.</li>
            <li> With him in about 3 days his skin was completely clear and has been since he started using it once a day at night.</li>
            <li> It really helped clear up my face up of occasional acne.</li>
            <li> This soap keeps my oils balanced and keeps my face clear.</li>
            <li> My face feels really clean and slightly tingly when I wash with it.</li>
            <li> id steer clear</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Also I don&#x27;t put the soap directly on my face either.  </li>
            <li> maybe I developed  non-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Smells really masculine too.</li>
            <li> It really makes such a difference!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> anyone that has acne problem as an adult will try just about everything.</li>
            <li> As far as cleaning</li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning to my skin being very luminous</li>
            <li> And it is supposed to be a natural product with no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars only because it is very drying for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be all natural, sensitive to skin and have health benefits like clearing acne, delays aging, curing cancer etc.</li>
            <li> Is it all natural?</li>
            <li> but I figured they make it a point to be all natural and sensitive</li>
            <li> I suspect the fragrance in the soap is the cause of my irritation of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you claim to use all natural ingredients AND be sensitive to skin, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be putting obscure fragrance in there or whatever</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I just wish they didn&#x27;t add so much fragrance -- not only</li>
            <li> but it destroys sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son uses it also for itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil on my body afterwards and my skin is so soft and</li>
            <li> but that is the price you pay for all natural.</li>
            <li> I will still use this soap until it is completely gone.</li>
            <li> though it&#x27;s unusual mixed with the \\&quot;ash\\&quot; ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I can imagine some people with sensitive skin might want to test a bit before throwing themselves into using it frequently.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no mention of 100% on the box, so I don&#x27;t know, 100%, if the fragrance is all natural like they claim in the product description on Amazon&#x27;s website.   </li>
            <li> I also use it on my skin along with natural shea butter.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive, and as a baby I couldn&#x27;t wear diapers (I wore cloth diapers).</li>
            <li> leaves my skin clear and soft too.</li>
            <li> Anti-bacterial action.</li>
            <li> The soap is not for fragrance sensitive people.</li>
            <li> Does anyone know if this soap is really natural?</li>
            <li> As far as I know  anything that you add a fragrance to, it is not organic/natural.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I didn&#x27;t want to start putting chemical type products on her young skin to combat her acne.  </li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t rub the soap directly on my face since it has stuff in it, I guess for exfoliation</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put the bar directly on your face and scrub.</li>
            <li> I never put any bar directly on my face anyway.</li>
            <li> It cleans the skin very well and deep.</li>
            <li> So, I think I&#x27;ll stick to my old regimen of oatmeal baths and sarna lotion to relieve my skin.</li>
            <li> It works on old scars and those are disappearing.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought the soap because it is all natural, and because ppl claimed that it cleared up acne.  </li>
            <li> IT WILL LEAVE YOUR SKIN BABY SOFT.</li>
            <li> NO chemicals etc used ; just all natural.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this may not be the soap for you.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend to use it on the whole body, avoid the private part (for females), because I got uti and had to take antibiotics for it.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> I found since using the soap I don&#x27;t have to shave my legs near as often as I did when not using this soap.</li>
            <li> but so far I haven&#x27;t seen a change in my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and moist from using this soap.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for nearly 3 months and it has also started to fade some brown spots on my face</li>
            <li> I like that this soap is natural.  </li>
            <li> This smells like old homes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still too early to tell all I know is my face</li>
            <li> No chemicals and all natural..</li>
            <li> I have suffered from adult acne for years, but since I have been using this soap my skin glows</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for making it possible .</li>
            <li> There are alot of natural soaps out there</li>
            <li> I bathe and wash my natural hair with it.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get away from anything that isnt natural.</li>
            <li> AFTER 2 WEEKS MY SKIN WAS SMOOTH AND FIRM .</li>
            <li> We do not have what you would call sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Has worked wonders on my adult sons with exzema.</li>
            <li> helps prevent pimples and naturally cleans with these organic ethnic soap.</li>
            <li> I used it to wash my face, I&#x27;ve also used it to wash my hair because the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and it works wonders on my face and body.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel extremely soft.</li>
            <li> It is soft and silky.</li>
            <li> we will see if it works for old lady spots.</li>
            <li> natural, I use to use counter soaps</li>
            <li> But this soap wow, wow,</li>
            <li> It burns your skin where you are sensitive (read that again and think about it), this did not cease for me even after a month.</li>
            <li> an make you sensitive to sunburn  </li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I like that it is natural and has cleared blemishes on my skin.</li>
            <li> And the way it made hands, forearms and elbows feel out-weighed the very temporary issue, especially being a bar soap.</li>
            <li> but my skin is still soft and I like the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for, but I guess I must have been sensitive to this product because if I got it in my eyes it would burn, or accidentally up my nose it would sting and sometimes bleed.  </li>
            <li> Feet felt almost instantly soft even after I got up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Stay away from this product if you have sensitive.</li>
            <li> GO NATURAL.</li>
            <li> Any soap strips away the natural acidity of your skin and can allow free-radicals to damage your skin.</li>
            <li> Same deal: soak some onto a cotton ball and gently rub across my face and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> and I like it so far</li>
            <li> As far as acne goes, it didn&#x27;t help the problem, but it does help fade the blemishes that I  have.</li>
            <li> Even though I filter shower water, this soap leaves my skin so soft and doesn&#x27;t need tons of lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with a problem with acne all my life.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to see what all natural soap was like.  </li>
            <li> but, i have sensitive skin and my skin loves this soap.</li>
            <li> Lol...and natural....</li>
            <li> Will stick to my Dove sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> I bought this soap A) because it&#x27;s all natural and B) because some reviewers had said that it helped clear their acne and scars.</li>
            <li> All ingredients are natural, except for the fragrance.</li>
            <li> If you like really natural, organic, etc.</li>
            <li> If your skin  is sensitive try if you feel a tingle leave  </li>
            <li> I also have begun using it as a shampoo, and it makes my hair shiny, soft and manageable without weighing it down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far whatever it is has not irritated my skin in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teenage son has very oily skin</li>
            <li> i use it on my 5 year old, my 9 month old (both boys) and me.</li>
            <li> AVOID sensitive areas&lt;</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin on my body feel toned and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have acneic skin on my face, and after ONE USE, my skin was brighter and it made my zits mature by the end of the day so that they could be extracted.  </li>
            <li> Also, my skin is baby soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> I bought this soap on advice from a friend who was getting adult acne.  </li>
            <li> Our skin is soooo soft and it has done wonders for our acne.  </li>
            <li> And using it on my scalp has completely eliminated my dandruff as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne prone, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so this is helpful stuff.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using my Old Spice body wash and started using this on my body and face.</li>
            <li> Old scars that I have from playing football have begun to fade.  </li>
            <li> and recently I&#x27;ve developed hormonal acne around my monthly visitor time.</li>
            <li> I read a million reviews on natural soaps before buying this one.</li>
            <li> I use this soap to bathe with and to wash my face and my skin is soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> Either way, I like it so far.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I started using the soap and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This soap has helped my adult daughter lessen acne caused by a medication.</li>
            <li> My daughters just turned 9 and 10 years old, and about a year ago</li>
            <li> I like it so far, just started using it</li>
            <li> well I have acne since 9 years old and now I&#x27;m 33!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over the years I have developed a sensitivity to soaps that results in a contact dermatitis.  </li>
            <li> My husband is sensitive to perfumes and it does bother him.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle enough for the face as well</li>
            <li> this product made my skin bumpy, and discolored a bit, which threw me off because the ingredients have natural elements.</li>
            <li> I decided that it was time to venture to the natural approach for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh and it removes everything....</li>
            <li> I have been usingit for a mouth now and didn&#x27;t notice any difference so far.</li>
            <li> so far it seems to be improving my adult acne.  </li>
            <li> And knowing that it&#x27;s all natural is a plus.</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t recommend using it in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this soap on sensitive areas as my face..</li>
            <li> This soap is marketed as all natural.</li>
            <li> The whole bathroom smells, when you open it; and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t dissipate for days.</li>
            <li> It lasts a really long time, I am still on my first bar.</li>
            <li> My three year old daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural fruit based ingredients.</li>
            <li> This soap appears to be working so far on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 10 days now and my skin is so soft</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s because my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is prone to eczema</li>
            <li> It really makes such a difference!</li>
            <li> By the way, I do not have a sensitive nose, it is truly just that</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural and even the address on the soap box is from Lagos, Nigeria.</li>
            <li> but this had completely erased it.</li>
            <li> All natural soap that cleans and leaves you completely refreshed.</li>
            <li> The only thing negative is that it kind of burns a bit on your nether regions.  </li>
            <li> I tried it a few more times, but ultimately had to throw it out because it was hurting my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also am able to use a thick moisturizer (night cream) by merle norman day and night to counter act the dryness.</li>
            <li> It rinsed completely out hence verifying that if you use expensive, good quality washcloths it won&#x27;t stain.  </li>
            <li> It rinsed completely out hence verifying that if you use expensive, good quality washcloths it won&#x27;t stain.  </li>
            <li> The smell is okay but not really amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, definitely flowery but also definitely not natural.</li>
            <li> Personally, I love the big chunk of Black soap they sell here on Amazon, *with the Shea butter in it!*...</li>
            <li> Our face felt very clean and once it started to burn a little we washed it off, no big deal.</li>
            <li> But I can say that I have noticed my acne getting much better over the past couple of months, too!  </li>
            <li> I would say be careful to use the right mixture of products with this bar.</li>
            <li> I started breaking out (for the first time in a very long time, mind you).</li>
            <li> I started breaking out (for the first time in a very long time, mind you).</li>
            <li> ( I was sure to be VERY gentle as I&#x27;d read many times where a person was rough and it was painful)</li>
            <li> After I use this soap, I try to moisturize face/body pretty well, but since my skin is on the dry side, it&#x27;s still drying out my skin even with shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I had heard good things about African Black Soap and after perusing Amazon I decided on the Dudu-Osun Black Soap by Tropical Naturals.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay for something so reasonable in price and does such a fine job.</li>
            <li> Because our hair is naturally dry, I immediately added shea butter and oils to my scalp first and then to my strands to replenish moisture and avoid breakage.      </li>
            <li> Thanks so much for having other comments on products because it helped me to purchase this product and give it a try.</li>
            <li> true black soap.  </li>
            <li> I think I like the raw African soap better, but I like that this is already in bar form</li>
            <li> Before I made my first purchase, I read every single review.</li>
            <li> I placed the soap outside my main door, so that it would not be nowhere near me.</li>
            <li> Immediately after I get out of the shower my skin feels healthy, firm and soft all day long.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s helpful being able to always tell when there&#x27;s soap left behind ;)</li>
            <li> It is messy but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I purchased it because of the natural ingredients, but am slowly learning that it is good for eczema, psoriasis, acne, (I use it as a preventative measure), and fading dark spots.</li>
            <li> While my sisters would use their high priced natural soaps, I&#x27;d be using my &amp;#34;gross&amp;#34; Irish Spring soap.</li>
            <li> I am a African American women in early 30&#x27;s and have suffered with mild acne since my teenage years.  </li>
            <li> I switched to &amp;#34;African Black Soap Raw Organic Natural Pure 1lb&amp;#34; (which is sold here on Amazon) and I like it better than Dudu-Osun.</li>
            <li> You will love Dudu-osun African Black Soap even if you are not african.</li>
            <li> but it has seriously changed my skin for the better.</li>
            <li> but if you have dry skin I really don&#x27;t suggest this for you as it can be very drying even leaving your skin white afterwards until you apply some type of moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have used natural black soap before with much success and can attest that this soap is in no way natural.  </li>
            <li> After letting it lather for a few minutes, you feel almost abnormally clean.</li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t say how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> 2)it is the grossest thing you will ever have in your shower - it is not a black soap, it is DUDU brown, literally.</li>
            <li> /makes your sting peel and dry, and yes this is true, but I recommend that you bare through it as it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do and will ultimately benefit you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People with sensitive skin should be careful when first using this, it can burn you/</li>
            <li> It also became apparent to me how much residue regular soaps leave on my skin.</li>
            <li> Once I stopped using it and used my old cleanser, my face turned back to normal.</li>
            <li> smell is a little strong for my taste, but this is only when using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about African Black soap and heard this was supposed to be the original one behind all the other ones out there.</li>
            <li> using it on my body, same for the face, my skin became smooth, but using it for my head, I noticed tight areas on the back of my head near the top wasn&#x27;t as tight after I washed me hair, cut it, and watched it grow back.</li>
            <li> highly recommend trying this soap - you will never go back to chemicals and fragrance again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Dudu-Osun soap contains different forms of wood ash, which in turn has a high percentage of calcium carbonate (used in agricultural lime) and potash (used in lye).</li>
            <li> I bought these for psoriasis relative with a high hope they will help ...</li>
            <li> I love what its doing to my skin although it can make your skin very dry yet tight.</li>
            <li> USE THE LATHER FROM THE SOAP WITH YOUR BARE HANDS!!</li>
            <li> Major self-esteem boost!</li>
            <li> Major self-esteem boost!</li>
            <li> Now granted, there are 4 soap bars in the sealed plastic wrap, but upon opening it I felt like I had walked by the perfume counter of a major department store and had every scent sprayed on me at once!  </li>
            <li> and then it disappears, being gentle &amp; patting dry with your towel is your sensitive, ect).</li>
            <li> Well not quite that quick, but the bar lasts a lot shorter than other bars I&#x27;ve tried (compared to standard soaps and natural ones).</li>
            <li> I had a slight (but consistent) acne problem, and wow was I ever surprised at the results!  </li>
            <li> Very large bars last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I had been using Raw African Black Soap for about three months and loved it.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because this not only did not help with my acne but caused more!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it before its great especially now since I&#x27;m getting into my African roots so ill be using this soap a lot now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with intense acne for so long</li>
            <li> So, there were a few people wondering if it was ok for white ppl to use an African soap.  </li>
            <li> I have posted a review about a week ago on the general outstanding performance and some tips about the soap (such as sensitive skin experiencing \\&quot;burning\\&quot; the first few times if you are not gentle, brief breakout period</li>
            <li> Also, it retained enough of the soap that it was fuller and thicker than normal.</li>
            <li> Buy it, buy it!Also, it retained enough of the soap that it was fuller and thicker than normal.</li>
            <li> purchased the soap in a pack of 4 and have barely even made a dent in the first bar considering that I&#x27;ve used it mostly several times daily for 2 months.  </li>
            <li> The son that I originally found this soap for, his face was a mess when I first started ordering, he had so many scars and was constantly breaking out, it was sad.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of my normal soap and had no choice but to pull out one of these bars and actually use it.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks I was confident enough to go out in public without ANY makeup!!!!!</li>
            <li> As regular soap use, not bad but...my husband told me he loves other brand.</li>
            <li> and as I got older i barely had breakouts now I&#x27;m 35 and its like all of a sudden puberty hit!</li>
            <li> My only issue, minor, is the soap, if left in any amount of standing water dissolves quickly.</li>
            <li> I like this soap more than any other black soap I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The price of the 1 Lb chunk is also very good..and it lasts a LONG TIME!</li>
            <li> But shortly after I graduated, went to college, and moved to a new city, my skin went haywire.</li>
            <li> cause I&#x27;ve gotten new ones on my face, neck, chest, and back, but not a ton, just a couple here and there.</li>
            <li> I live it and have left some for my mother to try.</li>
            <li> If you are the maker of this soap and you want to use that last sentence as a new business motto... please give me a job and pay me well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon..for printing both the good and the bad.</li>
            <li> Now as soon as I washed off soap it felt so clean like no residue feeling left after I dried my face with a soft cloth</li>
            <li> I really like it for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> He been having eczema for years and this really works in softening, his itchiness, and dry skin.</li>
            <li> the bubbles dont really turn that brown, you only notice it rinsing, on my skin (and I&#x27;m white)</li>
            <li> More people reviewing this product had complained of the same issue.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely looove this soap it has gotten rid of my back acne, and i was starting to get pimples on my thighs</li>
            <li> I bought this soap after some heavy research to cure my ongoing problem of a mild case of eczema.</li>
            <li> The more sensitive your skin, the worse this will be.</li>
            <li> Dudo osun is helping little fade a dark spots and keep soft skin in twice day, but I love it already.</li>
            <li> It burns like a mother especially on my cheeks which are rosey and very sensitive.</li>
            <li> It makes a muddy mess in the shower with use, it didn&#x27;t improve my skin at all, it stained some of my white wash clothes (brownish stains), and I had to clean my shower twice as often while I used my supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Caused major flare-ups.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s usually not used by white people, but I tried it anyway.</li>
            <li> First off, it lathers extremely well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I ran out of this soap, but I will definately be buying more soon!</li>
            <li> and we see a major improvement since he&#x27;s been using the soap.  </li>
            <li> I will say, I was hoping the black soap would help to even out my skin tone and help with fading some of my dark spots as so many reviews mention here and as the product description implies with the \\&quot;nature cures\\</li>
            <li> Extra clean feeling after use, but one MUST moisturize especially the face due to a drying effect that the soap has.</li>
            <li> The bar is a good size and the color looks like the other samples of black soap you may see that are square or odd shaped.  </li>
            <li> Some spots get a little dry at first, but then they must get used to the soap, because they get better in a few days.  </li>
            <li> I will also post other product links to the products I mentioned that I have really helped me achieve clear skin.</li>
            <li> I will also post other product links to the products I mentioned that I have really helped me achieve clear skin.</li>
            <li> During the second year I noticed a change in my skin, not as much oil production which made my face look dry and to me old.</li>
            <li> so it is better as use every other day or a few times per week.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you will find some large exfoliation bits that are rough.</li>
            <li> I was very leery about using &#x27;Black Soap&#x27;, in my new tub.</li>
            <li> ZITS.THAT LEAVE MY FACE WITH VERY LARGE BLACK SPOTS AND</li>
            <li> Like most black soaps, it does leave a black residue wherever you place it.</li>
            <li> it runs black when wet but washes away easily.</li>
            <li> it works so far it can burn little bit at first, just have to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I use a mosturizer right after because my face feels slightly tight if not.   </li>
            <li> makes more a baby black residue mess upon using it</li>
            <li> Since either way, she wasn&#x27;t using the black soaps, I decided to switch back since the other one felt more cleaner when I washed it off.</li>
            <li> Great for bad skin or acme or even eczema.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try this soap after perusing soaps and reading the generally favorable reviews.</li>
            <li> but as a general shower soap it leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> General effectiveness.</li>
            <li> General effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Or if your skin is just oily in general you might like it.  </li>
            <li> but then he started to really notice dark spots fading and completely disappearing as well</li>
            <li> I paid standard shipping, and when I posted my concerns Renee&#x27;s General Store said that I should have email my request to get my items early.</li>
            <li> This soap last a long time and lathers very well.</li>
            <li> wow, people you need to try it, you will not be disappointed, keep using it , you will see great results,</li>
            <li> My back and shoulders have not been this clear in years.</li>
            <li> My back and shoulders have not been this clear in years.</li>
            <li> I have fallen completely in love with it and recommend it to all of my friends, and probably will never buy another type of soap as long as this continues to be made.s has not irritated my skin in the least.  </li>
            <li> I used to rely on Neutrogena Body Clear to control my back and chest acne.</li>
            <li> I keep my unopened bars in a tightly closed bag and locked away in a drawer in the bedroom otherwise the whole room will smell like it.</li>
            <li> I do like that you can actually use as soap directly on your face without the worry stuff scratches but</li>
            <li> I use a lot of different natural bar soaps and this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> I am barely in my thirties</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell, but I am sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> everything was apparently brought to the surface</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a long history of eczema, skin irritations due to sodium laurel sulfate found in many shampoos, soaps and toothpastes among other ingredients like \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I suffered from adult acne for last 3 years.</li>
            <li> Also got my teen and 22 year old to start using it.  </li>
            <li> or shall I say darker ones are barely visible.  </li>
            <li> or shall I say darker ones are barely visible.  </li>
            <li> It has worked wonders on my adult acne and my kids teenage acne.</li>
            <li> and it definitely leaves my skin soft and it has not stained my tub</li>
            <li> so far, I still have two bars left &amp; I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I then used it on my body and the soap left mine skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I have adult acne and this is the only soap that clears my face and fades the scars.</li>
            <li> it also melted if left near or around moisture.</li>
            <li> so I went back to my old face wash and haven&#x27;t had a breakout.</li>
            <li> now we barely need any lotion after showering and the acne on my face (although not</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s organic and uses only natural products;which</li>
            <li> Your skin produces natural oils that are suffice enough to replenish skin after use.</li>
            <li> But you must wash with your bare hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m out of the shower now, obviously, and my body feels SO soft.</li>
            <li> all natural - I am buying only products without fragrance or chemicals now.</li>
            <li> But all the ingredients in the Dude Osun soap are simple and natural.  </li>
            <li> my next step is a natural deodorant...</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian female, early thirties, who has been suffering from hormonal acne for over a year now</li>
            <li> For barely over $10 this is a steal!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but like I said, bare through it</li>
            <li> It worked well enough for me to toss the old Benzoyl Peroxide in the trash.</li>
            <li> I have taken out everything from my old face washing routine and simply replaced it with this soap.</li>
            <li> I have natural, ethnic, coarse hair</li>
            <li> This is the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> This soap is lasting me about 90 days so far.</li>
            <li> I have tried mail order face systems, all natural face systems, over the counter, and regular drug store brand stuff.</li>
            <li> If left on the skin for even a minute, I can feel the burning for up to six hours later, and my skin sensitivity level is normal.</li>
            <li> I guess it gets worse before it gets better</li>
            <li> the danger of hormonal disruption from artificial fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother you than this is a good soap for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a change for the better or worse since using this skin.</li>
            <li> so it comes right out, but still a little perturbing.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this the seller told me to soap my cloth once and put the bar down....</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, make sure you get a moisturizer as well because it can leave your face feeling a little dry if you don&#x27;t have oily</li>
            <li> I tried various soaps, clensers, lotions and such, even made my own homemade lotion with shea butter and s few different oils (which did improve the softness of their skin and help a little with the bumps) but could not get rid of the bumps completely.</li>
            <li> So take it out and place it in a dry area until you are ready for your next use.</li>
            <li> this really softens skin - removes tiny bumps and dry spots.  </li>
            <li> My pores seem smaller, I get blemishes rarely, and I seem to have less redness.</li>
            <li> It makes your whole entire face feel opened up and refreshed, like every single pore you have is being cleansed.</li>
            <li> Because this soap is drying and I already live in a dry enough climate, but I like it thus far.</li>
            <li> and I did at first have some slight burning when I used on my cheek and forehead area.</li>
            <li> I have used black soaps before this was the first one that gave a skin reaction.  </li>
            <li> and it may have a slight burning sensation at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used up my first black soap.</li>
            <li> First, it smells, to me, just slightly like Vicks cherry cough drops.</li>
            <li> other than that, hubby&#x27;s still in love with it and hasn&#x27;t been drying out as much as he usually does.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few months now and my facial skin seems a bit better, so I&#x27;ll keep using it; one bar of soap can last a long time if you only use it to wash your face.</li>
            <li> Then, I used a small amount of shampoo and did a quick lather &amp; rinse.</li>
            <li> So far, after several months of use we&#x27;ve not had any dry skin issues, and we live in the Mile High dry zone and its brrrrrr...winter!</li>
            <li> I feel much more confident and have switched to a much lighter tinted moisturizer as a base instead of the heavy duty matte concealer I used before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I choose to rub it directly on the skin instead of taking the washcloth route, I just try not to apply with too much pressure as sometimes little particles can scratch.</li>
            <li> though dont scrub too hard with it, leaves you squeaky clean</li>
            <li> Other than the itch my face has a glow to it, and for once my SKIN can go the whole day looking how it looks in the morning</li>
            <li> My girlfriend said she didn&#x27;t care for it and didn&#x27;t like the smell as much as the other.</li>
            <li> is it dissolves much faster than any other soap I use.</li>
            <li> This is much cheaper that the other products I have used.</li>
            <li> It is a little more drying than I am used to, but my skin seems to have adapted after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> All this hype about how good this soap is for a persons skin and that it isn&#x27;t drying - WRONG!  </li>
            <li> It is \\&quot;unrefined\\&quot; and does have residue and deposits within the soap bar, including, but not limited to splinters, ash, etc.  </li>
            <li> morning: Dudu-osun soap to wash the face, mask of raw or clover honey and fresh lemon juice for 30 minutes, tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I had tinea versa color and the Dr. wanted to give me a medical shampoo and medical cream to help clear the spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently improved my diet (cut back on refined sugar, dairy, and gluten) in an attempt to clear my skin.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice so far, but I will make further updates.</li>
            <li> I decided to only use it 3 times a week rather than daily because my skin is so sensitive.     </li>
            <li> my first order of this soap left dark brown rings around the facebowl.</li>
            <li> it to wash my feet paying particular attention to my heels which are dry and sometimes will even crack open.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have particularly sensitive skin, but this stings on application, especially on the skin around my eyes, nose, and mouth, and leaves those areas chapped and red afterwards.</li>
            <li> Does not dry my skin at all as others report.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my skin was so soft, I&#x27;m not sure if it was the soap over drying out my skin, or maybe it was the soap improving the texture  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li> It will  not  dry  out your skin either.  </li>
            <li> did not dry my skin out either</li>
            <li> And my dark spots due to acne fading significantly.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive, dry and flaky skin.</li>
            <li> This soap cleanses my skin so well that I am willing to deal with the little bit of dryness it causes.  </li>
            <li> It was a little drying at first</li>
            <li> first impression of the soap was that it was a little flaky.  </li>
            <li> However my skin has majorly improved, there are almost no marks or pimples on the left side of my face, even the indented scarring has gone away.</li>
            <li> One person recommended starting out on the hands first until some of the raw material became soft.</li>
            <li> it says \\&quot;Dudu-Osun is the age-long African black soap made the traditional way by hand from PURE NATURAL INGREDIENTS AND HERBS from the tropical rain forest and savannah regions.   </li>
            <li> The strong rule, the weak suffer.</li>
            <li> I was first introduce to Dudu-osun African Black soap by my daughter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been 2 months since I first started using this African black soap, and I still could not be happier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been 2 months since I first started using this African black soap, and I still could not be happier.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used the African black soap.</li>
            <li> However raw african black soap tends to be a better grade of soap.</li>
            <li> so I tend to like to have the raw african black soap better.</li>
            <li> Good for acne, and doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it made my skin feel so smooth after showing but the burning sensation was not good.</li>
            <li> I have been on the same bar for about a month now, and it barely looks used.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed the first few times I used this</li>
            <li> It smooths your skin to a small degree and makes your skin feel fresh, but it is horrid for what it&#x27;s bought for.</li>
            <li> , I get dry scalp and dandruff occasionally went testing out new products</li>
            <li> and i never really stick to any particular brand of facial wash</li>
            <li> it never let me down Thanks</li>
            <li> Really cuts down on shower time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mass straight away as it is hand packed, but once its been used that slows down</li>
            <li> but you will notice less new acne spots and black heads right away.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using African Black Soap, and I can tell won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li> The other thing that is true about this soap is that it leaves a black film on everything it touches including the skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes it would get rid of new stretch marks and blemishes, I&#x27;ve been using it every day since mid July and the only thing it did was dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> It lathered a ridiculous amount, but I could definitely feel a HUGE difference upon the second rinse.</li>
            <li> leaves black color all over your tub and disintegrates fast</li>
            <li> All my skin felt soft except my face felt dry.</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive or dry then this might not be the product for you.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the black soap is wholly responsible</li>
            <li> I really like the black soap I purchased at Amazon.</li>
            <li> It leaves his skin soft and it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li> this black stuff is either being uses by family or is just melt really fast</li>
            <li> cause it will wash off the natural oil on ur skin and making it dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get black heads as much as before.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than clinique or murad and less harsher than the presciption stuff I had from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I really like black soap.</li>
            <li> Especially the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t keep it on your face too long or it will begin to burn, and I&#x27;m sure if you leave on longer you would risk causing irritation to your skin, which could be worse than any acne you already have</li>
            <li> Some super sensitive people may find it slightly irritating on the first few uses, but that passes.</li>
            <li> You MUST try this soap!![[ASIN:B0023A7JF4 Dudu-osun African Black Soap (100% Pure) Pack of 4]]</li>
            <li> My back is absolutely, 100% clear, and like my face, the skin tone is even and no more hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> My back is absolutely, 100% clear, and like my face, the skin tone is even and no more hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> soap is a little more expensive than your average chemical filled soap</li>
            <li> soap is a little more expensive than your average chemical filled soap</li>
            <li> I do put the bar directly on my body and wash away since my body is less sensitive and can take the scrubbing</li>
            <li> My whole family uses this soap and we all have different skin disorders that has  been helped by using this brand of black soap.  </li>
            <li> the first couple of uses, my skin was red and had a very slight burnt appearance.</li>
            <li> and i started to see my skin was getting really weird and kind of dry and patchy.</li>
            <li> But it is bears a strong pungent fragrance that obviously is an unnatural, unnecessary ingredient.</li>
            <li> I have not had any new breakouts, my old ones are clearing up quite a bit and there is really only one little stubborn part left.  </li>
            <li> I am African American and have dry skin and natural hair(hair that is not chemically processed).</li>
            <li> The only con is the fact that it really looks gross and leave a black tar substance in my soap dish.</li>
            <li> and it is a bit strong, but nobody complained about it (and my family isn&#x27;t afraid to voice their opinions) : ) .</li>
            <li> I still buy soap like that in large packages for everyday use.</li>
            <li> After using up the entire bar, I went back to using regular soaps and I really missed my black soap.</li>
            <li> The color can look weird on white porcelain, especially if you let it dry, but damn is it nice.</li>
            <li> Made from pure and natural doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that everything single thing is 100% natural -maybe</li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t take the time to do this everyday, but if I have a big day or event</li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t take the time to do this everyday, but if I have a big day or event</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, but I never had any irritation issues that other users have mentioned.</li>
            <li> If left to dry in sink its hard to clean it</li>
            <li> It does not waste so fast like other african black soaps that are out in the market.</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful to rinse it of quickly,  because it could burn and leave your face feeling raw and red.</li>
            <li> Like the employees of the company selling this product that get paid for going online and writing good reviews and rebutting on the bad ones?</li>
            <li> Been trying different expensive soap to help clear up my acne and return my face back to the smooth texture it was before I started breaking out, but none of these soap worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly two months now and it has made my dark spots from acne barely noticeable and are still fading.</li>
            <li> did feel that my face felt a little dry after using it twice a day for the first to days.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Dudu-osun African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> This soap is very harsh, so please DO NOT rinse it off your face with hot water and only use ONCE a day.</li>
            <li> Tried several other natural soap (coconut, shea butter, Chinese Ginseng soap) etc etc.  </li>
            <li> However, since I had no issues with this soap causing dry skin or irritating redness,  I quickly gave up my usual makeup remover in favor of Dudu-osun full time.  </li>
            <li> I have been blessed with good skin but since moving half way across the country the heat of where I live has made me break out really bad with nothing to help it.</li>
            <li> I still used their treatment to clear it up (which I would also recommend!), but now my skin is clear and I just have to use this soap to maintain it, no more benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks daily my skin and back are 100% clear!!</li>
            <li> but my acne are no longer huge or painful like in the past :), even around aunt flow time.</li>
            <li> Some are completely gone and the other \\&quot;deeper\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Some are completely gone and the other \\&quot;deeper\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Try Dove Unscented for sensitive skin or other skin ailments.</li>
            <li> I have bought competing brands, and I know that natural African Black Soap should have a faint earthy smell and nothing more.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is the scent is a little strong, I wish they wouldn&#x27;t add any scents.  </li>
            <li> The first few days after using it, my face would get really red and dry, weeks later, it would just get dry (sometimes it would hurt, but I bought me a moisturizer for it).</li>
            <li> I also find the soap makes more of a mess than the raw african black soap.</li>
            <li> Within one week of using this soap my skin was clear and I have had very few new breakouts as long as I use it regularly (usually daily in the morning).  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin as I do, be very careful to not overuse this product.  </li>
            <li> I like this better than the raw black soap I ordered previously from amazon.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought the African black soap because I wanted an all natural product for my skin.</li>
            <li> We both are in our mid 20&#x27;s and adult acne is not fun.</li>
            <li> It leaves a clean feel to my skin that I have never experienced with a soap before.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> Long story short I went back to mary kay</li>
            <li> The soap only made my acne worse and turned my face super red.</li>
            <li> The Margo is a far superior product because of the Neem oil is a natural anti- bacterial/viral since these organisms have a difficult time with find it difficult to breath though their exoskeletons if you apple same over a period of time.</li>
            <li> it can cause some redness in sensitive spots at first - my husband used it without warning and he was a little, um, uncomfortable the first day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with my Nubian Heritage African Black Soap, which smells divine and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised I was not ever introduced to black soap when I was smaller.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was unscented or had the natural smell of black soap like another bar I had that I got at a local</li>
            <li> I use it daily even if my complexion is clear because being that I&#x27;m very active</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the size but that only makes it even better!</li>
            <li> It did nothing to help clear my complexion of dark or pigmentation spots.</li>
            <li> It does clean, and my skin did not get dry, but its not better than the average soap</li>
            <li> My skin is clear of dark spots.</li>
            <li> dark spots fade and so far I haven&#x27;t seen that occur in my skin, but I haven&#x27;t taken pictures to monitor anything, but I might start to do so and give an update if I notice any changes.</li>
            <li> You should be aware just about everyone has 180 bacteria on their skin and at least two of these can kill you.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re conservative you can make one bar last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was hoping one bar of soap would last a really long time, but mine is already halfway gone</li>
            <li> No breakout, and the soap last long.</li>
            <li> I used it exclusively for a while and the only differences I noticed were: it&#x27;s messier and it burns a bit if it stays on too long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very big and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I used to only have a few pimples, but ever since using this product I started getting constant breakouts near my hairline.</li>
            <li> It last a long while and if you do purchase some get it with the Shea Butter in it because it will strip oil then</li>
            <li> I have to give this product a five star, I&#x27;ve been suffering with acne on my back and chest for as long as I could remember, and by using this soap for like three weeks</li>
            <li> To my knowledge, the only thing not natural is the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The soap stings a little, just a little, but it&#x27;s worth it for the results you get.</li>
            <li> bought this soap for my back acne, but my acne did not clear up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that some ppl hate the smell and can&#x27;t use it, but we are in love with it, and I&#x27;m ready to order again, in a larger amount this time.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I lathered up a wash cloth with thick foam and washed my face with gusto.</li>
            <li> Ive recently replaced my moisturizer with Raw African Shea Butter and now believe natural is the ONLY way to go when it comes to taking care of my skin and body.</li>
            <li> Tried this product so I could compare it to a black soap I was previously using, only because it was much cheaper and such a bargain for 4 bars.</li>
            <li> My back acne has completely (and yes, I mean COMPLETELY) cleared up</li>
            <li> My back acne has completely (and yes, I mean COMPLETELY) cleared up</li>
            <li> My skin was a little sensitive to it initially.</li>
            <li> The first few days I used it, there was a slight burning sensation, which decreases over a short period of time.</li>
            <li> Is up to you, if you want to throw your money away, then buy the black soap.[[ASIN:B0023A7JF4 Dudu-osun African Black Soap (100% Pure) Pack of 4]]</li>
            <li> Unlike other Black soap you find online these days, this soap is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I was excited about getting this soap, but as soon as I opened the box, saw the sealed zip lock bag with the 4 soaps in it, I was similarly knocked over by the fragrance of fake lime possibly.</li>
            <li> Lathers well last a long time and is not drying !</li>
            <li> They last very long.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that it made an impact on our skin issues, however, it did last a very long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m REALLY taking a chance as I&#x27;m VERY constant &amp; serious about My skin care (especially My face).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then take a white wash cloth and work it in, rinse my face and dry off.</li>
            <li> It make my skin red and dry.  </li>
            <li> Although my skin is generally dry, when I do get a blemish it lasts longer and leaves scarring whereas this was not the case when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> And because I am so light complected, it was so much more noticeable and was devastating to my self-esteem.</li>
            <li> Secondly; Skin, I&#x27;ve been using on my skin for about six months, and it&#x27;s gotten rid of my dry skin</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE BLACK SOAP DIRECTLY ON YOUR SKIN, LATHER IT ON A LOOFAH OR TOWEL WHEN WASHING YOUR FACE OR SHOWERING/</li>
            <li> I had oily and dry combination skin with occasional breakouts</li>
            <li> Still get acne, but far less of it.</li>
            <li> Some people think that it would be a blessing to look eternally young, but I think that that might have a negative effect on a young man&#x27;s self-esteem.  </li>
            <li> 2--- second this soap will make your skin feel dry</li>
            <li> I can say that using it daily will dry out the faced</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has delicate skin, I would just suggest to only use it on the body, as my girls claimed it dired out their faces too much.</li>
            <li> But on my t zone I feel like it has helped contain acne and certainly dry out pimples it does bring white heads to the surface and</li>
            <li> My skin got dry after using it for awhile, and I don&#x27;t know who said it is moisturizing, because it definitely isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I have battled dry skin all my life, especially in winter.  </li>
            <li> I could see how it might be different in the winter if I hadn&#x27;t used a moisturizer, but I still don&#x27;t think it would have been terribly dry,</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for 9 months now and have decided a long time ago that this would be the ONLY soap I would use for as long as they keep making it.     </li>
            <li> So this was my first time ordering Dudu Osun via Amazon, well as expected from past ordering experiences....</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier to say that I have had no new acne on my back in 4 months.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier to say that I have had no new acne on my back in 4 months.</li>
            <li> I initially bought a single bar as a test, and the minute that it started to shrink I ordered the 4-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be careful as this soap sometimes has little granules that might help exfoliate, as I always use soap directly on my skin, it left some big scratches (still have scars).</li>
            <li> The suds looks like its dirty soap, strange enough, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I ordered Dudu-Osun African Black Soap from Renee&#x27;s General Store on 02/22/10 and have yet to recieve my purchase.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and switched back to a different brand of black soap that I had previously used and it renewed my skin to the way it was and left my face moisturized and soft</li>
            <li> As others have noted, it does have a slight burning (or tingling) feeling when you first use it, but after a few days that feeling goes away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is odd to see dark suds when you lather up with this soap, but you get over that quickly (well, except my husband, he hates it because it leaves a mess in the soap dish).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend to anyone who has dry skin!</li>
            <li> Despite the funny name, this seems to be a serious product.  </li>
            <li> My only issue is that it has caused one of my microdermals to inflame, but this is perhaps because I did not fully remove the soap (the dermal sits between my clavicles in that dip above the sternum, between the neck and chest) or some other unrelated reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I only use it every other day now on my face because it can be drying but daily on my body.  </li>
            <li> I only use it every other day now on my face because it can be drying but daily on my body.  </li>
            <li> A decent soap, but not magical or anything.</li>
            <li> After a while my skin started to itch, burn and turn red and very dry.</li>
            <li> I am of mixed race have extremely dry skin, and could never find a product that could moisturize my skin and hair without it either being too greasy or would dry it out</li>
            <li> I use one half cup of apple cider vinegar, and one half cup of filtered water, store it in a jar, soak some onto a cotton ball and gently rub it on my face (and shoulders).</li>
            <li> --I instantly noticed the absence of soap residue that is typical of regular soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always kept a high protein, and low GI complex carbohydrate diet, plus I still work out and sweat like a beast.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissapointed because i was hoping it would help clear up my skin at least a little, but nothing, it hasnt done any harm to my skin either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through so many products, I can&#x27;t even begin to describe my disappointment.</li>
            <li> I am a dark skinned African American woman with oily skin who has had acne breakouts for 45 of my 55 years.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using dark colored towels if possible because they will stain white or lite colored ones.</li>
            <li> The soap is too harsh for my face, followed with a burning sensation after ( I don&#x27;t put the soap directly on my face/body, I always use face towel and shower puff).</li>
            <li> The name is a bit strange but overlook that because the results speak for themselves.   </li>
            <li> Removed long time scars.</li>
            <li> Dudu is a strange name</li>
            <li> But if, like me, you are sensitive, this will DESTROY your skin regardless of the hypoallergenic moisturizers you use.   </li>
            <li> interest over the long term</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strange sensation.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and this is the winter-time, I balance my oils while replacing them with deep moisture, I also use Queen Helene&#x27;s coco butter lotion on my rough parts on my skin, and use olive oil lotion for the rest of my body to condition well.  </li>
            <li> It also lathers well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Not completely gone, but some improvement.  </li>
            <li> It came earlier than I expected .</li>
            <li> l felt like l am dying and my face is not sensitive at all.</li>
            <li> Still have a long way to go tho.</li>
            <li> once before bed with this stuff and only rub the soap through wet hands for a couple passes and start washing.</li>
            <li> I have a few old scars on my legs.</li>
            <li> Each bar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Only thing is you can&#x27;t leave it wet in soap dish.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> The bar lasted for me for quite a long time-</li>
            <li> In the almost 2 months that I have been using this soap I have not suffered one breakout of SD on my face, and my beard and scalp are not nearly as flaky and itchy as they used to be.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strange sensation.</li>
            <li> Product came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I do have long hair</li>
            <li> This soap does better for removing my dark spots and acne than my expensive prescription dermatological creams.</li>
            <li> I suggest cutting the soap into smaller pieces and using it like that because it does run and melt in the water quickly if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> The Dudu-osun African Black Soap definitely makes my skin feel a little stronger than normal and it lasts longer than my other soaps.</li>
            <li> But I only gave it two stars because 1)the bar doesn&#x27;t last very long, four or five showers and it has shriveled down to nothing - that works out to about $1.00/shower and</li>
            <li> I thought, black people use different shampoo for their hair, maybe they use different products for their skin.  </li>
            <li> Here are products that I use on a daily basis (along with cleansing with African black soap) and my skin has NEVER looked this</li>
            <li> I recommend regular African Black soap which has no fragence.</li>
            <li> I have tried another brand&#x27;s black soap and there was no added fragrance and no essential oils, however it had a earthy and &amp;#34;clean soap&amp;#34; smell, similar to castille soap.</li>
            <li> Its not drying like some soaps are,  I also ordered the African Black Soap, I will be trying that soap next.</li>
            <li> and I mean VERY OILY.  </li>
            <li> I only use it when in the shower because it makes such a mess.</li>
            <li> It also drips back so if you have white tiles it looks like a mess.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product for no apparent reason, just to try it out because I&#x27;ve heard about it and because I read the reviews (why not try to lighten dark spots if it is possible?)</li>
            <li> All winter long the lotion bottle is emptied, oiling up to keep our skin from that dry cracking winter heat problem.  </li>
            <li> dry you out if you leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> With a teenage son this soap can leave a big mess in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Although it claims to be &amp;#34;made entirely from natural ingredients and herbs&amp;#34; the last few ingredients are pretty vague.</li>
            <li> As with all bar soaps natural or not it does dry your skin a bit, but I will take this dry over the other products such as dove with deadly chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large bar of soap that looks like a &#x27;traditional-soap-shaped&#x27; type of soap, no need to cut it like you would with raw Black</li>
            <li> I have a bad red head break out that why I start buying this 2 day and it starts to reduce the swelling and by the end of the week if pretty much faded away.</li>
            <li> At worst you have 4 bars of soap for the price of 10 dollars, at best your face will clear up a tad if not a good amount.</li>
            <li> The soap is still a little rough, but they don&#x27;t use it directly on their skin, they lather it up in a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Prior to opening I was a bit upset due to the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go back to any other soap.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, DEFINITELY use a moisturizer with this soap!</li>
            <li> Myself on the other hand, I am also Asian like the reviewer, Eka, and I also didnt like the way the DuDu soap reacted on me...</li>
            <li> but why bother when I&#x27;ve tried other African soaps that do NOT do that.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved immensely and any little sebum bumps ANYWHERE (including hubby&#x27;s bum) have totally disappeared.</li>
            <li> the smell is a little harsh, but what it does for my skin makes it VERY tolerable!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I still use my other facial cleanser but my arms, legs and torso are noticeably improved.  </li>
            <li> I will go back to using my other soaps.</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long?!</li>
            <li> but after that no significant change and my skin went back to breaking out within the next couple of weeks or so.</li>
            <li> It may be due to the fact that I was using a REVERSE skin care line just prior, which was supposed to lighten my skin...</li>
            <li> and so did my other teenage son.  </li>
            <li> I have used other brands of A.B.S. and they were very gritty but also worked.</li>
            <li> they started to get these little pimple-looking bumps, one on her thighs and upper arms and the other on her upper arms only.</li>
            <li> They have different skin types from each other, so I wanted to find something that would help both of them.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> One other thing the use of Neem oil over a period of time seems to reduce \\&quot;liver spots\\&quot; has nothing to do with the liver, but the overall aging process.  </li>
            <li> I would never go back to using any other soap.thanks dudu osun. .</li>
            <li> Can make your skin a little dry, but not a big deal,  i use daily moisturizers...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this soap, but perhaps only once per day or skip using it every other day for those of you who have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s entirely natural and costs so much less than other beauty products and still works wonders.</li>
            <li> Caustic alkaline soaps have a very high potential for skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Also, when you wash your hair with this soap, you will need to follow-up with your regular shampoo or conditioner; otherwise, your hair will feel very rough even if you use argan oil afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It does dry out your skin</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and that was my biggest concern.  </li>
            <li> (I bought CeraVe lotion) because it will dry out your face.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve discovered that after showering, the bar should be kept in a separate, dry place.     </li>
            <li> I notice my skin is not as dry as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I recommend this soap to anyone with dry scalp and skin issues.</li>
            <li> But after a couple of weeks of use, there were dry patches on my skin and a stinging sensation when I used it.</li>
            <li> However, my eczema and dry skin shows no improvement or worsening effect from the soap.</li>
            <li> Just keep it dry</li>
            <li> does not give me dry skin.</li>
            <li> am also going to send some to my sisters for their dry skin too.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> My skin does have a tendency to be dry, so I follow up with a moisturizer</li>
            <li> is really dry</li>
            <li> It does leave my face somewhat dry</li>
            <li> I must admit I suffer with eczemia so at time my face may feel dry after cleansing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After completely dry, tone with an apple cider vinegar toner (1 part water, 1 part apple cider vinegar).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have extremely dry skin, however, so</li>
            <li> , I had dry patches, and those are all gone now.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It soothed my dry skin and gave my skin an even tone.</li>
            <li> It does dry my skin out a bit so in the morning after washing my face I apply tree oil to my face and vitamin E oil under my eyes.</li>
            <li> But this soap isn&#x27;t going to help anyones acne who already has dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and acne.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having dry scalp issues then try this soap on your scalp as well.  </li>
            <li> , a bonus side effect was that it cleared up the dry skin on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yet it doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m using cocoa butter and Shea butter to soothe that dry skin feeling...</li>
            <li> PLEASE KEEP IT IN A AREA THAT WILL ALLOW IT TO DRY WITHOUT FLOATING IN A DISH</li>
            <li> After I used it, my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> Too dry on my skin and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell and it can dry the skin</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have problems, but after a while it began to strip my face and leave it extremely dry.</li>
            <li> It will dry up the face a tad</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, this soap does dry your skin out, so follow use with a toner and a non-greasy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin , he has dry skin.</li>
            <li> Keep it somewhere dry, not in the shower per say as it runs brown</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be dry and I apply lotions and sunscreens every day.</li>
            <li> I realized I cannot use any type of soap anymore without getting dry itchy and irritated skin.</li>
            <li> but if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> It does dry your skin out</li>
            <li> so keep the bar in a dry place.</li>
            <li> There were a few folks the said the bar soap left tiny cuts on their skin.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I can not live without these soaps.  </li>
            <li> I can not live without.</li>
            <li> Even though the fragrance coming from the soap is really strong, when you get out of the shower you end up with a very delicate fruity scent on your skin, not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> She said she had been using the African black soap and her skin almost totally cleared up with only an occasional small breakout here and there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had off and on problems with back and chest acne for a while, and nothing has helped diminish it like Dudu Osun African Black Soap!</li>
            <li> Purchased this last year and after each use, there was always a stinging burning sensation down there inmy inner lady parts, other soap don&#x27;t give me that problem.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have a single one now.</li>
            <li> Even after a single use.</li>
            <li> So I continued using the black soap/coconut papaya soap, rosewater as toner, and coconut oil as moisturizer combination and that dark spot is completely gone.</li>
            <li> So I continued using the black soap/coconut papaya soap, rosewater as toner, and coconut oil as moisturizer combination and that dark spot is completely gone.</li>
            <li> This soap compared to Shea Moisture Africian Black Soap has the same lustrious lather, which means a bar goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The natural oils and shea butter in the soap don&#x27;t dry thier skin out like I have read about raw african black soap.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it smelled \\&quot;soapy,\\&quot; not sweet like the other black soaps, and not like herbs or essential oils.</li>
            <li> I suppose because the water dripped directly on it,  it ran down the wall of my shower leaving a brownish black trail.  </li>
            <li> Started using this product and in a few days the red angry looking skin returned to its smooth luster.</li>
            <li> Since using this soap, I have never had dry skin or even dry patches, but I typically use a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> i, myself, will continue using it, because i&#x27;ve received quite a few compliments on my skin in general..</li>
            <li> Exfoliants remove dead skin cells, which clears pores, allows hair follicles to grow, and generally promotes skin health.</li>
            <li> However, as well as it performs on my general skin &amp; having read a few others reviews about using it as shampoo, I gave it a whirl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was not aware of the various things claimed for it - just got it because I was curious.</li>
            <li> The American English-speaking consumer may snerk at the fact that the soap is pronounced &amp;#34;doo-doo&amp;#34; and is dark brown in color.</li>
            <li> Still though, my skin needed improvement and I was still self conscious from regular breakouts and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation that was left behind after a pimple went away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not gentle on the skin, but I learned not to keep it on for too long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit loose so</li>
            <li> My adolescent daughter developed a serious case of acne and it is almost cleared from daily use of this soap.</li>
            <li> and I started using black soap again, and my skin was clear again in about a week and half of using it.</li>
            <li> and I started using black soap again, and my skin was clear again in about a week and half of using it.</li>
            <li> My balls stunk big time after using this soap down there.</li>
            <li> Dude, Dudu definitely did do its dutiful duty, decisively dissuading dirt, damning it down da drain.</li>
            <li> I also think that it might help that other poor boy, Justin Bleeper, that has the condition that forever makes him look and sound like a little girl.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t let it sit on ur skin for too long !!</li>
            <li> Even the red spots left behind are starting to fade (even the severe ones left on my shoulders and back)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i started developing pimples ( on my face..and black heads), which does not normally happen to me except for the occasional pre mens pimples.&lt;br /&gt;in fairness to the soap</li>
            <li> and like there was a residue in it, like having over conditioned or having a bunch of thick new gel stuff in it.</li>
            <li> I dropped it and it left a black mark on the bathroom carpet</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product after I was reading the suggestions from a forum, the women on that forum had recommended African Black Soap for dryness and etc.  </li>
            <li> Everyone I gift a bar of black soap never goes back.  </li>
            <li> Just did research on cures and black soap is a DEFINITE!</li>
            <li> Will try a different brand of black soap.</li>
            <li> Dudu-osun African black soap is not for everyone.</li>
            <li> but until then...I will continue using the big Black soap with Shea butter 1</li>
            <li> Then, I towel dried (almost seemed like normal hair) and blow dried.</li>
            <li> Black soap is the only thing that keeps my itchy tinea versicolor in check</li>
            <li> this is NOT AFRICAN black soap.  </li>
            <li> Therefore I&#x27;m going back to my Dermactin-TS Exfoliating Black Soap.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is the trace of black goo in the soapdish.</li>
            <li> I think the whip black soap will last me longer</li>
            <li> but it leaves a black residue on the tub where ever it has been left to sit.  </li>
            <li> I saw this African black soap and just had to try it.</li>
            <li> Just have to be careful to keep it dry and wash the stains it leaves.</li>
            <li> Which brings me to this African black soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is beneficial because African black soap can be drying.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this African black soap.</li>
            <li> As such, I was without this black soap for those two weeks.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this African black soap.</li>
            <li> As such, I was without this black soap for those two weeks.</li>
            <li> So I was on a totally different website and found black soap.</li>
            <li> which is why I tried two different black soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dudu-osun African Black Soap for a while, about six months now.</li>
            <li> I had never used African black soap before, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I also have on hand black soap moisturizer for my red spots, and a body butter with shea for afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is partly due to the nature of the soap but mainly due to the nature of a teenage boy.  </li>
            <li> I have a neuromuscular disease that also causes hyper pigmentation and &amp;#34;rashes.&amp;#34;  The Dudu-Osun Black Soap has reduced the appearance of one of the rashes which has been a big boost to my self esteem!</li>
            <li> I read the benefits to using African Black Soap</li>
            <li> Though a lot of reviews from black individuals seem to be reporting different luck.</li>
            <li> It got rid of a rough dry patch on my skin that I had tried getting rid of for MONTHS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week an a half, maybe 2 weeks</li>
            <li> If you ARE like me and looking for the latter, I recommend trying SheaMoisture&#x27;s Black Soap</li>
            <li> And last, for an experiment, For the last 3 days I&#x27;ve showered, shaved, and washed my hair with this stuff, and I swear, my hair looks and feels like it does when I use my usual shampoo/conditioner combo which  starts with a P.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shampooing with the soap: I have extremely thick, dark, horse hair, so I was VERY nervous about trying this bar of soap in my hair as \\&quot;shampoo.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but that was a small trade off for having no other issues including acne or dry areas.</li>
            <li> so I called an African Imports store (who charges way too much for shipping, but I only found that out upon checkout after loading up my cart which is why I purchased it here), and they said &amp;#34;the fragrance comes from essential oils and will not make your skin react and is not overpowering.&amp;#34;  WRONG!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed the soap leaves my skin very dry</li>
            <li> My scalp tends to get very dry and flaky, but when I use this soap as a shampoo, it terminates any dandruff or itchy scalp</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin &amp; eczema.</li>
            <li> Once out of the shower you skin is very dry but refreshed.  </li>
            <li> My skin and hair are very dry and this helps.</li>
            <li> But all of them made my skin very dry when you use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it made my skin feel very dry.</li>
            <li> But it does make my skin very very dry after coming out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural 100% black soap, it&#x27;s NOT smooth like the one&#x27;s you find in a store.</li>
            <li> , I thought it would be a little more convenient since I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep cutting small pieces from the big block with a knife every week or so (not a big nuisance but meh...).</li>
            <li> I started using this soap over 5 months ago only for my face becuase when I first used it all over it was very irritating.</li>
            <li> It has only been about 3 weeks and dark spots are also fading ! ...</li>
            <li> and I believe that my blackheads an little white bumps are fading away</li>
            <li> have a little scar above my lip, and I swear that its appearance seems to have lessened since using this soap.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product a little over a year ago and have been using it daily ever since.</li>
            <li> This is weird to use the first time because of the texture but now I refuse to use anything else!</li>
            <li> I used it for about two months simply as the reviews said I put a little bit on my hands and rubbed it as I washed my face.</li>
            <li> Acne products get soo expensive with all the special formulas but seriously, this soap is going to be the only thing I buy in the future.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have stated that it is necessary to moisturize after cleansing with black soap, but I do not.</li>
            <li> I threw the extra bars away and it stained the white on the tub and was hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice some marks on my leg and on my back, due to me picking and scratching have lighten and have almost gone away!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was expensive for 4 bars of soap, but it lasts so long and lathers up really well with very little soap that it&#x27;s actually a bargain and comparable in price to regular bar soap.</li>
            <li> NO wonder so many people are having bad reactions to this soap..</li>
            <li> lets see how many people can comment on my bad review.</li>
            <li> Since it was touted as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; I was under the impression it was free of artificial fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this specific brand is the smell.</li>
            <li> I just keep the bag open for a few minutes then put it away.</li>
            <li> I found this soap to be messy and still have an extra bar or two that I have yet to unwrap to use.</li>
            <li> careful if you use it on your face</li>
            <li> When I woke up, a few had disappeared, the bumps were smaller in size, and the redness had diminished a lot!</li>
            <li> But when I wasn&#x27;t careful about flushing with water, it hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sulfur soap with Dead Sea salts (such as what Jericho and Adovia offer) tends to be acidic when combined with water.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful about flushing with water and don&#x27;t mind getting a separate exfoliant, it should serve you well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re careful about flushing with water and don&#x27;t mind getting a separate exfoliant, it should serve you well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thats to be expected though.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be stuck with those for life and never really tried to do away with them since I thought it was a lost cause.  </li>
            <li> The next day my face had a scalines/scabbyness that took a few days to heal.</li>
            <li> I wet my face and hands</li>
            <li> My recomendation is to try this product, but be careful and listen to your skin.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> but if you suffer from itchy skin from unknown allergens</li>
            <li> On-time service shipment is a customer&#x27;s minimal expectation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 8 bars of JUST this soap for the last few months</li>
            <li> You have to be careful using it in that area</li>
            <li> But not really working for him.</li>
            <li> I spent literally hundreds of dollars on over-the-counter acne creams, cleansers, exfoliates, masks, pills, etc.</li>
            <li> , IT&#x27;S TOO ROUGH</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s wet, it starts to drip.  </li>
            <li> , after a few weeks, I started to notice a white line running across the floor from the wall to the drain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks and can tell a difference in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I expected a citrus smell from the reviews here, but that&#x27;s not what I would call the scent.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected</li>
            <li> Be careful if you suffer rosacea</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use Dudu Osun daily on my face, not because it&#x27;s too harsh or anything</li>
            <li> And its really not.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complains about this product.</li>
            <li> so well you can forget about rubbing the bar between your hands, just take your wet fingers, run them over the bar a bit, then rub them together</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using the soap flare ups a minimal.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that the soap can get messy so keep in a separate area on the tub.</li>
            <li> It was also shipped before its expected delivery time.</li>
            <li> since it is antibacterial it really seems to help the pimples from getting worse.</li>
            <li> Minus 1 star b/c</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research not just on amazon but all over the world wide web</li>
            <li> The soap was delivered sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ve only had the soap a few days</li>
            <li> Curious that the bars each have an expiration date</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only been using the soap for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Careful it burns your eyes.</li>
            <li> I like it except there is not much of a smell.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU STASH YOUR UNUSED BOXES</li>
            <li> like I was expecting its only been a few days</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t stand up to staying wet</li>
            <li> I started slow because I have sensitive skin and some reviewers said it caused irritation.  </li>
            <li> Which I did and yes it left very small abrasions the first few times, nothing that a 100% raw Shea Butter couldn&#x27;t take care of.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only lost about half its volume!</li>
            <li> I notice that my skin always dry after a cold shower and that only happen when I use hot water to wash off the sweat on my body.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after just a few uses my eczema on my legs and a few other skin irritations are much, much better.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to those that don&#x27;t have sensitive areas, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> However, it does leave skin a little tight feeling after use and I feel as if the bars of soap do not last very long.</li>
            <li> In fact, my skin tone all over my body has improved and I have noticed very slight diminishing of various stretch marks here and there - nothing drastic though.  </li>
            <li> It does make a big mess though!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad and you feel extra clean after washing with it...</li>
            <li> (I did this for shaving my legs), I attempted to use it in place of shampoo, but like one person said a while back it left a residure and made my hair feel like wet spaghetti and impossible to brush (after washing it out with regular shampoo and conditioning), my son&#x27;s hair is amazingly soft though and his skin was ashy afterwards, so I put baby lotion on him,</li>
            <li> The soap takes all the oil and sweat from your skin along with the dirt down to the drain leaving you with just dry skin</li>
            <li> It keeps your face clean from the dirt that get carried out from your sweat so that even if you get acne it doesn&#x27;t get worse and allow it to heal slowly.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it seems harsh, but it has worked better than ANYTHING I&#x27;ve tried in the past year--and that includes expensive chemical peels, microderm abrasions, proactiv, clinique, etc.</li>
            <li> Dark spots on my face have disappeared from teen acne years, the occassional pimple I used to get is no more and stretch marks on my breasts are gone, the ones on my thighs have faded, not completely gone yet</li>
            <li> After the bar of soap got wet though it was just like any other bar.  </li>
            <li> In my body not much difference from other soaps.</li>
            <li> The soap has really helped clear up my skin by cutting down on the redness and blotchiness.</li>
            <li> I also use the Raw Unrefined African Shea Butter for an after shower moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> each bar seems to last longer than the raw soap.</li>
            <li> this made my skin is not very bad to begin with, but this made it much worse!</li>
            <li> I may come back after 2wks of using to get a full result review because I purchased this because I never had a bad acne problem growing up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like cleaning off the dirty oil and replacing it with clean oil for our face.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling less dry afterwards than  </li>
            <li> It is messy and leaves a dark brown residue in the soap holder on my shower wall, but that is not really a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> Black soap can make your skin dry during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> I loke this one because the bulk black soap strips my skin and makes it dry.</li>
            <li> I was dealing with acne for a long time and it got pretty bad after high school :/</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s now a little over 2 years since I&#x27;ve been using the African Black Soap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s now a little over 2 years since I&#x27;ve been using the African Black Soap.  </li>
            <li> So now Im down to only a few crumbs of a bar and will we be reordering soon.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This Soap, which costs a fraction of what I have spent in the past on other brands, has totally cleared up my skin and controlled the oil.</li>
            <li> she said a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> It will make a mess in your tub if you don&#x27;t keep it dry except when using it.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago I started using Dudu-Osun African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> I tried this soap due to the reviews and the fact</li>
            <li> and I must say because of all the review talk about the soap may sting due to the lemon extract I didn&#x27;t feel that at all.</li>
            <li> Will be throwing away the other 3 bars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried proactive and a couple of other products I bought from Wal-mart which did not help.</li>
            <li> But due to the Hydroquinone (sp) controversy , I stop using it all together.</li>
            <li> The produce as far as I am concern does not work, it is messy leave soap film worse then regular</li>
            <li> My mom got me into using this soap for other reason then my face.</li>
            <li> It just won&#x27;t cure my acne or lighten my acne scars, which is what other reviewers rave about.</li>
            <li> I am going to start my other daughter on it to see if it helps her also.   </li>
            <li> I will update the product after my other daughter starts using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for the past 2 months &amp; as an individual w/ combination skin (oily &amp; blemish prone)</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it interfering with cologne or any other fragrance</li>
            <li> and I had numerous small blemishes.</li>
            <li> Several days of using this soap, it exacerbated my usual conditions, so I no longer use it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting big results because of all the past disappointments...</li>
            <li> The small bumps on my back were also GONE.</li>
            <li> hope that some of this helps to clarify the sometimes conflicting comments from other reviewers.enerally promotes skin health.</li>
            <li> hope that some of this helps to clarify the sometimes conflicting comments from other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Got it because my skin was drying out due to the drier winter weather and</li>
            <li> I see the other reviewers and comment saying to not use a wash cloth or a shower puff, loofta, etc, and that we should put the soap on our hands and rub it on our bodies</li>
            <li> i have oily/acne prone skin, and while im not sure if it has helped with the acne itself, it has helped with the overall texture and brightness of my skin.</li>
            <li> but nothing extreme.  </li>
            <li> but I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of reviews on this site and other internet sources.</li>
            <li> it says to the other party that you don&#x27;t care about their time\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It still seems like it&#x27;s almost a shade lighter, maybe it&#x27;s from the extreme shine</li>
            <li> It still seems like it&#x27;s almost a shade lighter, maybe it&#x27;s from the extreme shine</li>
            <li> As other have said, this soap is intended to exfoliate, and it does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that this soap can do miracles, like other stated.</li>
            <li> I use it because i have extremely oily skin and washing it with this soap helps to keep it in control</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll try to find other product.</li>
            <li> Cleans well compared to other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; soaps,</li>
            <li> you actually feel like it got the dirt and oil separated from your skin once you get past the fact that you are now bathed in brown water.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It cleans EXTREMELY well.</li>
            <li> My husband who is extremely picky loves it as well.</li>
            <li> But like other reviewers, you MUST use it correctly.</li>
            <li> This soap can be drying and exfoliating, so using a wash cloth, brush, or anything other than your hands will cause irritation and not be beneficial.</li>
            <li> My scars are brightening and fading, but I use it in combination with other stuff, but I would say that in addition to that it speeds up the process.</li>
            <li> I WOULD NOT USE ANY OTHER SOAP AFTER USING DUDU-OSUN.</li>
            <li> Not quiet as dense as other bars I have used in the past</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said it has a tropical type smell to it.  </li>
            <li> It never burns my face, and  I do notice a fresher cleaner feeling than with other soaps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is however a purging stage like some other reviews mentioned but don&#x27;t let that discourage u either.</li>
            <li> All of course without causing bouts of sneezing in me like other perfumed soaps do.</li>
            <li> I do agree with other users that the soap can be a bit drying</li>
            <li> I no longer use anything other than this soap in my house.</li>
            <li> I have tried other acne products and not onenof</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to use other soaps when I&#x27;ve run out</li>
            <li> I can not use any other soap for my face.</li>
            <li> so I use it every other day now</li>
            <li> Due to that I&#x27;m rating it as a four star, if they used no scent, I would rate it five stars.</li>
            <li> , it has a fruity, citrusy scent and lathers up extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I use every day for my face and every other for my body</li>
            <li> and I swear by this product because it does not irritate my skin like other store bought soaps.</li>
            <li> so i recommend using its every other day or every three days.</li>
            <li> I noticed that some other reviewers said that it made their skin drier.</li>
            <li> even in the summer I found it to dry out my skin a little bit.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face a little dry in areas</li>
            <li> This soap does dry out my skin a little bit though, so I have to apply shea butter to my face immediately after washing.</li>
            <li> This soap will dry you out a little.</li>
            <li> It did dry out my skin a little</li>
            <li> It did make it feel a little dry</li>
            <li> My recommendations would be try 1 bar of Dudu-Osum if you have oily skin, but beware it will dry you out with little protection.</li>
            <li> I have terrible facial acne and have tried absolutely everything under the sun to treat it for the past six years (Proactiv, Acne Free, other salicylic or benzoyl peroxide producs, Retin-A, antibiotics, taking Zinc tablets, drinking apple cider vinegar, applying tea tree oil, sulfur masks, homemade honey and lemon juice</li>
            <li> Very few break outs if I use it daily on my face.  </li>
            <li> A VERY ROUGH APPEREANCE.I SAW</li>
            <li> If you have acne due to dry skin don&#x27;t use harsh soap&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Finally, something that actually gives me clear skin AND isn&#x27;t expensive!  </li>
            <li> but I now prefer raw African black soap or Shea Moisture soaps.</li>
            <li> I never had bad skin but noticed that most soaps are too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> Anyways for about 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been using some Neutrogena products that I purchased and it got rid of all the black heads but left me with a few black spots that I want to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-American female who tends to have hyper-pigmentation along the chin and sides of my face, well in the past 2 months I&#x27;ve seen improvement as acne scars and dark spots are fading (Yay).</li>
            <li> so I use the coconut papaya one from Nubian Heritage after I rince off the black soap because it seems to conditions the skin and my skin is less dry.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I have sensitive skin and cannot use it daily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have not used it, when the soap gets wet the water coming from it will show a trace of black.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I have told family and friends about this miracle soap so please if you&#x27;re tired of buying the same products and getting the same results - give this a try.</li>
            <li> Every single day I have less and less acne</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I have noticed that my complexion has evened out since the dark patches and spots are gone.</li>
            <li> if it made any difference on my dark spots/acne scarring as I also use other creams to help treat.  </li>
            <li> I remove my makeup with Coconut oil , wash with this African Black Soap (2 times), Use Witch Hazel as a toner and use a small bit of sea butter as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> my eyes are less irritated an red then when using my usual acne soaps and my skin is clearer then when I was using over the counter products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is one pain about this product, however, I would not mark it down due to it&#x27;s efficiency.  </li>
            <li> But I have notice that everything I&#x27;m foing is drawing all of the bad stuff out of my pores and causing some breakouts which is fine because it&#x27;s coming out.</li>
            <li> WE have never experienced the burn that some other reviews have mentioned but our family doesn&#x27;t have particularily sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Fragrance    Water is vague, is it pure water, distilled, etc</li>
            <li> you are NOT a the very least sensitive regarding added perfumes then this product may do wonders for you.</li>
            <li> Does not turn my tub black, as I read other reviews</li>
            <li> Granted, this soap has a slight burning sensation due to the lime &amp; lemon juice but you grow accustom to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other black soaps and they don&#x27;t compare to this one.</li>
            <li> So, I used another black soap before but had to change it because my girlfriend is allergic to oats that the other bar had.</li>
            <li> Some other black soaps do not provide ingredients.</li>
            <li> but there are other companies that make a gentler black soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of black soap but this one is the purest.  </li>
            <li> Makes the washcloths black/brown and although it comes out some, it is hard to get the washcloth white again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to only folks with oily skin problems because it is rather drying and can be a little irritating upon initial use.</li>
            <li> I usually use the brand that won&#x27;t dry your skin like other soaps</li>
            <li> The only other thing I still do is apply a thin layer of apple cider vinegar over my face (1:1 ratio of filtered water to ACV) after cleansing and drying to restore pH and keep my skin from getting dry.</li>
            <li> The only other thing I still do is apply a thin layer of apple cider vinegar over my face (1:1 ratio of filtered water to ACV) after cleansing and drying to restore pH and keep my skin from getting dry.</li>
            <li> As some other reviewers have mentioned, since it is a black soap, some of the lather is dark colored, but I use dark washclothes anyway</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that the first time I used this soap, it burned my face so bad and made it so red that I almost called off work that night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After doing tons of research online and from asking my dermatologist, I learned that too many chemicals and medications can be incredibly bad for your skin, which irritate the skin and then inevitably make your acne worse.</li>
            <li> It is really a dark brown soap with flecks of tan and lighter brown.  </li>
            <li> It is called \\&quot;black\\&quot; soap because there are plant ashes in the soap, giving it it&#x27;s dark appearance.</li>
            <li> Helps with the dark spots on your skin as well, I use on face and body.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an acne problem, but I do have dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I use dark colored ones and don&#x27;t have a problem with discoloration.  </li>
            <li> So, these products do remove dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use dark colored ones and don&#x27;t have a problem with discoloration.  </li>
            <li> So, these products do remove dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Imagine their shock at finding a dark brown bar of soap named \\&quot;Dudu\\&quot; in the shower.</li>
            <li> I can see a fading of the dark marks taking place.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to use dark wash cloths or do what my husband does:&lt;br /&gt;lather</li>
            <li> Also leaves dark brown residue anywhere I put it when it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I paid $11 for a 4 pack and would say that is average.</li>
            <li> It stays dark when it washes off.</li>
            <li> After four bars, I didn&#x27;t lose any pimples out dark spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark, the water will be dark too, but it won&#x27;t stain your bathtub or towels.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d mention the water run off being dark, because when I gave a bar to a friend; she was worried about staining the bathtub.  </li>
            <li> This morning I got up and noticed how much it had decreased overnight!</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and dark spots are lightened.  </li>
            <li> It does help with lessening freckles and dark spots, helps with scars and healing, and helps fade stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> my only complaint is that it has fragrance in it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-American who sometimes gets dark spots from acne.</li>
            <li> When I use this along with exfoliating gloves, it works like a charm to get ride of or fade the dark spots I have.</li>
            <li> The soap is dark brown and made of oils that will stain the loafer though I do wash mine in the machine every Sunday to get the oils</li>
            <li> Also I take B3 and B complex daily!</li>
            <li> Does not improve dark marks at all.</li>
            <li> It has visibly diminished the dark patches I had on my legs from scars.</li>
            <li> it has started to fade my dark acne</li>
            <li> I had a really dark freckle on my leg and after using the soap for awhile, the freckle literally just scraped off as if it was a scab.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble with my skin the past year, possibly from stress, but who knows.</li>
            <li> and btw this soap made me have dark spots everywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a little over one month, and I say in all honesty that I have no use for any other face, hand, or body soap other than Dudu Osun Black soap.</li>
            <li> other than the smell and the black mess it leaves in the shower</li>
            <li> They have calmed down a bit since I bought Indian Healing Clay which by the way I saw on here on Amazon read all the reviews</li>
            <li> Aside from the clod, which has a fecal look to it, the bar drools a brown streak down the wall of the shower.</li>
            <li> While I was down there I thought to myself &amp;#34;wow, my skin feels so clean.&amp;#34; I picked my head up expecting to see my reflection in the mirror when I froze--</li>
            <li> Brown stuff running down everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one down, three to go and another order.</li>
            <li> now just less of it since I don&#x27;t have to try to cover dark spots since they are gone.  </li>
            <li> I have less breakouts and dark spots are vanishing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it improves my skin quality, but I like the idea.it did dry my skin a bit</li>
            <li> No more dry patches, just soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually when I get out of the shower, I have to put a moisturizer on my face because it gets dry.</li>
            <li> (for some other kinds a wash cloth would be too harsh).</li>
            <li> and I would wear makeup everyday, and by the time I would leave, my face would be extremely oily, and now my face hasn&#x27;t been.</li>
            <li> Decided to order again because the other cleanser I used for my face was too harsh.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have stated that it&#x27;s harsh on their skin</li>
            <li> If you have any samples of other product please send me a few.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked until I tried African Black Soap!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried other brands of black soap and I&#x27;ve either disliked the smell</li>
            <li> The smell weird, look ugly, but I feel good after use</li>
            <li> From the picture the soap looks black.  </li>
            <li> one star because it leaves a yucky black residue in my shower.</li>
            <li> This was only mildly uncomfortable and went away after the third day.</li>
            <li> and there are less bumps</li>
            <li> smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried black soap in my hair</li>
            <li> I have been using Dudu-osun Black Soap on and off for about 4 years now.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m adding DuDu-osun brand black soap to My regime.</li>
            <li> basis)&lt;br /&gt;Along with the previous the soap leaves a brownish trail of water after showering (this is remedied by rinsing off the soap and placing it in your soap</li>
            <li> woke up with my skin glowing and still smelling like the DuDu soap that I had bathed with the previous night before.</li>
            <li> Chemical exfoliants are typically acidic (e.g., alpha hydroxy acid).</li>
            <li> Chemical exfoliants are typically acidic (e.g., alpha hydroxy acid).</li>
            <li> this soap contains a fruity smell and helps to slightly whiten your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The black soap is drying</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the black soap can be drying, I follow up with the coconut papaya soap since it seems to condition the skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the enzymes in the soap is stimulating the hair follicles less or</li>
            <li> unless I find another Black soap bar with Neem Oil and Shea Butter in it...</li>
            <li> Now I have slightly oily skin, but do not  find this soap drying, as some others do.</li>
            <li> but the black soap worked faster and not to mention it is a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use black soap every time I was my face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think soap could do everything the previous reviewers said it could.</li>
            <li> They seem to be less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black soap.</li>
            <li> As someone who is used to buying black soap during their trips to West Africa, I am always dismayed when I run out of this stuff.</li>
            <li> It typically is about 2 years out from the manufacture date.  </li>
            <li> black soap from another company besides Amazon</li>
            <li> It lathers well, though the black color takes a minute or two to adjust to.  </li>
            <li> Less oily skin and no breakouts.</li>
            <li> Because of previous reviews, I tried it on my face</li>
            <li> but I had a slight reaction to it</li>
            <li> I have eczema and I heard black soap would help.  </li>
            <li> I have scars (black spots) from picking my face over time.  </li>
            <li> Overall,I would recommend this soap to those who have acne and black head problems.</li>
            <li> im gonna try to see if there is black soap with no lime juice  .  </li>
            <li> I break out less on my face &amp; the skin tone on my body</li>
            <li> Within days of using the black soap ( I use twice a day)</li>
            <li> then I notice i got deep scratches on my arms under the shower and now after a few hours I see that I&#x27;m gonna have these scars at least for a while</li>
            <li> Tried it on my face and felt the slight tingling.  </li>
            <li> I showed some slight improvement from the diet, but nothing noticeable.</li>
            <li> This black soap has also faded post-acne marks on my cheeks and forehead and has evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> One bar of this soap typically lasts 3-4 weeks for me.</li>
            <li> A YEAR AND HALF LATER&lt;</li>

            <li> A YEAR AND HALF LATER&lt;</li>
            <li> I bought this black soap in hopes of eliminating acne.</li>
            <li> So this black soap here reminded me of my childhood memories.</li>
            <li> this is black soap, take care of your bath-tub, basin, shower curtains and bathroom tiles -</li>
            <li> I like black soap</li>
            <li> I will continue using this seller to supply me with black soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using less body moisturizer than I ever have.  </li>
            <li> I have been using black soap on my body and face for 3 years now</li>
            <li> It did help slightly with the lightening of my scars.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have used black mud soaps before, and a friend recommended this one.</li>
            <li> If you want something less drying, go for the liquid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I bought the black soap as a recommendation from someone at my esthetician&#x27;s office to help with my acne.  </li>
            <li> Switch between my AMBI black soap and this one.</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter with less noticeable brown spots.</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun black soap burns my skin and someone I gave&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> Previously, I purchased from another seller and the scent was stronger and the soap didn&#x27;t have Dudu-Osun and Tropical Naturals stamped into it like this one.</li>
            <li> For me I am not even half way through my one bar</li>
            <li> Subtle discoloration has definitely faded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using black soap, lemon juice, and aloe vera as part of my skin regiment.  </li>
            <li> It lathers black but washes off ...</li>
            <li> I found it slightly drying (but</li>
            <li> This soap does NOT contain the ingredients in the Black Soap that Dr Oz has recommended.  </li>
            <li> Less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> also it started to break me out,leave black spots on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing black soap for almost two years</li>
            <li> And for anyone wondering whether or not it&#x27;s &amp;#34;real black soap&amp;#34;, it is.</li>
            <li> A small amount makes a super lather that turns almost to a cold cream consistency as you rub.  </li>
            <li> soap lathers in both cold and hot water</li>
            <li> At first I was afraid and intimidated coz</li>
            <li> or you will have a brown mess everywhere (all over the sink, all in the tube).  </li>
            <li> made a mess in the soap dish</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve never noticed a mess in my shower or bath.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about this soap since I was starting to feel like nothing would work for me, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has trouble with their skin.</li>
            <li> Smells a little odd.</li>
            <li> This is MY experience, it might not work for you, but my hair is not so tight anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps skin supple and tight.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin moist and tight.</li>
            <li> Our faces did feel tight</li>
            <li> , Hubby absolutely loves it and has no dryness problems whatsoever, me neither, and I did absolutely everything that people said not to do (minus using the bar on my face because that would be awkward..), it does have a cold cream consistancy if you don&#x27;t use alot of water</li>
            <li> If you hate strong smells</li>
            <li> (in that little round tin .99cents)now as of today I&#x27;ll be using the black soap followed by sheabutter sprinkled with a once week mask of Queen Helen Mint Julep.</li>
            <li> Helps me with my body acne a little.  </li>
            <li> I do follow with a little shea butter as a moisturizer and UV protectant.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give a higher rating but didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately!</li>
            <li> , you feel it a little bit working on your face.</li>
            <li> It is a little drying</li>
            <li> I decided to try this as it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used of.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do that while ago to see how it would do because a lot of people said they didn&#x27;t even use a moisturizer, but I feel like my face needs a little lotion for the dryness.</li>
            <li> they had an unscented version I would purchase again, but for now all my unopened bars will go to friends as a little gift because I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> I have it in a little ziploc plastic container</li>
            <li> Fab soap have been using it since 1998 when I was little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I need to keep it in a sealed up little box.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fallen of the wagon a little</li>
            <li> A little over a month ago when it was time to reorder I decided to try this brand instead</li>
            <li> soaps that you find in gift shops and such, usually sold by weird hippie-folk who also sell things like rocks, wooden crafts, and souvenir pens.</li>
            <li> Also, the fragrance is a little</li>
            <li> Can be a little drying</li>
            <li> It can be a little drying</li>
            <li> This soap has cleared up my skin a little.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month now and the soap has decreased my acne spots and eliminated several black heads.  </li>
            <li> If you notice dryness or few break out like i did, add a little body oil to your face before applying the soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little harsh on the skin, but I recommend the bar soap over the liquid for acne.</li>
            <li> It is a little harsh on your face.</li>
            <li> but it was very dark.</li>
            <li> but it was very dark.</li>
            <li> The soap bleeds with color when lathering just like the RAW black soap that comes by the pound on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin a little tight sometimes, but I just moisturize with some raw shea butter</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter had moderately bad acne and over the years the different medications from the doctor never worked.</li>
            <li> You guys I so wanted this to work since I heard it was amazing for oily/acne-prone skin, but it was terrible!</li>
            <li> i bought it to see if it could clear up and relieve the weird skin condition i have on my arms which can itch from time to time.</li>
            <li> I dropped all the expensive ineffective harsh acne treatments and went the natural route.</li>
            <li> but this is one of the few.</li>
            <li> I lather it up in my hands and apply it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really messy.  </li>
            <li> I thought once I got in to adulthood, it would go away, but it only got worse.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my boyfriend who has REALLY sensitive skin didn&#x27;t fare too well.  </li>
            <li> This soap is heavy on the marketing and lacking in what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this on my combination skin everyday and it removes the oil without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought some Shea butter (to use as a moisturizer) from the same company, and it had the worse smell</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> A few weeks into using the soap I could see a reduction in the blackheads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the soap for a few months now</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the soap for a few months now</li>
            <li> (we have a separate shower /bath) and after a few weeks it dissolved.</li>
            <li> I have uneven discoloration, a burn and acne scars.</li>
            <li> Gave a few to my sister who has severe eczema and this soap works wonders for her.</li>
            <li> It has stopped the breakouts and it is also lighting the dark spots from past damage.</li>
            <li> course you should exercise caution when treating any skin condition, and there&#x27;s absolutely no telling what will be a skin irritant or allergen to anyone, so I imagine that explains the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> One of the bars came in broken during shipping that would be only thing I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Then, a towel dried and blow dried.</li>
            <li> It was like blowdrying a clump of thick wet boiled spaghetti.</li>
            <li> It actually dried out my skin on my stomach and made me break out :x</li>
            <li> We use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done anything miraculous yet (been using it everyday for a month)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh, I can use it on my face, and even use it with a wash cloth</li>
            <li> have been using for a few days, bought based on reviews I read.</li>
            <li> you try it give it a few weeks</li>
            <li> Since I received it, I have been using it everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s natural (aside from the vague word &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; listed in the ingredients),</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing, and the few pimples and blackheads that I had on my face are gone.</li>
            <li> everyday and</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this soap because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have oily, sensitive, and weird skin</li>
            <li> I WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN because it is waaaay too messy.  </li>
            <li> I notice an improvement everyday.  </li>
            <li> and I continued to use it for a few months since I heard of the purging period, but my face never grew to like it.</li>
            <li> In addition to that, the soap provides a temporary \\&quot;brightness\\&quot; to my face for a few minutes after washing.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, dirt and grit even hair in this soap.</li>
            <li> This dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using this one for a few months.</li>
            <li> This soap was really harsh on my face.</li>
            <li> It is sort of messy.</li>
            <li> Do not use around your eyes and beware of the sting if you leave it on for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I am a senior guy who skin is starting to thin.  </li>
            <li> It also dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Sorry if that question is TMI but for people with sensitive skin and areas</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this soap for a few weeks and there had been no improvement in her skin condition.</li>
            <li> Not a HUGE fan.</li>
            <li> I have extremely bad back acne, and have body acne pretty much everywhere on my body; it&#x27;s the worst on my back and shoulders, though.</li>
            <li> the heave-ho and the black bar has a place in my powder room!</li>
            <li> I think the tingling comes from some slight irritations from using a night cream of retinol!</li>
            <li> Black Soap..Will definetly continue using!</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s when I realize it was the black soap dripping onto the floor!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less drying than all of the acne products out there!</li>
            <li> covered mess, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth-it.   </li>
            <li> I choose not to use bleaching creams due to the negative effects.</li>
            <li> you have SD or any other type of skin irritation, PLEASE give this soap a try with at least one bar.  </li>
            <li> If you have SD or any other type of skin irritation, PLEASE give this soap a try with at least one bar.  </li>
            <li> I stored mine in a travel soap container, because like other soaps, it runs, but it runs black (not a good look for the shower).  </li>
            <li> Will update later if there are any changes in my stretch marks, dark spots, and psoriasis, and hubby&#x27;s random acne flare-ups.  </li>
            <li> As such they can be caustic and corrosive although in small quantities this can be controlled.</li>
            <li> I mainly bought this for a friend who has a son that suffers severely from eczema</li>
            <li> so I rinse a little longer than usual.</li>
            <li> My face did feel a liiiiitle tight, but some toner and moisturizer and that was that!</li>
            <li> and it was all kinds of things not good for the skin, we have to be careful what we put on our skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this soap out for my acne prone skin and it did not clear my breakouts although it didn&#x27;t make them worse.</li>
            <li> I just break off or cut w/ a knife small portions of the bar and keep at the sink and also in the shower, so I don&#x27;t waste the soap.  </li>
            <li> Artificial perfumes tend to break me out in hives, but naturally scented soap can be a little pricey sometimes.</li>
            <li> I usually pay $5 per bar in the store, but got all 4 for less than $11 here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with over scented bath and body products.&lt;br /&gt;However, keep in mind that it is a black soap</li>
            <li> I used raw shea butter when I was done which helps with the dryness.</li>
            <li> So much so, it made me sick to my stomach, as all chemicals do, and I had to store it in a air tight container</li>
            <li> Been having bad acne for the past 15 years I tried a lot of products after the first time I used this soap</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s different but not in a bad way, over time I got used to it and actually like it  </li>
            <li> Fragrance/perfume is a horrific irritant for sensitive skin, and is an absolute breeder of Eczema and Rosacea.</li>
            <li> After abandoning the medical profession&#x27;s expensive prescription remedies, I started using a combination of sulfur soap with Dead Sea salts, vitamin B-5.</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun is cheaper than other brand but smells not good.</li>
            <li> So for 2.5 years I would use it when I had bad acne because it dried up bumps overnight and left minimal scarring</li>
            <li> I usually by a set of this soap.</li>
            <li> Not sure where they came from</li>
            <li> Which is what I usually experince after my showers.</li>
            <li> I have tried my inexpensive moisturizers and my expensive moisturizers with this soap, I received just about the same results from both</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t buy those expensive facial cleanser products anymore</li>
            <li> Oh well.. Trial and error per usual.</li>
            <li> I know a lot about chemical additives from my research over the past 11 years and this soap has a chemical additive in it somewhere.</li>
            <li> does it smell disgusting (think cheap tropical-scented bathroom freshener!)</li>
            <li> and I am not sure I want walk around smelling lady like.</li>
            <li> it can be a bit drying and messy and even stings at times, but it does help with breakouts!</li>
            <li> The sores got small and went away.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is 7 and breaks out with small pimples on her forehead.  </li>
            <li> It was still thick and heavy, but I could feel the layers.</li>
            <li> I noticed I was having small breakouts..</li>
            <li> The appearance of the soap made me say I&#x27;m not touching it.  </li>
            <li> a heavy brown/black color comes off the soap too!</li>
            <li> As a result, I was using an ordinary department store-bought face wash bar and</li>
            <li> As a result, I was using an ordinary department store-bought face wash bar and</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> So for the past 3 days I&#x27;ve used to soap alone in the shower opposed to using face wash, body wash, shampoo and bar</li>
            <li> and I broke out around my jaw line only which was weird because I&#x27;ve never broke out there before.</li>
            <li> I use them to avoid skin rash and excessive dryness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually used to break out a lot under my chin</li>
            <li> I would have still tried it on my skin though if I could have gotten past the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure why I tried something else anyway.</li>
            <li> It cleans the skin from blackheads, acne, small skin tags, eczema and</li>
            <li> Im not sure</li>
            <li> I first used this and thought the smell was weird, it looked weird</li>
            <li> As for my arms which have a &#x27;chicken skin&#x27; like feel, almost gone completely.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if I will use it again on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I noticed some people mentioned skin color in their reviews, I&#x27;m not sure why that matters</li>
            <li> Not sure I noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> Acne is very frustrating and to actually find a product that delivers results is a miracle.</li>
            <li> I would always have to scrub the tub after using this soap, being it black!!</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I have not experienced any irritation or burning sensations during/ after use.</li>
            <li> I suffer from skin dry enough that I sometimes fear it will flake off in giant sheets like something out of a horrible movie starring Brendan Fraser.</li>
            <li> I saw a slight difference immediately and have noticed lately that my skin is making a comeback!  </li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this soap, and was disappointed when it did not meet them.</li>
            <li> I went from around 20 active zits on my face on a daily basis to maybe 3 or 4 or on a bad day.</li>
            <li> I am now addicted to black soap.</li>
            <li> And I like that it has no high tech ingredients of questionable benefit.</li>
            <li> no biggie, it&#x27;s a bar soap afterall and AZ has really hard, chlorinated water.  </li>
            <li> Hard to explain.</li>
            <li> A little irritating for the skin.</li>
            <li> It has natural ingredients and didn&#x27;t do anything bad to my skin.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been getting some blackheads on my face.  </li>
            <li> If I stop using it at least once a day, the break outs from my roscea return.  </li>
            <li> When I used it, immediately afterwards my hands, which suffers from the occasional eczema, started to feel a bit irritated.</li>
            <li> Lye is a common soap ingredient.</li>
            <li> Lime is not so commonly used.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;When you are late</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a prissy person, you won&#x27;t like having this soap in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> It brought the &amp;#34;cream white&amp;#34; back to the dirty fiberglass shower</li>
            <li> So its extra work or the area looks dirty .</li>
            <li> Ladies, these soaps do not help with that at all; at least for me it did not.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a day, once in the morning and once at night to remove my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I also replaced my usual very expensive facial cleanser with this soap and it did wonders in removing my waterproof mascara and makeup!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for almost a year now (July 2012) and this sounds crazy, but I am still on the SAME BAR!</li>
            <li> at least judging by the reviews.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I was treated to a secondary heaping of maturity-circa-fifth-grade levels of giggles before I set it aside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it once around my hairline, to see if it would help w/ the oily-ness it gets in the late day from putting my fingers thru it all day.  </li>
            <li> It leaves brown soap scum wherever I set it.  </li>
            <li> Second, it lathers like crazy.</li>
            <li> Kinda annoying how fast they run out, but that&#x27;s just the nature of bar soap.</li>
            <li> and it was trying to slowly like vacate.  </li>
            <li> Well the eczema stopped itching and the discolorations are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> i could also make a mask with its thick lather on my face.</li>
            <li> It was thick and grainy feeling.</li>
            <li> This soap was slowly dripping onto my fiberglass shower.  </li>
            <li> My eczema is slowly going away.</li>
            <li> *** to slowly heal without damaging your skin.    </li>
            <li> I also lather thickly</li>
            <li> I have recently underwent chemo which left a very bad rash on my face.</li>
            <li> I live with psoriasis and it can be very uncomfortable and irritating at times.</li>
            <li> It has actually helped to reduce the appearance of my rosacea, which is truly unbelievable!!!!</li>
            <li> But, failing to meet a client&#x27;s minimal  expectations reeks of inefficientcy, speaks to poor time management skills, and translate into lossed revenue due to loss of unhappy customers.</li>
            <li> what can that mean?</li>
            <li> does this mean for a soap meant to help with breakouts?</li>
            <li> Gave me harsh rashes!!</li>
            <li> The other stuff I got had random sticks and rocks in it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;ll remind people to lotion everyday!!</li>
            <li> Like some other soap I reviewed, this soap is useless.</li>
            <li> I can already see a big diference in my acne which had gotten really bad over the past year</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this soap irritated my skin pretty badly.</li>
            <li> and I once had plenty of dark spots that weren&#x27;t too awful to look at and really noticeable</li>
            <li> my acne scars did not fade one bit, the one thing this soap did do was dry my face completely which was terrible</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me, try using this with coconut oil as a moisturizer and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> So far no change :(</li>
            <li> MY ACNE CONSIST OF VERY SMALL PIMPLES AND</li>
            <li> Been trying product after product and nothing seemed to help my excessive oily skin that suffered horrible breakouts and its even worse now that I&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
            <li> It is subtle.</li>
            <li> I am so serious.</li>
            <li> Seriously it lathers up</li>
            <li> have leave that feeling when showering, but this black piece of weird looking soap change everything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually afraid to run out and get anxious when I&#x27;m down to one bar.</li>
            <li> It really gets down and dirty with my skin, pulling lots of crap out.  </li>
            <li> , I had a pimple and silly me, I kept picking at and it resulted in a very dark spot on my face once it was gone.</li>
            <li> , I had a pimple and silly me, I kept picking at and it resulted in a very dark spot on my face once it was gone.</li>
            <li> I know everyone is different, but I a had bad experience.</li>
            <li> I still have a few dark spots but they are not as bad as they were.</li>
            <li> If you battle with bad skin I would definitely try this product.</li>
            <li> As a side note, it&#x27;s not actually a mud soap, which - my bad - I assumed it was.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t hurt so bad or turn so red after a while.  </li>
            <li> only bad thing about this soap is it stains your washcloths..</li>
            <li> Those bumps were red and painful.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD FOR PSORIASIS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with bad acnes for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> First of all it smells awful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used the bar as shampoo I was MISERABLE.</li>
            <li> Avoid artificial chemicals, dyes, fragrances, or other irritating ingredients.</li>
            <li> I ran into some horrible acne problems I first tried acne.org&#x27;s line, but began substituting this soap for their cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the worst acne I&#x27;ve ever had all over my chin that seemed like it would never go away, it left behind pink marks from almost every breakout I&#x27;ve had and</li>
            <li> now my face is dry and what I believe its doing is pulling all that bad stuff out</li>
            <li> i gave a bar to my girl friend and she has dry skin bad idea.</li>
            <li> so it functions well in that regard, but it is weird that the soapy water draining off your body is brown-colored, made me think wow, I&#x27;m really dirty!</li>
            <li> Black Soap is a gift from the f*cking creator.</li>
            <li> I gave up on it because it seemed to make my acne worse.</li>
            <li> ORDERED IT AND ACNE GOT WORSE.</li>
            <li> Mine is still totally broken out.    </li>
            <li> The soap has not made my skin worse, from what I can tell.</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun soap contains things like palm oil and shea butter which should help to reduce the burning that caustic substances can cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not rubbing my skin with the bar and causing unnecessary irritation.</li>
            <li> The soap might look unappealing, but it works quite well.</li>
            <li> I have teenagers who haven broken the bank with prescription acne creams....</li>
            <li> the scrub in the soap is worse than sand paper</li>
            <li> Maybe it could help that poor handicapped girl that I keep hearing of with her affliction.  </li>
            <li> but I have found that that (the drying) makes my acne worse.</li>
            <li> not happy with this at all</li>
            <li> I was really starting to hate the way my skin looked.</li>
            <li> and I have not experienced any irritation as some others have mentioned or skin dryness.</li>
            <li> I gave up on it because it seemed to make my acne worse.</li>
            <li> Also, every time I use it on my body, my skin gets really dry with ashy kinda look all over my fingers and toes :(.</li>
            <li> I dislike the sloppy feeling of moisturized skin after bathing, but if needed, I re-moisturize my skin after washing with this soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always had bad skin, the 1st two days of using black soap</li>
            <li> Anyways, I has a really bad breakout a couple of days previous to receiving the soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a week, and I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> so I am very serious about my skin care.</li>
            <li> the smell really bothered me :( disappointed .</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was absolutely miserable until my next days shower because it felt very heavy</li>
            <li> If I had anything bad to say is, it leaves my shower/tub dirty looking because of the color of the soap, but that&#x27;s no major thing for me.  </li>
            <li> Well, after a few days of using the soap the spots had cleared up and about 90 percent gone after one week of use.&lt;br /&gt;My son who is 2.5 has a lot of allergies and bad eczema.</li>
            <li> It dried her out bad.</li>
            <li> I will spare you the details, but needless to say my skin looks much worse than it did before.</li>
            <li> (it lathers up so creamy and thick, like cold cream)</li>
            <li> Overall, I hated the part when you&#x27;re done showering</li>
            <li> I have bad skin acne and this seams to tame it..</li>
            <li> I know other reviews talk about how it&#x27;s crap and that it burns</li>
            <li> It dried my skin but didn&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t the case, within a three month time period my face broke out a lot-  </li>
            <li> Needless to say when I use it, it fumes of my bathroom with a yummy scent.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this soap to begin with.</li>
            <li> Maybe those reviews are fake?    </li>
            <li> I have never bought expensive soap, but this makes you feel like you have.  </li>
            <li> WTF is it?</li>
            <li> there is even the slightest trace of chemicals in products (food or lotions and soaps, etc), I tend to get really ill.</li>
            <li> so this seemed weird to me.</li>
            <li> If others use the shower after you I guarantee as soon as they get in they will think WTF?</li>
            <li> as skeptical as I was, thought what do I have to lose!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &quot; so I was convinced I&#x27;d found the secret!</li>
            <li> WRONG...</li>
            <li> Never go wrong with Dudu-Osun brand.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wear oil base make up anymore everyday.</li>
            <li> Used it for a week on my face and then notice my boyfriend secretly started using my soap because he noticed a change in my skin...will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it irritated my skin and does not exfoliate as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves stains everywhere and smells weird.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately th.is soaps not for me</li>
            <li> though I was wrong with the feeling.</li>
            <li> The smell is... weird.</li>
            <li> but i was wrong.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Oh silly me,&amp;#34; I said, &amp;#34;George</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews of this soap, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> , we were a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> The reason I have the 4 stars is the problem of actually keeping the soap from dripping this nasty brown color all over my shower.</li>
            <li> when I opened the box the smell made me gag unfortunately</li>
            <li> Sorry folks...</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like random fragrances on your skin, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> just be wary of the packaging the bars come in.</li>
            <li> This soap is sort of useless.</li>
            <li> If you have oily or angry skin, this is for you.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are obsessed with this soap.  </li>
            <li> This product is rendered useless without some form of exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was unable to use it every day on my face.</li>
            <li> but sadly it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and you have a black, dirty looking tub!!</li>
            <li> After showering with the black soap my skin was ashen and in worst shape.</li>
            <li> Some worked, but they were terribly drying to my skin and caused extreme flakiness in some cases.</li>
            <li> I have some discoloration due to years of acne (I&#x27;m 25) and the scars are the worst part of it all.</li>
            <li> Not just five or six blackheads, but colonies of the evil little bastards.     </li>
            <li> I bought this after desperately trying to search for something that would help me get rid of the acne I have been getting around my jaw line.  </li>
            <li> artificial colours  </li>
            <li> Tell everyone you know that suffers from skin problems that this the soap to try.</li>
            <li> I recommended this product to a friend of mine who suffers from eczema and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Or should I say \\&quot;cold cream\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It looks terrible too, and messy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i was so disappointment</li>
            <li> I had a terrible hormone inbalance a few months after having my son.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I won&#x27;t buy it again unless they remove the artificial fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to like it also because it gets rid of those pesky &#x27;chicken bumps&#x27; you have on your arms.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and just be warned the water looks dirty when you lather</li>
            <li> Was afraid to buy this soap because I didnt want to be duped</li>
            <li> I thought I was going crazy</li>
            <li> When washing your face rinse with cold</li>
            <li> Before the breakout, I always had these small, nondescript bumps that could be popped (the puss smelled horrible) on my cheeks, forehead, and on/around my nose.</li>
            <li> I have a hormonal disorder and one of the external manifestations is terrible, terrible acne.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be a bad soap if it didn&#x27;t bleed all over the place &amp; leave residue in the bathtub.</li>
            <li> day I discovered that my sulfur soap was gone, and I had a bad breakout on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t suffer from bad acne.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this soap I haven&#x27;t had a bad eczema out break in years</li>
            <li> I  have nothing bad to say about these soaps, I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
            <li> Both my sister and I had at one point some really bad acne that disappeared with time.</li>
            <li> this not help in nothing my psorasis bad idea to buy this soap</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t that bad at all</li>
            <li> she had really bad skin</li>
            <li> It broke me out so bad</li>
            <li> I have bad eczema on my arms and neck.</li>
            <li> but this time I thought, &amp;#34;how bad can it be?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 out of 5, because Since I&#x27;ve been using it my face has improved and I don&#x27;t break outs as bad as I once used to.</li>
            <li> I was itching so bad I was bleeding.</li>
            <li> I have been so frustrated with my acne and oily skin for years, and have tried just about every acne product on the market that swears results through advertising.</li>
            <li> If you have any irritations anywhere, this soap will tingle a bit, almost like an antiseptic, it is nothing I find painful</li>
            <li> I know have 4 bars :(</li>
            <li> didnt help my acne :(</li>
            <li> It was recommended by a friend for my daughter hormonal acne, but she is afraid to use it!  </li>
            <li> and I promise you that you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed that after using this product for three weeks, I haven&#x27;t noticed a measurable change in my skin tone or acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This soap made my skin burn, not to mention it stinks!</li>
            <li> The fragrance reminded me of a bathroom cleaner :(</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed of this</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t terrible to look at but was inconvenient.</li>
            <li> others hate it.  </li>
            <li> hate writing a review</li>
            <li> I hate soap that contains nonessential ingredients, whether it be fragrance, chemicals, or whatever it is.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as bad as before!  </li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t got rid of the horrible acne it gave me :(</li>
            <li> It burns very bad, or maybe I&#x27;m just a baby.  </li>
            <li> They can be very painful.</li>
            <li> I had acne and terrible skin and tried everything.  </li>
            <li> It is cloying and awful, but thankfully it fades just like the skid</li>
            <li> Resulting in terrible acne.</li>
            <li> terrible!</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible!  </li>
            <li> I had a terrible zit that had been lingering for a couple of weeks and was relentless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible acne issues since I was in 7th grade, I&#x27;m talking unpopable, under the skin, sore, raised, scar-causing, pimples.</li>
            <li> It was horrible and I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.</li>
            <li> Dries you out, very badly!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the worst.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have horrible skin problems but stuff that is noticeable to me.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible breakout from this soap.</li>
            <li> This was a awful experience.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t awful</li>
            <li> , if you get this, understand that it will leave a filmy, nasty looking residue in your shower.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thick lather, awesome smell, cleans well.  Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Package arrived really fast. Everything was intact. This soap has a awesome light scent. Gives my skin a radiant glow, help clear up dark marks and leaves skin soft and smooth. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Truly helps clear up skin and acne!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had skin issues and breakouts since I was a teen...now in my 40&#x27;s I thought it would go away but I still struggle with problematic skin. I tried this soap due to the reviews and the fact it&#x27;s all natural ingredients. I&#x27;ve never written a review before but with my results I have been telling everyone I know. After using it for a few weeks daily my skin and back are 100% clear!! My husband couldn&#x27;t believe it was just from using this soap only...but it is! It does dry out your skin so I need to moisturize my face after but aside from that it&#x27;s a wonder...and for the price well it&#x27;s just rediculous! Please try this if you&#x27;ve struggled with skin issues your whole life like me.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I can&#x27;t use most soap but this is one of the few. It keeps my skin moist all day. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Our new favorite soap.  This is a great deal for four bars of the soap!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read such great reviews about African Black soap, and I was looking forward to seeing much clearer skin. Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t the case, within a three month time period my face broke out a lot-  in areas where I never saw breakouts. I will spare you the details, but needless to say my skin looks much worse than it did before. I stopped using the soap, and gave the three bars away. I know everyone is different, but I a had bad experience.</li>
            <li> I have always love black it never let me down Thanks</li>
            <li> Well.a bit smaller than I was looking forward but the quality is guaranteed</li>
            <li> A woman had walked up to me in a parking lot and diagnose my skin on the spot; she said try this soap... I was hesitant, but my mother said it&#x27;s probably good. Well, i have been trying ever since and my skin is clearer and improving tremendously from the state my skin was in. Yes, the acne, oil, the marks are dwindling away. I usually by a set of this soap. It works for me, so it may not work for some, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my sister and she says she loves it. It&#x27;s a 4 star because it doesn&#x27;t do everything it claims to do</li>
            <li> Awesome product, leaves my skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> First time buyer, so I may augment rating, to reflect overall performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far;&lt;br /&gt;1. SMELL FANTASTIC&lt;br /&gt;2. VERY POTENT CLEANSING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is SO potent i would not recommend using it daily, because it &amp;#34;MAY&amp;#34; strip you of needed moisture. Perhaps 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also; Do not recommend using, following any type of dermal/follicle shaving/peeling agents (IT&#x27;S THAT POTENT(or maybe It&#x27;s me)).</li>
            <li> Fast shipment!! I tried the soap last night and so far so good. I&#x27;m excited to see the results. I&#x27;m recommending the soap to my friends with problematic skin. Hoping the soap will bring wonders to their skin too. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this soap. I can already see a big diference in my acne which had gotten really bad over the past year It has only been about 3 weeks and dark spots are also fading ! ... Regimen:  I remove my makeup with Coconut oil , wash with this African Black Soap (2 times), Use Witch Hazel as a toner and use a small bit of sea butter as a moisturizer. I just ordered more of this soap because I also use a bar for my 4 year old that has eczema. Just wash with this and put shea butter on him afterwards, Im seeing a diffrence and he isnt complaining about itching at night!!!!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Finally I have a {MCS} Multiple Chemical Sensitivity User Friendly Soap to Use. I&#x27;m in, this is now my Soap of Choice! K</li>
            <li> The smell weird, look ugly, but I feel good after use</li>
            <li> This soap has one of the best lathers that I have ever seen. I like the smell, it isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> Bought this wonderfully scented soap to give to family because it keeps skin smooth and soft. My aunt loved it.</li>
            <li> It has evened out my skin, and I have given away two bars to people who told me my skin looks wonderful!  Does not turn my tub black, as I read other reviews say it does.  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is only my 2nd day using the soap so that&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars. Thanks to the great reviews I read about it; I decided to give it a try.  Lately I&#x27;ve been getting some blackheads on my face.  Not sure where they came from but I thought that stage of my life was over.  Anyways for about 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been using some Neutrogena products that I purchased and it got rid of all the black heads but left me with a few black spots that I want to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed the soap leaves my skin very dry so I&#x27;m back on Amazon to see what I can find to put on my face after using the soap.  I noticed one reviewer mentioned the coconut papaya soap and rose water so I&#x27;m about to look into it.  Also I don&#x27;t put the soap directly on my face either.  I lather it up in my hands and apply it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the product for a few weeks and then I&#x27;ll come back with an update.  By the way the soap smells wonderful.  Honestly, before I took it out the box I could smell the aroma coming from it.  Needless to say when I use it, it fumes of my bathroom with a yummy scent.</li>
            <li> this soap is awesome, it does dry ur skin after use but just use a good moisturizer {I use nadinola} and you&#x27;re all set. it definitely takes care of blemishes....I even use it to bathe! awesome!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it works well with me.  I gave some to my family members and all like it as well.  Good items to keep in stock.</li>
            <li> Unlike other Black soap you find online these days, this soap is the real deal. Very strong and well made. Great value for the price. I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician so I am very serious about my skin care. This is the perfect daytime and evening cleanser for every day use.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing but leaves wash clothes stained with brown color.</li>
            <li> Soap is great to balance skin, esp oily skin.  Also easy transaction with quick shipping!!  Would purchase from again.</li>
            <li> I am an Asian. Every now and then I always get breakout/acne on my face. so, I decided to buy the soap after I read so many good reviews people wrote about it.I use it for several times, but then I&#x27;ve decided to discontinue using the product. The soap is too harsh for my face, followed with a burning sensation after ( I don&#x27;t put the soap directly on my face/body, I always use face towel and shower puff). Also, every time I use it on my body, my skin gets really dry with ashy kinda look all over my fingers and toes :(. I was hoping that I could enjoy this product just like the others who have been given good review about it, but my skin &#x27;says&#x27; otherwise.</li>
            <li> OK... so I always knew black soap was the best but never tried it until I purchased on Amazon.com... Let me testify &#x27;Dudu Osun&#x27; is the best soap ever. I have used for about 3 weeks and love it! I have dreadlocks so the organic elements of the soap work wonderfully to clean mi locks :) As for blemishes and tone... works GREAT too! Just ordered shea butter today with a double shipment of the Dudu soap ;) can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> This is a good cleansing soap, but it really dries out your skin after cleansing with this soap.  I&#x27;d recommend this soap, but perhaps only once per day or skip using it every other day for those of you who have dry skin.  If you have oily skin, you can use it every time you wash your face/body.  After I use this soap, I try to moisturize face/body pretty well, but since my skin is on the dry side, it&#x27;s still drying out my skin even with shea butter.  This would be very good if it does not dry out my skin.  This soap is like a regular soap, so any ethnic background can use it. If you wash out well, none of your towels will have any residue.  Also, when you wash your hair with this soap, you will need to follow-up with your regular shampoo or conditioner; otherwise, your hair will feel very rough even if you use argan oil afterwards.  This is good for cleansing your scalp and won&#x27;t make your hair smooth unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for 9 months now and have decided a long time ago that this would be the ONLY soap I would use for as long as they keep making it.     Here is what I&#x27;ve noticed after using this every day for my body and twice a day for my face: My skin complexion is very even and the look and feel of it is very smooth. I believe the evening of the skin tone is due to the lime juice as it&#x27;s acidic and typically that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s good for. I have also noticed that during that time of the month when I would break out on my face, the pimples don&#x27;t stay around for more than 2 days. It also TIGHTENS your skin and SHRINKS your pores. One of my sisters confessed that she would always stare at my skin trying to figure out what I was using to make it look the way it did. She now uses this soap and has ordered 6 bars.    I&#x27;m actually afraid to run out and get anxious when I&#x27;m down to one bar. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else!    Also, I LOVE the smell of it. It&#x27;s a strong fragrance, but a pleasant one. I keep my unopened bars in a tightly closed bag and locked away in a drawer in the bedroom otherwise the whole room will smell like it. When I want to freshen the room I just keep the bag open for a few minutes then put it away. It&#x27;s THAT strong.    I purchase mine from a seller on eBay but really want to review it for those who purchase on Amazon. Don&#x27;t let the name or look of it put you off. It truly is an amazing beauty secret.</li>
            <li> I really like this natural soap!  Bar dries quickly after shower or bath, shape holds up, rinses clean.  We&#x27;re all different, my experience may not be the same as the next person.  Am I happy with this product..yes!</li>
            <li> The smell is WONDERFUL!  I was so excited by just the smell of this soap, I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is odd to see dark suds when you lather up with this soap, but you get over that quickly (well, except my husband, he hates it because it leaves a mess in the soap dish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and that was my biggest concern.  And again, the smell is just incredible!  This is my first purchase, but I will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> fragrance is so overpowering, I didn&#x27;t even unwrap the soap before I decided I had to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Great soap, helped me get cleAr skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this soap to begin with. Shortly after my 2nd bar I started to notice how it made my skin blend and scares seem lighter. So now Im down to only a few crumbs of a bar and will we be reordering soon.</li>
            <li> So I literally just got mines in the mail. Prior to opening I was a bit upset due to the packaging.  I had read many reviews stating this soap should be kept away from water because it can dissolve pretty fast. So you would think the seller would had packaged it better so in case of weather. Well it was pouring rain yesterday guess there was water in mailbox and I was at work til 230 so it just sat in water most of day it went thru the package and even the soaps I was scared my product melted away. So shipping package could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the actual product review.  My nephew was next to me as I was opening and he made a comment Wow auntie whatever is in there smells really good ... lol I had to agree it smelled a bit zesty but fresh smell alone sold me. I was pleased to see the soaps was not damaged or wasted.  Took the 2 that soap packaging was more affected by and laid it on a plate to air dry used 1 of them to immediately wash my makeup off and I must say because of all the review talk about the soap may sting due to the lemon extract I didn&#x27;t feel that at all. I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m Hispanic and I have used many types of products and masks in my past maybe I developed  non-sensitive skin. Now as soon as I washed off soap it felt so clean like no residue feeling left after I dried my face with a soft cloth I noticed my skin felt very soft. It didn&#x27;t feel so drying as I anticipated maybe its because its just my 1st time but I used a oil free moisturizer from neutrogena best kind for me due combination/oily skin . SO for now I gave it a 4 I may come back after 2wks of using to get a full result review because I purchased this because I never had a bad acne problem growing up and as I got older i barely had breakouts now I&#x27;m 35 and its like all of a sudden puberty hit! They have calmed down a bit since I bought Indian Healing Clay which by the way I saw on here on Amazon read all the reviews and I was determined to try then turns out my new BF uses it andhe told me it helped so I was sold by his experience but I bought it at Whole Foods Store in the beauty dept,  NOW he is the one that told me about Dudu Osun soap and after reading the reviews here I was sold and made my order.</li>
            <li> I have a hormonal disorder and one of the external manifestations is terrible, terrible acne.  I went from having clear, perfect, glowing skin, to dry, pimply skin, with lots of black marks in a short period of time.  Within two weeks of using Dudu-Osun, my skin looked better than it has in the past year.  It&#x27;s been about a month and it has significantly controlled my breakouts, giving my skin a chance to heal and black marks to fade.  I HIGHLY recommend this product for acne sufferers.  It took my skin about 3 days to get used to it and sometimes it seems harsh, but it has worked better than ANYTHING I&#x27;ve tried in the past year--and that includes expensive chemical peels, microderm abrasions, proactiv, clinique, etc.</li>
            <li> Great new take on soap!</li>
            <li> I ordered the product on Sunday, 02/28/2010...And I received my package two days later....I was so excited because I paid standard and was not expecting the package to come until the following week...I bought this soap after some heavy research to cure my ongoing problem of a mild case of eczema. I saw some great reviews and thought why not try it....I used it for the first time today and it made my eczema patches super dry,but it did not itch. Which is what I usually experince after my showers. In the beginning many ppl have some slight side effect but they will subside eventually..I hope that this is true since I brought four of them...lol..Nevertheless I will continue to use..If its not the product for me..I am satisfied with how quickly I received my package</li>
            <li> I will always buy this item its really does wonders for my skin</li>
            <li> Love this soap it smells so good and really helps with acne.</li>
            <li> First of all it smells awful. I have a pretty sensitive nose and I could smell it before I even opened the package...even though the soap is in its own boxes and was in a bag inside of the big box! Smells really masculine too. But since I had read so many amazing reviews I thought I would give it a try anyway, despite it stinking up my entire bathroom. I used a whole bar and didn&#x27;t notice any difference except my skin being drier and tighter (not in a good way). It also stained the soap holder in my shower. Will be throwing away the other 3 bars. Bummed!</li>
            <li> LOVE dude osun! Converted many family members by just glowing in my beautiful skin!</li>
            <li> a very decent so. However raw african black soap tends to be a better grade of soap. This soap is more commercially processed the convenience is that you have no foreign particles within yourself. I also find the soap makes more of a mess than the raw african black soap. I do like that you can actually use as soap directly on your face without the worry stuff scratches but the downside is I do find this soap in particular makes more a baby black residue mess upon using it I believe it to be just as useful as the others so just more process so I tend to like to have the raw african black soap better.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this soap is how long it lasts. I bought this pack 5 months ago and I&#x27;m still on the first bar and it&#x27;s only lost about half its volume! I purchased this soap because I started to break out after having my son. But I haven&#x27;t seen a difference. There hasn&#x27;t really been any improvement. I don&#x27;t want to blame the soap for that, but I guess my expectation was higher based on the reviews and recommendations from people I know. Also, if you buy this soap, make sure you buy face lotion too (I bought CeraVe lotion) because it will dry out your face. Especially the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li> My fav soap.  Kinda annoying how fast they run out, but that&#x27;s just the nature of bar soap. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about 4 years now. The very first time anyone tries it, there will always be a burning sensation. Your skin has to get used to it for a couple of days. But the major problem is the fact that many people are using a cloth towel/ shower puff to apply the product. Never do that. I also made that mistake during the first couple of months of my use. I gave up on it because it seemed to make my acne worse. However after watching a youtube video about this soap, I learned that not using a cloth to apply the soap on you skin is key for the soap to work. Try using your hands instead (like I do). It really makes such a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the soap for a three weeks.  It&#x27;s really messy.  It smells good.  I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll ordered it again.  I&#x27;ve used Nubian Heritage black soap and really liked it.</li>
            <li> leaves black color all over your tub and disintegrates fast</li>
            <li> I love this soap. My Fiance told me about it because I was having problems with pimples popping up out of no where on my face and then they would take forever to go away. I&#x27;ve tried proactive and a couple of other products I bought from Wal-mart which did not help. This soap works better and faster and its CHEAPER which i&#x27;m sure everyone can appreciate. The name is a bit strange but overlook that because the results speak for themselves.   God bless</li>
            <li> This shiz burns my who-ha!</li>
            <li> Smells good, gets you nice and clean. Helps me with my body acne a little.  doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and rinses off clean.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I&#x27;ve had acne for almost 15 years. I thought once I got in to adulthood, it would go away, but it only got worse. I&#x27;ve tried every brand imaginable: Clinique, Clean and Clear, Proactiv, Neutrogena, Zapzyt, etc. Some worked, but they were terribly drying to my skin and caused extreme flakiness in some cases. I had heard about African Black Soap, and decided to give it a try; I am so happy I did. This stuff makes your skin squeaky clean without stripping you of all the moisture in your skin. It gets every last ounce of makeup off; even the most stubborn mascara wipes away easily with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve started using it, my skin tone has evened out and I only get hormonal breakouts now. My boyfriend even started using it for the acne around his shoulders and back, and has had great results. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I got this soap because I have read and also watch YOUTUBE videos on reviews of the soap I have used it for three days n my glow is back and I have been gettin compliments from usin the soap , BUT one thing I do not apperciate is the fact I ordered 4 bars of soap and two were OPEN like come on! All products must be sealed ! So that was my only problem</li>
            <li> We have really noticed an improvement in all of my family&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> One swipe of this stuff and you&#x27;re squeaky clean. Really cuts down on shower time. I dropped it and it left a black mark on the bathroom carpet, it&#x27;s soap so it comes right out, but still a little perturbing. Not enough to make me stop buying it though... Love this soap!</li>
            <li> Excellent lather and feel. Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin. Nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The soap is really good, use it on my face which had pimples but I&#x27;ve noticed a very significant difference. though dont scrub too hard with it, leaves you squeaky clean</li>
            <li> I will never buy anything else for my face, only Dudu-Osun!</li>
            <li> So far so good; I have tried most acne treatments out there (Clean and Clear), but this seems to be working out of all that I have done to contain my acne problem. Hasn&#x27;t got rid of all of my pimples and blackheads, but basically most of them. I grew up with acne from junior high to college so this soap is a great improvement for me.</li>
            <li> Brown silk is only one way I can described Dudu Osun soap. I am a dark skinned African American woman with oily skin who has had acne breakouts for 45 of my 55 years. Also, due to extreme sun exposure (I live in sunny Southern California), I experienced unattractive discoloration. My face, neck,fore-arms and hands are MUCH darker than the rest of my body. YUCK.  In the pass, I&#x27;ve tried skin lightening cream which would even my skin tone somewhat. But due to the Hydroquinone (sp) controversy , I stop using it all together. I thought I was doom to have miss mactched-tone skin forever.     While surfing the \\&quot;net\\&quot;, I came across a comment about DUDU OSUN Black soap that was so inspiring. I decided to research this product further. I was pleased to discover that this soap contains natural ingredients so I ordered 3 bars.    After receiving my order (within a couple of short days), I put it to the test that afternoon. All I can say is for the next 20 minutes (while in the shower), I was in BROWN SUDS HEAVEN.  The lather is abundant and the fragrance is like no other.... very pleasant. A little bit goes a long way. But I&#x27;ve discovered that after showering, the bar should be kept in a separate, dry place.     I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a little over one month, and I say in all honesty that I have no use for any other face, hand, or body soap other than Dudu Osun Black soap. I haven&#x27;t had ONE pimple, my skin tone is beginning to even out and my skin texture has never been softer.    I also use the Raw Unrefined African Shea Butter for an after shower moisturizer.  The products work wonderfully alone, but when used together, the results (IMO) are AMAZING. Well, they are for me, anyway.</li>
            <li> It took me a week to get use to the smell of the soap but now I like the smell.  The soap itself is really good.  For two people one bar only last about 1.5 weeks, showering every day.  I use a lot of different natural bar soaps and this is one of my favorites.  Will continue to buy and use.  I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  Very few break outs if I use it daily on my face.  If I stop using it at least once a day, the break outs from my roscea return.  I use it to shower as well.</li>
            <li> Just a brief note about this soap.  From the picture the soap looks black.  It is really a dark brown soap with flecks of tan and lighter brown.  It had a definite hand-made look.  The bar is a good size and the color looks like the other samples of black soap you may see that are square or odd shaped.  I will review again after use. Update after use:  Excellent soap.  It does have a brown residue if you leave it in the soap dish.  I have used it on my hair and it is wonderful!  Leaves my hair soft and manageable.  My hair is tightly coiled-kinky and this soap makes it so easy to comb.  Good for the skin leaving it soft and comfortable.  Combined with the Shea butter, you will love your skin and hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this after desperately trying to search for something that would help me get rid of the acne I have been getting around my jaw line.  I tried everything and it was always there! I bought this product and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. When you use it you feel very clean and your face is soft. I use a mosturizer right after because my face feels slightly tight if not.   This has done wonders for my face. I have not had any new breakouts, my old ones are clearing up quite a bit and there is really only one little stubborn part left.  I just used tea tree essential oil on that last night and I am thinking that I am going to have an adult face for once!!! I can&#x27;t wait to share this with my family. For the price you cannot beat this... anyone that has acne problem as an adult will try just about everything. I love this product. Let&#x27;s just say if that if they took this off the market I would pull a version of the Seinfeld episode with the Sponges. ;)</li>
            <li> i decided to give this soap a whirl after so many positive reviews. I have sensitive skin, and was quite conservative with it at first, only using it for showers.. my skin really liked the natural properties, and i would come out of the shower truly feeling clean.    i tried it on my face, and liked the results as well.      Unfortunately, my boyfriend who has REALLY sensitive skin didn&#x27;t fare too well.  after using the soap for about 2 weeks, (which is great because other soaps caused rashes within a day or two), we noticed red welts on his abdomen and legs.  he thought it was a mild sunburn at first.. We realized it was the soap.  After he stopped using it, the rash went away in about a day.    Thus, if you feel a slight \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; as he described while using the soap, please be aware that this might the beginning of a mild allergic reaction.    i, myself, will continue using it, because i&#x27;ve received quite a few compliments on my skin in general..</li>
            <li> I found this soap to be messy and still have an extra bar or two that I have yet to unwrap to use. It did nothing to help clear my complexion of dark or pigmentation spots. Some people swear by it I kinda found it messy and swore at it:))) It&#x27;s one of those items that some love and some don&#x27;t. As far as cleaning I think it did a fair job of that. I&#x27;ll eventually use it up in the shower but I thought it was a tad drying over all too. Maybe it&#x27;s suppose to be and  in my younger very oily skin years that would have been wonderful. Today the oil&#x27;s gone and I&#x27;d rather have some moisturizing. Do I think it works for some....as they claim...probably. I&#x27;ve had great results with products others don&#x27;t and vice versa which is one reason we get to talk shop and review these products here on Amazon. Thanks Amazon..for printing both the good and the bad.</li>
            <li> The produce as far as I am concern does not work, it is messy leave soap film worse then regular soap/ plus it irritated the face. I would not recommend this produce to anyone. Is up to you, if you want to throw your money away, then buy the black soap.[[ASIN:B0023A7JF4 Dudu-osun African Black Soap (100% Pure) Pack of 4]]</li>
            <li> I like this soap a lot. I have very sensitive skin, but I never had any irritation issues that other users have mentioned. I have not used this with a loffah, I just rub it vigorously and it makes a really rich white lather. Do not get upset by the brown coloring that comes off, it does not stain. Makes my skin feel squeaky clean without over drying!</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product after I was reading the suggestions from a forum, the women on that forum had recommended African Black Soap for dryness and etc.  I am barely in my thirties but I had noticed that my skin was getting drier and drier.  I didn&#x27;t like that because I love my glow and it was trying to slowly like vacate.  I had ordered this soap because it was a good deal to be honest, I mean four bars of soap for ten dollars is a bargain no matter what kind of soap it is.  Anyways, I tried it the first night and it cleansed my face as good as a exfoliator without the harshness.  I woke up the next morning to my skin being very luminous, my husband had commented on my skin also so that is saying alot. I&#x27;m a skeptic so I wanted to make sure that it would continue to work days later before I made my decision if this was a wonderful product.  Surprise! My skin has continued to get better and better by day and night.  This soap really helps to improve the performance of your moisturizers.  I have tried my inexpensive moisturizers and my expensive moisturizers with this soap, I received just about the same results from both so I know it is the soap that is helping.  Also I had a blackhead that was very noticeable but I couldn&#x27;t remove it without injuring my skin, it has totally vanished without there being any trace that it had ever existed. I would recommend this to my friends and my enemies because this is a product that every woman should use as part of her regimen.  Lastly, I&#x27;m not affiliated with this company at all.  I don&#x27;t do reviews at all but I had to do this one.  Remember this is a product that is made in Africa by the African women, the women in Africa do have some of the most beautiful skin in the world.</li>
            <li> Smells super, mildly exfoliating.  When used before shaving legs, I get a super smooth, close shave every time.  My husband also likes this soap, and says he feels like his skin is cleaner than with many other soaps.  He also uses instead of shaving cream when shaving his head.&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star because it leaves a yucky black residue in my shower.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST SOAP I HAVE EVER USED (I AM 58)&lt;br /&gt;THE SMELL IS LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED MAKES MY WHOLE BATHROOM SMELL NICE&lt;br /&gt;THE CLEAN IS FANTASTIC&lt;br /&gt;HIGH QUALITY</li>
            <li> This soap makes you feel squeaky clean without drying your skin.  Love it, and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I used this soap for over 4 months and loved it! Great quality soap that lasts forever! I got 4 bars and each bar lasted me a month or so.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have strong smell, like sulfur, but also effective.</li>
            <li> My mom got me into using this soap for other reason then my face. I tried it on my face and it has helped my acne so much!!! My complexion looks amazing too. I work at  Wendys and I get so many compliments on my complexion. If you have acne and trying to find a good soap without having to spend so much, this is the product for you. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> great product already starting to fade scars in combination with the 100% PURE SHEA BUTTER</li>
            <li> ORDERED IT AND ACNE GOT WORSE. NOT TO SURE IF THE DUDU IS ULTIMATLEY TO BLAME BUT I HAD TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THAT AND JUMP ON MY NEUTROGENA BODY CLEAR BODY WASH. I LL CHECK BACK ON THE DUDU IN A COUPLE WEEKS AND SEE IF IT STILL GIVES ME ITCHY SKIN AND BREAK OUTS.IT SMELLS REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD THO. MY GOSH. I LOVE THE SMELL. WORKS WELL AS HAIR SHAMPOOO, AND IT DOESNT STAIN MY WASH CLOTHS??!!?!? I THINK SOME OF YOU GUYS SHOULD STOP BLAMING DUDU ON YOUR DOODOO LOL!</li>
            <li> I really wish I could give this an enthusiastic review, because that would mean that it actually worked for me. I have terrible facial acne and have tried absolutely everything under the sun to treat it for the past six years (Proactiv, Acne Free, other salicylic or benzoyl peroxide producs, Retin-A, antibiotics, taking Zinc tablets, drinking apple cider vinegar, applying tea tree oil, sulfur masks, homemade honey and lemon juice masks)...everything works at first, but soon becomes ineffective.    I figured that since everything I&#x27;ve tried is pretty much equally ineffective, I&#x27;d just stick to a natural routine. So now my routine is the following: morning: Dudu-osun soap to wash the face, mask of raw or clover honey and fresh lemon juice for 30 minutes, tea tree oil. Night: Dudu-osun, tea tree oil, and sulphur clay mask before bed. Anyone else&#x27;s skin would be glowing!! Mine is still totally broken out.    But the soap smells nice and lathers well, considering it&#x27;s natural and has no sulfates. The soap has not made my skin worse, from what I can tell. It just won&#x27;t cure my acne or lighten my acne scars, which is what other reviewers rave about. Maybe those reviews are fake?    Anyway, three stars for a nice natural soap...no miracles here, though.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter had moderately bad acne and over the years the different medications from the doctor never worked. Neither did the pricey or not so pricey OTC formulas. I read about this product looking for more help for her and since the price of this soap was extremely reasonable, I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it. After a while I noticed that her face was fresher and more clear and I asked her what she was doing. She said she had been using the African black soap and her skin almost totally cleared up with only an occasional small breakout here and there. Although it made an improvement right away, it took a month or so to totally clear up her skin, but it did and she is hooked. Her skin has been lovely for a few months now. I am going to start my other daughter on it to see if it helps her also.   The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell, but I am sensitive to smells and my daughter doesn&#x27;t mind it at all. But the price is not bad to find out if your are sensitive to the smell or not, because the SOAP WORKS on getting rid of acne.  Bottom line: This is a wonderful product for acne problems and it is reasonably priced. And it is supposed to be a natural product with no chemicals. BUY IT!   I will update the product after my other daughter starts using it.</li>
            <li> Nice product! It appears that the ingredients have the ability to promote skin growth.  The Dudu-osun African Black Soap definitely makes my skin feel a little stronger than normal and it lasts longer than my other soaps. I have seen &amp; felt better soaps, but this one is in my top 3!    K. Royalle</li>
            <li> the soap has a very nice different distinct fragrance. i bought it to see if it could clear up and relieve the weird skin condition i have on my arms which can itch from time to time. well so far i have not used it much and am about done with the first bar, but it seems to leave the skin really smooth. and the spots and small pimple like grains seems to be receding somewhat into the skin...but who knows how effective it will be in the end when i used the 4 pack i bought. hopefully it treats it completely! whish me luck....</li>
            <li> Skin is looking so refreshed and acne has improved so much</li>
            <li> Removed long time scars.</li>
            <li> i feel clean after using this soap.  dove makes me feel sticky). smells nice, and the color is exotic.  solid shape.</li>
            <li> I have tried many things in my 29 yrs for mild acne,proactive was my last thing i researched this soap and never ever heard about it before after reading the reviews i decided why not give it a try.I did shipping was fast and as soon as i got it i tried it out it smells great and left my skin soft and squeaky clean ive never tryed anything like it i use pure shea butter after for a moisturizer my skin has never felt better...I will post another review after a couple of weeks of use!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this soap so far! It leaves my skin very soft and smooth and I have noticed some old marks starting to fade away. I will definitely buy so more after I open my last bar out of the this box.</li>
            <li> It cleans you... that&#x27;s about it</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good soap for my acne and sensitive skin. Artificial perfumes tend to break me out in hives, but naturally scented soap can be a little pricey sometimes. I had heard good things about African Black Soap and after perusing Amazon I decided on the Dudu-Osun Black Soap by Tropical Naturals. I was extremely skeptical because the top review at the time of my purchase claimed that using the soap vanished stretch marks. However, after about a month of using this soap I can say that it is an almost miraculous product. My acne is gone, I have had no breakouts or irritated skin, and my stretchmarks are noticeably lighter and smaller! It will probably take a while for them to fully disappear, but this soap did more in a month for my stretchmarks than three years of expensive oils and lotions. The scent is light and pleasant, and it creates a thick lather. I DO NOT recommend it for use near your &amp;#34;sensitive areas&amp;#34;, because it tends to sting and burn, everywhere else on the skin is fine, though.</li>
            <li> Ok I don&#x27;t know what to say about Dudu Osun except I LOVE It!!!!! I&#x27;ve been using this soap for the past 2 months &amp; as an individual w/ combination skin (oily &amp; blemish prone) this has become a Life-Saver. I&#x27;m an African-American female who tends to have hyper-pigmentation along the chin and sides of my face, well in the past 2 months I&#x27;ve seen improvement as acne scars and dark spots are fading (Yay). I like to use Dudu Osun in combination w/ Shea-Butter, which for some reason is a Power-Pack when it comes to skin care/treatment. What I like most about this soap is that I can use it on my entire ody w/out irritation....it&#x27;s the best!  So this was my first time ordering Dudu Osun via Amazon, well as expected from past ordering experiences....everything went smoothly, so smooth that my soap came a day early, which was so perfect since I had a sliver of a piece left and when I say sliver I mean sliver (lol). Ok so I&#x27;m going to stop rambling, but please if you have any problems w/ skin, such as rash, acne, blemishes, dark spots, etc please give Dudu Osun a shot, I&#x27;m not a professional nor can I guarantee that my results will be the same for you, but trust me its worth a shot!</li>
            <li> very good very fast thank you</li>
            <li> Works well, leaves skin feeling clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and it is miraculous!! I have always had bad skin, the 1st two days of using black soap I wasn&#x27;t sure if I made a good choice my skin would have a burning sensation and would slightly peel but I guess that was just my skin getting used to the product. My skin is now silky to the touch and my dark spots are visibly fading I also use REAL shea butter right after I wash my face I also use this soap on my body I won&#x27;t go back to any other soap.</li>
            <li> However, I will NEVER use another soap again! I&#x27;ve had off and on problems with back and chest acne for a while, and nothing has helped diminish it like Dudu Osun African Black Soap! I still use a cream for any small blemishes I get, but this soap has taken care of most of them! I gave this product 4 stars only because it is very drying for my skin. A good moisturizer should help though.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, makes a great gift, leaves skin feeling soft and lathers up very well.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful. I enjoy the smell -- it smells &#x27;natural&#x27;, clean, and light. It doesn&#x27;t perfume your skin so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it interfering with cologne or any other fragrance you may wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon the first couple of uses, my skin was red and had a very slight burnt appearance. This was only mildly uncomfortable and went away after the third day. My mild acne initially seemed to clear up, but then about a week into it seemed to &#x27;purge&#x27; -- everything was apparently brought to the surface and I had numerous small blemishes. They went away quickly, however, and my skin is now firmer and clearer than before -- even the pores on my nose have started lightening and shrinking. The soap seems to double as a mild exfoliant and toner. Because of this, it does have a mild drying affect. I&#x27;d recommend using Cetaphil cream after washing your face with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m a Caucasian male, by the way.)</li>
            <li> The soaps are quite fragrant. The smell is good but it gave me a headache this morning. I will use it a few more times because it made me feel really clean and it lathers well but if the headache comes back, I will have to give it away.</li>
            <li> Well I bought this product for my mom she said it was good, if you had some kind of allergy. removes Wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;and she would recommend it!</li>
            <li> This soap smells great! I have really sensitive skin, and even in the summer I found it to dry out my skin a little bit. I decided to only use it on my face (I have oily skin) and it cleared my acne, and improved my complexion. If you use a moisturizer afterwards, you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to keep it in a container because it totally melts in the shower. My first bar only lasted 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My wife says this soap is better than all the acne face soaps she&#x27;s ever bought. She doesn&#x27;t buy those expensive facial cleanser products anymore and if we run out of this soap I&#x27;m sure to hear about it. Since I buy this for her I also use it for myself in the shower. It lathers really well, cleans well,  and doesn&#x27;t have a scent. If you&#x27;re conservative you can make one bar last a long time. I&#x27;m not as ecstatic about it as my wife is but it&#x27;s probably 12% better than the other bars of soap I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. It arrived at the time it was predicted to arrive and was packaged nicely. I have only used it twice so far, but I will make further updates. I don&#x27;t have acne but I have bumps on my face, arms, and legs. I have focused getting rid of mainly the ones on my face. Nothing has helped except I got a facial once and there are less bumps and they aren&#x27;t as prominent as they used to be. They are still there though and very noticable at times so I have been wanting something that will get rid of them for good or at least keep them at bay I guess. I could get facials and hope they will go away, but they are so expensive and the chemicals may not really be the best thing for my skin. I have used face cleansers that haven&#x27;t done anything either. Then I saw this soap and that it was natural and it had great reviews- just what I need!!!    I think it smells good, but some may not like it and it is a bit strong, but nobody complained about it (and my family isn&#x27;t afraid to voice their opinions) : ) . All my skin felt soft except my face felt dry. The first time I used ot I applied African shea butter to my skin,  but it is a bit time consuming since the butter is kind of hard to apply to all of my skin evenly.  The 2nd time I used it I didn&#x27;t follow up with moisturizing, but my face felt fine the next morning.    Tips:  -don&#x27;t apply to freshly shaved legs  -be careful if you use it on your face ( I think it got in my eyes a little or maybe the strong smell irritated my eyes, but I rinsed my eyew with water and then they were fine)</li>
            <li> I bought extra soap because it was a deal.  It suds great, cleans very well, leaves your skin soft and smelling like freah lemons.  What more can you want?  I have never bought expensive soap, but this makes you feel like you have.  I even gave it as gifts, to only my favorite friends.  You will love Dudu-osun African Black Soap even if you are not african.</li>
            <li> Been having bad acne for the past 15 years I tried a lot of products after the first time I used this soap I noticed a difference immediately my skin cleared up and kept my oily skin problem under control I&#x27;m a man who sweats all the time this soap definitely cuts through my funk and makes me feel so clean even my friends tell me I look cleaner as if I didn&#x27;t before this is a must have for men</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing it leaves your skin feeling so clean! Definitely buying it again, I just love it! :)</li>
            <li> Great soap, great scent. People, this soap is for everyone, not just black people (do you know how incredibly ignorant that sounds?! I wish people would research stuff before they perpetuate this kind of nonsense.) It is called \\&quot;black\\&quot; soap because there are plant ashes in the soap, giving it it&#x27;s dark appearance. It is made from leaves and bark of various trees and plants that are burned in a kettle or vat. The leaves are from banana trees, plantain skins, leaves and bark, palm tree leaves, cocoa pods, shea tree bark, etc. The ashes from the leaves are then mixed with water and then filtered. Oils such as shea butter, coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, and cocoa butter are added to this water to create the soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about African Black soap and heard this was supposed to be the original one behind all the other ones out there. It&#x27;s supposed to be all natural, sensitive to skin and have health benefits like clearing acne, delays aging, curing cancer etc. Unfortunately if it sounds too good to be true.. then it probably is. This soap is heavy on the marketing and lacking in what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a long history of eczema, skin irritations due to sodium laurel sulfate found in many shampoos, soaps and toothpastes among other ingredients like \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve tried many soaps claiming to be sensitive to the skin. Most use marketing language and obscure ingredients to back those claims which in turn, prove to be misleading and prolonging your conditions. In my opinion, this soap falls into that category which is disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving the soap I was enthusiastic about trying it out. I read the ingredients and one thing that really stuck out to me was \\&quot;FRAGRANCE\\&quot; hmmm what can that mean? Is it all natural? WTF is it? Kind of obscure but I figured they make it a point to be all natural and sensitive so let&#x27;s see. When I used it, immediately afterwards my hands, which suffers from the occasional eczema, started to feel a bit irritated. I also used this on my face and the same result happened. Several days of using this soap, it exacerbated my usual conditions, so I no longer use it. I suspect the fragrance in the soap is the cause of my irritation of my sensitive skin. If you claim to use all natural ingredients AND be sensitive to skin, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be putting obscure fragrance in there or whatever else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I may be in the minority of sensitive skin consumers but you need to have more concrete data and complete transparency of ingredients supporting your claims. Oh well.. Trial and error per usual. Next hypo-allergenic soap please.</li>
            <li> Great Smell and skin feels awesome after your shower love it. Helps with the dark spots on your skin as well, I use on face and body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years, mostly the expensive stuff and nothing compares to this cheap soap.  Helped my acne problems tremendously.</li>
            <li> I got this soap because of the reviews and because my daughter was having some acne issues. I could not wait to receive it, but was very thrown off when I did. The soap had a VERY strong fragrant odor to it. So much so, it made me sick to my stomach, as all chemicals do, and I had to store it in a air tight container so I would not have to deal with the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap says natural, but what is natural OR pure about added fragrance? I know a lot about chemical additives from my research over the past 11 years and this soap has a chemical additive in it somewhere. I am attributing it to the fragrance factor. Instead of helping clear my daughter&#x27;s skin, she broke out severely on her forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When there is even the slightest trace of chemicals in products (food or lotions and soaps, etc), I tend to get really ill. I would not buy this product again unless this additive is taken out. It is really not necessary for it to be effective and this is probably a factor in other people&#x27;s various skin reactions that I have read here. I will be sticking to my organic soaps as before.</li>
            <li> Really good soap, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. It leaves your skin smooth and fresh feeling. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SOAP....&lt;br /&gt;1) Natural ingredients so I don&#x27;t feel like I am bathing in a chemical factory wash&lt;br /&gt;2) Great scent....I am sure this also comes from the natural ingredients as well&lt;br /&gt;3) Does not dry my skin at all as others report. The shea butter prevents this.&lt;br /&gt;4) This is a large sized bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Good selling soap.  It lathers well.  Has a nice exfoliating texture.  Dudu is a strange name and I guess the color adds to the joke, but you&#x27;ll find yourself liking this soap.  I don&#x27;t know if there are known allergic reactions to the ingredients used, so its best to read that first.</li>
            <li> My older brother got my sister, mom and I this soap as part of our Christmas gift this year, telling us that he turned his girlfriend onto it and that I&#x27;d love it.  I got it in the mail around Christmas time and joked that it looked like a BIG lump of coal that he had given everyone as a gift, but it smelled really good and I was excited to try it out since I read all of the benefits online about how get it was for your skin. I was in love after only a week of using it and am hooked on it like it is crack.  I am of mixed race have extremely dry skin, and could never find a product that could moisturize my skin and hair without it either being too greasy or would dry it out, I get dry scalp and dandruff occasionally went testing out new products but, this soap despite the look and name is amazing! The fact that you can use it in your hair, body and face is wonderful and that it has benefits for all three and that it has natural ingredents is also a plus, I have only been using it a week and have already noticed the difference in my skin tone.  I read somewhere that it burns your face, so I was cautious using it on my face, the only time it burned is when I used a washcloth on my face, if i get a good lather and apply it to my face that way I have no problems. And this soap has the best lather I have seen with any product of this type (natural)it leaves my skin clear, moisturized and blemish free which I get even as an adult from time to time, it leaves my skin feeling clean and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to regualar soap, I love this product and would recommend it to anyone as a must have and this year&#x27;s one of my favorite things! (in Oprah voice)</li>
            <li> There is a very specific problem with this otherwise wonderful product: the added fragrance. Fragrance/perfume is a horrific irritant for sensitive skin, and is an absolute breeder of Eczema and Rosacea. IF (!!!) you are NOT a the very least sensitive regarding added perfumes then this product may do wonders for you. But if, like me, you are sensitive, this will DESTROY your skin regardless of the hypoallergenic moisturizers you use.   On a positive note, this is extremely good at clearing blackheads -- amazingly so, actually! However my entire body quickly became an eczema and rosacea covered mess, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth-it.   As other reviewers have noted, DEFINITELY use a moisturizer with this soap! It is very drying!   I just wish they didn&#x27;t add so much fragrance -- not only does it smell disgusting (think cheap tropical-scented bathroom freshener!) but it destroys sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. Great for rashes,skin problems,acne,oily skin,itchy skin and more. I use this on my combination skin everyday and it removes the oil without drying my skin. My 16 year old son uses it also for itchy skin. Works like a charm! I will keep buying this!</li>
            <li> this smells good and works good on my body. i was using it on my face and i started to see my skin was getting really weird and kind of dry and patchy. but it works good if u use it once and a while</li>
            <li> UPDATE: We&#x27;ve gone through an entire bar since we got our soap on what, wednesday? (sunday now). My psoriasis is clearing up on my arms and my hair on my legs isn&#x27;t growing back as fast as it normally does (i shave with the dudu-osun). other than that, hubby&#x27;s still in love with it and hasn&#x27;t been drying out as much as he usually does. my son thinks it&#x27;s awesome that it&#x27;s black, and we havent had any staining problems in our shower. the bubbles dont really turn that brown, you only notice it rinsing, on my skin (and I&#x27;m white) the bubbles are white and when it rinses it looks like i was really diry lmao. my face started breaking out so i just wash my face with it when i&#x27;m in the shower, hubby is not even getting one zit though.  Just received my pack of 4 bars yesterday and we&#x27;ve all used it (myself twice), Hubby absolutely loves it and has no dryness problems whatsoever, me neither, and I did absolutely everything that people said not to do (minus using the bar on my face because that would be awkward..), it does have a cold cream consistancy if you don&#x27;t use alot of water (I did this for shaving my legs), I attempted to use it in place of shampoo, but like one person said a while back it left a residure and made my hair feel like wet spaghetti and impossible to brush (after washing it out with regular shampoo and conditioning), my son&#x27;s hair is amazingly soft though and his skin was ashy afterwards, so I put baby lotion on him, no biggie, it&#x27;s a bar soap afterall and AZ has really hard, chlorinated water.  Will update later if there are any changes in my stretch marks, dark spots, and psoriasis, and hubby&#x27;s random acne flare-ups.  leaves a super clean feeling and makes the entire house smell amazing.  the scent isn&#x27;t really a big deal, it&#x27;s like someone said about it smelling like hotel soap. it&#x27;s kind of citrusy, but the end result is a hotel soap scent. I like it and my entire house smells super fresh, I might just keep a bar here and there through the house hidden as air-freshener LOL!</li>
            <li> I love black soap.  Everyone I gift a bar of black soap never goes back.  This stuff is truly amazing!  I wash from my face to my toes with this stuff - it clears any acne/backne that I may have and prevents it from coming back.  This stuff LATHERS!  My skin looks great!  I use grapeseed oil on my face afterwards (AMAZING to fight acne as well - hydrates where you need it).  I use coconut oil on my body afterwards and my skin is so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried black soap in my hair but I have VERY fine hair - like baby hair.  So it did not work for me .  A coworker of mine uses it in her hair and she absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying this soap - you will never go back to chemicals and fragrance again.  Nature provides us with everything we need!</li>
            <li> Soap is excellent and is good for oily skin uses multiple smelled pretty good shape&lt;br /&gt;His interest over the long term</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t Work For Me.&lt;br /&gt;Makes Skin Really Dry&lt;br /&gt;Went To Dermatologists.&lt;br /&gt;Problems Solved</li>
            <li> Thought I would try this soap after perusing soaps and reading the generally favorable reviews. I don&#x27;t know about the medicinal virtues of this soap as others have commented on (I don&#x27;t really have any skin problems to speak of) but as a general shower soap it leaves a lot to be desired. It has a funky smell and taste (which always manages to sneak into my mouth, don&#x27;t ask me how (??), not a big deal I guess but I still don&#x27;t like it. It seems to get you clean so it functions well in that regard, but it is weird that the soapy water draining off your body is brown-colored, made me think wow, I&#x27;m really dirty! then I realized it is the soap which then made me wonder how much of that brown stuff just stays on my skin so I rinse a little longer than usual. I&#x27;m usually only semi-conscious when taking a morning shower so this seemed weird to me. But I only gave it two stars because 1)the bar doesn&#x27;t last very long, four or five showers and it has shriveled down to nothing - that works out to about $1.00/shower and 2)it is the grossest thing you will ever have in your shower - it is not a black soap, it is DUDU brown, literally. When you leave it on a shelf (or whatever you call the ledge the soap sits on when not in use) it fuses to it so the next time you pick it up a big clod sticks to the ledge. Aside from the clod, which has a fecal look to it, the bar drools a brown streak down the wall of the shower. If others use the shower after you I guarantee as soon as they get in they will think WTF? who has the case of chronic diarrhea? DUDU - it&#x27;s not just the name.</li>
            <li> I had to use this a while to make up my mind. While I don&#x27;t care for the smell....and that is one of the things I like about soap....I will say that my skin likes it. I notice my skin is not as dry as it used to be. I usually use the brand that won&#x27;t dry your skin like other soaps (-:  but this does work better. I also like that I can use this on my face and I couldn&#x27;t use that soap that has a bird name on my face as it would clog my pores. So....wish it smelled better but that is the price you pay for all natural.</li>
            <li> I purchased one bar. and I did at first have some slight burning when I used on my cheek and forehead area. The suds looks like its dirty soap, strange enough, but it&#x27;s okay. I have perioral dermatitis. I was hoping this would work on it.  I will still use this soap until it is completely gone. Only on my face, once a day. Then I can give a better review. So far, though it&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;ll give it more time. The first time I used it my skin was so soft, I&#x27;m not sure if it was the soap over drying out my skin, or maybe it was the soap improving the texture  then that wore off quickly, and I am still waiting and using this. I am going to stick with it. I paid for it, might as well.</li>
            <li> As a honky, I tried out this Soap.  It looks like a turd at first, or a chocolate bar so you might be put off rubbing your face into it.  It&#x27;s a strange sensation.  I can&#x27;t say if it helped me or not.  It&#x27;s okay.  I eat alot of sausage too.</li>
            <li> I suffered from adult acne for last 3 years. I tried everything out there from home remedies to prescription medicine. I saw a you tube  video about this soup. as skeptical as I was, thought what do I have to lose!!&lt;br /&gt;I have oily acne pron a skin with large  pores .I have been using this for last 2 months, no soup could ever clean my face as good as black soup.&lt;br /&gt;combination of witch hazel and tea tree oil plus washing my face twice a day with this soup did wonder for my skin.</li>
            <li> These soaps are great!  They last very long.  I have been on the same bar for about a month now, and it barely looks used.  I use it twice a day.  Things I&#x27;ve noticed...This soap looks handmade, it&#x27;s not mass produced and full of junk you don&#x27;t want on your face. I have blackhead on my nose since I was a teenager.  I&#x27;m 35 now.  Those have disappeared.  Some spots get a little dry at first, but then they must get used to the soap, because they get better in a few days.  The soap stings a little, just a little, but it&#x27;s worth it for the results you get. And DON&#x27;T get this in your eye. It burns very bad, or maybe I&#x27;m just a baby.  At any rate, I&#x27;m pretty sure these 4 soaps I have will last probably close to a year.  When these are gone, I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap..For anyone who has not used I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying, after using this product on and off for Four years I LOVE THIS product! I have extremely oily skin. Forehead, Nose, especially. I initially found this at my local African Market and mentioned it to my sister who told me that my eldest cousin swears by it. Of course she has skin \\&quot;TO DIE FOR\\&quot; so I was convinced I&#x27;d found the secret! During my first year of using this product, I loved that it completely rid my face of the dark brown spots left over from years of acne and I could see my skin transforming into what I have been trying to accomplish forever, a clear glowing complexion. During the second year I noticed a change in my skin, not as much oil production which made my face look dry and to me old. Of course I had not been using a moisturizer and I never had to because my face was so greasy. So for 2.5 years I would use it when I had bad acne because it dried up bumps overnight and left minimal scarring but the more I used it the drier my complexion looked, so i would ultimately discontinue usage for a short period of time. Finally this year after reading many reviews on this product I realized I needed more than just this soap. I now do my initial cleanse with Dudu Osun, followed by a Merle Norman foaming cleanser. I use a gentle exfoliator and follow up with toner from Merle Norman as well. I also am able to use a thick moisturizer (night cream) by merle norman day and night to counter act the dryness. My skin now has that glow you find in movies!! I would say be careful to use the right mixture of products with this bar. I have also started using this soap in the shower and have noticed a significant difference in the appearance of my stretch marks. I would recommend this to only folks with oily skin problems because it is rather drying and can be a little irritating upon initial use.</li>
            <li> Great price! I usually pay $5 per bar in the store, but got all 4 for less than $11 here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have always had oily troublesome skin that breaks out in everything known to man...pimples, pustules, blackheads, whiteheads and clogged sweat glands.  Like some of the other reviewers I have tried almost everything on the market...including the Proactive type products.  That stuff caused an allergic reaction and my skin to turn horridly red and thicken for days...not nice!  The product has helped a lot.  I like the citrus fragrance though it&#x27;s unusual mixed with the \\&quot;ash\\&quot; ingredients.  It will make a mess in your tub if you don&#x27;t keep it dry except when using it.  A small amount makes a super lather that turns almost to a cold cream consistency as you rub.  I do recommend that you lather and apply with your hands.  It causes a slight \\&quot;chemical peel\\&quot; action, so intense scrubbing isn&#x27;t a good idea, nor is leaving it on for an extended time.  And RINSE really well (moisturize if you need it).  Using it in the shower is really good, since the rinsing is usually better.  I laughed at the reviewers that suggested this product is somehow for African people.  Um...skin is skin and it&#x27;s SOAP--you need not worry that it will change your color!  I&#x27;m caucasian and quite fair and it&#x27;s been working very well for me.  I&#x27;d like to try it on my hair but a little concerned, since I color my hair, as the soap seems a bit strong.  If you are looking for something to deep clean troublesome skin...this is affordable and does the job better than anything else that I have tried.  You still can&#x27;t skip good skin cleansing at least 2x a day. I can imagine some people with sensitive skin might want to test a bit before throwing themselves into using it frequently.  I am giving all my drug store bottles and jars the heave-ho and the black bar has a place in my powder room!</li>
            <li> This soap works excellently at removing dirt and clearing up acne. If you have dry skin, make sure you get a moisturizer as well because it can leave your face feeling a little dry if you don&#x27;t have oily</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and strong without being over powering.Leaves you feeling squeaky clean. I ordered another dozen bars before I finished the first one.</li>
            <li> This review is for label readers. The box says Pure Natural Ingredients.  There&#x27;s no mention of 100% on the box, so I don&#x27;t know, 100%, if the fragrance is all natural like they claim in the product description on Amazon&#x27;s website.   Verbatim it says \\&quot;Dudu-Osun is the age-long African black soap made the traditional way by hand from PURE NATURAL INGREDIENTS AND HERBS from the tropical rain forest and savannah regions.   .No artificial colours  .No preservatives  .Bio degradable.\\&quot;    Made from pure and natural doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that everything single thing is 100% natural -maybe it&#x27;s just their wording. And why they have spelled colors \\&quot;colours\\&quot; is beyond me, maybe it&#x27;s just a misprint.  Here&#x27;s an exact list of the ingredients on the box:    .Pure Honey  .Shea Butter  .Osun(camwood)  .Palmkernel oil  .Cocoa pod ash  .Palm bunch ash  .Aloe vera  .Lime juice    .Water &amp; Fragrance    Water is vague, is it pure water, distilled, etc.. Water could have all kinds of contaminants, so when I&#x27;m looking for a pure product the type of water is important to me. I gave it a 3 instead of 5 stars -call me picky - because 100% isn&#x27;t on the box.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all, I&#x27;ve never, ever used a soap that smells so refreshing, and cleanse your skin well and not OVER-DRYING. Actually, with me it cleanses and using a scrub buff, or loofah as a exfoliater is a wonder for a cleaning sensation! It cleanses well while it conditions...   The feeling for now is the results, but I can&#x27;t wait to see what this magic can do in the near future. I have oily skin, and this is the winter-time, I balance my oils while replacing them with deep moisture, I also use Queen Helene&#x27;s coco butter lotion on my rough parts on my skin, and use olive oil lotion for the rest of my body to condition well.  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 3 days now, and I see myself only using this soap for a life-time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice soap. works well and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 3 days but I love it! My skin tone &amp; texture have improved already. I didn&#x27;t even think about putting foundation on when I was getting ready for work this morning. That&#x27;s how much this soap has helped my skin. I don&#x27;t really get pimples, maybe 5 a year but I&#x27;m hoping this soap will help with my clogged pores and blackheads. From the looks of things I think it will over time. I even got my boyfriend to wash his face with this last night and he loved it also. I&#x27;ll definitely keep purchasing this!</li>
            <li> I have been using Dudu-osun Black Soap on and off for about 4 years now. It is the best soap I have ever used. I am African American and have dry skin and natural hair(hair that is not chemically processed). My scalp tends to get very dry and flaky, but when I use this soap as a shampoo, it terminates any dandruff or itchy scalp I have. I also use it on my skin along with natural shea butter. When used together, my skin glows! Also, I feel super clean and refreshed after using Dudu-osun. I recommend this soap to anyone with dry scalp and skin issues. It is a God send.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema since childhood. I&#x27;m surprised I was not ever introduced to black soap when I was smaller. Just did research on cures and black soap is a DEFINITE! I was hipped to sheabutter 3yrs ago and LOVE IT! Now I&#x27;m adding DuDu-osun brand black soap to My regime. I just got it today and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it ( I was sure to be VERY gentle as I&#x27;d read many times where a person was rough and it was painful) I rubbed the soap in My hands then lather it all over My face areas, after I cleaned the lather with My towel I followed this with sheabutter (this will be My New regime) I&#x27;m REALLY taking a chance as I&#x27;m VERY constant &amp; serious about My skin care (especially My face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last 7yrs I&#x27;ve been using Baby Magic Hand &amp; Body Wash for My face followed by Nivea (in that little round tin .99cents)now as of today I&#x27;ll be using the black soap followed by sheabutter sprinkled with a once week mask of Queen Helen Mint Julep. I&#x27;ll get back with you and let you know what&#x27;s the deal 3/17 which will be 1 full month of using this new regime. so far I LOVE the smell, the feel and hopefully the GREAT results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;signing off: PRiNCESSgIgI</li>
            <li> The black soap was really good. At first I was a little skeptical,  but as it turned out, it is an excellent product. Plus, it smells good.</li>
            <li> Helped my skin and didn&#x27;t leave it dry, feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be a bad soap if it didn&#x27;t bleed all over the place &amp; leave residue in the bathtub. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this soap again.</li>
            <li> Overall I am VERY pleased with this bar of soap. I plan to use it from now on and I simply had to let you all know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS PRODUCT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the soap is brown it leaves a residue where ever left (this is remedied by cleaning off the place it is kept on a daily basis)&lt;br /&gt;Along with the previous the soap leaves a brownish trail of water after showering (this is remedied by rinsing off the soap and placing it in your soap dish)&lt;br /&gt;Use a chamomile wipe after use to add an even better glow!&lt;br /&gt;This soap lathers in both cold and hot water</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for around a month now and I love it! It lathers really well and I absolutely love its unique scent. I&#x27;ve seen many reviews about its lightening properties or it making scars/dark spots fade and so far I haven&#x27;t seen that occur in my skin, but I haven&#x27;t taken pictures to monitor anything, but I might start to do so and give an update if I notice any changes. I use this with a rag on most days and exfoliation gloves some days, and so far my skin has been feeling great. It does have a drying effect so make sure to follow up with lotion or butter. I&#x27;ve also used this product on my face and although its drying its a great make up remover and like I said before I love the scent. I don&#x27;t have an acne problem, but I do have dark spots on my face. They haven&#x27;t seemed to fade at all, but once again I&#x27;ll try to take pictures and monitor changes. I plan to continue to use this soap so as soon as I run out I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> This soap was shipped in a timely manner     I use Dudu-Osun on my face and body, and it&#x27;s actually a great product but it left my skin itchy. My skin is really sensitive, and as a baby I couldn&#x27;t wear diapers (I wore cloth diapers). The soap has a very interesting smell that I love, but my skin hates. My face doesn&#x27;t really itch because I use moisturizer on my face. I bought some Shea butter (to use as a moisturizer) from the same company, and it had the worse smell so I decided not to put it on my face or body. Other than the itch my face has a glow to it, and for once my SKIN can go the whole day looking how it looks in the morning (refresh/revived). I&#x27;m thinking about buying some Shea butter lotion, and hopefully the rest of my body will have the same results as my glowing face.  Also, when I washed my face the next morning I noticed my eyebrows looked smoother, and softer. Normally my brows go in all kinds of directions, and for once they were tamed (I might use it on my hair as I intended to do at first).    I forgot to mention that it has a burning/tingling sensation. At first I just felt it on my face, but the second time I used it I felted it on my legs and arms. I decided to only use it 3 times a week rather than daily because my skin is so sensitive.     Facts about myself  I&#x27;m 21, African American, no acne, no acne marks, and I have freckles.</li>
            <li> I have been so frustrated with my acne and oily skin for years, and have tried just about every acne product on the market that swears results through advertising. Nutrogena, pro-active, clearasel and so on...    This Soap, which costs a fraction of what I have spent in the past on other brands, has totally cleared up my skin and controlled the oil. I wasn&#x27;t expecting big results because of all the past disappointments...But this product WORKS!! My skin has been the clearest it has ever been in 5+ years!     I love amazon reviews and look for them whenever I am opting to try a new product. When I find something that works I run to write my review because they really help me discern what to spend money on, what works and what doesn&#x27;t. Acne is very frustrating and to actually find a product that delivers results is a miracle. Can&#x27;t beat the cost either. Tell everyone you know that suffers from skin problems that this the soap to try. leaves my skin clear and soft too.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It feels so soft and amazing on my skin and I feel so healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome for people with skin problems.  Until I started using this soap my face would constantly stay red and chaffed. I started using this soap and now it&#x27;s the only soap I use. I turned two friends on to it and now its all they use.  Great for bad skin or acme or even eczema.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I came across this product. This soap smells wonderful and leaves your skin feeling silky smooth. It doesn&#x27;t take much soap to create a good lather and one bar lasts longer than regular soap. I never had bad skin but noticed that most soaps are too harsh on my skin. I was looking for a natural soap and always loved black soap. My adolescent daughter developed a serious case of acne and it is almost cleared from daily use of this soap. It is great for the entire family. I would recommend using dark colored towels if possible because they will stain white or lite colored ones. I recommended this product to a friend of mine who suffers from eczema and he loves it. Try it and you will not regret it! It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my brothers acne fast and lasts about a month or so each bar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with bad acnes for as long as I can remember. This product didn&#x27;t work on the acnes. However, it has definitely kept the unaffected part of my skin healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Got my soap today and used it for the first time this evening. I do love the soap. The people on here saying it smells your whole room, you must have very very sensitive noses, because yes it does have a smell but it is very light. I thought the soap smelled nice and worked nice. As with all bar soaps natural or not it does dry your skin a bit, but I will take this dry over the other products such as dove with deadly chemicals. I DO NOT recommend using it on your private parts, because it burns like the dickens, I made this mistake tonight LOL, but other than that it is safe to use other places just not there. Also I did notice when I washed my face with it, my face starting feeling warm and turned a little red. So I will just be using this as a body soap and not for face or privates. I used raw shea butter when I was done which helps with the dryness. The hairs and grains you see coming from the soap is from the plants, it is not people hair lol...geesh. Anyways I love this product and the smell is light and citrus</li>
            <li> Awesome soap!  Great vibrant smell and because of the texture, I choose to rub it directly on the skin instead of taking the washcloth route, I just try not to apply with too much pressure as sometimes little particles can scratch. It lathers great and kicks dirt and oil into next week.  However, for those same reasons, it can dry out your skin, but then again who&#x27;s buying pure natural soaps without having some kind of moisturizing ritual.  If your skin is sensitive or dry then this might not be the product for you.  But that is not an issue for me so I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great all over the body and face.  My skin is amazingly soft!  It cleared my son&#x27;s back acne almost immediately after the first use!  I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> After reading the stellar reviews, I decided to give this soap a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap worked wonders for me on the FIRST DAY! I am a victim (lol) of acne as well as bacne. Since I&#x27;ve only used it last night and this morning, I have nothing to say about acne scars, but in a month or so I&#x27;ll come back and report. Anyways, I has a really bad breakout a couple of days previous to receiving the soap.Those bumps were red and painful. When I woke up, a few had disappeared, the bumps were smaller in size, and the redness had diminished a lot! Before the breakout, I always had these small, nondescript bumps that could be popped (the puss smelled horrible) on my cheeks, forehead, and on/around my nose. The morning after I used it for the first time, those bumps were GONE completely. The small bumps on my back were also GONE. Obviously, this soap is what I&#x27;ve been waiting for all my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like another user said, I went ahead and bought a bottle of vitamin A pills- which I will add C,D, and E, to every time I get paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up with my skin glowing and still smelling like the DuDu soap that I had bathed with the previous night before. I had an organic antioxidant moisturizing cream that I used immediately after that did the job good.The smell was not overpowering to me at all and I did not experience any stinging of any type. I definitely recommend this soap to anyone with acne.</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling refreshed, and smelling amazing!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clean and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> After I passed the age of 60, I started having facial breakouts for reasons that escaped both me and my doctors. After abandoning the medical profession&#x27;s expensive prescription remedies, I started using a combination of sulfur soap with Dead Sea salts, vitamin B-5. And Tri-Derma skin repair creme. This was effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I discovered that my sulfur soap was gone, and I had a bad breakout on my scalp. I decided to give the Dudu-Osun soap a try. How and why this soap may be effective requires some explanation, and I apologize if this seems a bit like lecturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dudu-Osun soap contains different forms of wood ash, which in turn has a high percentage of calcium carbonate (used in agricultural lime) and potash (used in lye). Lye is a common soap ingredient. Lime is not so commonly used. Both are alkaline (high pH level). As such they can be caustic and corrosive although in small quantities this can be controlled. Dudu-Osun soap contains things like palm oil and shea butter which should help to reduce the burning that caustic substances can cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does this mean for a soap meant to help with breakouts? Here is my own analysis, based on chemistry and personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Anti-bacterial action. Bacteria do not thrive well in alkaline environments. Dudu-Osun creates a highly alkaline environment which has a more highly disinfectant action than most soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Skin irritation. Caustic alkaline soaps have a very high potential for skin irritation. The more sensitive your skin, the worse this will be. This is the downside of Dudu-Osun&#x27;s disinfectant qualities. If left on the skin for even a minute, I can feel the burning for up to six hours later, and my skin sensitivity level is normal. If you use Dudu-Osun, wash it off immediately. Don&#x27;t let it get near your eyes or other more fragile tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Exfoliation. Exfoliants remove dead skin cells, which clears pores, allows hair follicles to grow, and generally promotes skin health. Chemical exfoliants are typically acidic (e.g., alpha hydroxy acid). Dudu-Osun is alkaline. It is not the best solution for skin exfoliation. With a good exfoliant, your skin will feel more refreshed. While your skin will feel clean with Dudu-Osun, you won&#x27;t have the refreshing quality that a good exfoliant produces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. General effectiveness. It took only a couple of days for me to resolve a scalp breakout with Dudu-Osun. But when I wasn&#x27;t careful about flushing with water, it hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Alternatives. Sulfur soap with Dead Sea salts (such as what Jericho and Adovia offer) tends to be acidic when combined with water. Acid also has an anti-bacterial action as well as being good for exfoliation. The salts themselves have magnesium, which has anti-inflammatory and hydration qualities that people have found therapeutic for over 4,000 years. I rate these soaps as better than Dudu-Osun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Value. What can I say? This product is a steal at its current pricing. If you&#x27;re careful about flushing with water and don&#x27;t mind getting a separate exfoliant, it should serve you well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that some of this helps to clarify the sometimes conflicting comments from other reviewers.enerally promotes skin health.

            <li> I was excited about getting this soap, but as soon as I opened the box, saw the sealed zip lock bag with the 4 soaps in it, I was similarly knocked over by the fragrance of fake lime possibly. I left the bag on my cabinet in the bathroom, hoping I would get used to the smell through familiarization. 8 hours later I went to bed, woke up 4 hours later sniffing the intense smelling soap fand feeling panicky, as in anxiety causing a mild panic attack. I don&#x27;t wear perfumes either. I placed the soap outside my main door, so that it would not be nowhere near me. The soap is not for fragrance sensitive people. I&#x27;m sure the possibly present lime may be acidic helping with acne and immediately soothing with the Aloe, but they may have been trying to cover up a smell or made a pretty big mistake. Most people commenting gave their approval so I chose to try it. Almost 5 flying stars sank my boat though. Dudu!!</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this soap. I had a rash on my skin that was very itchy. After using this soap for about a week, the rash and itching disappeared.  It&#x27;s a very gentle soap, and I love the natural ingredients.  I will definitely continue using this soap.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Pros- this soap contains a fruity smell and helps to slightly whiten your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- this is not advisable for clearing your acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this soap for my back acne, but my acne did not clear up.</li>
            <li> If you want clearer skin this is it for the naturalist..gave a bar to a co-worker n his skin is transforming even when he accidentally burned his face (1st degree) it gave him his tone back without the acne</li>
            <li> I just received my soap and I must say--the fragrance is a bit much. Its not a bad smell but it is a feminine smell and I am not sure I want walk around smelling lady like. I am debating on whether or not to send it back. I am giving it three stars based on the ingredients only. I&#x27;ll modify this review in the future if I use the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now. My skin color is evening out but I am breaking out more. It leaves too much oil on my face</li>
            <li> I use this primarily on my face....it can be a bit drying and messy and even stings at times, but it does help with breakouts!</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Got it because my skin was drying out due to the drier winter weather and these regular bar soaps don&#x27;t help.  Only bugaboo is that it does stain the washcloths and my son won&#x27;t touch it because it&#x27;s brown and called dudu. Otherwise I love the smell and how it leaves my skin clean but still moisturized with out the greasy feeling. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Smells and feels clean.  People love washing their hands at my house.</li>
            <li> It cleanse my face, but did nothing for my acne. Will try a different brand of black soap.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit like play dough, works good though! Keeps my face acne free and squeaky clean :) Since it is very natural, it tends to be a bit crumbly. Thats to be expected though.</li>
            <li> Love this product, natural and love the smell</li>
            <li> This soap, which I heard about on the Dr. Oz Show sounded like a good product.  WRONG...I should have read the reviews before purchasing.  More people reviewing this product had complained of the same issue.  When I first noticed the sores on my legs, I stopped using soap for 7 - 10 days.  The sores got small and went away.  I began using the soap again and sure enough more sores began on my legs and also one on the outline of my upper lip also began.  My daughter had the same reaction to this soap!!  BEWARE....</li>
            <li> Does anyone know if this soap is really natural? When I was reading the ingredient list it says there&#x27;s fragrance in the soap. As far as I know  anything that you add a fragrance to, it is not organic/natural.</li>
            <li> The cosmetic industry should be worried. If more people find out how awesome this soap is, they will lose a lot of sales! I have recently underwent chemo which left a very bad rash on my face. I tried many different cleansers, lotions, and potions to no avail. My ace cleared up after just one week of using Dudu-Osun! My complexion continues to improve each day. It has lightened my acne scars, freckles, and sun spots. It&#x27;s also great for shaving legs! This soap has a clean, fresh smell. It smells like a cross between dove&amp;ivory, very pleasant. It also lathers well and lasts a long time. One bar lasts me 2-3 months, and I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> Really rather harsh soap.  Interesting smell. I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Liked the smell of this soap, and it made my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I am a believer in this soap.. After many many years of searching I finally found what fits my skin.</li>
            <li> Refreshingly clean and lathers up great and rinses great with no soapy residue...I love this soap...as I feel really clean!</li>
            <li> At first, it was a good soap that got me really clean,I liked the smell, and I could even overlook the fact that half of one of the bars turned into a small pool of mud the one time I forgot to take it out of the shower. But after a couple of weeks of use, there were dry patches on my skin and a stinging sensation when I used it. Also there was no visible improvement on any of my scars, acne or otherwise. I was cautiously optimistic after reading all of the (mixed) reviews but it didn&#x27;t work out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients as listed in the back of the box are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure Honey, Shea Butter, Osun (camwood), Palm Kernel Oil, Cocoa Pod Ash, Palm Bunch Ash, Aloe Vera, Lime Juice, Water and Fragrance.</li>
            <li> i love this soap!!! I had acne and terrible skin and tried everything.  This will be my third time purchasing this product.  Ive been getting compliments about my complexion and actually got friends and family using this stuff too.  It suds up and you feel really clean plus i love the scent.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go back to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; soap now. Granted, this soap has a slight burning sensation due to the lime &amp; lemon juice but you grow accustom to it. In fact, I like it now as I feel that it is actually removing stuff and not leaving soap residue on my skin. It quickly clears up problem areas on my face. My only issue is that it has caused one of my microdermals to inflame, but this is perhaps because I did not fully remove the soap (the dermal sits between my clavicles in that dip above the sternum, between the neck and chest) or some other unrelated reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that it does melt kind of fast but not much different than other soaps. Perhaps it&#x27;s just more noticeable because it&#x27;s brown versus white/ivory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, this soap smells amazing and works great. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After researching webpage after webpage and throwing dollars in all directions looking for a product that will help with blackheads, I ran across this soap.  With the low price, I figured it would not hurt to give it a try.  I have suffered blackheads on my inner thighs since adolescents (30 years ago).  Not just five or six blackheads, but colonies of the evil little bastards.     At first, I just used the soap on my problem areas then decided to start using it the shower for allover washing (do not use light or white washcloths with this soap, not even Clorox will get the brown tint out).  Dudu-Osun makes a lather that feels rich and creamy but rinses off better than most national brand soaps, leaving behind just enough moisture to keep your skin fresh.    A few weeks into using the soap I could see a reduction in the blackheads. Not completely gone, but some improvement.  Although Dudu-Osun is not a miracle cure, it is a great soap with a nice fragrance (sort of has an incense scent, sort of hard to explain, but it&#x27;s pleasant).</li>
            <li> Great for every day use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it before its great especially now since I&#x27;m getting into my African roots so ill be using this soap a lot now. also ita made in Nigeria and I&#x27;m 29% Nigerian so its awesome a must have and great smell even after your bathroom will smell good for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought that my skin would benefit from a simple soap? If you have sensitive skin like me, try using this with coconut oil as a moisturizer and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I love the aroma and rich creamy feel of this product and it does not dry my skin out like harsh chemical cleansers. I recommend it wholeheartedly!</li>
            <li> Love this soap! It smells fantastic and it works wonders for your skin!</li>
            <li> My daughter is 7 and breaks out with small pimples on her forehead.  I purchased this item because I didn&#x27;t want to start putting chemical type products on her young skin to combat her acne.  This soap is a godsend! It has cleared her acne and is just a great soap to use if you have skin issues like eczema and blemish issues.</li>
            <li> This soap is divine.  The black soap is drying so I use the coconut papaya one from Nubian Heritage after I rince off the black soap because it seems to conditions the skin and my skin is less dry.  Using the two together has been wonderful.  I have 20 year old stretch marks from childbirth that are fading!  Anything that can do that is a winner in my book. I thought I would be stuck with those for life and never really tried to do away with them since I thought it was a lost cause.  Then I started using these products and I swear in two weeks I started to notice that those stretch marks were fading and some disappeared all together.  I told my boyfriend and he said it was placebo effect but then he started to really notice dark spots fading and completely disappearing as well and now he is using the soap too which means now I have to buy more since it is going quite fast. Also got my teen and 22 year old to start using it.  Now my bathroom smells like a tropical paradise every time I bathe and now showering is no longer a chore but I actually look forward to the process. And my skin is smooth like a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the black soap can be drying, I follow up with the coconut papaya soap since it seems to condition the skin.  Plus the smell is quite yummy. Sometimes I use Carol&#x27;s Daughter \\&quot;Bring back the moisture\\&quot; liquid soap which is also great and works well with the black soap.  Then I rince.  I follow-up with organic rose water as a toner, placed on cotton ball then dab over my face and neck.  Rose water soothes the skin. I moisture with organic coconut oil.  I guess you can use shea butter moisturizer but I like coconut oil.  For the body I either use coconut oil or the Coconut Papaya body lotion with vanilla bean extract when I have it.  It smells so yummy and is excellent for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these products for almost a month and have had excellent results.  Dark spots on my face have disappeared from teen acne years, the occassional pimple I used to get is no more and stretch marks on my breasts are gone, the ones on my thighs have faded, not completely gone yet but I took a pic when I noticed they were fading so that I can compare in a month but I can already see they are fading by the naked eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the person who said that if you are light skinned African American not to use this soap because it makes you lighter.  I am light skinned AA and the soap didn&#x27;t turn me into Michael Jackson ghost white or anything.  On the other hand, I have noticed that my complexion has evened out since the dark patches and spots are gone. I use the same color foundation that I used before...now just less of it since I don&#x27;t have to try to cover dark spots since they are gone.  Works for people who are not of color aka caucasian as well.  My boyfriend is Scandinavian and it works for his skin as well and you don&#x27;t get whiter skin than that.  The soap doesn&#x27;t know skin color.  Also, I don&#x27;t rub the soap directly on my face since it has stuff in it, I guess for exfoliation and I have sensitive skin so I rub the soap in my hands and get a really good lather then wash my face with my hands that way I&#x27;m not rubbing my skin with the bar and causing unnecessary irritation. I think maybe that&#x27;s why some reviewers are complaining about irritation. Don&#x27;t put the bar directly on your face and scrub. I never put any bar directly on my face anyway. I do put the bar directly on my body and wash away since my body is less sensitive and can take the scrubbing but if I have just shaved my legs then I lather the soap in a wash cloth and then use the wash cloth to clean so that I won&#x27;t cause irritation to my freshly shaven legs. I also noticed that the hair on my legs seems to be growing back slower since I&#x27;ve been using this soap.  I don&#x27;t know if the enzymes in the soap is stimulating the hair follicles less or what but I have noticed slower hair regrowth. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a result of the soap or something else but I&#x27;m not complaining.  The soap is also great for the eh em private parts...especially the coconut papaya...you&#x27;ll be yummy smelling and delectable all over...don&#x27;t ask me how I know, just trust me...enough said about that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is supposed to be great for tightening the skin and preventing wrinkles.  I don&#x27;t know if this is true since I&#x27;m 41 with no wrinkles so far, so I say, cool, don&#x27;t have none, won&#x27;t be none especially if I use these products.  Win Win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is a little more expensive than your average chemical filled soap but it&#x27;s worth it. I was using Dove which I would pay $7 for 8 bars. Now, I pay $10 for 4 with one bar lasting about 3 weeks since now my boyfriend decided to use the soap too and I&#x27;m spending a lot more time in the shower with it but it is so much better for my skin so I don&#x27;t sweat the price.  And for those who complain that it discolors white wash clothes..fooey, don&#x27;t use white wash clothes then!  I use dark colored ones and don&#x27;t have a problem with discoloration.  Wash clothes are cheap...you can always replace them and buy more...you only get one skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****update 08/08/2011*****&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the soap for a few months now and I did a test, I had a pimple and silly me, I kept picking at and it resulted in a very dark spot on my face once it was gone. Decided this was the perfect time to really see if this removes spots since I had a fresh one. So I continued using the black soap/coconut papaya soap, rosewater as toner, and coconut oil as moisturizer combination and that dark spot is completely gone. It did take 4 weeks but it was very dark. So, these products do remove dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****update 12/10/2013*****&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now a little over 2 years since I&#x27;ve been using the African Black Soap.  I have it on autoship since I can&#x27;t live without it.  I would like to report that those large stretch marks I had on my upper thighs are just about gone.  Some are completely gone and the other \\&quot;deeper\\&quot; or shall I say darker ones are barely visible.  Another 6 months or so and I think they will all be gone. This soap has done wonders for my skin.  I only use it every other day now on my face because it can be drying but daily on my body.  I also noticed that I took it with me on vacation at a nice spa and it did not stain the white towels at all.  It rinsed completely out hence verifying that if you use expensive, good quality washcloths it won&#x27;t stain.  It only stains cheap, low count cotton cloths.  But like I said before, wash cloths are a dime a dozen, but you only have 1 skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I will like to say that I do not work for the company and they did not pay me anything for the review...not even a free bar of soap...not even a thank you, so please don&#x27;t accuse me of working for them just because I gave it a great review because I love the product and believe in how it has helped MY SKIN. If you don&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t buy it. Thanks.t I&#x27;m not complaining.

            <li> Never go wrong with Dudu-Osun brand.  I tried a liquid pump brand from Whole foods, no to my liking.  I also wash my hair with this soap.  I&#x27;m AA with 3c/4a thick hair and this feels so good!  My skin always thanks me when I use this soap.</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> I occasionally get eczema and this clears it up.  Takes awhile to work but I prefer this over chemical creams.</li>
            <li> This soap was good for 2 weeks. It made my skin smooth and cleared it up for a while. After a while my skin started to itch, burn and turn red and very dry. Dudu-osun African black soap is not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Not enough words to tell how I&#x27;m in love with this soap. It cleans the skin very well and deep. Simply amazing and rejuvenating</li>
            <li> Honestly, i am leery of buying products from Nigeria. There dont seem to be many checks and balances as far as anything goes in that country. The strong rule, the weak suffer. However, after reading all the reviews, i decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;First off, the name Dudu-osun (but specifically the Dudu part) was a hilarious way to tease my kids. Imagine their shock at finding a dark brown bar of soap named \\&quot;Dudu\\&quot; in the shower. Priceless! In fact, that alone would have made the purchase worth it.&lt;br /&gt;However, the real truth is that the soap smells and feels great, and leaves my skin feeling and looking healthier. I admit, that isnt really a problem for me, but my girlfriend has some skin issues from time to time, and she absolutely loves this soap as well. I can see the difference in fact.&lt;br /&gt;So, thumbs up and five stars. (I bought the four pack for $10, btw)</li>
            <li> I was surprised, it leaves my sink feeling clean, and soft.  It smells ok too.</li>
            <li> I have given this a 3 star rating, because my husband loves this soap!...He wants me to continue buying it...he likes the way it rinses clean while showering.    Myself on the other hand, I am also Asian like the reviewer, Eka, and I also didnt like the way the DuDu soap reacted on me...I see the other reviewers and comment saying to not use a wash cloth or a shower puff, loofta, etc, and that we should put the soap on our hands and rub it on our bodies...Well..that&#x27;s how I used it, ( No washcloth or loofta, etc.)...and when done my skin also burnt AND ITCHED. Now of course, I decided I could keep using this soap hoping that the sensation would go away....but why bother when I&#x27;ve tried other African soaps that do NOT do that. I bought these because of the price. Personally, I love the big chunk of Black soap they sell here on Amazon, *with the Shea butter in it!*...My skin feels sooo soft after using that...yet clean when rinsing off, without the skin irritation...You may want to try that! I am going to order more....unless I find another Black soap bar with Neem Oil and Shea Butter in it...that&#x27;s what I AM REALLY looking for!...but until then...I will continue using the big Black soap with Shea butter 1 Lb. chunk.  The price of the 1 Lb chunk is also very good..and it lasts a LONG TIME!</li>
            <li> This has helped my complexion a lot. i have oily/acne prone skin, and while im not sure if it has helped with the acne itself, it has helped with the overall texture and brightness of my skin. i use a cetaphil bar to take off my makeup then i use this to cleanse my face. it can be drying so i make sure to use a lot of moisturizer afterwards. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Reading all the reviews on this soap make me laugh... I was thinking about getting some for my wife. Ha FOE GET DAT!!! Then I re-read the name of the soap. NO wonder so many people are having bad reactions to this soap.. Its DU DU soap. Soap is to get rid of du du not put it on.. Think about what your buying PEOPLE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now lets see how many people can comment on my bad review. Like the employees of the company selling this product that get paid for going online and writing good reviews and rebutting on the bad ones? How you guys doing?</li>
            <li> doesnt smell the best but i swear this soap has done wonders for my skin! i highly recommend for anyone suffering from acne or acne scars to give this soap a shot :)</li>
            <li> The soap might look unappealing, but it works quite well. I feel squeaky clean after each use and it smells great. Used it for two weeks now. However, my eczema and dry skin shows no improvement or worsening effect from the soap. So, I think I&#x27;ll stick to my old regimen of oatmeal baths and sarna lotion to relieve my skin.</li>
            <li> Actually was looking for something for my son-in-law to try for his ecxema and found this. Told my daughter about it, and she ordered some. After it arrived at her house and they tried it, they loved it, and it helped the excema tremendously!  I decided to order some, and now I&#x27;m hooked and so is my son and daughter-in-law! Now the whole family is hooked on this wonderful soap. It is absolutely the best smelling soap we have ever used. When someone is taking a shower, you start to smell the fragrance drifting out of the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;As for the skin care part, it cleans perfectly, leaves you squeaky clean, and smelling fresh. It has actually helped to reduce the appearance of my rosacea, which is truly unbelievable!!!! It works on old scars and those are disappearing. Now I have slightly oily skin, but do not  find this soap drying, as some others do. No one in my family has any problems with the soap. If you have any irritations anywhere, this soap will tingle a bit, almost like an antiseptic, it is nothing I find painful and it seems to help heal any chafing.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wash my face at night with the soap and the tingling feels good, and I think the tingling comes from some slight irritations from using a night cream of retinol! It&#x27;s nothing I can see, but it&#x27;s there anyway!&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance of this soap is an outdoorsy-type scent, kind of a pine, cedar, and green smell to it. I&#x27;ve read that some ppl hate the smell and can&#x27;t use it, but we are in love with it, and I&#x27;m ready to order again, in a larger amount this time. You do have to keep the bar up and away from puddles of water, as it will melt. Just keep it dry and it lasts quite a while, even with three adults using it. My son bathes his 2 year old with it, also, and it does nothing to her beautiful skin, but make is smoother, and more porcelain looking!  You MUST try this soap!![[ASIN:B0023A7JF4 Dudu-osun African Black Soap (100% Pure) Pack of 4]]</li>
            <li> I love this soap I wash my face and my body with it. I dnt really care for the smell. I have notice that it is helping clearing my skin. I still have break outs. But it does help with the pain of the pimps. I also been using tea tree oil and has also really help with the few break outs I get. My face is not has red and swollen senice I been using the black soap I love it! My pores are not has big I can tell a big difference in my blackheads. But I have notice that everything I&#x27;m foing is drawing all of the bad stuff out of my pores and causing some breakouts which is fine because it&#x27;s coming out. I wash my face twice at night to make sure that I get everything off my face. Has a toner I use witch hazel in the morning and apple cider vinegar and water at night. For moisturizer I use a light one mine change all the time but I mix it with tea tree oil and. Hyaluronic acid and vitamin E oil. I hope this helps somebody.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It really is the best, all natural soap you can get for your body.  I had tinea versa color and the Dr. wanted to give me a medical shampoo and medical cream to help clear the spots. Well, since I was pregnant during the time I didn&#x27;t want to risk any medicine that was not  necessary. Well, after a few days of using the soap the spots had cleared up and about 90 percent gone after one week of use.&lt;br /&gt;My son who is 2.5 has a lot of allergies and bad eczema. The Dr. recommended cetaphil which is a good cleanser but the black soap worked faster and not to mention it is a lot cheaper.  I have had a number of mom&#x27;s ask me how I got rid of my son&#x27;s eczema and so I told them to get this black soap, and they all have and was happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the bar is great, nice a clean. We also use the black soap shower gel which is nice too but there is something about the bar that seems a bit more pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT! once you use it in the shower or bath, take it away from water. I first kept it in the shower (we have a separate shower /bath) and after a few weeks it dissolved. So take it out and place it in a dry area until you are ready for your next use.</li>
            <li> I realize that this is not meant to be a refined product, but these bars were obviously &#x27;seconds&#x27;.  Bars were mangled and unsightly -beyond rustic- with some really suspicious looking tunneling.  Tossed them.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I love this soap. Or should I say \\&quot;cold cream\\&quot;.  It works wonders.  I have been using it since September 26th.  I wet my face and neck area with hot water to open my pores, work up a good lather (it lathers up so creamy and thick, like cold cream) It tingles a bit but nothing extreme.  I then take a white wash cloth and work it in, rinse my face and dry off. It leaves my face a little dry in areas but I have extremely oily skin so that does not bother me. I do follow with a little shea butter as a moisturizer and UV protectant. I can see a difference in my skin already.  My goal is to even out my skin tone. I have uneven discoloration, a burn and acne scars. I can see a fading of the dark marks taking place.  I choose not to use bleaching creams due to the negative effects. Another great thing about this product is that it leaves your skin baby soft. It is working wonderfully in my opinion.  I give this product 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> So, there were a few people wondering if it was ok for white ppl to use an African soap.  Yes, and you are racist!  Jk.  I was wondering the same thing.  I thought, black people use different shampoo for their hair, maybe they use different products for their skin.  Well, I bought the soap because it is all natural, and because ppl claimed that it cleared up acne.  I too have seen those results.  The only thing negative is that it kind of burns a bit on your nether regions.  Maybe it&#x27;s a psychosamatic thing.  Also, don&#x27;t use anything white to lather the soap in.  It will turn the color of the soap.  I have already replaced my first order.</li>
            <li> Great soap! Gave a few to my sister who has severe eczema and this soap works wonders for her.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD FOR PSORIASIS. It make my skin red and dry.  Caused major flare-ups.  Switched to Dove with moisturizer and it was way better.</li>
            <li> Good for acne, and doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell.Shipped quickly and on time.  We have been using this soap for about a year now.</li>
            <li> Love this soap..I have bad skin acne and this seams to tame it..it also leaves your skin fealing clean</li>
            <li> Very fragrant, leaves your skin feeling very smooth. Very large bars last for a long time. The texture and fragrance may not be for everyone&#x27;s liking though.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. Will be buying more as soon as she tells me shes out..</li>
            <li> Let me tell you a story with both ups and downs. I bought this product because of reviews on this site and other internet sources. I have acne prone, oily skin and wanted to see if something new would work better than what I was using. When I recieved the product I was so excited to see what type of results I would get. The first time I used it I lathered up a wash cloth with thick foam and washed my face with gusto. My face started burning right away but I continued on thinking this something that would pass. After rinsing and splashing on water for quite a while my face continued to burn. The next day my face had a scalines/scabbyness that took a few days to heal. It wasn&#x27;t terrible to look at but was inconvenient. I checked the expiration date and it was fine. I opened up a new bar and tried again this time I was a little more gentle and used the soap more sparingly when my face started to burn I rinsed it off immediately. It took several more tries to get it right.&lt;br /&gt;  What I&#x27;m saying is it took some trial and error to find the way it works for me. Now I love the stuff. I wet my face and hands rub one hand lightly on the bar and work up a light lather on my face and rinse, I might repeat if my skin was very oily or I&#x27;m removing makeup or sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t use black soap every time I was my face. If I exfoliate I stay away from it. Right now my skin is doing great. My pores seem smaller, I get blemishes rarely, and I seem to have less redness. I don&#x27;t know if the black soap is wholly responsible but I do think it is a factor. My recomendation is to try this product, but be careful and listen to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;  Good luck finding what&#x27;s right for you!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap! I swear I read a lot of the reviews and feared I would be one of those people who wouldn&#x27;t see results. I saw some people daid that it help cleared skin. I was just hoping it would give me a clean wash and help with my dry skin. Well it did give me a clean wash and help with dry skin. Well it sorta dries you out but if you suffer from itchy skin from unknown allergens like I do then it will help. Why I was really impresses was the fact that it did clear up my skin in a matter of days. Now I don&#x27;t suffer from bad acne. I have been blessed with good skin but since moving half way across the country the heat of where I live has made me break out really bad with nothing to help it. This cleared me up in days. I don&#x27;t know if this is the solution but this added with my regular face regimen has done wonders!</li>
            <li> AMAZING scent and it leaves your skin feeling so smooth. Definitely would recommend to anyone who has dry skin!</li>
            <li> I recently bought the African black soap because I wanted an all natural product for my skin. {I tend to break out in a rash from certain chemicals in skin products} I know it&#x27;s usually not used by white people, but I tried it anyway.I will never use anything else on my skin or hair but that soap from now on! It is a miracle for me! It smells great, Takes away blemishes and evens out skin tone.not to mention how soft and shiny my hair is! After about two weeks of use, A rather large scar on my breast from surgery,has almost disappeared!It&#x27;s a blessing for me! I encourage fair skinned people to try it also!</li>
            <li> I love black soap &amp; it keeps my skin exfoliated. These bars r in a very convenient size &amp; shape.</li>
            <li> I ordered Dudu-Osun African Black Soap from Renee&#x27;s General Store on 02/22/10 and have yet to recieve my purchase. I paid standard shipping, and when I posted my concerns Renee&#x27;s General Store said that I should have email my request to get my items early. Any business who strives to retain good paying customers should make it a common practice to \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; the customer... On-time service should be a given. On-time service is not something to be solicisted by customers. Getting the item to the customer early is wonderful. If a business does this, it says to the customer, \\&quot; I appreciate your business\\&quot;. In return that customer will stay loyal and buy more product.  But, failing to meet a client&#x27;s minimal  expectations reeks of inefficientcy, speaks to poor time management skills, and translate into lossed revenue due to loss of unhappy customers. On-time service shipment is a customer&#x27;s minimal expectation. \\&quot;When you are late it says to the other party that you don&#x27;t care about their time\\&quot;. It stains your repretation, and dilutes your credibility. And it  makes me wonder about the quality of the product that I&#x27;ve yet to recieve.  We are more than a few days into March, and I&#x27;m still waiting...Sandra.</li>
            <li> I am very happy so far with the Dudu-osun African Black Soap. I have always had a problem with acne since my pre-teens. It has stopped the breakouts and it is also lighting the dark spots from past damage. My remey is washing my face twice a day, followed by shea butter, and in the morning I appy sun screen. Don&#x27;t wear oil base make up anymore everyday. I have seen a real improvement in the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> THIS SOAP GETS THE JOB DONE AND EXCEEDS ALL OF YOUR EXPECTATIONS. IT WILL LEAVE YOUR SKIN BABY SOFT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> This should be the only soap everyone in the world should use. I&#x27;ve been through so many products, I can&#x27;t even begin to describe my disappointment. I just figured I was the problem. But then I saw the results of this soap on my best friend over the course of 3 months, and decided to try it. I&#x27;ve decided to wait 3 months myself to see if it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it does! It tones the skin, makes it smoother,  and best of all, it does fight acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it as a body soap and my boyfriend started commenting on my skin&#x27;s smoothness and glow after the first week. I tried it as a shampoo and my hair has gotten so much thicker, and so much stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s been working because I stopped using it for one night and my skin broke out again. It&#x27;s best used twice a day, and for even better results, use it with a mud masque twice or thrice a week. It works miracles, trust me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap! This is the 3rd time I have ordered it &amp; could never go without it! Clears up adult &amp; teenage acne very quickly.. Once you use it your gonna be hooked I promise you that!</li>
            <li> Pretty good soap. Lives up to all of the reviews. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> This is really awesome soap.  It really gets down and dirty with my skin, pulling lots of crap out.  Afterwards, my skin looks fresh and the tone looks even and creamy!  I could do without the smell, though... I&#x27;m just not a fan of it at all.  I&#x27;d rather it smell like dirt than whatever they put in this.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for my daughter and me as we have very sensitive skin and my daughter was getting tiny, red bumps on the tops of her arms. We just started using this soap a couple of weeks ago. My skin seems to love it. I have not had any breakouts or irritation from it (itchy or otherwise). It smells really nice, to me. Kind of like soap and citrus? Hard to explain. I enjoy it. It does not leave a residue on you or your tub (no slippery tubs to deal with). It leaves your skin squeaky clean. I have some breakouts on my face and was hoping this would help and I do see a significant improvement in that area. Plus, my skin just looks healthier. DON&#x27;T let it get in your nose or mouth or eyes (or any tender area...) as it will sting!!! I believe this is the citrus in the soap. It is a very good product and I will definitely buy it again, but I knocked one star off for price. I was hoping one bar of soap would last a really long time, but mine is already halfway gone and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks. Still, if it works, I will pay the price!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. helps reduce my back acne. it does sting if you leave it on your skin for longer than say 3-5min. I have no problem using this twice daily. does not give me dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this soap is so good but I bought it for my eczema and skin discolorations. Well the eczema stopped itching and the discolorations are slowly fading. (Would fade faster if I stayed away from sunlight and I have to remember the sunscreen) Low and behold, I told my husband about it and now he uses it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I am also going to send some to my sisters for their dry skin too. This soap works and it smells good too. Just remember to use dark wash cloths or do what my husband does:&lt;br /&gt;lather it up real well in the shower, rub the lather all over your body and rinse: no wash cloth needed. (I guess it helps to have bigger hands)</li>
            <li> They arrived as expected, made the box smell REALLY LOVELY!!! I have enjoyed this soap for years and will contiune!!</li>
            <li> Different experience from what I&#x27;m used to but I had to try it bc it had such wonderful reviews... Smells good and works well!</li>
            <li> This is the best natural soap that I&#x27;ve ever tried ... NO chemicals etc used ; just all natural. It lathers up really well and has a slight fragrance making it OK for men as well as women ....&lt;br /&gt;When I run out; I will be ordering MORE ...</li>
            <li> Since I started using this soap I haven&#x27;t had a bad eczema out break in years I recommend this for anyone who has eczema. I will be purchasing some more soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of soaps over the years, and I&#x27;m not usually picky. While my sisters would use their high priced natural soaps, I&#x27;d be using my &amp;#34;gross&amp;#34; Irish Spring soap. Chemicals? What did I care, as long as I got clean and the soap was cheap. I still buy soap like that in large packages for everyday use. But I felt like buying something special for my wife and decided to give this a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out for myself and found that this soap left me feeling refreshed. My skin felt tighter, healthier, and yeah, it smelled nice too. The only &amp;#34;downside&amp;#34; of this soap is probably that it bleeds brown all over the place, so you&#x27;ll want to keep it in a soap dish, even in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you should exercise caution when treating any skin condition, and there&#x27;s absolutely no telling what will be a skin irritant or allergen to anyone, so I imagine that explains the negative reviews. As for myself, I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who isn&#x27;t super picky about their soaps (ya, know, gluten-free organic, free-range, blessed by a priest, made-only-by-monks-in-tibet-fed-a-vegan-diet soap). For me, it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> This soap is great, I read some earlier reviews about the smell of the soap. It smells wonderful. I haven&#x27;t used it for a week yet and already the spots on my face are starting to fade. My face feels so smooth. I absolutely love this soap. I&#x27;m gonna used this from now on.</li>
            <li> I bought my first 4 bars with tad suspicion. I didn&#x27;t think soap could do everything the previous reviewers said it could. Happily I was wrong. The soap is amazing. It has worked wonders on my adult acne and my kids teenage acne. We&#x27;ve also notices a difference in our pores as well. They seem to be less noticeable. Our results started showing up after using it a week twice a day, once in the morning and once before bed. My only issue, minor, is the soap, if left in any amount of standing water dissolves quickly. Since that&#x27;s more on me than the company I&#x27;ll still give it 5 stars and ensure the soap remains away from any puddles. This is my second order of Dudu-sun and I&#x27;ll order more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance. Leaves your skin feeling renewed.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that actually gives me clear skin AND isn&#x27;t expensive!  LOVE!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love his product but unfortunately I have sensitive skin and cannot use it daily.</li>
            <li> Great product so far I feel fresh and clean after I shower. Waiting for more positive changes as I just started.</li>
            <li> I received my order within a few days :).  After one use of this soap, I must say, it left me with an unfamiliar feeling compared to the popular soaps.  It made me feel cleaner. I also noticed that my skin and face felt tighter and appeared to have more of a golden tone.  The only flaw is it really dries your skin so be sure to have a great moisturizer on hand.  I use Nubian Heritage&#x27;s Coconut and Papaya lotion.  The scent (flowers) of the soap itself is a little strong for my taste, but it doesn&#x27;t leave you with a strong body scent.  I stored mine in a travel soap container, because like other soaps, it runs, but it runs black (not a good look for the shower).  If you have sensitive skin, this may not be the soap for you.  After making fun of it&#x27;s name and appearance all evening, my wife also noticed a differece in my skin.  Now she wants to use it.  I will definately buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the soap.The smell is very nice and lite.Good for sensitive skin.One of the bars came in broken during shipping that would be only thing I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I have posted a review about a week ago on the general outstanding performance and some tips about the soap (such as sensitive skin experiencing \\&quot;burning\\&quot; the first few times if you are not gentle, brief breakout period and then it disappears, being gentle &amp; patting dry with your towel is your sensitive, ect). Now, I tried shampooing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampooing with the soap: I have extremely thick, dark, horse hair, so I was VERY nervous about trying this bar of soap in my hair as \\&quot;shampoo.\\&quot; However, as well as it performs on my general skin &amp; having read a few others reviews about using it as shampoo, I gave it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the bar as shampoo I was MISERABLE. Let me explain: the soap didn&#x27;t tangle, but it felt like a huge solid wet clump of wet spaghetti &amp; got to the squeaky clean state right away so I rinses as best as I could. Then, a towel dried and blow dried. It was like blowdrying a clump of thick wet boiled spaghetti. After I FINALLY finished (it took quite a bit longer), it was very thick &amp; full, shiny, and a bright vibrant lighter brown color. Very interesting. Unfortunately, I was absolutely miserable until my next days shower because it felt very heavy and like there was a residue in it, like having over conditioned or having a bunch of thick new gel stuff in it. I kept playing with it and it almost seemed like my hand was a tad sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try #2: I decided to try it again, but with a rinse. I used the soap as before, it didn&#x27;t tangle, and rinsed the spaghetti clump as best as I could. Then, I used a small amount of shampoo and did a quick lather &amp; rinse. It lathered a ridiculous amount, but I could definitely feel a HUGE difference upon the second rinse. It was still thick and heavy, but I could feel the layers. Then, I towel dried (almost seemed like normal hair) and blow dried. MIRACLE! It blow dried how it would normally for the most past, but I was absolutely thrilled to feel normal textured hair, but it was SUPER SHINY and very very SOFT. Also, it retained enough of the soap that it was fuller and thicker than normal. It still seems like it&#x27;s almost a shade lighter, maybe it&#x27;s from the extreme shine and you can see the layers? I LOVED IT! I hadn&#x27;t told my husband I used it again and he commented on my hair that it felt super soft today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS: twice the work, but absolutely worth it. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t take the time to do this everyday, but if I have a big day or event coming up- I&#x27;m absolutely using this routine the day before and the day of. Holy cow was my hair shiny, full, and soft!! I LOVE this soap.... and now shampoo... Buy it, buy it!Also, it retained enough of the soap that it was fuller and thicker than normal.

            <li> This product really cleans the skin and you really feel it, it is also great on my hair too leaves it tangle free and it didn&#x27;t dry it out. Yes I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I started using this soap on my face.Been trying different expensive soap to help clear up my acne and return my face back to the smooth texture it was before I started breaking out, but none of these soap worked. This soap  makes my face feel smooth and it also dries up my acne.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this kind of soap.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting the color of the soap to come off on my hands and my towels.  Other than that this soap is very nice and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> My wife &amp; I really like this soap, we will buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black soap. It&#x27;s not a miracle cure for acne like everybody on this is raving. I&#x27;ve gone through 8 bars of JUST this soap for the last few months and I still have breakouts. It smells like playdoh, and if your soap bar is anywhere in the path of your shower stream, it will dissolve quicker than any bar of soap you&#x27;ve ever owned. It also leaves a brown pool wherever you put it. I&#x27;m leaving 3 stars because it does a decent job with oily skin.</li>
            <li> i really like it cleans well. Has a nice smell to it i plan on buying more. it a nice product</li>
            <li> I am a habitually order this soap bc of its toning effects that it does for my skin</li>
            <li> This soap makes my face fill so smooth.  I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I have searched local health food stores for about 5 years, always looking for this soap but never finding it. A friend had told me that it might help my cystic rosacea, and my husbands shaving &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34;. At last...my &amp;#34;Duh!&amp;#34; moment and I found it here. This stuff is amazing. No, it&#x27;s not a miracle, but darned close. My skin has improved immensely and any little sebum bumps ANYWHERE (including hubby&#x27;s bum) have totally disappeared. As other have said, this soap is intended to exfoliate, and it does. We followed the advice to not use a bath puff or cloth and only used our hands. So far, after several months of use we&#x27;ve not had any dry skin issues, and we live in the Mile High dry zone and its brrrrrr...winter!</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my psoriasis</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what, but this soap does something good to your skin. After use, my skin feels like it&#x27;s slightly taught and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am satisfied that it does a pretty good job of protecting my face from the ravages of harsh weather.</li>
            <li> I suffer from postherpetic neuralgia, and this Dudu-Osun African Black soap is wonderful.  It is truly a god-send.  It smells good, and it slowly has helped me with my skin condition.  My skin is not as itchy as it had been before.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this soap. I started getting away from anti-bacterial liquid and bar soaps that contain triclosan and chose this soap. I thought it was expensive for 4 bars of soap, but it lasts so long and lathers up really well with very little soap that it&#x27;s actually a bargain and comparable in price to regular bar soap. I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying it.</li>
            <li> As regular soap use, not bad but...my husband told me he loves other brand. Dudu-Osun is cheaper than other brand but smells not good.</li>
            <li> i started getting red marks on my body</li>
            <li> Best I like it cleaning very wel when you use after shave no bump at all , it works for me !!! Try</li>
            <li> This black soap produces the most luxurious lather I have ever experienced with any soap. I also love the earthy smell of it.  My face seems deeply cleansed and smoother after I use it.  This soap does dry out my skin a little bit though, so I have to apply shea butter to my face immediately after washing. This soap cleanses my skin so well that I am willing to deal with the little bit of dryness it causes.  So far I love the combination of this soap with shea butter as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Smells good and really makes your hair have a lot of volume if you use it on your scalp, but it does give it a new texture too.</li>
            <li> I mainly bought this for a friend who has a son that suffers severely from eczema and i am hoping it helps. I tried this and it definitely leaves my skin soft and it has not stained my tub so that&#x27;s good. It smells really nice and it is a little strong but nothing that gives me a head ache.</li>
            <li> As someone who is used to buying black soap during their trips to West Africa, I am always dismayed when I run out of this stuff. Now that I&#x27;ve found Dudou-Osun on Amazon, I don&#x27;t have to hoard my soap that I bring home from my trips. Black soap is the only thing that keeps my itchy tinea versicolor in check and I&#x27;m so glad to have found a quality and authentic black soap that is delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li> Great soap but you have to be careful to rinse it of quickly,  because it could burn and leave your face feeling raw and red. I am afro Hispanic with olive complexion and really like this soap.</li>
            <li> I bought to erase some stretch marks. I am not sure that it is the magical wonder product that some think it is, but my skin feels just great after using this. It&#x27;s a very nice smelling soap and I will continue using hoping to see some results.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I will use!! It has cleared my skin up so well since I&#x27;ve been deployed. It leaves my skin a little tight sometimes, but I just moisturize with some raw shea butter &amp; it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> Very good soap for sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about a week now and love it. Smells great and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> Allegric reaction big time I can&#x27;t used this soap ever again</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I ordered 4 bars to use for acne on my face. This soap has cleared up most of the acne I still have a few dark spots but they are not as bad as they were. I use morning and night and then air dry before applying a mild moisturizer. If you battle with bad skin I would definitely try this product. I have oily skin and I needed the moisturizer so I advise when you order the soap to also order a moisturizer. It took about 1 month for me to see significant changes in my skin but you will notice less new acne spots and black heads right away. 4 bars have lasted me over 6 months so one order is enough to try and see if the soap works for you. I&#x27;ve tried other black soaps and they don&#x27;t compare to this one.</li>
            <li> this is NOT AFRICAN black soap.  the ingredients are similar, but it is slightly different.  this made my skin is not very bad to begin with, but this made it much worse!</li>
            <li> Love,love, love this soap. Where has this soap been all my life. I wear makeup 350 days a week, this soap works so well, you can wipe your face after washing with a white towel.!! No makeup residue. True Diva!</li>
            <li> Not a miracle product. I&#x27;ve been suffering from moderate acne for over 10 years &amp; this soap is just OK. But I will definitely keep using it.  Warning: it will burn the hell out of your face when you first start using it LOL.</li>
            <li> Great on skin, leaves a very clean feel but can be messy in shower and on counter top leaving behind black residue! Although it&#x27;s helpful being able to always tell when there&#x27;s soap left behind ;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that this soap can do miracles, like other stated. I do have light eczema, but I did not see positive results from using this soap. It looks terrible too, and messy. I would not recommend to use it on the whole body, avoid the private part (for females), because I got uti and had to take antibiotics for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soap free of chemicals. I like it. Is it a miracle.? I don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd pack of this soap. Great for my husband skin irritation and he likes it as a shampoo too.  I really like it for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and is really creamy. Can feel the clean! Daughter likes it for teenage skin. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scented soap.  It left my skin soft, and lightly scented.  This is a good soap to use for dry skin.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I was determined that this product was great. It actually dried out my skin on my stomach and made me break out :x I will not be using this product anymore nor do I recommend it.</li>
            <li> We have been using the soap now for two months. I just purchased 12 more bars. So far its a great soap and the smell is great. works great for my son who has acne. We use it everyday. I would suggest trying it and just make sure you wash off well after using as it does lather up fast! aroma can be strong but  wash off, and rinse! highly sugget this soap.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick.&lt;br /&gt;The product is great aside from the fact that it is drying but nothing a toner and moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.  Prior to using this soap I had a huge flared cyst on my cheek and subsequently to using the soap it minimized it so much, enough that I&#x27;m not so self conscious about it.  The cyst hasn&#x27;t gone away but it hasn&#x27;t flared up since I&#x27;ve been using this soap.  I&#x27;ve been using for a month, mostly in the mornings.  I&#x27;m happy with the results thus far.</li>
            <li> Received Early, product as expected.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap now for 2 months , my skin is clear and lovely. Some people have a issue with the smell, it dose not bother me.&lt;br /&gt; the soap works perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you</li>
            <li> I was very leery about using &#x27;Black Soap&#x27;, in my new tub. However, I used it and I love it! It smells so good and is non staining. I wash my hair with it and it cleans my hair very well. I gave a friend a bar and also my daughter and they both love it! This soap is great!</li>
            <li> This soap smells delicious and feels luxurious and natural. I could smell it out of the box, and it filled the bathroom with a subtle beautiful clean aroma. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m digging these soaps, my skin smells nice hours after my shower. I keep the bars of soap out on a shelf my bathroom smells nice too :) I  have nothing bad to say about these soaps, I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this last year and after each use, there was always a stinging burning sensation down there inmy inner lady parts, other soap don&#x27;t give me that problem. Wasn&#x27;t even worth returning so I tossed it</li>
            <li> The soap is very good. I bought it because it&#x27;s natural and it&#x27;s supposed to help with acne. It hasn&#x27;t done anything miraculous yet (been using it everyday for a month) but it is a great soap that has a nice scent and leaves you feeling clean</li>
            <li> I suffer from keratosis pilaris and so I tried out a couple different brands of black soap, hearing good things about it&#x27;s chemical exfoliation, and wanting to keep my skincare routine natural. Right now this is my favorite brand of black soap. It&#x27;s not too harsh, I can use it on my face, and even use it with a wash cloth (for some other kinds a wash cloth would be too harsh). While my KP hasn&#x27;t gone away, I notice the soap keeping it at bay moreso than with others.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap i&#x27;ve ever used . I bought the 6 pack and gave 2 bars to friends, they loved it too. I found since using the soap I don&#x27;t have to shave my legs near as often as I did when not using this soap. My skin and my face feel so smooth now. My husband uses it too all the time. I am now ordering my second 6 pack.</li>
            <li> the smell is a little harsh, but what it does for my skin makes it VERY tolerable!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have phsorisis and its only mild.. after I statred using this soap, cleared it right up.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all the creams and oils, nothong worked..Simply amazed!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll def purchase again!</li>
            <li> Gave me harsh rashes!!</li>
            <li> I really love the smell. Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. Used it for a week on my face and then notice my boyfriend secretly started using my soap because he noticed a change in my skin...will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem that much better than regular soap to me. Also leaves dark brown residue anywhere I put it when it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t do any harm either and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3/4 weeks &amp; I love the smell but so far I haven&#x27;t seen a change in my skin. I saw on the reviews someone said it worked for their KP (Keratosis Pilaris) which is what I have on my arms &amp; legs. So far no change :( I was really hoping I&#x27;d see some results in a week or two but nothing so far, I still have two bars left &amp; I will continue to use them. Wish I could give a higher rating but didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately!</li>
            <li> I use this almost all the time.The product doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would but it does the job.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and moist from using this soap. I even wash my face with the soap and have seen an improvement. I have less breakouts and dark spots are vanishing. Make sure after you shower that you place the soap on a dry paper towel.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing.  I have experienced mild acne for most of my adult life, but since I have been over 50 it has changed in nature.  Although my skin is generally dry, when I do get a blemish it lasts longer and leaves scarring whereas this was not the case when I was younger.  This soap has been a spectacular find!  I am a Caucasian woman aged 66 with very light, freckled skin and light hair and eyes.  I don&#x27;t have any deep lines in my face, but have been plagued with pesky acne, especially on my chin and the corners of my mouth.  Within one week of using this soap my skin was clear and I have had very few new breakouts as long as I use it regularly (usually daily in the morning).  I have been using it for nearly 3 months and it has also started to fade some brown spots on my face which is a wonderful plus !!  My skin does have a tendency to be dry, so I follow up with a moisturizer and I am good to go.  I would recommend this soap to anyone who has a problem with skin eruptions.  I would expect that it works excellently on acne on other parts of the body also.  I have used it in the shower and it seems to work very effectively as a deodorant soap also.  The smell is delightful and I keep a bar in a dish on my vanity.  Very, very happy with this product !!  I&#x27;ve just placed it on an Amazon auto-shipment plan so I will never run out !!!    September Update:  I have been using the Dudu Osun since March and I am still as enthusiastic about the product as I was when I wrote the initial review.  Recently people have been asking about the expiration date on the packaging.  It typically is about 2 years out from the manufacture date.  If you use it regularly you will not ever have a problem using up 4 to 6 bars before the exp date, but I would also like to say that I don&#x27;t see any deterioration in the product from one box to another, so I would not hesitate to use this beyond the date of expiration.  It makes my skin smoother, evens out my complexion of dark spots which have faded considerably since I began using it in March, clears up acne and smells wonderful.  I love that it is all natural and looks hand-made as opposed to so many commercial products.  I continue to be absolutely delighted with Dudu-Osun !!</li>
            <li> I bought the pack of 4 which lasted about 6 weeks. I like that this soap is natural.  It smells nice and gives a good lather. I have pretty sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts from many of the popular over the counter skin products so I was a bit nervous but I didn&#x27;t experience this at all.  I will say, I was hoping the black soap would help to even out my skin tone and help with fading some of my dark spots as so many reviews mention here and as the product description implies with the \\&quot;nature cures\\&quot; but nothing of the sort. However, if you just want to go more natural/organic and have a nice smelling soap that does make your skin feel soft, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I really like the black soap I purchased at Amazon. I had previously&lt;br /&gt;purchased black soap from another company besides Amazon and I liked&lt;br /&gt;it so well (it came in a can)I decided to try the bar soap. I do like&lt;br /&gt;the can soap better, but the bars last forever and they smell so fresh&lt;br /&gt;and clean. Like laundry on the line. I will purchase again. It rinses&lt;br /&gt;very well.</li>
            <li> This soap is great.  The smell of the bar is fantastic.  It makes my whole bathroom smell fresh.  It lathers well, though the black color takes a minute or two to adjust to.  It leaves my skin feeling less dry afterwards than  my normal soap.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this soap to anyone.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This smells like old homes</li>
            <li> Tried this product so I could compare it to a black soap I was previously using, only because it was much cheaper and such a bargain for 4 bars. Unfortunately it irritated my skin and does not exfoliate as I thought it would. If you really want to try a very good black soap, go for the Dermactin-TS Exfoliating Black Soap…This soap exfoliates, fade dark spots, dries out your pimples which helps prevent other problems, and leaves your face feeling so refreshing and light. I purchase this for myself and teenage daughter who uses it daily. The one thing I&#x27;ve learned when looking at cheaper products, is if it&#x27;s not broke than don&#x27;t try fixing it. Therefore I&#x27;m going back to my Dermactin-TS Exfoliating Black Soap.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Not drying.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I was worried about using the soap, but it&#x27;s very good to my skin and I love the smell! The price is amazing  as well :) It does have a drying effect at times though (the stretched face feeling?).</li>
            <li> So when I got the package, I opened it up hoping that the soap would be great to use; even through the plastic it came in, you can SMELL it&#x27;s fragrance! It was daring me 9the soap) to try it haha! So when I did, here is what I experienced with the &amp;#34;Dudu Osun&amp;#34; soap::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The soap bleeds with color when lathering just like the RAW black soap that comes by the pound on Amazon. This is normal, the soap is natural, so it bleeds with vitamins and it&#x27;s elements. Wet-ten your face first, Lather it in your hands with the soap and apply it on, rinse your face, and make pats on your face with a warm towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lime juice in it gives a cooling feeling, you feel it a little bit working on your face. My face is smooth and clear, and I believe it is because of using Dudu Osun, because of the ingredients is has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using it on my body, same for the face, my skin became smooth, but using it for my head, I noticed tight areas on the back of my head near the top wasn&#x27;t as tight after I washed me hair, cut it, and watched it grow back. This is MY experience, it might not work for you, but my hair is not so tight anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The smell is strong but it is not overbearing; you want to smell like this stuff! I wish I could sell this locally, I have improved lives when offering to friends and family. It&#x27;s a large bar of soap that looks like a &#x27;traditional-soap-shaped&#x27; type of soap, no need to cut it like you would with raw Black soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love RAW black soap, but Dudu Osun is currently my &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; :) I love this stuff, works good!</li>
            <li> AMAZING totally transformed my skin I use it all over my face and body. easily remoes my makeup better then any other soap leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized. my eyes are less irritated an red then when using my usual acne soaps and my skin is clearer then when I was using over the counter products. I love this soap I don&#x27;t think I will ever use anything else on my face again</li>
            <li> I got this soap for acne on my face I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now my face is dry and what I believe its doing is pulling all that bad stuff out I guess it gets worse before it gets better but I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts and I believe that my blackheads an little white bumps are fading away it&#x27;s still too early to tell all I know is my face is really dry but I don&#x27;t want to put anything else on it because everything makes my face break out I think I like it I&#x27;ll put another review in about a week or two it definitely takes off all my makeup yea i think its working</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way it nourishes my skin. This soap is a real treat, I will be purchasing it again and again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap. It is well worth the cost. It gives a very refreshing feeling!</li>
            <li> i did research first then ordered this brand and when they arrived I quickly opened one and I kept washing my hands over and over as my hands were so clean and soft it was amazing..then i took a shower with the soap it was truly a delight...i felt so clean yet so refreshed and so soft. No chemicals and all natural..i am sold on it highly advise anyone to start by ordering and using  right away..you will be amazed..GREAT SOAP can use on your hair also..WOW WOW!!!</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome.  I purchased it because I have very oily skin and was prone to breakouts.  It is a little drying but that&#x27;s the reason I purchased it.  I have been using this for five weeks and have noticed a remarkable difference.  Less oily skin and no breakouts.</li>
            <li> Good soap.  Helps with skin irritations and rashes.</li>
            <li> This soap is something I will buy over and over and over again. I have been plagued with skin issue most of my adult life and so many of them have improved thanks to this soap. You can kiss all of you acne routine goodbye if you use this instead!</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. I have suffered from adult acne for years, but since I have been using this soap my skin glows and I love it! I live by it</li>
            <li> I LOVE how this smells, and I love the ingredients. It does seem to be having a positive affect on keeping my dry skin at bay, but it melts so fast in the shower. It&#x27;s similar in price &amp; affect to the charcoal soap I&#x27;ve been buying. Understand that your water will not run &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; while using this soap, meaning, as you&#x27;re washing the water will look &amp;#34;dirty. I also recommend NOT using wash cloth or loofa. You will have better results applying the soap directly to your skin. I paid $11 for a 4 pack and would say that is average. If you find it for less...grab it!  :)  I will be buying this soap again.</li>
            <li> It came earlier than I expected . I been using this soap for over 6 month and my skin looks amazing . Thank you so much for making it possible .</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It doesn&#x27;t look great but it does the job.</li>
            <li> This soap has a nice smell , it cleans perfectly but it some what drys the skin . You can apply a moisturizer after using it.</li>
            <li> I tried this soap out for my acne prone skin and it did not clear my breakouts although it didn&#x27;t make them worse. I don&#x27;t like the waxy/dry feel it leaves so I&#x27;m bummed I know have 4 bars :(</li>
            <li> this soap is great. i use for body and face and have noticed a difference in my skin. I also use apple cider vinegar as a toner and my skin has never felt better. I got a case of acne at 30 years old and this was the only thing that helped, and i seen a difference right away! There are alot of natural soaps out there but this one worked for me so i am sticking with it. oh and you will definitely need a soap dish for this one. it runs black when wet but washes away easily.</li>
            <li> Love the results so far. I haven&#x27;t really been getting any more acne, except really light ones that disappear after a day or two. Significantly reduces redness and the appearance of scars. I love that it&#x27;s natural and soap-free.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and how clean it makes your skin feel. I have ordered it twice now and plan to keep using it!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I&#x27;ve been using it for my entire body and I can seen improvements in my skin condition. This soap last a long time and lathers very well. Since it is somewhat drying, moisturize after use.I will certainly order more.</li>
            <li> i order 8 soap from the dudu-osun but it came other&lt;br /&gt;soap not the one in the picture&lt;br /&gt;i was so disappointment</li>
            <li> I read all the comments on here and l thought that maybe it can solve my acne problem. l started to wash my face, it BURNED my face literally. l felt like l am dying and my face is not sensitive at all. I still carry that redness on my face. SO PLEASE DO NOT BUT THIS SOAP ! IT IS A HOAX !</li>
            <li> I use this product daily.  I bathe and wash my natural hair with it. It&#x27;s the only soap I use.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you lotion after this and watch out washing rectum. lol it works perfect for removing oil though.</li>
            <li> The scent is great. The texture is great. The sudsing is great. The color can look weird on white porcelain, especially if you let it dry, but damn is it nice.</li>
            <li> Clears up my acne right away. Love this stuff for my balls and face not in that order but yea really good.</li>
            <li> great bargain. It&#x27;s way better than the liquid. I use it because i have extremely oily skin and washing it with this soap helps to keep it in control</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this soap. Will be buying it from now on. Made our skin very soft and it smells really great :-)</li>
            <li> Because of previous reviews, I tried it on my face but I had a slight reaction to it (my skin is very sensitive). I then used it on my body and the soap left mine skin soft and supple.  I have had no reaction to using it on my body.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great and froths like a beast! The bars are also huge and last a long time. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> after using a week haven&#x27;t experiance any of the benefits advertised. hasn&#x27;t had a positive effect on psoriasis. skin isn&#x27;t better for using this product.</li>
            <li> Not impress. Made me itchier and drier. I have eczema and I heard black soap would help.  After showering with the black soap my skin was ashen and in worst shape. I immediately lathered on coconut oil, almond oil and petroleum jelly after showering to prevent further itching. I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin &amp; eczema. I&#x27;ve been trying to get away from anything that isnt natural. This soap is better than any Olay or Dove soap you will ever have. It lathers up nicely and leaves my skin feeling softer. It has help controlled my eczema as well.</li>
            <li> MY ACNE CONSIST OF VERY SMALL PIMPLES AND SOMETIMES CYSTIC LARGE ZITS.THAT LEAVE MY FACE WITH VERY LARGE BLACK SPOTS AND A VERY ROUGH APPEREANCE.I SAW A TUTORIAL OF THE SOAP AND DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY. AFTER 2 WEEKS MY SKIN WAS SMOOTH AND FIRM . IT DOES CAUSE A LIL DRYNESS BUT I USE SHEA BUTTER FOR THAT. BUT I MUST SAY I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt; I DONT NEED TO WEAR AS MUCH MAKE UP&lt;br /&gt; AND THE SPOTS HAVE ALSO STARTED  TO  FADE&lt;br /&gt;I ALSO BATH WITH IT AND IT HAS ANICE PLEASANT SENT&lt;br /&gt; AND LEAVE ME FEELING SQEAKY CLEAN&lt;br /&gt; PLUS I GOT 6 BARS FOR 11 BUCKS &amp; FREE SHIPPING THROUGH AMAZON PRIME.</li>
            <li> This soap has been God scent for my son&#x27;s acne prone skin. He swears by this so much we buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this African Black Soap product several times and have had excellent results. It smells great. really like it.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll get over it. I use this on the parts of my body plagued by acne scars and it looks like it&#x27;s fading them along with the use of african shea butter. My skin feels great too.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! I use this especially for my back. I&#x27;d wanted to even out my complexion and it worked wonders. It does take a bit to get used to... My skin was a little sensitive to it initially. The sensitivity went away in about a week.  Love this soap and it smells very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> The product would be great except it is like washing it bleeds color and will make a mess in the bathtub, soap dish, etc. If they could find a way to keep the color from bleeding from the soap it would be excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 3 years now.. It cleans the skin very nicely and lasts a really long time..I have no problem whatsoever with the smell, because it&#x27;s not a bad smell to me...The only drawback is that it burns my feminine parts..You have to be careful using it in that area</li>
            <li> The best decision I have ever made in my entire life. I have oily skin that&#x27;s super prone to acne. I bought this particular brand because this is the one they sell in Lagos (I&#x27;m Nigerian). When I tell you this is the only soap that will ever be used on my face for the rest of my life, I kid you not! This with a clarasonic Mia is a LETHAL combination. My skin is even, brighter and flawless. Not one pimple anywhere. At first my face burned from it but I think it was because I had to get used to the soap. Not burned as in scar but burned THE way cleansers kinda sting. It eventually stops. I use this and a light moisturizer after and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> Been using this soap for years. Great for people with acne.</li>
            <li> I am a African American women in early 30&#x27;s and have suffered with mild acne since my teenage years.  I have scars (black spots) from picking my face over time.  TRUST ME, I have tried everything possible to try to get rid of these scars.  Even tho i rarely get pimples now, its the scaring that will not fade.  Well, let me tell you, I was given this soap by a friend who normally uses it on his own skin, he told me it works, so I decided to try it.  The soap have a mild smell that is bareable, yet it leaves your washcloth, shower and soap dish the same color as the soap.  Once out of the shower you skin is very dry but refreshed.  I also use this soap on my face 2-3 times a day (once n the morning, once after the gym if I go, once at night).  I have been using this soap for 1 month and this soap is fading my darkspots on my face...YEAAAA Black Soap..Will definetly continue using!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I have adult acne and this is the only soap that clears my face and fades the scars.</li>
            <li> These soaps smell nice and organic, but honestly they leave my skin dry and bitter after I use them in the shower. They are not overly special compared to a soap bar at your local Target/Walmart. They get the job done, however, I prefer Dove or Aveeno compared to this soap.</li>
            <li> Just beware that you may break out in a rash.  I have used black soaps before this was the first one that gave a skin reaction.  This happened to me and my girlfriend.  We do not have what you would call sensitive skin</li>
            <li> With a name like &amp;#34;dudu&amp;#34; what should I expect right?  The soap has a &amp;#34;Tropical&amp;#34; scent which smells like...  well... DUDU!</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a while now and I like it very much. It is good for your skin and hair. My skin and hair are very dry and this helps. When I am done taking a shower with this soap I use coconut oil on my skin. It all helps. I will continue to use this product as it helps me very much.</li>
            <li> I got this one for my husband having acne. But not really working for him. Maybe I&#x27;ll try to find other product.</li>
            <li> We just keep buying and buying. Has worked wonders on my adult sons with exzema. If you pair this with a shower filter, you will see drastic changes in your skin!</li>
            <li> This soap leaves stains everywhere and smells weird. My husband asked that i throw it all away and not buy it again. I agree.</li>
            <li> i dont know what this soap is , but i know what it is trying to imitate. it is not dudu osun soap. i purchased dudu oson soap from a different vendor from amazon prior to ordering this soap.  my first order of this soap left dark brown rings around the facebowl. it also melted if left near or around moisture. i could also make a mask with its thick lather on my face. this soap from this vendor does none of this. no ugly  brown rings, does not melt and certainly no thick suds to make a facial mask. it does smell the same original packaging, but it not the same soap. imposter. i had two bars left of which i threw in the trash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and I wanted a soap that was effective and didn&#x27;t dry my skin. This soap accomplishes that and more. My skin is clearer and I&#x27;ve not had as many breakouts. I&#x27;ve also given this to a relative with eczema, and they claim it&#x27;s the best soap ever for their skin.</li>
            <li> Love this so use this soap to clean  when I don&#x27;t want any residue on my skin this soap is great if you have any type of rash or anything</li>
            <li> I love this soap I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and my skin is so much more even. My skin is damaged from the sun, but this soap is helping that issue and I have more radiance and glow on my face now.</li>
            <li> This soap really is blackish brown and smells like Ivoey soap. The color washes off and it cleans skin ok. Not exactly what I thought it would be and do, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and mildly scented.</li>
            <li> I like this soap, I&#x27;ve used it before but I&#x27;ve bought it at a store that carries African American products. Now I know where I can get it when the store is out or I want a convenient way to get it. I received the soap in a timely fashion and the soap is fresh. The only thing I would suggest is the company who makes it should put the item in heavier boxes. This soap is heavy, thick etc which is great but one of my boxes was open on arrival (not the outer packaging), the soap was fine but...</li>
            <li> ...but it works!&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this soap for two days and am already seeing results. I&#x27;m 24 and have really struggled with stress-related acne, but I can already see a difference after the few days I&#x27;ve had this soap. Pesky zits are already clearing up, and my face feels smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you should keep in mind is that it is really strong. Don&#x27;t keep it on your face too long or it will begin to burn, and I&#x27;m sure if you leave on longer you would risk causing irritation to your skin, which could be worse than any acne you already have (this happened to me with a different soap). So just about 15-20seconds of lathering seems like the sweet spot for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does look like poop. If you&#x27;re a prissy person, you won&#x27;t like having this soap in your bathroom. Like most black soaps, it does leave a black residue wherever you place it. This is fine with me, but I know it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to help keep skin cleansed and moisturized. helps prevent pimples and naturally cleans with these organic ethnic soap.</li>
            <li> I cannot go without this soap.  It makes my skin feel refreshed.  Will definitely buy more once I run out.</li>
            <li> It was okay not what I expect</li>
            <li> Just get a little of this stuff and it lathers up great. I used it to wash my face, I&#x27;ve also used it to wash my hair because the ingredients are all natural. The smell is like the bar soap your mom used to wash you with. I really really love this product, however, I think it made my skin too dry or may have put something on my face that didnt do well with my skin type. I noticed I was having small breakouts.. so I went back to my old face wash and haven&#x27;t had a breakout. I do think one should try this product, though. You get 4 bars, it&#x27;s cheap, natural, and lathers really great, it makes things feel &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;. Use a soap dish with it! It stays dark when it washes off. I really really like this soap. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is OK soap. I don&#x27;t feel that it made an impact on our skin issues, however, it did last a very long tome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise to be aware that it can leave stains if you don&#x27;t wash out the tub/shower immediately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural, pleasant smelling, soap.  I have sensitive skin, and it works wonders on my face and body. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing. It makes your skin feel extremely soft. I would certainly recommend this soap to anyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes you feel clean in the shower.  And anybody with skin conditions will find relief.  I think I bought 10 bars last time and after my son visited, I had about 5 left.  This also washes my hair better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I use this daily as a face cleaner/scrub and it does great for any acne problems you may have. It does leave my face somewhat dry but if you use a moisturizer afterwards it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin supple and tight. Smells great and will clear your complexion over time. Use it with shea butter and it evens out your skin tone</li>
            <li> it works so far it can burn little bit at first, just have to get used to it. Nice soap and smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband it works well and lathers well i use it to shave with too.</li>
            <li> This soap is great for people with skin Irritation or eczema. It is gentle and helps keep the skin moist.</li>
            <li> So far I really love this soap. I bought it because my husband and I both have body acne and all kinds of skin problems popping up. When we first started using it we experienced some irritation and dryness but i am so glad that we kept using it bc now we barely need any lotion after showering and the acne on my face (although not the body) is starting to go away. We have been using it about a month and I cant tell you how many people have told me my skin is glowing. It is soft and silky. I really love it.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and it works!!!</li>
            <li> Both my sister and I had at one point some really bad acne that disappeared with time. I wanted to see if this product worked with the scars. I gave one soap to my sister (didn&#x27;t work too much for her), I kept one and hoped that I would rate this item as \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; within a matter of days. The first few days after using it, my face would get really red and dry, weeks later, it would just get dry (sometimes it would hurt, but I bought me a moisturizer for it). After a month I saw no difference in the improvement of my skin, I actually had some breakouts on my hairline and my jaw for not rinsing my face well. Maybe it did help prevent some from appearing, and it did make my face feel clean, and I actually liked the smell. If you are buying this product, do not rub the bar on your face, rub it on your hands until it foams. That foam in your hands is what you will use on your face. Rub gently, and rinse immediately, don&#x27;t let it sit there otherwise your face will turn red (depends on your skin type).</li>
            <li> We love this soap! I purchsed it after being recommended by a friend when I asked what her son use to keep his skin looking so nice. I first tried it whan I purchased from a vendor that came to a vendor sale at my job, liked it and purchased more from Amazon. I then gave a bar to my daughter to try and her splotches are clearing up and her husband says his skin doesn&#x27;t itch like it did before and that it appears to be helping with his eczama. It also helps my son&#x27;s acne without drying his skin out.</li>
            <li> Ok I read all the other reviews before we bought and decided it was worth a one time try. It TOTALLY is.  I have teenagers who haven broken the bank with prescription acne creams....this works better. I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen my daughters face look this good in 3 years.  Sounds like it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but she uses everyday and follows with a good moisturizer and after just 3 weeks she looks beautiful. I&#x27;ve started using as well we will see if it works for old lady spots. We also are Caucasian and found it very helpful.</li>
            <li> I was first introduce to Dudu-osun African Black soap by my daughter. The appearance of the soap made me say I&#x27;m not touching it.  Once she opened the box and I smelled the pleasant fragrance I was sold.  It&#x27;s been a month now and the soap has decreased my acne spots and eliminated several black heads.  I could not believe it. My face feels smooth and looks radiant after I cleanse with this soap.  I must admit I suffer with eczemia so at time my face may feel dry after cleansing. To eliminate the dryness, I use 100% cocobutter and I&#x27;m good to go. This soap does stain light colored clothes so I&#x27;d recommend having separate clothes for your face. The soap does not stain the sink and tub surfaces. Overall,I would recommend this soap to those who have acne and black head problems.</li>
            <li> It worked well.I had soo many whiteheads  You may purge this cause I purged badlyyyy but after my skin was butter. Still have a long way to go tho. But considering how many over the counter acne medication I used that didnt work this got rid of wayy more</li>
            <li> I love this soap sooooo much, it makes your skin so clear and soap, the best about it it is&lt;br /&gt;All natural, I use to use counter soaps and I began to notice what&#x27;s in these soaps and it was all kinds of things not good for the skin, we have to be careful what we put on our skin. But this soap wow, wow, wow, people you need to try it, you will not be disappointed, keep using it , you will see great results, really it real.</li>
            <li> I tried this soap due to the same reason I think most customers out here on Amazon do - the great reviews. I was able to get through three bars before coming to my full opinion on it: it&#x27;s cons out weigh it&#x27;s pros. So short and sweet, here we go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans well compared to other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; soaps, you actually feel like it got the dirt and oil separated from your skin once you get past the fact that you are now bathed in brown water.&lt;br /&gt;- Lasts longer than many soaps, you initially get a significant loss of it&#x27;s mass straight away as it is hand packed, but once its been used that slows down and you can then suffer it&#x27;s cons for that much longer...&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s brown and it will stain everything it touches except your body. Expect your shower and towels to look like Mr. Hanky needed to bounce around in a manic frenzy and your bathroom was just the place.&lt;br /&gt;- It burns your skin where you are sensitive (read that again and think about it), this did not cease for me even after a month. It persists with some people then so reviewers saying it goes away, that is not universal - YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;#34;All natural&amp;#34; is a lie as it uses a perfume, now that does not bother me, but this perfume smells like some kid did not like the smell of his play-dough and sprayed it incessantly with his grandmother&#x27;s Windsong. It is cloying and awful, but thankfully it fades just like the skid marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you like bathing in brown stinging water or your bathroom is just too white, boy did you find the right product.</li>
            <li> So, I used another black soap before but had to change it because my girlfriend is allergic to oats that the other bar had. I decided to try this as it was a little cheaper and I had generally liked the other black soap. Also, because of Dave Chapelle, when I opened it, I would say, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Dudu, baby!&amp;#34; Anyway, the aroma was light. Nothing too appealing. It was thick and grainy feeling. My girlfriend said she didn&#x27;t care for it and didn&#x27;t like the smell as much as the other. So, she didn&#x27;t use it. Since either way, she wasn&#x27;t using the black soaps, I decided to switch back since the other one felt more cleaner when I washed it off. So, this is a slight better in cost if you want to save a bit.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel fresh and clean but is not intended for everyday use. It can irritate your skin an make you sensitive to sunburn  im gonna try to see if there is black soap with no lime juice  .  Unfortunately th.is soaps not for me i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> this not help in nothing my psorasis bad idea to buy this soap first ask the specialist to place some product in your skin</li>
            <li> I waited a while before writing a review because I needed my husband&#x27;s point of view. He Loved It!. He felt it was soothing to the skin and got him very clean. Yes, I will order more!</li>
            <li> Love the tropical scent.  I like this better than the raw black soap I ordered previously from amazon.  This seems like more or less the same stuff, but more carefully processed.  The other stuff I got had random sticks and rocks in it.  None of that with this brand.  But the same, rich lather and healing benefits.  Most of which I have yet to experience.  But I&#x27;m hopeful.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Love thee smell and feel of this soap! I don&#x27;t really like the stains it leaves on the tub. Put it on a soap holder!</li>
            <li> didnt help my acne :(</li>
            <li> Awesome soap!  Very moisturizing; nice light scent.  Only drawback is the trace of black goo in the soapdish.</li>
            <li> have been using for a few days, bought based on reviews I read. Only time will tell, if the help my skin issues.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. It clears the skin and cleans pores to the max. Highly recommended for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has natural ingredients and didn&#x27;t do anything bad to my skin. It did it&#x27;s job and cleaned my body.</li>
            <li> I started using this soap over 5 months ago only for my face becuase when I first used it all over it was very irritating. Currently I can use this soap to wash up all over and I love it. It has a light smell and lathers really well. I like that it is natural and has cleared blemishes on my skin. The only con is the fact that it really looks gross and leave a black tar substance in my soap dish. I only use it when in the shower because it makes such a mess. This is my new go-to since I am now on my all natural kick!!!</li>
            <li> Love this soap!!  It feels great on the skin, it smells fantastic, and it&#x27;s very light.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you try it give it a few weeks so your body can get used to the change in soap.  Like with anything your PH changes when you try something new.  Same goes for face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff will get more Dudu when I run out</li>
            <li> The shippings really fast! This is the best deep cleansing! You just feel clean-I love it! It&#x27;s taken the place of my morning and night facial foam.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I don&#x27;t have any skin issues that needs to be treated so I cannot address this aspect, but I didn&#x27;t feel any changes to my skin and it&#x27;s has strange strong smell. Defiantly, not a beauty saloon soap. It also drips back so if you have white tiles it looks like a mess.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love black soap. Been using it for a month now for my face and body &amp; there has been a visible difference. I break out less on my face &amp; the skin tone on my body is finally even. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> This is about my fourth order. Love the stuff, an true answer to ALL my skin issues. Before I made my first purchase, I read every single review. There were a few folks the said the bar soap left tiny cuts on their skin. One person recommended starting out on the hands first until some of the raw material became soft. Which I did and yes it left very small abrasions the first few times, nothing that a 100% raw Shea Butter couldn&#x27;t take care of. And the way it made hands, forearms and elbows feel out-weighed the very temporary issue, especially being a bar soap. This is now my signature soap, I shower with it all the time, love the smell.</li>
            <li> i think its good for my sons asthma thats why i recommend him to use when he takes a bath</li>
            <li> I had a terrible hormone inbalance a few months after having my son. They were all over the place. Resulting in terrible acne. All different types too. Blemishes, boils, white and blackheads, red spots. It was an absolute disaster. Within days of using the black soap ( I use twice a day) my face had significantly cleared up. It has been a little over a month now, and my face looks fabulous. I am still working on the red scars, but its fabulous to have nice smooth skin again. This soap will dry you out a little. Invest in a great moisturizer. Your face deserves it anyway. Also great on my shoulders and arms. Smooth SKIN!!!</li>
            <li> This will be my main soap along with ivory.    This soap moisturizes my skin and hair.  No breakout, and the soap last long.</li>
            <li> Have you ever hurt yourself with a soap?! well, I did! with these soaps! the scrub in the soap is worse than sand paper and I though I was wrong with the feeling. then I notice i got deep scratches on my arms under the shower and now after a few hours I see that I&#x27;m gonna have these scars at least for a while if not forever! a heavy brown/black color comes off the soap too! terrible!</li>
            <li> My bathroom smells like a tropical paradise during and after my showers.  I use this soap to wash my face and it appears to me that my skin has improved.  It lathers wonderfully and the only con to using it is it dissolves much faster than any other soap I use. I use it exclusively for my face now because I want it to last.</li>
            <li> Since I received it, I have been using it everyday. I do not see any change but my skin is still soft and I like the smell. It is subtle. I have a hard time with over scented bath and body products.&lt;br /&gt;However, keep in mind that it is a black soap so be prepared to scrub your tub more than usual.</li>
            <li> Works good!  Fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s organic and uses only natural products;which I&#x27;m all for, but I guess I must have been sensitive to this product because if I got it in my eyes it would burn, or accidentally up my nose it would sting and sometimes bleed.  I do suffer from acne and acne scars, I wash my face twice a day, morning and night and I really didn&#x27;t see any mass improvements in my face.  I do really wish this worked for me though</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Meh&amp;#34; is how I would describe this soap. I used it exclusively for a while and the only differences I noticed were: it&#x27;s messier and it burns a bit if it stays on too long. Aside from that, it&#x27;s just soap. The smell is... weird.</li>
            <li> great soaping product for your soap uses. positive review. bargain deal. no chemicals for your nature. treat yourself happy day.</li>
            <li> I think the whip black soap will last me longer</li>
            <li> Ok. Sooo Idk what everyone else is rating.. but It does WHAT IT CLAIMS to do. It cleans EXTREMELY well. So well that my skin actually felt squeaky. I experienced no burning or crazy drying effects. Your skin produces natural oils that are suffice enough to replenish skin after use. Personally the smellis not bad to me. Different but not stinky. I don&#x27;t know if it clears skin problems or a miracle for stretch marks but again. THAT&#x27;S NOT WHAT IT CLAIMS TO DO. More reviews on fulfillment of claims &amp; not fulfillment of wishfull thinking.</li>
            <li> great soap, leaves the skin clean and shine</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Hahaha&lt;br /&gt;It cleaned up my bath​tub where it ran!! kkk</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this soap.  I was looking for a natural soap that lathers well and hear African Black soap was the best choice.  I love this soap, it cleans well and smell very fresh.  If I had anything bad to say is, it leaves my shower/tub dirty looking because of the color of the soap, but that&#x27;s no major thing for me.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this soap.</li>
            <li> Soap is okay but it leaves a black residue on the tub where ever it has been left to sit.  Not crazy about the smell, tried it, it just wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be but it&#x27;s not the soap&#x27;s fault.  It arrived in a timely fashion and the price was reasonable.  It&#x27;s perfectly good soap, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for me.</li>
            <li> I love to try new soaps and been in love with Aleppo soap which I use regularly on body and hair.  I saw this African black soap and just had to try it. The smell is wonderful! It lathers up very quickly and cleans well. To be sure I&lt;br /&gt;used it to wash my feet paying particular attention to my heels which are dry and sometimes will even crack open.  Feet felt almost instantly soft even after I got up in the morning.  Tried it on my face and felt the slight tingling.  Next used it in the shower. I&#x27;ve never felt so clean and refreshed before!! My husband who is extremely picky loves it as well. Just have to be careful to keep it dry and wash the stains it leaves. Small price to pay for something so reasonable in price and does such a fine job. I am so happy with this find that I bought the 12 pack and plan to give them away as gifts.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter. She loves it. If left to dry in sink its hard to clean it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after just a few uses my eczema on my legs and a few other skin irritations are much, much better.  I still use my other facial cleanser but my arms, legs and torso are noticeably improved.  I would recommend it for mild cases of eczema.  Avoid using a cloth, just lather with hands and rub it gently on your skin.  Follow with moisturizer and you are good to go!</li>
            <li> I like this ok, but I didn&#x27;t like the burn. A little irritating for the skin. I did use it and didn&#x27;t notice significant benefits but I like the smell. I might would buy this again, because maybe the burn is removing the top layer of skin and imperfections. I&#x27;m not sure if it improves my skin quality, but I like the idea.it did dry my skin a bit</li>
            <li> This soap tore my skin up (this is slang for, my skin became irritated). This soap stains my bathroom shower with black residue, Although it smells good, this product is not for you. Stay away from this product if you have sensitive.</li>
            <li> The soap smells great, not like typical soap but that&#x27;s to be expected with it being all natural.  Unlike other reviewers, I have not experienced any irritation or burning sensations during/ after use. It helped a lot with some arm acny I was experiencing. By the way the bar is VERY large. I was shocked at the size but that only makes it even better!</li>
            <li> This is one the most effective products for rashes, pimples and over all good health this is my second time ordering this the smell is ok but it works so it makes up for it.</li>
            <li> This soap smells nice and it cleanses quite well. It&#x27;s calmed down my skin problems and is a much better alternative to commercial soaps that contain chemicals. These large bars last a long time so this is definitely a good purchase.   Update: I still like this soap but I now prefer raw African black soap or Shea Moisture soaps. Either way, stay way from chemicals and buy natural products!</li>
            <li> Could smell the soap through the plastic wrap on the soap boxes. What are they thinking?Returned.  Thanks for great service,  Amazon!</li>
            <li> Rated a 4 because of the sinsitivity that I felt in some areas of the body. Otherwise it made my skin feel so smooth after showing but the burning sensation was not good. Would recommend to those that don&#x27;t have sensitive areas, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> This is for Mary - she loves this soap. I tried it, but it was not for me. She and her sister take turns ordering this soap. I must say one thing, it sure smells good. Have you noticed, I get stuck doing the reviews.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Makes your skin really clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that this is possibly the BEST cleanser I have ever used. As an acne-sufferer, this stuff is a miracle. No exaggeration at all. Adding this soap to my skin care regimen has made all the difference. For all you other acne-sufferers out there, this soap is a very worthwhile purchase. That being said, please keep reading because using this alone was not the only thing that cleared my skin and evened my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now a 23 year old, light complected, white male. I never suffered from acne throughout puberty or high school, and thought I would be blessed with clear skin. But shortly after I graduated, went to college, and moved to a new city, my skin went haywire. Not only did my face break out seemingly overnight, but I also had breakouts on my back and shoulders that turned into severe cystic acne in a matter of days. And because I am so light complected, it was so much more noticeable and was devastating to my self-esteem. I spent literally hundreds of dollars on over-the-counter acne creams, cleansers, exfoliates, masks, pills, etc. Name a product, and I guarantee I have tried it. Nothing has ever worked well for me up until now. I&#x27;ve recently improved my diet (cut back on refined sugar, dairy, and gluten) in an attempt to clear my skin. After all, acne is as much of an internal problem as it is an external one. I showed some slight improvement from the diet, but nothing noticeable. Then I started supplementing with vitamins. Vitamins A, C, D, E, and Niacin (B3). These vitamins DRASTICALLY helped my skin, and after roughly two months, my skin looked 75% better. Still though, my skin needed improvement and I was still self conscious from regular breakouts and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation that was left behind after a pimple went away. Now, here is the part where my life changed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing tons of research online and from asking my dermatologist, I learned that too many chemicals and medications can be incredibly bad for your skin, which irritate the skin and then inevitably make your acne worse. I&#x27;m talking about benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid in particular, undoubtedly the two acne-fighting ingredients you will find in almost any over-the-counter acne treatment product. Solution? GO NATURAL. Avoid overusing medicated creams and cleansers. Avoid artificial chemicals, dyes, fragrances, or other irritating ingredients. Your skin will thank you for it. My skin thanks me for it. Which brings me to this African black soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s natural (aside from the vague word &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; listed in the ingredients), and it has made all the difference. But like other reviewers, you MUST use it correctly. First off, it lathers extremely well. I wash my face in the shower once in the morning and once before bed with this stuff and only rub the soap through wet hands for a couple passes and start washing. It lathers SO WELL. Which is definitely a good thing because it means it is easy to be gentle with it. But you must wash with your bare hands. This soap can be drying and exfoliating, so using a wash cloth, brush, or anything other than your hands will cause irritation and not be beneficial. I can&#x27;t say it enough. USE THE LATHER FROM THE SOAP WITH YOUR BARE HANDS!! After I rinse it off, my skin feels soft and tight and most importantly: clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for only a week now. Yes, one week. And have already noticed the most drastic improvement in my skin ever. My skin is glowing, and the few pimples and blackheads that I had on my face are gone. Even the red spots left behind are starting to fade (even the severe ones left on my shoulders and back)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said earlier though, using African black soap alone is probably not going to clear your skin, so my best advice is to start using more natural products or homeopathic remedies. Here are products that I use on a daily basis (along with cleansing with African black soap) and my skin has NEVER looked this great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing, gently PAT your face dry with a clean, soft towel (don&#x27;t rub dry). After completely dry, tone with an apple cider vinegar toner (1 part water, 1 part apple cider vinegar). I use one half cup of apple cider vinegar, and one half cup of filtered water, store it in a jar, soak some onto a cotton ball and gently rub it on my face (and shoulders). This is beneficial because African black soap can be drying. Any soap strips away the natural acidity of your skin and can allow free-radicals to damage your skin. Apple cider vinegar returns the acidity to your skin and also has antibacterial properties. Be sure to purchase an organic, unfiltered apple cider vinegar (with &amp;#34;the mother&amp;#34; in it). I use Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 30-40 minutes after toning with the ACV, I make a pass over my skin with witch hazel. Same deal: soak some onto a cotton ball and gently rub across my face and shoulders. Other reviewers have stated that it is necessary to moisturize after cleansing with black soap, but I do not. I don&#x27;t feel the need to because the ACV truly returns my skin to a good state. I don&#x27;t have extremely dry skin, however, so if you do, perhaps moisturizing after toning with ACV is the best way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, on your path to getting clear skin, I would definitely recommend supplementing with certain vitamins and encourage you to do research into them. I take A, C, D, E, and Niacin (or vitamin b3) everyday and like I said before, it has really helped. Of course, you should talk to your doctor about supplementing with any vitamins and research how much of each you really need or should take. Niacin has probably helped my skin more than anything. It increases blood flow to the surface of the skin and is an essential component in detox and cleansing programs. Be sure to buy pure Niacin (NOT no-flush, flush-free, or time-released varieties). I buy Solaray Niacin from Amazon, and take 500mg a day at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep you guys updated on how my skin does with this black soap, but so far so good! I will also post other product links to the products I mentioned that I have really helped me achieve clear skin. I could not be happier with this African black soap. Highly recommended purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 2 MONTHS OF USE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 2 months since I first started using this African black soap, and I still could not be happier. My back acne has completely (and yes, I mean COMPLETELY) cleared up and I&#x27;m absolutely convinced this soap is the main reason why. Even better is the fact that the postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (that is a result of severe cystic acne) on my back is clearing up so nicely. My back and shoulders have not been this clear in years. Seriously, after struggling for years to clear my skin, it is such a good feeling when you find a product that clears everything up in a matter of ~8 weeks. Major self-esteem boost! My face is also so much better and I very rarely get breakouts or pimples anymore. When I do, they tend to go away in a matter of a couple days, so I am no longer worried when I see a pimple in the mirror in the morning because I know it&#x27;s not going to stick around. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is because the black soap is slightly exfoliating and deep cleans the skin in a relatively gentle way and keeps sebum production under control. This black soap has also faded post-acne marks on my cheeks and forehead and has evened out my skin tone. My skin looks awesome right now, and I could not be more satisfied. One bar of this soap typically lasts 3-4 weeks for me. I am sold and will definitely continue purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE! 6 MONTHS LATER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing really new to add. Just want to say that I will never use another cleanser for my skin. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I&#x27;ve been able to look in the mirror and not see any blemishes. My face is 100% clear of blemishes, and my complexion is even and skin is like silk. I wash my face with this when I wake up in the morning, and again before I go to bed at night. The only other thing I still do is apply a thin layer of apple cider vinegar over my face (1:1 ratio of filtered water to ACV) after cleansing and drying to restore pH and keep my skin from getting dry. Like I said in my original review, my primary problem was severe acne on my back and shoulders. I couldn&#x27;t be happier to say that I have had no new acne on my back in 4 months. It is a fantastic feeling to be able to take off my shirt to go swimming or whatever and not be embarrassed. My back is absolutely, 100% clear, and like my face, the skin tone is even and no more hyperpigmentation. I&#x27;ve never been this enthusiastic about a product before, and I&#x27;m convinced that nothing is better for your skin than natural products. I&#x27;ve ditched all those medicated creams and gels and won&#x27;t look back. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!! A YEAR AND HALF LATER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still can&#x27;t believe how well this soap has helped my skin and how much of a difference it really does make. Example: I went on vacation for two weeks a couple months ago. As such, I was without this black soap for those two weeks. As a result, I was using an ordinary department store-bought face wash bar and what happened? I started breaking out (for the first time in a very long time, mind you). Nothing else changed. I ate the same foods, took the same vitamins, and there was no change in climate or weather (didn&#x27;t travel cross country or anything). So I knew exactly why I was breaking out. Of course, I was mortified when I looked in the mirror after two weeks without this (which is a good thing, because it means I can&#x27;t even remember what it looks like to have zits all over!). Fast forward after vacation was over and I started using black soap again, and my skin was clear again in about a week and half of using it. Lesson learned: my skin has become totally accustomed to this soap and I can&#x27;t use anything else. Can&#x27;t express how happy I am (still!) that this stuff works as well as it does.ake 500mg a day at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep you guys updated on how my skin does with this black soap, but so far so good!

            <li> I got pregnant and my back face and chest. Broke out  proactiv STOPPED working and I was freaking out. My Dr said it wasn&#x27;t good to use chemicals while pregnant cause it could go to the baby. So I was on a totally different website and found black soap. Brought it but it wasn&#x27;t no reviews on it  so I type it in on amazon.com and I was blessed with dudu osun. It took a little getting used of. But ny face is way clearer than before. My chest is cleaning up and my back is coming along. I would recommend this product to everyone! It was a little drying at first but my skin got used of it quickly. About a week or so. Ps I have oily skin so it gave me a good balance!</li>
            <li> I really love this productthe really makes your skin feel real goodI&#x27;ve tried other black African soapthis is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible!  I was concerned about the 100% pure claim when I read the ingredients and fragrance was listed, but I know it&#x27;s a popular brand so I called an African Imports store (who charges way too much for shipping, but I only found that out upon checkout after loading up my cart which is why I purchased it here), and they said &amp;#34;the fragrance comes from essential oils and will not make your skin react and is not overpowering.&amp;#34;  WRONG!  Now granted, there are 4 soap bars in the sealed plastic wrap, but upon opening it I felt like I had walked by the perfume counter of a major department store and had every scent sprayed on me at once!  I will be using this up as hand soap only and even then only on the weekends because my hands reek (and I&#x27;m putting it in a plastic ziploc baggie between uses so it doesn&#x27;t smell up my room)!  Try coastal scents brand; I purchased one of those at the same time and it&#x27;s unscented.  I didn&#x27;t know which one I would like better which is why I tried two different black soaps.</li>
            <li> Use this mainly as a facial wash treatment. Wash my face with it in the morning and at night. I am happy with the result.</li>
            <li> Best soap I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I love the smell the price is great too.  It works great to help clear skin. I will purchase it again</li>
            <li> great product..it does wonders for my skin</li>
            <li> The soap smells great, it dries out my skin, did nothing for my acne scars.</li>
            <li> I love it. I have sensitive skin and this soap doesnt irritate my skin at all. It leaves my skin feeling really smooth.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this soap because I have sensitive skin. I used it and loved it. Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, but can be drying. It is important to follow up with a good moisturizing oil or lotion. It smells nice also. I use it for face and body. I use my hands and not a cloth. This is the real stuff. I purchased it because of the natural ingredients, but am slowly learning that it is good for eczema, psoriasis, acne, (I use it as a preventative measure), and fading dark spots.</li>
            <li> I love this soap it really gets me squeaky clean!!</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t used this long enough but we love what we have experienced so far.  It was recommended by a friend for my daughter hormonal acne, but she is afraid to use it!  So I guess we on&#x27;t know for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African american and i have sensitive, soft an uneven skin tone. I really wanted this product just to even out my skin some more but i haven&#x27;t seen any results using this product. The only thing it did was make my skin softer from what it was already.I thought this soap would be great from the reviews but i was wrong. I will go back to using my other soaps.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap! Been using for a week or 2 and my skin look so much better. Been trying product after product and nothing seemed to help my excessive oily skin that suffered horrible breakouts and its even worse now that I&#x27;m pregnant. Came across all the reviews on this product so decided to give it a try and Im in love :) But only thing is make sure you use a moisturizer afterwards :)</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product for no apparent reason, just to try it out because I&#x27;ve heard about it and because I read the reviews (why not try to lighten dark spots if it is possible?), I bought it and I like it so far, I do also have raw shea butter too and make sure that after I apply the black soap to my face I follow up with a minuscule amount of shea butter (a little goes a long way) to eliminate drying as some have experienced. But it does lather really well, better than I thought it would! It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dudu-osun African Black Soap for a while, about six months now. Firstly; Hair, I use it on my hair and it&#x27;s amazing. It smells good and it cleans my hair. It lathers well, and I only need to shampoo it once. Secondly; Skin, I&#x27;ve been using on my skin for about six months, and it&#x27;s gotten rid of my dry skin, I had dry patches, and those are all gone now. My scars are brightening and fading, but I use it in combination with other stuff, but I would say that in addition to that it speeds up the process. As far as acne goes, it didn&#x27;t help the problem, but it does help fade the blemishes that I  have. Hope this helps, and I would recommend this for a more natural healthy way of cleaning hair, and for those who have dry skin.    P.S     DO NOT USE BLACK SOAP DIRECTLY ON YOUR SKIN, LATHER IT ON A LOOFAH OR TOWEL WHEN WASHING YOUR FACE OR SHOWERING/BATHING ETC, IT&#x27;S TOO ROUGH AND IT&#x27;LL SCRATCH YOUR SKIN AND IRRITATE IT!!! DON&#x27;T DO IT!!! It&#x27;s natural 100% black soap, it&#x27;s NOT smooth like the one&#x27;s you find in a store. Beware!!!</li>
            <li> I feel like this may be my fault because I didn&#x27;t do enough research before buying this product. I had never used African black soap before, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. It didn&#x27;t clear up my skin. It stained my bathtub and it just didn&#x27;t smell very good at all. I guess my expectations were just too high. I guess if you&#x27;re new to this product just don&#x27;t buy a ton like I did expecting it to do wonders. Just get a sample bar and see what you think, but don&#x27;t get your hopes up. It&#x27;s just soap.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I think it&#x27;s ok. there&#x27;s nothing spectacular about this soap. But,  it&#x27;s affordable, smells good and doesn&#x27;t have tons of chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing! I don&#x27;t have any skin conditions, but for an overall feeling of cleaniness, this product does wonders.  I will continue to use this product for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> This soap compared to Shea Moisture Africian Black Soap has the same lustrious lather, which means a bar goes a long way.  It leaves the skin feeling soft and clean and does not leave a slippery film in the shower.  Unlike Shea Moisture, this product is more affordable, four bars compared to one, available through Amazon, and does not stain the shower or certain wash clothes.  I will definitely continue to buy this product as long as it&#x27;s available via Amazon.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think &amp;#34;dudu&amp;#34; soap would smell good but these have a really unique almost fruity smell. They are a nice change from the synthetic fragrances you get from a lot of other soaps.</li>
            <li> I GET IT ON TIMES GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE I REALLY LOVE IT, GOOD PERFOMANCE, EXCELLENT JOB , SEE YOU NEXT TIMES OK BYE</li>
            <li> This seems like a good soap - not drying, lathers good, looks like it won&#x27;t disappear quickly.&lt;br /&gt;But the one problem is it has fragrance added. Since it was touted as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; I was under the impression it was free of artificial fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see now that it does say it has fragrance added, in the description. Had I seen that I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.&lt;br /&gt;If the danger of hormonal disruption from artificial fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother you than this is a good soap for you.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I won&#x27;t buy it again unless they remove the artificial fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredients are laid out in ink. Some other black soaps do not provide ingredients. It seems to help fade my scars. This will probably last me a loooong time. Great price! Great product! Will repurchase when I run out. :)</li>
            <li> I have a few old scars on my legs. It is gradually fading away, thanks to this soap. Forget about bio oil and buy this product!</li>
            <li> This soap is natural and it leaves your skin feeling so clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels so much better since I started using it.  No more dry patches, just soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped fast and in my house quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I love this soap so much.</li>
            <li> Certainly cleans and keeps my skin looking smooth and acne free. Found that it works better than Dove. Will use from now on!</li>
            <li> Lathers well last a long time and is not drying ! I love it and will continue to purchase it  good all natural soap I use it on my face and body.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Tried several other natural soap (coconut, shea butter, Chinese Ginseng soap) etc etc.  But all of them made my skin very dry when you use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap however works perfectly for my skin type.  Doesn&#x27;t matter how much I use, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this soap is very &amp;#34;leaky&amp;#34;.  When it&#x27;s wet, it starts to drip.  And that&#x27;s how I found out how much cleaning power this soap has.  This soap was slowly dripping onto my fiberglass shower.  And there is a certain spot that is &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; no matter how hoard I try to get it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after a few weeks, I started to notice a white line running across the floor from the wall to the drain.  And that&#x27;s when I realize it was the black soap dripping onto the floor!  It brought the &amp;#34;cream white&amp;#34; back to the dirty fiberglass shower floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also noticed that my the more I use it, the more my stretch marks on my thighs start to appear &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s not as bad as before!  I will continue to use this soap.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells good, washes away clean. My only problem is the bar seems to disappear over night. Well not quite that quick, but the bar lasts a lot shorter than other bars I&#x27;ve tried (compared to standard soaps and natural ones). Maybe that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s 4 in the pack?</li>
            <li> This soap really cleans my skin.  Even though I filter shower water, this soap leaves my skin so soft and doesn&#x27;t need tons of lotion.  As a matter of fact, I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about a month.  It&#x27;s the best soap.  I have sensitive skin with a problem with acne all my life.  While sulfur soap worked, my back still itched between showers.  NOT with this soap.  I don&#x27;t even have to put lotion on my back.  This soap is the greatest!!  Each bar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> July 30, 2015. I ordered this soap for my acne prone skin. I have extremely bad back acne, and have body acne pretty much everywhere on my body; it&#x27;s the worst on my back and shoulders, though. This product arrived in the mail today, and let me tell you, from the second I opened the box up, I could smell how AMAZING the soap smelled before I even actually opened a bar of soap. It does have a tropical smell like it says, but it smells THAT good. (To me anyways). -- I plan on updating weekly on this to tell you how my skin and face are doing with this product, but using it for the first time today, I wanted to write a review. Whenever I showered with it, it lathered very well. I used my hands to lather everything on my body and my face because I read reviews that it stained their washcloths. I also read on some reviews that they had a &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; sensation, however, that did not happen to me. Whenever I wash the soap off, my body was &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; feeling, which made me feel good because I could tell my body was clean. I&#x27;m out of the shower now, obviously, and my body feels SO soft. Usually when I get out of the shower, I have to put a moisturizer on my face because it gets dry. I didn&#x27;t do that while ago to see how it would do because a lot of people said they didn&#x27;t even use a moisturizer, but I feel like my face needs a little lotion for the dryness. I will continue updating weekly to let you guys know if this is helping my skin or not. I&#x27;m praying it does cause I&#x27;ve read so many great reviews about it!  Week 1 Update!  I&#x27;ve been using the product for a week, and I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic difference in my skin. :/ I read a lot of reviews and some people said that they&#x27;ll get a &amp;#34;phase of breakouts&amp;#34; but to keep using the product because it&#x27;ll still help. I think I&#x27;m going through the phase of breakouts cause I&#x27;ve gotten new ones on my face, neck, chest, and back, but not a ton, just a couple here and there. One good thing thatthis product has done for my face is help with the oil. I work at a fast food restaurant and I would wear makeup everyday, and by the time I would leave, my face would be extremely oily, and now my face hasn&#x27;t been. I have a lot of breakouts on my face right now, and I&#x27;m hoping that this soon will help with those soon cause I&#x27;ve read too many good reviews about this product and I hope everything works for me. Also, the acne I had on my back has flattened. When I rub my back, you can&#x27;t feel any bumps, but you can see them. I also noticed the first few times I used this, it made my skin feel very dry. I was putting on more moisturizer than normal just to help with the dryness. Now that it&#x27;s been a week, I went back to only putting moisturizer on once a day. I&#x27;ll still continue doing reviews, but as for this weekly update, it&#x27;s nothing new really. Hopefully before school starts in a couple weeks, my skin will look better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still puberty at this point (I&#x27;m 18) or what, but this product didn&#x27;t work at all. After four bars, I didn&#x27;t lose any pimples out dark spots. The soap just acted as just that, soap. Not necessarily bad, but if I needed any regular soap I would just go to grocery store or CVS.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer.  My daughters and I can not live without these soaps.  They leave your skin so soft and moisturized!  Only thing is you can&#x27;t leave it wet in soap dish.  If you do they kind of melt.  Absolutely great soap!</li>
            <li> At first I was afraid and intimidated coz the name is &amp;#34;African&amp;#34; soap.  But I decided to put my prejudices aside and give it a try.  It&#x27;s very big and lasts a long time.  That&#x27;s what she said.</li>
            <li> Its an ok soap. You can use it as a face wash or in the shower. It does clean, and my skin did not get dry, but its not better than the average soap</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS SOAP.  IT SMELLS SO FRESH AND CLEAN AND MAKES MY SKIN SO SOFT, I HAVE TURNED MY FRIENDS ONTO THIS WONDERUL SOAP.  I WOULD NOT USE ANY OTHER SOAP AFTER USING DUDU-OSUN.</li>
            <li> Order got here in great time for ordering late Friday, it got here on Monday. The soap was good. I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect at first. But after using it for a couple of days, it&#x27;s actually been quite great! Great value and quality!</li>
            <li> It is a hit with Family and friends. Perhaps the novelty of it. It has a nice aroma. I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this  black  soap it works very good with me.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  Leaves no residue and all natural - I am buying only products without fragrance or chemicals now. Not quiet as dense as other bars I have used in the past but overall a good product.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> This soap feels great. I&#x27;ve washed my face with soap plenty of times before, but this stuff does something different. The first time I used this soap I was impressed with the lather and how clean it made my skin feel--I instantly noticed the absence of soap residue that is typical of regular soaps. But this time it was different. I lathered the soap up between my hands, scrubbed my face well and lowered my face to the sink to rinse off. While I was down there I thought to myself &amp;#34;wow, my skin feels so clean.&amp;#34; I picked my head up expecting to see my reflection in the mirror when I froze--I wasn&#x27;t alone. There was a man, a man in the mirror, who was he? I had seen that face before but where!? Then, like a tidal wave it hit me--&amp;#34;George Clooeny is that you!?&amp;#34; Oddly enough the movements of his mouth seemed to mimic the words I spoke. What was George Clooney doing in my bathroom? Was this a dream? Then the light bulb in my head went off. My lips began to curl and I couldn&#x27;t help but chuckle. &amp;#34;Oh silly me,&amp;#34; I said, &amp;#34;George Clooney will have to keep dreaming.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought these for psoriasis relative with a high hope they will help ... the condition showed no improvement after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews of this soap, I was skeptical. The first few days I used it, there was a slight burning sensation, which decreases over a short period of time. My face felt softer and cleaner and the soap makes a nice, scented lather. It can stain light colored washcloths, but I don&#x27;t mind. I have used it for a few months now and my facial skin seems a bit better, so I&#x27;ll keep using it; one bar of soap can last a long time if you only use it to wash your face.</li>
            <li> I bought this black soap in hopes of eliminating acne. The first few times of using this soap, I fell in love! It not only made my acne go away, but it tightened, firmed and gave my skin an overall great complexion. I used it in the shower as a face and body wash. It soothed my dry skin and gave my skin an even tone. Unfortunately I ran out of this soap, but I will definately be buying more soon! I highly recommend Dudu-osun African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap because it does wonders for my face. I was given this soap by a friend years ago and never used it consistently. We even laughed at the name. However, recently I saw it in my make-up storage bin and decided to give it a try consistently. Why did I wait so long?! This soap does better for removing my dark spots and acne than my expensive prescription dermatological creams. I use it religiously day and night but you have to moisture after using it because like any soap it is drying. I have oily, sensitive, and weird skin but this soap works for me. If I notice that my skin becomes too sensitive after using it consecutively I will use my over the counter gentle skin cleaner for a day or so before going back to this product. I use this soap as a cleaner to remove my make-up and as a daily face cleanser when I am not wearing make-up. I tried to bathe with it but it melts too fast in the shower. However, if you use it as a daily face cleanser it will last you forever. It is definitely worth the investment and don&#x27;t forget to moisturize because your skin needs the moisture even if toy are oily like me.</li>
            <li> So I got this soap about 3 days ago.  I&#x27;ve used it about 3 times now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this soap five stars because it met my expectations and some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured when I ordered the soap that it would be nothing special.  I just wanted to see what all natural soap was like.  And the price was very reasonable.  I normally use bar soap like Dove and Old Spice, so I figured I&#x27;d try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of the soap was that it was a little flaky.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about the quality and was a little worried that it would fall apart in the shower.  After the bar of soap got wet though it was just like any other bar.  Fully intact and no problems with flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the soap.  The smell is great.  Like other reviewers have said it has a tropical type smell to it.  And the amount of suds and lather I get from the soap it way more than the normal bars I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used it, I rubbed the bar between my hands for a couple seconds then started to wash my face.  I moved my hands up to my hair to wash that and the soap that was left on my hands practically turned into shampoo.  It literally felt like concentrated shampoo in a bar.  It was the potent.  So for the past 3 days I&#x27;ve used to soap alone in the shower opposed to using face wash, body wash, shampoo and bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviewers have talked about irritation, but so far the soap has been fine for me.  The smell stays on my skin throughout the day and leaves me smelling fresh.  It could almost replace my cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the soap this much to be honest.  But I feel like it deserves a 5 star review because of the quality of the soap and also that I agree with what the company stands for.  There are ingredients in the soap I used to buy that I couldn&#x27;t pronounce.  But all the ingredients in the Dude Osun soap are simple and natural.  I&#x27;m not an all organic type of guy, but soap is something that I&#x27;m using on my body everyday, and It&#x27;s nice to know that that I can actually pronounce the stuff that I&#x27;m rubbing all over my body every morning in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is cheap (2 dollars more than my old soap), smells great, and replaces other products I use.  I love it.  Enough said.  I hope this was helpful</li>
            <li> This soap smells good, feels good on my skin, and has made my skin clearer and brighter.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks and can tell a difference in my skin tone.  I started using it all over then started to only use it on my face.  That wasn&#x27;t the best idea because now my face is lighter than my body and you can really see a difference between my neck and face.  So, I have started back using it all over.  Hopefully my body catches us to my face :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, the smell is the best part but it doesn&#x27;t stay on after washing. Overall, I hated the part when you&#x27;re done showering and you have a black, dirty looking tub!! I would always have to scrub the tub after using this soap, being it black!! So I stopped using it! It is a bit drying, and the smell won&#x27;t be enough for me to scrub the bathtub after every use!</li>
            <li> Having researched skin care options that are both natural and gentle (due to my eczema and sensitive skin), I&#x27;ve read plenty of reviews and tried many soaps. While the name is little funny (honestly, my husband laughs every time I call it just du du), it has been wonderful for my skin. My eczema is calming, healing, and disappearing while the rest of my skin feels refreshed and clean. I also have on hand black soap moisturizer for my red spots, and a body butter with shea for afterwards. Using a moisturizer is an important part of using this soap, but knowing my skin is healthy, healing, and absorbing all-natural ingredients makes du du osun a permanent part of my skin care. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This soap is magic for your face...gets you that pharell look.</li>
            <li> If you notice dryness or few break out like i did, add a little body oil to your face before applying the soap. Wash off immediately so as to avoid dryness of the skin. I love this soap, all my black heads are almost gone, and i have stopped breaking out. I use this soap with the Life-Flo pure Almond oil, Amazing result !!! GoodLuck</li>
            <li> I know that there are many great reviews on this soap.  For many, this soap is a beauty staple and must have.  Skin care is such an individual protocol.  With that said I felt the need to give non-bias and personal experience with this soap.  I purchased this soap several years ago (from a different website) based on the &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34; reviews.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it.  When I did get the soap like many describe it has an overpowering scent.  I find it is a bit musky - like a man&#x27;s cologne (I am a lady and very feminine at that).  I still decided to give it a try because of all the praises the soap is given.  As for cleaning the skin it does BUT the scent lingers on your body like any scented soap.  So if strong musky scents is not for you then this soap may not be either.  There is nothing clean and freshing about the scent.  The other thing that is true about this soap is that it leaves a black film on everything it touches including the skin.  Even though it washes off it leaves a slight brown tint on the skin - great for those who want a sunless tan look.  I believe that is why it appears the skin is evening out it is being died slowly to a different hue.  I ended up giving this soap away to a male who absolutely loved it and everythign about it.  So there you have it some peopole love it and others hate it.  It really depends on what you can and can&#x27;t tolerate and your beauty goals.  I recommend regular African Black soap which has no fragence.</li>
            <li> Smells a little odd. I expected a citrus smell from the reviews here, but that&#x27;s not what I would call the scent. It&#x27;s not bad, just not a natural-type smell.&lt;br /&gt;Soap works good and is not too drying.</li>
            <li> this really softens skin - removes tiny bumps and dry spots.  it can cause some redness in sensitive spots at first - my husband used it without warning and he was a little, um, uncomfortable the first day.  but, i have sensitive skin and my skin loves this soap.</li>
            <li> It will get you very clean but dries out your skin use with a exfoliating glove twice a week</li>
            <li> This soap is really something else! I was expecting it to be ok but it has seriously changed my skin for the better. My skin is more taut, pores diminished &amp; the occasional acne is gone, oh &amp; my scars are fading too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow did not expect such great results.&lt;br /&gt;Tips for usage: it is a bit drying so don&#x27;t use too much, once a day and don&#x27;t scrub it into your face just gentle massage.&lt;br /&gt;The aroma will be very strong the first week then it fades so hang on. :)</li>
            <li> This is a nice soap it helped clear my blemishes,  but for my postular psoriasis did not help, it drys  the skin a lot.</li>
            <li> This quality is good and smell good, This is the best type of soap purchased the black, thanks ، thanks ,</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this the seller told me to soap my cloth once and put the bar down....she said a little goes a long way...well I got overwhelmed by the suds and softness so I found myself using my 12 pack quicker than I was supposed to.  But my skin is awesome...I&#x27;m now using shea butter in place of lotion.  My body scent is now fruity....Lol...and natural....my next step is a natural deodorant...any suggestions?</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It is messy but totally worth it! It has helped with my acne and faded my melasma.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap! I have been using it for years now and I love the way it makes my skin feel...clean and smooth with no funky residue.  I love the smell too!</li>
            <li> Though it has not yet proven to be affective in toning some of the blemishes I have on my skin, it lathers and cleanses very well. It is a little more drying than I am used to, but my skin seems to have adapted after a few weeks of use. I will likely repurchase this soap.</li>
            <li> It got here fast,,,and so I had to use it and my skin felt so soft.and I don&#x27;t know why people say it smells ,,it really dont.I would tell you to try it you will love it,,,and it last for a long time...you have to get this soap.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any miraculous moisturizing or spot fading properties yet, and I have been using for over a month now.  The soap gets used up pretty quickly, so it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Best soap I ever used.</li>
            <li> I read an article about Marissa Miller using this to fight her acne during pregnancy and I decided to try it myself. I had oily and dry combination skin with occasional breakouts and I have tried every medication out there from topical to antibiotics. This soap is amazing! Ive been using it for over a year now and refuse to use anything else! I no longer have black heads and my skin has smoothed out nicely. Ive recently replaced my moisturizer with Raw African Shea Butter and now believe natural is the ONLY way to go when it comes to taking care of my skin and body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, it smells good (very light pine, herbs and flowers - I am sensitive to strong smells, but this soap is just great). It leaves my skin soft, smooth and healthy. It&#x27;s dark, the water will be dark too, but it won&#x27;t stain your bathtub or towels.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for a long time. Can be a great gift. Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mind the feel or the earthy smell of the soap , but the brown suds leave a residue on the sink or shower . Ended up rinsing all the time . So its extra work or the area looks dirty . And  I would even put up with all of the above if the soap would make my skin feel better , but it don&#x27;t . Will stick to my Dove sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> Does not dry up the skin, smell good and reasonable priced</li>
            <li> This soap is the real deal...true black soap.  I&#x27;ve been using Nubian Heritage exclusively for 10+ years and recently tried Dudu osun.  It IS different; stronger than most and it&#x27;s a big fat chunk of soap.  It really cleans and clears the skin .  Some super sensitive people may find it slightly irritating on the first few uses, but that passes. The soap is great.  Nature &amp; Herbs is a fantastic 5 STAR business, and I urge everyone to support them and check their complete online storefront.   ~DM</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Great smell, great for oily skin without drying your skin out.&lt;br /&gt;Great on acne &amp; feels good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for 5 years now and will never go back to retail branded soap again. Everyone is always complimenting my skins softness, complexion and tone. This is a strong soap that not only strips you clean but replenishes as well.</li>
            <li> My fiance&#x27; and I have been searching for a good soap for his skin since he has psoriasis and eczema.   We&#x27;ve tried many and nothing helped, or it would just dry him up.  We bought this and now it&#x27;s the only soap he will use.  It leaves his skin soft and it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  I&#x27;ve started to use it too since we found out I have pupps, a pregnancy rash that came out of no where.  I suggest cutting the soap into smaller pieces and using it like that because it does run and melt in the water quickly if you&#x27;re not careful.  And don&#x27;t leave it on anything that you don&#x27;t want stained.   Other than that this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this product and am ordering more. This soap makes my skin feel and look clean, clear and soft. I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap A) because it&#x27;s all natural and B) because some reviewers had said that it helped clear their acne and scars. Well I do love it&#x27;s scent, the lather and that it contains only natural products. But I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my pimples or the age spots or scarring have not been reduced in appearance. It&#x27;s not a miracle soap. It never burns my face, and  I do notice a fresher cleaner feeling than with other soaps. It is messy and leaves a dark brown residue in the soap holder on my shower wall, but that is not really a big deal for me. I will continue buying this soap because of how much I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. That&#x27;s it...just okay. I can&#x27;t justify the price for it, honestly.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it would help with my occasional acne. I used to only have a few pimples, but ever since using this product I started getting constant breakouts near my hairline. I was really disappointed because this not only did not help with my acne but caused more!!! I wanted to give it more time for the positive results, but I have used it for more 3 weeks so far and it still gives me more breakouts.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that the first time I used this soap, it burned my face so bad and made it so red that I almost called off work that night. But after a couple hours it went away. I used it again that same night and no redness just squeeky clean. So don&#x27;t get discouraged the first time u use it and think your one of the unlucky ones who can&#x27;t use this soap. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 months now and man did it make a world of difference in my skin. I get complements all the time on how nice my skin looks. I had very mild acne and I don&#x27;t have a single one now. Everything great people say about this soap is true. I threw away all of my face washes and only use this now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is however a purging stage like some other reviews mentioned but don&#x27;t let that discourage u either. Mine lasted about a week to two weeks and I broke out around my jaw line only which was weird because I&#x27;ve never broke out there before. But it wasn&#x27;t that bad at all and I covered it easily with makeup. But even when I was breaking out some, my skin looked so nice that the very little acne wasn&#x27;t the main focus on my face. It was my glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap can be a bit drying, even if I have oily skin. Then it can make ur skin over produce oil so I&#x27;d suggest using jojoba oil afterwards. Litterly the most amazing stuff in the world. I&#x27;m super self conscious about what I put on my face. I never used to use moisturizer because I thought it would make me break out. But this stuff I slather it on with confidence. It&#x27;s 100% natural and is the closest oil to our own sebum that our skin produces. It&#x27;s like cleaning off the dirty oil and replacing it with clean oil for our face. It does not make me break out at all whatsoever and yes I have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So give this soap a try. And the oil too. You won&#x27;t regret it. I&#x27;ve tried so many face washes and what not and nothing has ever worked as good for me as those two things.</li>
            <li> Got this 4 pack and put a couple in a gift basket I made up for my wife.  OK, yes, I kept a couple for myself as I wanted to try a black colored soap.  Wow, so cool, and here is the surprise - no dry skin afterwards!  All winter long the lotion bottle is emptied, oiling up to keep our skin from that dry cracking winter heat problem.  But after a week or so of using this wonderful product - no dry skin, and any skin irritations or rashes fade away or are reduced significantly.  This is a seriously cool product and will be a staple in our home from now on.</li>
            <li> This soap is excellent... especially for the price</li>
            <li> These soaps are eehh.  I purchased these because of all the rave reviews about it helping with acne blemishes and discoloration.  Ladies, these soaps do not help with that at all; at least for me it did not.  Whomever wrote those reviews is good at hype.  What it does do though is leave your skin feeling soft - that is true.  But, it does not smell so wonderfully fantastic as some people have mentioned.  It just has a regular scent to it (like hotel soap smells).  I WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN because it is waaaay too messy.  Brown stuff running down everywhere.  If you decide to get these soaps, you better make sure you have something to contain it in or you will have a brown mess everywhere (all over the sink, all in the tube).  It is just not worth it.</li>
            <li> this is a very good soap now for those of you scared about the burning sensation that everyone else is worried about experiencing for the first time use, I just used it and did not experience such a thing probably because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin it went on quite easily and lathered up very good like everyone said but if you have dry skin I really don&#x27;t suggest this for you as it can be very drying even leaving your skin white afterwards until you apply some type of moisturizer and it has the bar soap type of feel but if you have combination/oily skin like me this is perfect for you also it works good on the face but don&#x27;t apply directly on the face just lather together in your hands and then apply to face and neck, Overall a very good product</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Smells good and lasts a long time.  Was not aware of the various things claimed for it - just got it because I was curious.</li>
            <li> This soap is seriously amazing!  I am a Caucasian female, early thirties, who has been suffering from hormonal acne for over a year now and I purchased this soap based on reviews claiming that this soap helped to clear acne and acne scars.  I&#x27;ll tell you it did more than help.  It&#x27;s been a miracle for me!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 months now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I started slow because I have sensitive skin and some reviewers said it caused irritation.  I was using it only once a day in the shower,  lathering and applying with my hands.  I definitely noticed a difference within the first week.  However, since I had no issues with this soap causing dry skin or irritating redness,  I quickly gave up my usual makeup remover in favor of Dudu-osun full time.  I use it at least twice a day, once in the morning and once at night to remove my makeup.  If I&#x27;m home all day I may use it again just for good measure.  :)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s truly been a blessing for me.  The acne scars have all but disappeared and it is extremely rare that I even have a new breakout. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin feels and looks younger.  The fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes have shrunk as well.  I feel much more confident and have switched to a much lighter tinted moisturizer as a base instead of the heavy duty matte concealer I used before.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the soap in a pack of 4 and have barely even made a dent in the first bar considering that I&#x27;ve used it mostly several times daily for 2 months.  I can&#x27;t imagine why this pack of 4 wouldn&#x27;t last me 2 years at this rate.  For barely over $10 this is a steal!&lt;br /&gt;I realize this is a somewhat gushing review so I&#x27;ll tell you the only downside I can think of to this product.  I first kept the bar of soap on a rack in my shower caddy hanging from my shower head.  I suppose because the water dripped directly on it,  it ran down the wall of my shower leaving a brownish black trail.  It washed off fine though and I&#x27;ve simply movedit to the back of my shower onto a soap dish.  Problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re suffering from acne like I was and have tried everything from apple cider vinegar to proactiv, try this soap!</li>
            <li> This soap works wonders. Extra clean feeling after use, but one MUST moisturize especially the face due to a drying effect that the soap has.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to test its effectiveness for two personal concerns:&lt;br /&gt;1. My eczema, hilariously caused by my own skin&#x27;s sensitivity to my own sweat and&lt;br /&gt;2. Allergies to a myriad of things, but especially strong odors and perfumes as most soaps tend to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did wonders! I noticed results within a week.&lt;br /&gt;1. My eczema is slowly going away. Which I attribute to this soap because it is the only change I made. I&#x27;ve always kept a high protein, and low GI complex carbohydrate diet, plus I still work out and sweat like a beast.&lt;br /&gt;2. The soap smells really nice, and it somehow also manages to moisturize my skin. All of course without causing bouts of sneezing in me like other perfumed soaps do.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for over a year.  It&#x27;s a wonderful soap and really cleans.  You can almost hear it fizz and bubble when it hits the skin.  It&#x27;s really fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a little scar above my lip, and I swear that its appearance seems to have lessened since using this soap.  I&#x27;m not saying it will mend scars, just that I personally noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have not used it, when the soap gets wet the water coming from it will show a trace of black.  That water does not stain the tub or shower stall.  You should use a soap dish though to make sure the soap isn&#x27;t kept in a constant state of dampness so that it can last longer.  I thought I&#x27;d mention the water run off being dark, because when I gave a bar to a friend; she was worried about staining the bathtub.  It&#x27;s perfectly safe to use plus being an exceptional product.</li>
            <li> Strong smell, but good for skin.  Wish they made an unscented version</li>
            <li> This is my second or third time buying this soap, and I must say that I absolutely love it. It makes your whole entire face feel opened up and refreshed, like every single pore you have is being cleansed. And it works not just for your face, but for your entire body as well. I&#x27;ve come to like it also because it gets rid of those pesky &#x27;chicken bumps&#x27; you have on your arms. And it doesn&#x27;t take much to lather up; just one wipe across a moist washcloth or hand and it makes exceptional lather. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants smoother, clearer, and cleaner skin. I WILL be buying this again!! ^^</li>
            <li> All ingredients are natural, except for the fragrance. I like all natural products and when I make my own lotions I use Essential Oils to add a natural scent. I have tried another brand&#x27;s black soap and there was no added fragrance and no essential oils, however it had a earthy and &amp;#34;clean soap&amp;#34; smell, similar to castille soap. This particular brand is a top seller on black soaps and I liked that it said &amp;#34;Tropical&amp;#34; hinting to a tropical-type smell. However when I opened one of the packages I had this strong sniff of fragrance that is definitely not in the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; arena. If you like really natural, organic, etc., I really think the smell will turn you off as it did with me.&lt;br /&gt;If they had an unscented version I would purchase again, but for now all my unopened bars will go to friends as a little gift because I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> The smell of this soap is too strong.  I will not purchase again.  I could smell the soap through the packaging.</li>
            <li> I have acne marks all over, I am using this soap hoping to get rid of them all. Will update the review accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will clean you well but will dry you up. I have a very sensitive, dry and flaky skin. So, this is how I apply it: I moisturize it well, so there is a bit of extra grease on my face and body, and then wash with this soap. So, for face, any kind of regular non-fragrant moisturizer does the job. For body, I rely on Olay in-shower body lotion, it stays put really well. I dislike the sloppy feeling of moisturized skin after bathing, but if needed, I re-moisturize my skin after washing with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it looks like a solid rock, it lathers rather very well and by that it also means that this soap runs out really fast, so, it&#x27;s a great relief that I ordered this pack of 4. The smell is good, I am used to it. In my country(India), they sell a famous soap, Lifebuoy, a very basic and cheap, red-colored brick-like soap (it didn&#x27;t lather well). So this black soap here reminded me of my childhood memories. A very welcoming experience for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is black soap, take care of your bath-tub, basin, shower curtains and bathroom tiles - not only does the soap bar but also the \\&quot;lather\\&quot; and water mixed with lather leave a distinctive coffee brown stain all over.</li>
            <li> The soap has really helped clear up my skin by cutting down on the redness and blotchiness. It does dry my skin out a bit so in the morning after washing my face I apply tree oil to my face and vitamin E oil under my eyes. At night I just wash it and go to bed. It lathers well and just be warned the water looks dirty when you lather but that&#x27;s just the soap. Lol</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!! I loooove the way it cleans and smells!!!! Wow! Simply amazing! I not only shower with it, but I also replaced my usual very expensive facial cleanser with this soap and it did wonders in removing my waterproof mascara and makeup! My face is amazingly soft and clean without any dryness plus the whole entire bathroom smells so fresh after every shower! I can&#x27;t say enough about this soap! I only hope I keep getting the same quality product every time I order from Amazon because I&#x27;m now a customer for life!!!</li>
            <li> I use them to avoid skin rash and excessive dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Do like the smell and the feels.</li>
            <li> Love love this soap..it smells so good,feels clean and fresh after using it..the kids love it too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap! I have eczema and feel it&#x27;s improved my skin. I use it on my body and face and it smells wonderful! Great value, too! Lathers great and can last a while if you&#x27;re careful. This is my soap for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Makes skin feel really clean.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful soft and nourishing soap.  I live it and have left some for my mother to try.</li>
            <li> Been using this soap for about another. A friend asked what I have been doing to my face because my skin looks even toned.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soo good! It does dry the body but the skin is still smooth. Maybe that&#x27;ll remind people to lotion everyday!! Since the body needs that. Anyway I love it &amp; it also smells so good. Leaves my bathroom smelling like an air freshener.</li>
            <li> I do not know all of this stuff works but it does.. 2 people have asked me what I am doing to my skin since i have been using it.. my face is smooth and the bumps I have are going away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I have not reordered this soap as it was really nice. Each bar lasted quiet a leanth of time.  Maybe I&#x27;ll reorder</li>
            <li> Smells good, use it every day. Good price, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  I have oily skin which causes me to break out in pimples.  This soap evens out my skin and helps to clear my pimples.  I use it daily even if my complexion is clear because being that I&#x27;m very active I sweat alot and my face will get oily throught the day. Also, for that time of the month that i expect to break out it keeps my pimples to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Used to purchase expensive facial wash, however have dropped them all for this wonderful soap.  Not over drying and quite effective for preventing acne breakout.  This is the ONLY soap I use now.  So well priced for such a great product.</li>
            <li> This is good soap but it really didn&#x27;t do much for my skin...I bought it because it was suppose to help my acne scars and pimples..it didn&#x27;t help much...but it does clean good and gives you a fresh clean feel.</li>
            <li> got here quick great soap, makes my skin soft, has little ruff pieces in it that help exfoliate. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> i used this soap and i had a break out.I have problem free skin and i never really stick to any particular brand of facial wash and my skin is always smooth. i used this soap on my whole body for two weeks and i started developing pimples ( on my face..and black heads), which does not normally happen to me except for the occasional pre mens pimples.&lt;br /&gt;in fairness to the soap, i am going to use it for the rest of my body which seems to be doing ok and stop using it on my face and see if the pimples will dissipate, that will mean i have to buy another facial wash and see if it will do a good job of clearing the pimples....after that i will update my review. As for the rest of my body, it doesn&#x27;t have a problem with the soap.&lt;br /&gt;So go ahead and try it, but I would suggest you didn&#x27;t start with the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My edited review.....The soap was definitely the cause of my break out.(but i still use it on the rest of my body, with no problems) I bought the St ives apricot scrub and it helped clear some of the pimples, but i am not out of the woods as yet, so been trying castor oil as well. It seems to work for my friend she had really bad skin and now her face is almost flawless.</li>
            <li> First, This is my first review on a product I purchased on Amazon. I&#x27;m only writing this because I am in LOVE with this soap. Yes, it is only my second day of using the product but I noticed immediate results. I had a terrible zit that had been lingering for a couple of weeks and was relentless. This morning I got up and noticed how much it had decreased overnight! My skin is also glowing, smooth, and flawless. The soap lathers very well and has a great sent to it. I do agree with other users that the soap can be a bit drying so make sure you follow up with a light moisturizer right after. Other than that its perfect!!!</li>
            <li> My roommate will not use this soap because it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Dudu&amp;#34;, looks like doo-doo, leaves a doo-doo looking residue and made in Africa.  However,  I find the Dudu most pleasing.  This Dudu makes my hands soft, and has a nice odor. I&#x27;ve been using Dudu on my entire body for about a month now.  I love this soap because of its&#x27; ingredients and so far I have not died from it. - Major plus!!!</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Thank You!</li>
            <li> excellent soap for both body and face, will order again</li>
            <li> This soap is great.  I have now been using it for several months and I can attest to the fact that the soap has many varying benefits.  My skin is smoother and dark spots are lightened.  In addition, the skin on my face is a lot clearer.  The soap has a unique and appealing scent that I love as well.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SOAP!  SKIN REALLY FEELS SOFT AND CLEAN  EVERY  TIME I WASH UP</li>
            <li> Great buy good product</li>
            <li> LOVE THE WAY MY BODY FEELS</li>
            <li> This soap is to die for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant and isn&#x27;t harsh for the nose at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly two months now and it has made my dark spots from acne barely noticeable and are still fading. I usually used to break out a lot under my chin and I once had plenty of dark spots that weren&#x27;t too awful to look at and really noticeable but of course we ourselves notice things about us that bother us more than others. Anyway this soap is wonderful for blemishes and If I ever feel a zit coming I just scrub my face that night  before and within the next day it&#x27;s already disappearing or has disappeared. It&#x27;s entirely natural and costs so much less than other beauty products and still works wonders. It makes the skin soft and you just feel so clean after a shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, be aware that this soap WILL BURN YOUR SKIN (depending on your skin sensitivity that is). I know other reviews talk about how it&#x27;s crap and that it burns/makes your sting peel and dry, and yes this is true, but I recommend that you bare through it as it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do and will ultimately benefit you. Some people say the stinging lasts one week or so but my face kept stinging for two or three weeks. All skin is different though and some days will burn more than others but like I said, bare through it and I promise you that you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Received the soap today and will be returning tomorrow. I have used natural black soap before with much success and can attest that this soap is in no way natural.  The fragrance was so strong I could smell it through the plastic bag. Once I opened the box the cent filled the entire room. It is that strong!! I didn&#x27;t realize that fragrance was listed in the ingredients. Had I known I would not have bought it</li>
            <li> I bought these on the esteemed advice of a female friend. Glad I did! This soap does an amazing job of leaving you clean and refreshed, but not dried out(if used right). It helps with acne/scars more than I expected. Still get acne, but far less of it. It worked well enough for me to toss the old Benzoyl Peroxide in the trash. I also use this soap on my hair as a shampoo, it gives hair texture. The smell is quite nice, not earthy as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People with sensitive skin should be careful when first using this, it can burn you/dry you out if you leave it on too long. Rinse it off quickly and you&#x27;ll be fine. I purposely leave it on longer on acne prone areas to make sure the bacteria die a Dudu-inflicted death.</li>
            <li> Love this soap for face and body!!!! I can not live without. I have very sensitive skin and this soap works awesome. It keeps my eczema under control to!Awesome product and it smells great</li>
            <li> When my family bought dudu-osun soap (we called it dudu soap for short when we first heard of it and then the magical dudu after we had experienced the great benefits), we were a bit skeptical.  But then we tried it!  I had a slight (but consistent) acne problem, and wow was I ever surprised at the results!  I have already had a couple of comments on the nice improvement my skin has made.  When they ask what I&#x27;ve changed, I simply tell them that I rub magical dudu on my face and they proceed to give me rather strange looks of jealousy and longing.  I would suggest that everyone rub magical dudu on their skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really starting to believe in the magical dudu.  Who knows?  Maybe it could help that poor handicapped girl that I keep hearing of with her affliction.  I think her name is Lady Gagle or Lady Googoo or Lady giggles or something, I can&#x27;t remember.  Either way, I think that it&#x27;s wonderful that a person in her condition can get a record contract.  I also think that it might help that other poor boy, Justin Bleeper, that has the condition that forever makes him look and sound like a little girl.  Some people think that it would be a blessing to look eternally young, but I think that that might have a negative effect on a young man&#x27;s self-esteem.  Maybe if the magical dudu can absorb all the kaka-girly nasties that have been imbedded in his skin, then they will stop forcing him to do makeup commercials and sing soprano (unless he wants to, of course, then who am I to say he can&#x27;t)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, you should buy the magical dudu, it is the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 3 weeks.  I saw a slight difference immediately and have noticed lately that my skin is making a comeback!  I notice an improvement everyday.  It&#x27;s even fading my scars.  I will not be without this soap!</li>
            <li> Good soap. Definitely dries the skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just as I expected</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this soap, and was disappointed when it did not meet them. I got it in the hopes of clearing up my acne. The soap smells fantastic and feels great, and I love using it, but my acne got no better or worse after three weeks of use. I still like the product, but I use it da body soap now than a face soap now.</li>
            <li> If you have the kind of acne that benzoyl peroxide helps then this soap will be good for you.  Or if your skin is just oily in general you might like it.  But this soap isn&#x27;t going to help anyones acne who already has dry skin.  I have dry skin and acne.  It does nothing.  I switched to &amp;#34;African Black Soap Raw Organic Natural Pure 1lb&amp;#34; (which is sold here on Amazon) and I like it better than Dudu-Osun.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I will not be going back to the regular soap or soap wash. This is also a great facial soap!!! Thank-you SimplyBeautiful !!!</li>
            <li> Wow!  Not only does it make your skin feel soft and wonderful it smells so fresh.</li>
            <li> Good for a harsher black soap. If you exfoliate with this and use hot water it may burn your skin. It burnt mine. I like black soap but there are other companies that make a gentler black soap. I used this for acne.</li>
            <li> You guys I so wanted this to work since I heard it was amazing for oily/acne-prone skin, but it was terrible! It broke me out so bad and I continued to use it for a few months since I heard of the purging period, but my face never grew to like it. I still haven&#x27;t got rid of the horrible acne it gave me :( I wish my skin loved it, because that would save me so much money! I envy the people this product worked for!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this soap. I originally found it on a travel blog and decided to try a bar for myself. This soap makes me feel so clean and helped a lot with my skin. I am currently living in Costa Rica for a year and brought the bar with me, but after running out near the beginning of my trip I have been dying to get back home for winter to get some more. I just ordered the four pack this weekend and it should be at my house by the time I return for winter break and I am extremely excited to use this soap again. Now I will be sure to bring more back with me in the spring :) I recommend it to all my classmates and friends as well.</li>
            <li> I like this soap it smells good and works well. I would purchase it again</li>
            <li> This soap is very nice and mild. It does not dry out the skin.  It is a nice facial and body soap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible acne issues since I was in 7th grade, I&#x27;m talking unpopable, under the skin, sore, raised, scar-causing, pimples. I have some discoloration due to years of acne (I&#x27;m 25) and the scars are the worst part of it all.I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about two weeks now, and there is sometimes a fluttery burn sensation that goes away once I splash cool water on my face to rinse it off. However my skin has majorly improved, there are almost no marks or pimples on the left side of my face, even the indented scarring has gone away. It&#x27;s been awesome to feel some sort of relief from years of fighting pimples off my very oily complexion! This is no microcell problem but damn did it help! The reason I have the 4 stars is the problem of actually keeping the soap from dripping this nasty brown color all over my shower. I have it in a little ziploc plastic container so the brown stuff stays put. Above all it&#x27;s a great product for those looking for some acne relief.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  You get a nice, clean feeling after using it and feel as though you&#x27;ve used a natural product instead of a lot of chemicals. I use it as a facial cleanser to excellent result.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this soap.  My son was suffering from acne about his face and back.  We have used everything advertised along with Doctor prescriptions to no avail.  After reading the reviews I ordered this in hopes that it would help.  This has been a blessing for him and he does not want to be without it because the minute he does not use it his acne returns.  This has been able to keep breakouts at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one pain about this product, however, I would not mark it down due to it&#x27;s efficiency.  With a teenage son this soap can leave a big mess in the shower.  This is partly due to the nature of the soap but mainly due to the nature of a teenage boy.  After the 8 bars I ordered are used up I think I will try the liquid bottles from the same seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> My wife did not like the soap. It dried her out bad.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works so well to clear up acne and acne scars</li>
            <li> Best soap on the market.</li>
            <li> This soap  is  great  for  purring the skin of oil and  dirt and  keeping the skin smooth and radiant along with a  scent that  makes you even  feel  clean. It will  not  dry  out your skin either.  Have  given  soap  to  friend at  work  and  it  has  cured the blemishes she had from pimples and i  can  safely say the same  as for myself when i  first used it  while on  deployment  in  Afghanistan.If your skin  is sensitive try if you feel a tingle leave  on  as  best you  can  then  rinse  off and build up  tolerance over time .  But this  soap  does what  other soaps claim but at a  better price .If your using Proactive i  will  ask  you  to  try  this  soap .I feel  safe  that with  one  bar you  will  see  better  results with a better product to  cost  value .I strongly recommend this  product as i  have  ordered it  many times with good results .</li>
            <li> I first came across this soap at an herbiary in Philadelphia selling for $5 each bar. The scent was beautiful and strong, but not in an obnoxious way at all.     The bar lasted for me for quite a long time- I only use it to wash my face. After using up the entire bar, I went back to using regular soaps and I really missed my black soap. It also became apparent to me how much residue regular soaps leave on my skin. I was very glad to see this soap being sold on amazon in multi-packs for much less than $5 each bar. The package arrived promptly and the bars are just as fragrant as they are at the herb boutique.    I will continue using this seller to supply me with black soap.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap. My family and I have been using this soap for over 6 months. After a couple of months, my daughter said her eczema went away. I feel clean every time I use it. I smells clean and fresh. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for just over 2 months and cannot recommend it enough. I initially bought a single bar as a test, and the minute that it started to shrink I ordered the 4-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My roomate and I both have seborrhoeic dermatitis, which results in red, irritated, flaky skin around our noses, in between and in our eyebrows, in my beard and on both of our scalps.  After having tried NUMEROUS remedies, including dandruff shampoo, apple cider vinegar, mail-order acne treatments, prescription steroid creams and cleansing facial scrubs, we have both found something that actually WORKS.  In the almost 2 months that I have been using this soap I have not suffered one breakout of SD on my face, and my beard and scalp are not nearly as flaky and itchy as they used to be.  In fact, my skin tone all over my body has improved and I have noticed very slight diminishing of various stretch marks here and there - nothing drastic though.  Perhaps with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself has a very pleasant herbal/earthy scent that stays with you throughout the day, but is not overpowering, so it is safe to use with colognes/perfumes and not be a distraction.  It just smells CLEAN.  As some other reviewers have mentioned, since it is a black soap, some of the lather is dark colored, but I use dark washclothes anyway so I cannot say if it stains permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather is AMAZING.  It is the thickest lather that I have ever seen from a bar soap - I even use it as a shaving cream for my face.  Immediately after I get out of the shower my skin feels healthy, firm and soft all day long.  I also have begun using it as a shampoo, and it makes my hair shiny, soft and manageable without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this soap is that it is completely organic and has the ingredients, in plain english, printed on the back of the box.  There are no artificial ingredients or preservatives to be found apart from \\&quot;fragrance,\\&quot; which I admit could be anything but so far whatever it is has not irritated my skin in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have SD or any other type of skin irritation, PLEASE give this soap a try with at least one bar.  I have fallen completely in love with it and recommend it to all of my friends, and probably will never buy another type of soap as long as this continues to be made.s has not irritated my skin in the least.  If you have SD or any other type of skin irritation, PLEASE give this soap a try with at least one bar.  I have fallen completely in love with it and recommend it to all of my friends, and probably will never buy another type of soap as long as this continues to be made.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap you can use if you are having problems with dry skin.  I&#x27;m using less body moisturizer than I ever have.  Not to mention it&#x27;s such a lovely mild soap for one&#x27;s face.  If you have acne due to dry skin don&#x27;t use harsh soap&#x27;s.  Use Dudu-osun.  If you&#x27;re having dry scalp issues then try this soap on your scalp as well.  I highly recommend it scalp, face, or an all over body soap.  It&#x27;s the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product!  My teenage son has very oily skin and we see a major improvement since he&#x27;s been using the soap.  I&#x27;m a true Dove user and I have fallen in love with this soap. It lathers very well, leaves skin squeaky clean and smells wonderful.  I think anyone with acne and/or oily skin should really consider using this product.  Warning: Melts pretty fast if its in water too long.</li>
            <li> i love this soap, always have. it lathers good and smells great. i use it on my 5 year old, my 9 month old (both boys) and me. very good buy. thank you very, very much.</li>
            <li> Worth the money. If you are a fan of this soap, well this is a great deal. The pack has lasted for two months and it&#x27;s the family soap. It does not waste so fast like other african black soaps that are out in the market. This is truly and good investment.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this soap, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this soap. It smells great, makes you feel so clean and keeps your skin feeling so soft for a great deal of time after your shower/bath. I no longer use anything other than this soap in my house. My sister has a little girl (just turned 1) who has skin problems and she now uses this on her and has seen great results. My brother in law in a marine, during training and drills when it is hot out, he sweats a lot which will cause his shoulders and back to break out. He now uses this and has seen great results. My sisters and I all use it as our face wash as well and it also has worked very well. I would and will recommend this soap to anyone.</li>
            <li> Feels great, smells great. I use it on my face as well. Dissolves quickly in the shower.</li>
            <li> great soap. smell decent and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Loved it! This is a great product, just what I was looking for...I will be ordering this product again soon.</li>
            <li> I brought this soap because of my psoriasis and it feels great on my skin. Did I mention that it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> *Me &#x3D; scars from acne. Breakout around PMS hence more acne scars. Oh and yep oily skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Dudu&lt;br /&gt;- Nice smell&lt;br /&gt;- leaves skin soft/smooth and extremely squeaky clean&lt;br /&gt;- I wash my face once with the soap, then put soap on my face, leave it for like 1 min&lt;br /&gt;- AVOID sensitive areas&lt;br /&gt;- I have not seen my scars getting better (yet) but we&#x27;ll see&lt;br /&gt;- will still buy it.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for body soap, as it leaves you extremely squeakily clean, however I was using it as a cleanser as well. I have extremely sensitive combination skin. It dried out my face for the most part, and made me break out a bit and have whiteheads. Once I stopped using it and used my old cleanser, my face turned back to normal.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this soap to fade some acne blemishes and help reduce breakouts... when I opened the box the smell made me gag unfortunately I had to set it back outside until I got used to the fragrance.. other than the smell and the black mess it leaves in the shower its definitely cleared my face up and simplified my makeup routine</li>
            <li> Need clarity on this item they seem like the same and five different distribution</li>
            <li> Be careful if you suffer rosacea</li>
            <li> ty so much what a deal!</li>
            <li> great soap and made my skin smooth</li>
            <li> Fab soap have been using it since 1998 when I was little. Definitely helps the skin out.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing; I walk into my bathroom and smell the wonderful fresh and natural fragrance.  Amazingly rich lather.  Makes the skin on my body feel toned and soft.  I have acneic skin on my face, and after ONE USE, my skin was brighter and it made my zits mature by the end of the day so that they could be extracted.  My face did feel a liiiiitle tight, but some toner and moisturizer and that was that! I will never use anything else to wash my skin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did feel that my face felt a little dry after using it twice a day for the first to days. So, I just skipped a day.  I recommend skipping a day as you see fit whenever you feel some dryness.</li>
            <li> Great for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy this soap after reading all the positive reviews so I bought the 4 pack. I had been using mary kay before so I stopped using mary kay to test this soap out and at first it made my skin smooth and less irritated for about a week or so but after that no significant change and my skin went back to breaking out within the next couple of weeks or so. Long story short I went back to mary kay and my skin is clearing up again. Maybe I&#x27;ll try again another time but it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone so if you&#x27;re gonna try it just buy one bar at first.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I have taken out everything from my old face washing routine and simply replaced it with this soap. I used to have a breakout every week and after using this I have none. I love it and will continue to use it. This does depend on skin types, what works for me might not work for you but its def worth a try!</li>
            <li> I live with psoriasis and it can be very uncomfortable and irritating at times. This soap has subsided the further inflammation of my skin. As long as I maintain a healthy diet and use the soap I have not had problems with my skin. I am very satisfied indeed!</li>
            <li> This is quite honestly one of the best soap i have used. My face a body is cleared up and no longer blemished. Also, my skin is baby soft. I have tried other acne products and not onenof them has worked this well. grant i still get some breakouts but mothing like it was.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It smells great.  It leaves my skin incredibly soft.  I follow with Shea butter as a moisturizer.  I love the smell of this soap, and have gotten even more compliments about my scent than before I started using this.  It does help with lessening freckles and dark spots, helps with scars and healing, and helps fade stretch marks.  I did not like using it on my face, though and I don&#x27;t know why.  I thought it left my skin blotchy.  It may be due to the fact that I was using a REVERSE skin care line just prior, which was supposed to lighten my skin...so who knows.</li>
            <li> I bought these to help a teenage daughter with acne, agreed to try these with her.&lt;br /&gt;These helped her clear her face without over drying it.&lt;br /&gt;This did not dry my skin out either, a bonus side effect was that it cleared up the dry skin on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to buy these, this brand (Dudu-Osun) specifically.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 4 or 5 years now and I will never use another.  My skin is softer than it&#x27;s ever been and smells divine.  Dudu Osun serves as the perfect base for the myriad of moisturizers I use (shea butter, sweet almond oil, lotion) and my Desert Essence deoderant.  I&#x27;ve had to use other soaps when I&#x27;ve run out and my skin immediately notices the difference. I&#x27;ve even tried other brands of black soap and I&#x27;ve either disliked the smell or they made me itch. Not all black soap formulas are the same, Dudu Osun is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I don&#x27;t use Dudu Osun daily on my face, not because it&#x27;s too harsh or anything but because I use a tea tree oil based face wash that takes care of blemishes.</li>
            <li> I didnt really care for this soap, it makes my family very itchy and REALLY dries out our skin. The smell is okay but not really amazing. And the number one reason i dont like it is because it make my girly part burn smh</li>
            <li> I bought this soap on advice from a friend who was getting adult acne.  I myself have been having an issue as well as my teenage children.  I bought the soap and we have all been using it for about a month now and we love it!  Our skin is soooo soft and it has done wonders for our acne.  My son&#x27;s face has cleared up nicely and I have not gotten a pimple since!!  My boyfriend uses it for his psoriasis and the patches are clearing up!!  The soap has a nice smell, but the only downfall is that it leaves a puddle of brown suds and residue on the soap dish.  It rinses easily and is definitely worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all love it!!  I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> The Dudu-Osun is as good as the nubian in slightly different ways; more fragrant, dissolves faster.&lt;br /&gt;lathers as well while being a milder soap.</li>
            <li> I like this soap and re ordered it again because it makes me feel so fresh and so clean! In addition to that, the soap provides a temporary \\&quot;brightness\\&quot; to my face for a few minutes after washing. Though the brightness could be attributed to the lime ingredient used in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m neutral to the smell, doesnt excite or bother me. It will burn if you are not used to it or have not used it for a while. The lather is amazing and can be used as a shampoo, though it served no beneficial purpose to my hair. It is drying and should be coupled with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, its a good soap if you want to feel clean, but as per other reviews I did expect something special. And its really not.</li>
            <li> It smells like nature and enough soap creator so that we can wash head to toe.</li>
            <li> I got this for acne. It really dries you out but I have found that that (the drying) makes my acne worse. I since have went to &amp;#34;the caveman&amp;#34; regimen and only use water and a washcloth to wash my face. It helped a lot!</li>
            <li> Had patches of chronic dry skin for years and years that resisted any kind of medical treatment- this stuff cleared it up within one use. I cannot stress how awesome it is. After letting it lather for a few minutes, you feel almost abnormally clean. And using it on my scalp has completely eliminated my dandruff as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;srsly. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Immediate lresults!  I love how my skin looked the 2nd day and now it has been 5 days and see a brighter, clear  face and my pores minimized!  I will continue to use and even will add the line of products from Dudu-Osun!</li>
            <li> The soap has a strong aroma to it I couldn&#x27;t stand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My roommate loved the smell so I gave them to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves this soap and has asked me to order more for her so I guess it&#x27;s good!  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I just couldn&#x27;t handle the smell.  Maybe chicks just like the smell...</li>
            <li> If you have skin issues, itching, dryness acne, or cannot find a soap that really works with your skin give this product a try. It lathers well. Good to order several bars at one time. Do not be concerned about the tingly feeling you have during the initial use. That goes away. It it almost as if the lather gives special attention to areas of the skin that need it. Try it, you will see its great! A little more cleaning in the shower but its well worth it.  My already dark skin darkened more during the summer but that was a small trade off for having no other issues including acne or dry areas. After each use I applied African Shea butter. I feel good in my skin now.</li>
            <li> Wonderful right&lt;br /&gt;Greatly relieved to use this soap&lt;br /&gt;Excellent in cleaning the skin and smell nice&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to purchase&lt;br /&gt;nice</li>
            <li> The soap cleans very good and has a nice smell.  I have experienced no side effects, redness or other irritation that others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I have been using black soap on my body and face for 3 years now and I love this product. It melts a little too fast for me, but it&#x27;s worth it to me. I really like this soap and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is great and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Love love love this soap!! It does make very fine form and cleans very well.. Yet it doesn&#x27;t dry. It&#x27;s magic!!</li>
            <li> Great for dry, itchy skin!!</li>
            <li> Yes I love this soap. Four bars, great deal. I&#x27;m one down, three to go and another order. Clean, fresh skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for my broken out skin</li>
            <li> Lv this soap better than old school soap</li>
            <li> Leaves you so clean and soft, we have since ordered so many more and everyone in the house loves it.</li>
            <li> It smells like nature and enough soap creator so that we can wash head to toe. Excellent lather and feel. Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin. Nice clean feeling. Overall, it&#x27;s pricey but i&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Its a great soaps and does clean very well.</li>
            <li> Not bad. I think I like the raw African soap better, but I like that this is already in bar form and I don&#x27;t have to cut it myself and each bar seems to last longer than the raw soap. It lathers ok, but not as well as the other and the lather isn&#x27;t as nice. I will likely alternate between the two because the African raw soap is my favorite and makes my sensitive skin feel great. This soap is also good and I rated them the same.</li>
            <li> Love love love this soap. A must have for those dealing with acne. I purchased this product a little over a year ago and have been using it daily ever since. I am soon finished with my fourth bar and need to buy more. I have been dealing with acne for many many many years. It was horrible and I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. I&#x27;ve been to countless dermatologists that helped not one bit. All they did was aggravate my skin even more. After many years of wasting money on soaps, creams, tools, anything that claimed to help my skin but didn&#x27;t, I gave up. I just wanted to have beautiful skin. I dropped all the expensive ineffective harsh acne treatments and went the natural route. I stumbled upon this soap and decided to buy it. I never looked back ever since. This has done wonders for my skin. I am so serious. I can not use any other soap for my face. All I do to my face is wash with this soap and apply coconut oil as a moisturizer. I do not even have to wear makeup anymore. My mother compliments me on my skin all the time now. Now my mother and my sisters use this soap. They all love it. I have never felt so pretty til I stated using this soap.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff, but leaves dark messes in your soap dish. Can&#x27;t quite see why the overwhelming positive reviews on it. Smells nice and it&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li> This soap smells very nice. Its soft on the skin. Moisturizes well, and its the first time I am using this product.</li>
            <li> I could smell this soap through the shipping box before I even opened it! My whole bathroom now smells like it. Now, perhaps you will love the smell and that will be a great feature. Personally, for me it is overly tropical and fruity. I don&#x27;t think I would mind the scent if I only smelled it when I used it, but it&#x27;s making my bathroom smell a bit reminiscent of a cheap hotel in a tropical locale. Granted, I do have a sensitive nose, but wow, I&#x27;ve never had soap make my whole bathroom smell. I can actually smell it from my bed. It&#x27;s like I need to keep it in a sealed up little box.&lt;br /&gt;As for the soap itself, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, so I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference in my skin. It has a very nice, rich lather, which I like. It does leave a bit of a film on the skin - not necessarily a bad thing, but for those who like coming out of the shower feeling squeaky clean, it is not exactly that feeling. However, I am hoping that film that remains is moisturizing my skin?</li>
            <li> Kinda burns when u first use it but i do see my skin clear up alot works good it smells ok also</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complains about this product. My wife has been using her first soap (from this package) and so far according to her, the skin is softer and feels more clean in comparison with other products. I hope the manufacturer keep the quality of this wonderful soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for my mild psoriasis and now I don&#x27;t want another. I introduced it to my family and they&#x27;ve become quick fans too. I would only warn that you should really rinse the tub after using because it can up how often you need to clean it.</li>
            <li> Love love love love it , it&#x27;s very very good !&lt;br /&gt;I even orders more for my whole family and friends</li>
            <li> Felt great on my skin..cleared up blemishes nicely</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast service.</li>
            <li> Thought it was coal tar soap. It is not. Made from tree ashes.</li>
            <li> It was working for the first couple weeks and then it started breaking me out, I kept using it even after then because after reading reviews they said it takes longer to see results. My skin still didn&#x27;t clear up and it was still breaking out. It did help slightly with the lightening of my scars.</li>
            <li> This soap dries my skin out, if it had done what most of the reviews said it would, I might have been able to tolerate the smell. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This soap is great.  Works great if you have acne on back !</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that it has fragrance in it</li>
            <li> I have to say at first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell but it grew on me and really like it now. Also my skin dryed out at first but seems to have got better with time and I continue to use it. All I have to say is I have seen my skin improve in many ways like the appearence, and my face I have seen a difference as well. I have used it for about 2 months I think and really like it so far. Will buy again and I would say try it and wait and see if you see improvement for your self. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  There is a visible difference in my skin and I couldn&#x27;t be more excited about a product!  My skin is brighter and softer.  I have a neuromuscular disease that also causes hyper pigmentation and &amp;#34;rashes.&amp;#34;  The Dudu-Osun Black Soap has reduced the appearance of one of the rashes which has been a big boost to my self esteem!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this soap for over a year now and just love it.  I started buying it as an acne treatment for one of my teenage sons.  It both treats existing acne, prevents AND fades acne scars.  Even the purple acne scars that people with brown skin get.  I started buying it for him because he wanted something simple, but I wanted to use it too and so did my other teenage son.  All three of us have had results with this soap and I tell everyone to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has faded my own acne scars, some that were over 10 years old and not only that, but I sometimes get cystic acne along my jaw but not with this soap.  I only get it if I don&#x27;t use the soap for a while.  I love this stuff.  The son that I originally found this soap for, his face was a mess when I first started ordering, he had so many scars and was constantly breaking out, it was sad.  The acne changed his handsome face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he has his face back!!  It took some time but his skin is so much better, he looks like my son again and his self esteem has improved greatly.  I highly recommend this soap.  The best way to use it is to wet your face, soap up your hands, wash your face with your soapy hands, let it sit just a minute, rinse and repeat once more.  Try to do it twice a day and in time you should see results.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have used black mud soaps before, and a friend recommended this one. As soon as I pulled it out of the Amazon box, I noticed the fragrance. I was surprised that it smelled \\&quot;soapy,\\&quot; not sweet like the other black soaps, and not like herbs or essential oils. When I opened the individual soap box and sniffed the bar, the smell was so overwhelming it nearly knocked me over. I had to put it back in the box and threw all four of them away. The ingredients state \\&quot;fragrance,\\&quot; but doesn&#x27;t state what exactly is used for fragrance. As a side note, it&#x27;s not actually a mud soap, which - my bad - I assumed it was. I would have still tried it on my skin though if I could have gotten past the smell. I&#x27;ll stick with my Nubian Heritage African Black Soap, which smells divine and keeps my skin clear. I&#x27;m not exactly sure why I tried something else anyway.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail sooooo fast! Smells amazing and leaves my skin so clean. Definitely use a nice moisturizer afterward like shea butter because it cleans off everything.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. I&#x27;ve had pretty severe acne for the past four years and have even used prescription medication for it. Nothing worked until I tried African Black Soap!!! I went from around 20 active zits on my face on a daily basis to maybe 3 or 4 or on a bad day. My scarring isn&#x27;t disappearing yet. But being able to wake up without acne is fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a liquid and a bar soap version. Both have worked for me, but I prefer the bar soap. It&#x27;s a little harsh on the skin, but I recommend the bar soap over the liquid for acne. If you want something less drying, go for the liquid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I DO use prescription Retin A Gel in conjunction with this soap. But I didn&#x27;t notice a remarkable difference in my skin until I started using this soap.</li>
            <li> Ok stuff doesn&#x27;t necessarily prevents breakout but somehow it faded my acne scar.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I read the benefits to using African Black Soap (those are many) It really helps with my Eczema and keeps my skin looking fresh and soft. The soap smells great too! I have used other brands of A.B.S. and they were very gritty but also worked. I like the Dudu-osun soap because it is not typically gritty as others. Sometimes you will find some large exfoliation bits that are rough. I just take my just take my finger nail and scrape it off into the water. I also recommend keeping the soap in a container if you use it in the shower. I put my soap in one of those plastic traveling soap containers. If you leave it out and let the water run over it the soap will disintegrate quickly.</li>
            <li> Was afraid to buy this soap because I didnt want to be duped but I really like it.  Lathers well and I really like the changes I see in my skin. The smell is strong(it doesnt stink) so when I opened the box my whole room smelled like the soap even though I hadnt used it yet.  I already know I will be purchasing more as soon as I run out.  I have been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> This soap is great but it makes my skin dry after use.But I&#x27;m using cocoa butter and Shea butter to soothe that dry skin feeling...</li>
            <li> Waste of money, dirt and grit even hair in this soap.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this item.  Feels great on the skin.  My husband asked for more.  A great sign.</li>
            <li> This soap is phenomenal. I&#x27;m an African-American who sometimes gets dark spots from acne. When I use this along with exfoliating gloves, it works like a charm to get ride of or fade the dark spots I have. I use this on my face and I constantly get compliments about how even my skin tone looks. It also makes my skin feel super smooth!</li>
            <li> Where had it been all my life???  Amazing...  It helped in clearing my back and chest acne scares. I used it on face too gently and this made me get rid of all of the 70 dollars kits that had been draining my pockets.&lt;br /&gt;The first shower did give some tingles during rinsing but by day two I was ok. What I will suggest is some shea butter after the shower.  The soap gets out all the dirt and opens up your pores soothe the skin with some shea butter and say hallo to the gorgeous skin coming out.&lt;br /&gt;The buffer or loafer to use should not be of a light color white, peach or cream won&#x27;t look the same... The soap is dark brown and made of oils that will stain the loafer though I do wash mine in the machine every Sunday to get the oils out.&lt;br /&gt;It does not stain the shower but it will have a slippery feel after a two to three days. please clean the shower to avoid accidents.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s cheap and works fast... It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Man people really prey on us. Yes I was one they caught. This is a joke. Makes the washcloths black/brown and although it comes out some, it is hard to get the washcloth white again. I notice nothing special about this soap, so I would stick with a soap you know is good and works well with your skin. Nothing special about this soap. Maybe it is not the contents it was supposed to be??</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing African Black soap worked for acne-prone skin, and I was not disappointed!! Acne products get soo expensive with all the special formulas but seriously, this soap is going to be the only thing I buy in the future. I ran into some horrible acne problems I first tried acne.org&#x27;s line, but began substituting this soap for their cleanser. I still used their treatment to clear it up (which I would also recommend!), but now my skin is clear and I just have to use this soap to maintain it, no more benzoyl peroxide. Lathers amazing, not too drying but also gets all the oil off my skin. Highly recommended, for this price you can&#x27;t go wrong!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- I&#x27;ve been using this soap for almost a year now (July 2012) and this sounds crazy, but I am still on the SAME BAR! Seriously it lathers up so well you can forget about rubbing the bar between your hands, just take your wet fingers, run them over the bar a bit, then rub them together and you have enough to wash your face. Five bucks for a year&#x27;s worth of cleanser! (I bought the individual bar from another seller here on amazon for 5 bucks, cause I didnt want to get a lot of something I had never tried). I don&#x27;t even wear foundation most days anymore, my skin is that clear and even (and I&#x27;m not one of those people with naturally perfect skin, as I said above- I was having real acne problems!). I would recommend this soap to anyone, I can&#x27;t say that enough!</li>
            <li> Not good as expected, I was hoping the soap would be more fit for oil skin but it turns out it&#x27;s just for normal skin</li>
            <li> My son and I both broke out after trying this on our faces.</li>
            <li> I love it. It cleans the skin from blackheads, acne, small skin tags, eczema and it smalls good.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. Dont let the color, smell or name deter you from buying this. I have oily skin and have struggled w/ acne, ingrown hairs, &amp; scars my entire life- this rids of everything. It will make your skin very smooth. Any blemishes or acne will scab up and healthily bring back new skin. Buy it</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful, all natural and it helps your skin still nice, soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference.  I still have breakouts.  I have burned my skin with this soap using it conjuction with a facial sponge. Working it into a lather and applying it with hands works best.  It is \\&quot;unrefined\\&quot; and does have residue and deposits within the soap bar, including, but not limited to splinters, ash, etc.  It has a strong smell.  It does remove oils from your face that you must replenish with moisturizers.  For some reason it reminds me of an astringent. I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed that after using this product for three weeks, I haven&#x27;t noticed a measurable change in my skin tone or acne breakouts.  It&#x27;s just okay.  If you have sensitive skin as I do, be very careful to not overuse this product.  It is good for makeup removal and cleansing ONCE a day.  Anything more frequent may harm your skin or compromise its disposition.  I have oily, acne prone, sensitive skin and I mean VERY OILY.  Even so, I can only use this soap once a day to minimize irritation and burning my skin.  I&#x27;m going to try Biore&#x27;s charcoal soap bar now.    I have natural, ethnic, coarse hair and I&#x27;ve used it once to remove product buildup as a shampoo.  Because our hair is naturally dry, I immediately added shea butter and oils to my scalp first and then to my strands to replenish moisture and avoid breakage.      It&#x27;s okay but no cigar!  Sorry folks...</li>
            <li> Mild and lightly scented, this soap is really nice.</li>
            <li> Great soap especially if you are suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> Dries you out, very badly! It also has a strong smell (like incense almost). The smell doesn&#x27;t leave you all day. If you hate strong smells it&#x27;s the worst. Amazon easily refunded my money, though.</li>
            <li> made a mess in the soap dish</li>
            <li> I love it... Makes me want to stay in the shower! I&#x27;ve never felt so clean!</li>
            <li> It is working beautifully. I will recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Mild on the skin and cleans well.  I have sensitive skin so this is helpful stuff.  Lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Same soap my girlfriend brought back from Africa.</li>
            <li> Best soap evahh!! I am a guy who hates oily feeling on my skin and pretty much every bodywash I used have leave that feeling when showering, but this black piece of weird looking soap change everything.  The first thing that I notice is  that I don&#x27;t really have to scrub with this soap anymore. The soap takes all the oil and sweat from your skin along with the dirt down to the drain leaving you with just dry skin I notice that my skin always dry after a cold shower and that only happen when I use hot water to wash off the sweat on my body. This also a good facial cleaner heck I threw away my facial cleaner when I start using this. It keeps your face clean from the dirt that get carried out from your sweat so that even if you get acne it doesn&#x27;t get worse and allow it to heal slowly. I have a bad red head break out that why I start buying this 2 day and it starts to reduce the swelling and by the end of the week if pretty much faded away. Since Popping it can leave bruises on your facial skin this soap offer a softer touch while allow your acne s*** to slowly heal without damaging your skin.    cons-- this black stuff is either being uses by family or is just melt really fast cause I remember it a huge block in less than 2 weeks it became a piece of sponge.   2--- second this soap will make your skin feel dry cause it will wash off the natural oil on ur skin and making it dry. No worry though, just use lotion or coconut oil and it will be fine,try Nature&#x27;s Way Coconut Oil-extra Virgin let it melt and use it as body and face moisturizer and no it&#x27;s not sticky if you ask.    this also the longest review i have ever wrote just to support this company</li>
            <li> Works wonders for eczema. However, it does leave skin a little tight feeling after use and I feel as if the bars of soap do not last very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many pricey products to try to treat my acne-prone face and body, and NONE of them work like this soap does! My face, back and shoulders have dramatically cleared up within a matter of days, and it seems like older acne marks are fading already! I like the light, fresh scent and abundant lather. It can be a tad drying at first, but stick with it and be sure to moisturize (which you should do anyway, even with oily skin).  The price is amazing too! I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Dudo osun is helping little fade a dark spots and keep soft skin in twice day, but I love it already. I&#x27;ll order more Dudo osun is so ROCK!</li>
            <li> I saw a similar product on the Dr. Oz show, so I looked it up and bought this brand. I don&#x27;t have horrible skin problems but stuff that is noticeable to me. I noticed a difference in days. I stopped using my Old Spice body wash and started using this on my body and face. As an African American, I get razor bumps and ingrown hairs from shaving. They can be very painful. Since I started using this soap, my ingrown hairs on my face and neck have been drastically reduced. My skin all over my body is clearer. My wife has even started using it on her face and it has started to clear up her breakouts.  Old scars that I have from playing football have begun to fade.  Don&#x27;t be discouraged that the soap is called \\&quot;DUDU\\&quot;, because it is anything but.</li>
            <li> I bought the black soap as a recommendation from someone at my esthetician&#x27;s office to help with my acne.  I reserached a few different kinds &amp; brands, and landed on the Dudu-Osun which was rated pretty highly, had good reviews, and was offered at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I used it, I felt it &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; on my skin and my skin felt smoother and overall just really clean! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now, and I think my skin is just getting used to it - so I use it every other day now so my skin doesnt get so used to it.  I like it a lot! One bar lasts a long time, its gets really soapy and is pure so I like that it is natural, as well.  It does stain your tub/soap holder - but nothing a little elbow grease cant remove :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say it did initally help on my acne - but my skin just adapted over time.  Im not sure if it made any difference on my dark spots/acne scarring as I also use other creams to help treat.  But I can say that I have noticed my acne getting much better over the past couple of months, too!  When I first started using it, I would lather up my face and let it sit for about a minute before scrubbing it off with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I have bad eczema on my arms and neck. Since I&#x27;ve been using the soap flare ups a minimal. And it smells great too.</li>
            <li> The soaps smell too much. It&#x27;s not a bad smell but I would prefer just to be clean and take advantages of the benefits that according to the seller the soaps offer and not be cover with any scent. Besides, it looks like my roommate is allergic to the soap&#x27;s fragrance. If you don&#x27;t like random fragrances on your skin, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product because I started breaking out with guattate psoriasis. I also have occasional acne outbreaks. Since I have been using the soap, I have definitely noticed an overall improvement of my skin.Scars seem to be healing and I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts. It is amazing how much better my skin looks after only using the soap twice!! It burned the first time I used it but after that my skin adjusted. I would highly recommend this soap for acne, psoriasis, eczema, scars, or even just as a disinfectant. Not to mention, it smells really good and is a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a great all-around soap for the whole family. It lathers up luxuriously and personally I love the smell. I use this on my toddler and it&#x27;s surprisingly gentle, despite its powerful healing effects. By using this soap in conjunction with tea tree oil I have finally been able to cure my toe fungus. At the end of my shower I lather up a bit more soap and put the lather on my toes and leave it there. I then use tea tree in the evening before bed. It&#x27;s made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The soap has a good smell and lather but something in it I must be allergic to, it made me burn and itch.</li>
            <li> I have been using thid soap for a couple of months now and it appears to be good.  Its not drying like some soaps are,  I also ordered the African Black Soap, I will be trying that soap next.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this again when I run out. It has been the best soap to help clean out my pores. Delivered timely, with no complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes it would get rid of new stretch marks and blemishes, I&#x27;ve been using it every day since mid July and the only thing it did was dry my skin out. It smells great though!</li>
            <li> The soaps came in  very fast. Love it so far. I always feel extra clean , when i am done.</li>
            <li> DAILY USE AS A PREP TO SHAVING AND  ALL OVER I LIKE THE FRAGRANCE  PLEASE KEEP IT IN A AREA THAT WILL ALLOW IT TO DRY WITHOUT FLOATING IN A DISH</li>
            <li> After I used it, my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> Always use this soap. Switch between my AMBI black soap and this one. It works well. I sometimes use the Bar soap (Coconut &amp; Papaya) right after for moisturizing. This ideas came from another review, it works good I believe with constant use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about a month now and I have noticed a huge difference on my skin and my break outs. After having kids i noticed I started to break out alot around the time I would get my period every month. I&#x27;m someone that always get one or two a month but it was to a point where my skin would be beautiful one week and then black heads and acne the next. I also stress alot at work and that does not help the skin either, so anyways I found this product actually on groupon.com and it came in a pack of 3 for only $10 so i bought it and I&#x27;m so glad I did, my black heads on my nose are almost gone, I have not had a huge pimple on my face this month and my acne scars seem to be alittle better but not gone. I&#x27;m giving this product some more time to work its magic for me to see even better results.</li>
            <li> It made me feel so smooth. Don&#x27;t let the name fool you it has a very pleasant smell . My daughter took two of them !!! She loved them so much.</li>
            <li> Good.There are better soaps in the market.It was OK.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! My skin looks brighter with less noticeable brown spots. I think it&#x27;s even helped my roseacea. And in case you are wondering, I&#x27;m a female Caucasian. My skin that is sensitive to most soaps - not this one! I&#x27;m also trying it on my chihuahua that has skin problems.</li>
            <li> I left a bar of this in the corner of my tub, and it kinda melts and runs everywhere. Overall, it&#x27;s a good soap, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me that other soaps didn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> Did not like this soap. Too dry on my skin and the smell really bothered me :( disappointed .</li>
            <li> Great price. Fast delivery. But i did not like the soap. It smelled funny. And it blackens the dish its in, the cloth also.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. I&#x27;ve struggled with intense acne for so long and recently I&#x27;ve developed hormonal acne around my monthly visitor time. After 2 months of continuous use, I one day woke up with clear skin. Like WTH.... Me, clear skin. And my dark spots due to acne fading significantly. I&#x27;ve fallen of the wagon a little but my acne are no longer huge or painful like in the past :), even around aunt flow time. So happy to have tried this and will use it for ever. If you&#x27;re in doubt, try it, stick with it, and marvel in the glory that is clear skin :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for me it never burned my face, I&#x27;ve left it in for a while and nothing. It is drying but any decent moisturizer with take care if it. Treat yo self, buy this soap.</li>
            <li> I read a million reviews on natural soaps before buying this one. So far so good. It smells awesome and has a fantastic lather. WE have never experienced the burn that some other reviews have mentioned but our family doesn&#x27;t have particularily sensitive skin. Although it claims to be &amp;#34;made entirely from natural ingredients and herbs&amp;#34; the last few ingredients are pretty vague. (i.e. &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;) I&#x27;m all about FULL disclosure on product ingredients and I wish Amazon as well as the soap company would give specifics. For that, I am giving the soap a four-star rating.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, 2 days after purchase. It leaves the skin very soft and can be used on sensitive and dry skin like my own. (not excessively of course. You should still mosturize your face after washing it with this.) just be wary of the packaging the bars come in. It&#x27;s a bit loose so don&#x27;t go chucking it around.</li>
            <li> I like this soap more than any other black soap I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon.  It has a pleasant smell, lathers great and seems to last longer than the other brands I ve tried.  It cleanses the skin (face or body) beautifully. Despite the funny name, this seems to be a serious product.  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, tried many products and shower gels, nothing works as well as this African soap. It leaves my skin moist and tight. I don&#x27;t get black heads as much as before. Only downside is that the soap can get messy so keep in a separate area on the tub. It smells a bit odd at the beginning, but after the first use it smells good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell and it can dry the skin</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. My skin has definitely gotten better and I will definitely be replenishing soon. I use this soap to bathe with and to wash my face and my skin is soft and glowing. Better than the morning burst I used to use on my face prior to receiving this. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love love love the smell and how soft this soap leaves my hands. It does make a big mess though!</li>
            <li> This dried out my skin.  All this hype about how good this soap is for a persons skin and that it isn&#x27;t drying - WRONG!  I threw the extra bars away and it stained the white on the tub and was hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Makes my body feel squeaky clean. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love its scent and how it cleans without over drying my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used different black soaps and have always liked them.&lt;br /&gt;The Dudu-Osun black soap burns my skin and someone I gave&lt;br /&gt;it too had the same problem.</li>
            <li> It really smells good when I grabbed it from my mailbox. It was also shipped before its expected delivery time.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I started using Dudu-Osun African Black Soap. It rinses clean and has a nice citrusy scent. Previously, I purchased from another seller and the scent was stronger and the soap didn&#x27;t have Dudu-Osun and Tropical Naturals stamped into it like this one. Honestly, I have no idea if one is authentic and the other is not. Either way, I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to help fight body achene.  As others have noted, it does have a slight burning (or tingling) feeling when you first use it, but after a few days that feeling goes away. The sent is nice (not overpowering at all) and it lasts all day.  I have noticed that it does reduce achene just like it states.  The ingredients are simple and chemical free, that is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> This soap made my skin burn, not to mention it stinks! There&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s called Dudu. I&#x27;m throwing it out.</li>
            <li> This soap clears your skin so fast and it smells amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I have mild acne in my face and back and this soap is helping a lot. I would prefer an unscented version but for me is ok. I use it in the shower everyday and lathers nicely. It does not dry my skin, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I haver tried.</li>
            <li> I RECOMEND THIS SOAP LOVE THE SMELL AND HOW IT FEELS SO CREAMY.</li>
            <li> I had been using Raw African Black Soap for about three months and loved it. A little over a month ago when it was time to reorder I decided to try this brand instead, I thought it would be a little more convenient since I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep cutting small pieces from the big block with a knife every week or so (not a big nuisance but meh...). I had read that some of the reviewers mentioned the strong smell and in part that is why I didn&#x27;t buy them sooner but this time I thought, &amp;#34;how bad can it be?&amp;#34; Well, let me tell you, when I received the box I almost returned it right there and then, the smell was sooo strong. But I decided to keep them (not before selling two of the soaps to one of my coworkers :op) . Anyway, I started using the soap and was pleasantly surprised. Even though the fragrance coming from the soap is really strong, when you get out of the shower you end up with a very delicate fruity scent on your skin, not overwhelming at all. I was really glad about this and kept using the soap... now, a month later, I can without a doubt tell you that I have found my favorite soap. My skin has never looked better and it has helped me tremendously with some skin problems that I have. Now my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t get them way sooner.</li>
            <li> great product! This works so well. It cleans make-up very well. It makes your skin feel very soft after using.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this soap irritated my skin pretty badly. I don&#x27;t think I have particularly sensitive skin, but this stings on application, especially on the skin around my eyes, nose, and mouth, and leaves those areas chapped and red afterwards. Even after a single use. I tried it a few more times, but ultimately had to throw it out because it was hurting my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had worked for me! It would have been a great thrifty find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also just want to say that the advertising is misleading, which is a pet peeve of mine. This soap is not all-natural. It contains perfume, which (check out the Environmental Working Group and Skin Deep) is a catch-all term for all sorts of nasties. It is not just \\&quot;scented with Osun\\&quot; -- perfume is listed as an ingredient as well. It has a powerful perfume-y smell to it. All the other ingredients are good, though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product via Amazon after reading reviews. I have been using this soap for almost 2 months and I&#x27;m very, very pleased with it! I use it all over my body as well as on my face. Its great taking off make up... especially mascara!! After using on my face I always moisturize because its a little drying...but its always good to moisturize after cleansing your face!! I&#x27;ve notice some marks on my leg and on my back, due to me picking and scratching have lighten and have almost gone away!! I am very pleased and definitely purchasing this soap again. Love...love...love it !! : ))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even used it to wash my hair while on trip to key west cause didn&#x27;t have time to wait on housekeeping...made my hair sweaky clean and manageable as well. Smells good too !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Op&lt;br /&gt;from Miami, Fl.</li>
            <li> Fantastic soap - my skin felt tighter after first use!</li>
            <li> So... I&#x27;m Asian. I feel like maybe I&#x27;m the only confirmed Asian who has purchased this soap, at least judging by the reviews. To be honest, I bought this soap when I was on an intoxicated Amazing shopping binge (yes, I do that sometimes), simply because it is called &amp;#34;dudu&amp;#34; and it looks like turd in the pictures. When it arrived, I was treated to a secondary heaping of maturity-circa-fifth-grade levels of giggles before I set it aside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I ran out of my normal soap and had no choice but to pull out one of these bars and actually use it. To my surprise, it isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s a lot like those &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; soaps that you find in gift shops and such, usually sold by weird hippie-folk who also sell things like rocks, wooden crafts, and souvenir pens. The color is, frankly, incredibly off-putting, but it functions as soap should. Does it cure all the skin&#x27;s woes as the manufacturer&#x27;s description would have you believe? No, it&#x27;s no more effective than, say, Irish Spring. Though a lot of reviews from black individuals seem to be reporting different luck. I don&#x27;t buy it though, the same way I don&#x27;t buy it when Asians talk about how amazing Asian products are. Soap is, for the most part, soap, regardless of whatever favoritism we want to apply towards things we perceive as being &amp;#34;ours&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; by some ethnic merit.</li>
            <li> I love this product and its all natural ingredients! It really cleans the face. I can say that using it daily will dry out the faced so it is better as use every other day or a few times per week. It also noticed that it stains the bathtub BUT this is not to deter anyone away from purchasing this product. It is definitely a MUST BUY!</li>
            <li> This soap has helped my adult daughter lessen acne caused by a medication. I am 62 and have somewhat uily skin. It works well as a face soap for me as well. The bar does not dissolve away quickly.</li>
            <li> I love using this soap.  In my opinion this is one of the best soaps on the market. Looking forward to purchasing more.</li>
            <li> My daughters just turned 9 and 10 years old, and about a year ago they started to get these little pimple-looking bumps, one on her thighs and upper arms and the other on her upper arms only. I tried various soaps, clensers, lotions and such, even made my own homemade lotion with shea butter and s few different oils (which did improve the softness of their skin and help a little with the bumps) but could not get rid of the bumps completely. They have different skin types from each other, so I wanted to find something that would help both of them. I heard about africn black soap, but was concerned about the roughness of its natural form on my childrens delicate young skin, so I was happy to find this soap. My girls have been using this specific soap for about 6 months now, and in combination with the homemade lotion I make, I am happy to say the bumps are all gone! The soap is still a little rough, but they don&#x27;t use it directly on their skin, they lather it up in a washcloth. The natural oils and shea butter in the soap don&#x27;t dry thier skin out like I have read about raw african black soap. I would recommend this to anyone who has delicate skin, I would just suggest to only use it on the body, as my girls claimed it dired out their faces too much. Will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> The item has reached my all expectations I could not ask for more. It has done what I was exacting it to do an more.</li>
            <li> I got this soap on a wim, and feel in love with it&lt;br /&gt;I give 2 people at work a bar and now they are in love&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering this product again</li>
            <li> I like this smell.  after shower,feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and at first I was like what the heck was my husband thinking......but it does seem to work. It burns like a mother especially on my cheeks which are rosey and very sensitive. But on my t zone I feel like it has helped contain acne and certainly dry out pimples it does bring white heads to the surface and since it is antibacterial it really seems to help the pimples from getting worse. I haven&#x27;t found a great natural moisturizer but I&#x27;m still looking. Because this soap is drying and I already live in a dry enough climate, but I like it thus far. For me I am not even half way through my one bar and it&#x27;s been about two weeks and it lathers up nicely. I think that this seems to be a really great natural soap.</li>
            <li> I was dealing with acne for a long time and it got pretty bad after high school :/ nothing was working until I started using this soap! It&#x27;s been about month with this soap and I have Almost ZERO acne! I highly recommend you put Apple cider vinegar on your face with cotton ball after washing it!! This combo will I promise you remove your acne issues altogether! Wash your face twice a day! Anyways I hope this review helps someone cause it did for me! Also I take B3 and B complex daily!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to build a great skin care regimen and I know it starts with a quality cleanser. I&#x27;ve read excellent things about black soap and I&#x27;ve been using this one for a few months. My skin tone has evened out quite a bit but the soap is definitely stripping. I follow up with extra virgin coconut oil as my moisturizer and drink tons of water. My skin seems to be doing nicely.</li>
            <li> I like it so far, just started using it and my face has cleared and I haven&#x27;t had any new acne.  I have had cystic acne from hormonal changes.  Tried everything and no luck. Will update after a month and see if it controls it still.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses this soap and we all have different skin disorders that has  been helped by using this brand of black soap.  Psoriasis, eczema and minor irritations of our skin has tremendously improved over the last three months that my family have used this soap, but it is very important to use good quality natural lotion to keep your skin moisturized.  Black soap can make your skin dry during the winter months.  I use Shea butter lotion.</li>
            <li> As a honky, I tried out this Soap. It looks like a turd at first, or a chocolate bar so you might be put off rubbing your face into it. It&#x27;s a strange sensation. I can&#x27;t say if it helped me or not. It&#x27;s okay. I eat alot of sausage too.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to just try this soap. I didn&#x27;t like color or scent. It&#x27;s ok, but would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This soap was really harsh on my face. In the beginning, it was okay and I didn&#x27;t have problems, but after a while it began to strip my face and leave it extremely dry. Also, it BURNED my face before I&#x27;d exfoliate and severely after exfoliation. I stopped using it and switched back to a different brand of black soap that I had previously used and it renewed my skin to the way it was and left my face moisturized and soft and it also got rid of that intense burning sensation and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Yea. Just go to a good dermatologist. This soap is sort of useless. It smooths your skin to a small degree and makes your skin feel fresh, but it is horrid for what it&#x27;s bought for. Does not improve dark marks at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my daughter had acne and all the products I used did not help. Started using this product and in a few days the red angry looking skin returned to its smooth luster. She still has occassional break outs but nothing like she had prior to starting the use. She is 10 years old and is not always consistent with cleansing routine. Have bought this product multple times and will continue using for the skin. This is much cheaper that the other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I love the smell! I&#x27;m using this for shower, but cannot justified how it&#x27;s  good for acne or oily skin as I feel no difference except it&#x27;s smell great.</li>
            <li> Very nice soap..HAve a very strong smell, but it is not bad.. Can make your skin a little dry, but not a big deal,  i use daily moisturizers...</li>
            <li> Hi everyone&lt;br /&gt;I hate writing a review but I don&#x27;t want the star of this fool you&lt;br /&gt;My soap is almost finish and still I have acne all over my body well I have acne since 9 years old and now I&#x27;m 33!&lt;br /&gt;So you know that I tried everything in amazon and the market&lt;br /&gt;I wash my body with this soap yet nothing change but I got more acne..&lt;br /&gt;I wish I can find the right treatment as I&#x27;m really lost..</li>
            <li> Over the years I have developed a sensitivity to soaps that results in a contact dermatitis.  The inflammation, rash, and itch can be unbearable and unsightly.  This soap returns my skin to normal, I love it!  The only negative thing is the scent is a little strong, I wish they wouldn&#x27;t add any scents.  My husband is sensitive to perfumes and it does bother him.  Due to that I&#x27;m rating it as a four star, if they used no scent, I would rate it five stars.</li>
            <li> Not a HUGE fan. It&#x27;s soap, it smells ok, and it cleans my body. Feels like I have to rinse of quite a bit to get the \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; feel off, but I probably will try something else next time. Not bad, but not the best.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  It smells wonderful!  My face is so clean and smooth.  I&#x27;m getting all kinds of comments on how wonderful my skin looks, and that I don&#x27;t look close to my age - 52.  I enjoy that!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. It is a little harsh on your face.</li>
            <li> It dried my skin but didn&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> This soap is very deep cleaning.  My skin got dry after using it for awhile, and I don&#x27;t know who said it is moisturizing, because it definitely isn&#x27;t.  Also, the fragrance is a little ummm...odd.</li>
            <li> Its gentle on my skin, and love the smell.</li>
            <li> first off I give the soap 5 stars because it smells good, secondly I give the soap 5 stars because it does make me feel clean but having said that the soap does tend to cause me to caugh maybe it&#x27;s because of the ash ingredient that is included in the soap and it does irritate my throat. I have experienced a burning sensation on my face as well as my neck.  My face has also turned red because of the burning/stinging from the soap.  So I had to take a break from it for about two days.  Eventually the skin gets used to it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt so bad or turn so red after a while.  But I do like the smell of the soap still ;)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used the African black soap. I have read the review on Dudu-Osun products and ordered it to see how it woks. I have been using for almost 10 days and it is awesome. It leaves your skin fresh and not at all dry and it feels clean. It is gentle enough for the face as well but I would recommend just using it once when you are in shower because it is very potent and can dry off your skin. All it takes is just one use and you are clean. It has a nice mist to it as well. You definitely have to follow up with a moisturizer and lotion after but with the right products, this is all you need to keep your skin clean. I have recommended it to my family and friends and I will definitely will be ordering more. I am so glad I have finally found the right soap for me. A MUST BUY!!!</li>
            <li> From antibiotics, to face washes to cleansers and nothing has worked significantly well for an extended period of time. I&#x27;ve had acne for about 7-8 years now and out of frustration I went ahead and tried this, and to be honest it works.the bar has done good so far, it&#x27;s nothing special but it has helped clear my face up fairly well. I give it a 4 out of 5, because Since I&#x27;ve been using it my face has improved and I don&#x27;t break outs as bad as I once used to. Although changing my diet has probably also done wanders, I know this bar is contributing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It will dry up the face a tad and it may have a slight burning sensation at first. If your like me and you&#x27;re just fed up with acne and you too have tried everything, all I can say is go for it. At worst you have 4 bars of soap for the price of 10 dollars, at best your face will clear up a tad if not a good amount.</li>
            <li> I have been using DUDU OSUN products for a while now, and I love the black soap. I loke this one because the bulk black soap strips my skin and makes it dry. This is the complete opposite. My skin isn&#x27;t dry and it smells wonderful. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is the best bar soap I have ever used. It got rid of a rough dry patch on my skin that I had tried getting rid of for MONTHS. It truly is better than the rest and the smell is heavenly.</li>
            <li> not happy with this at all</li>
            <li> I like this soap, it has a fruity, citrusy scent and lathers up extremely well.  Rinses off clean and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  What more can you ask for from soap? 10/10</li>
            <li> I bought this soap based solely on the reviews. In the few weeks I have been using it, I can tell you that my skin looks and feels much healthier. Subtle discoloration has definitely faded. Keep in mind, this soap does dry your skin out, so follow use with a toner and a non-greasy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> GREAT BUY, JUST AS I EXPECTED!</li>
            <li> Visibly saw a big difference in 2 weeks with this soap It&#x27;s absolutely the best product for acne. Great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this soap. It always leaves m skin feeling stripped clin. Can be a little drying but I use either coconut oil or shea butter afterwards to replenish.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I can&#x27;t wait to order more. My skin feels so good and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> I used this soap a few years ago with wonderful results, but stopped because I thought it was too messy. Decided to order again because the other cleanser I used for my face was too harsh. Product came earlier than expected. Been using for 4 days and can see and feel the difference. Make sure you purchase a cheap soap dish to store the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My face looks radiant!! The sunspots and acne scars are fading and I&#x27;m currently acne free. I use this soap along with witch hazel as my toner and sunscreen as a moisturizer as my daily beauty regime. Much cheaper than clinique or murad and less harsher than the presciption stuff I had from the dermatologist. Just gave a bar to my ex boyfriend and he&#x27;s in love with it, lol.</li>
            <li> Black/brown all over the shower</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to know how good it is! But it does make my skin very very dry after coming out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Great for my son&#x27;s skin. He been having eczema for years and this really works in softening, his itchiness, and dry skin.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a year now and I have to say that I really really love it. It has visibly diminished the dark patches I had on my legs from scars. I like how clean I feel after I use it. I also use it on my face once every week or two. When I finished the first order I had to get some more.</li>
            <li> Its a great soap. I have used it in the past and felt really clean and fresh after using.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately as much as I love this, I am allergic to some ingredient contained therein!  Shucks!</li>
            <li> Solid product. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> «:::P:::» «:::E:::» «:::R:::» «:::F:::» «:::E:::» «:::C:::» «:::T:::»</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because i was looking for a natural product that would help with my acne, and was eager to try this due to the good reviews, and customers saying how it helped to clear their skin. I have been using this soap for 5 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed a diffence in my skin. I&#x27;m very dissapointed because i was hoping it would help clear up my skin at least a little, but nothing, it hasnt done any harm to my skin either. Its smells great and washes well like any other soap but i was really looking forward to it being beneficial to my skin.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter because of acne she has. Surprisingly it has helped her and she&#x27;s pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used up my first black soap. I used to rely on Neutrogena Body Clear to control my back and chest acne. It doesn&#x27;t work all the time and I want to find something that is more natural for long-term usage. I&#x27;m glad I found this black soap. It smells good and I haven&#x27;t had massive breakouts on my chest nor back. Minus 1 star b/c it melts very easily.</li>
            <li> this product made my skin bumpy, and discolored a bit, which threw me off because the ingredients have natural elements. Whenever i took a shower my face would burn when i used it.  I checked the ingredients because i didn&#x27;t want anything like that happening when i used it.  I&#x27;d never buy it again and i just want to get rid of what i have left of it ( 5 bars left)</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It smells great, it&#x27;s quick to lather, rinses easily, and leaves my skin feeling great. It&#x27;s even good on my (buzzed) hair. And I like that it has no high tech ingredients of questionable benefit.</li>
            <li> my wife has eczema , the product made it worse&lt;br /&gt;i start using it in stead. and it melt so fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bad purchase</li>
            <li> All of the ingredients seem safe to me... There&#x27;s just one exception - &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.  Federal law doesn’t require companies to list on product labels any of the chemicals in their fragrance mixture.  You can find this on EWG&#x27;s site.  So for all we know, carcinogens could be within their fragrance mixture.  To obtain 100% customer safety/satisfaction they should list what their fragrance mixture is composed of... After all, most of us buying this are wanting to feel safe!</li>
            <li> Excellent for skin conditions. It worked very well.</li>
            <li> Dudu Osun smell like perfume. But the best part about this soap not speaking for all skin types, but for my extra dry skin it really helps softens and lighten the Skin up. Thank God for it.</li>
            <li> I alternate this soap with coconut/papaya soap from Nubian heritage.  This has made such a difference in my skin.  I no longer need creams or oils for my skin.  I have battled dry skin all my life, especially in winter.  Now I realize it has been commercial soaps and shampoos all along! This is weird to use the first time because of the texture but now I refuse to use anything else!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend and I.  We both are in our mid 20&#x27;s and adult acne is not fun. I have oily skin , he has dry skin. But we both decided to give this a try since we heard great things. we received it and started using it that night . Both of us got the same experience and results even with completely different skin types.  Our face felt very clean and once it started to burn a little we washed it off, no big deal. Our faces did feel tight so we both used a moisturizer afterwards.  With him in about 3 days his skin was completely clear and has been since he started using it once a day at night. My face cleared up in about 5 days and I use it 2x a day. I ony get some around that time of the month but this dries it up fast.  I love this black soap. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. If you have oily or angry skin, this is for you. I only use it once a week unless I need help getting make-up off, otherwise I do the oil cleansing method. It&#x27;s not drying, but you feel clean. Keep it somewhere dry, not in the shower per say as it runs brown and it goes fast if water runs on it consistently.</li>
            <li> I loved this soap. I shared it with family and friends as well. It smelled great, did not dry my skin and was very happy with my end results.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle soap. It really cleans my skin and leaves a nice fresh smell. It also smooths my skin.  And I&#x27;ve noticed it is cleaning my face and making it look brighter!! I also use it on my whole body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great use it all the time now, I even give one to my son-in-law and he is now a lover of the african black soap really works great on our face.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are obsessed with this soap.  I even got friends and family hooked on it.  This has helped the complexion of my skin, and helped reduce acne.  I seriously can&#x27;t say how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this soap but it does&#x27;t last very long. Great value, product, smell, mositure, qanity and and beatuy care.</li>
            <li> The scent is super strong and it really irritated my skin and I don&#x27;t even have very sensitive skin. Maybe it&#x27;s the fragrance that irritated my skin. The fragrance reminded me of a bathroom cleaner :(</li>
            <li> Great African Black soap in a bar. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This soap has a lovely fresh springtime smell, and has done an excellent job of gently cleaning my face, without drying it out.  It helps keep my acne-prone skin under control.  I also believe it has  helped to keep my perioral dermatitis at bay.  I would highly recommend this purchase to anyone.</li>
            <li> The product was great and came very quickly!</li>
            <li> Black Soap is a gift from the f*cking creator. feels great on the skin. and It&#x27;s all naturaaale.</li>
            <li> Like some other soap I reviewed, this soap is useless. It makes a muddy mess in the shower with use, it didn&#x27;t improve my skin at all, it stained some of my white wash clothes (brownish stains), and I had to clean my shower twice as often while I used my supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money. Try Dove Unscented for sensitive skin or other skin ailments. Don&#x27;t take my word for it; ask a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I use now for a body soap. It leaves a clean feel to my skin that I have never experienced with a soap before. It eliminated skin breakouts and no soap has ever done that for me before. I have lots of soaps in my cupboard just collecting dust now. I feel a tingling but no burn. It can be a little drying so I don&#x27;t use it on my face. I use another cleanser for my face. However if I had acne  on my face such as I did when I was younger, I would certainly give this soap a try. It&#x27;s much less drying than all of the acne products out there! And I&#x27;ve never noticed a mess in my shower or bath. The water drains brown for a second but rinses off just fine.</li>
            <li> I decided that it was time to venture to the natural approach for my skin. I&#x27;m using black soap, lemon juice, and aloe vera as part of my skin regiment.  During my quest for the right \\&quot;products\\&quot; for my skin, I came across dudu-osun.  I did a lot of research not just on amazon but all over the world wide web and all feedback was pretty doggone good so I took a chance and BOY I&#x27;m glad that I did.  This by far has been the best soap that I have ever used for my face.  It&#x27;s not harsh and it removes everything....eh hem EVERY-THING.  It leaves my skin smooth and clean AND Lord have mercy it has started to fade my dark acne blemishes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviewers have stated that it&#x27;s harsh on their skin but I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all. I have learned over trial and error that scrubbing your skin with a wash cloth is NOT the way to go.  Simple smooth circular motions with your hands will do the trick. Remember no scrubbing!! Also, some have stated that it dries their skin but a good moisturizer will eliminate that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have told family and friends about this miracle soap so please if you&#x27;re tired of buying the same products and getting the same results - give this a try.</li>
            <li> Strong rich soap...I love it and have ordered it before..and it is even great in a closed closet..imparting sweet pure fragrance..it lathers wonderfully..It lathers black but washes off ...It is strong on the skin...when washing your face ..rinse immediately..very cleansing...</li>
            <li> Heard about this product from a friend. I went on Amazon and found the product. I ordered the product and have used the soap. It has a great smell and I can smell when I enter my bathroom. My skin feel so smooth and clean. I have told my friends and family about this soap. Try it you will not regret trying this product.</li>
            <li> I first used this and thought the smell was weird, it looked weird (brown bubbles?) but used it nonetheless. After the first shower I actually liked the after-smell. Soon I began liking the smell in general, it&#x27;s fresh, natural, not artificial/too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the important part: skin. It didn&#x27;t cure my back acne or chest acne, but it definitely didn&#x27;t hurt. As for my arms which have a &#x27;chicken skin&#x27; like feel, almost gone completely. It MUST BE USED WITH AN EXFOLIATING GLOVE. This product is rendered useless without some form of exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why I am really buying this again is what it does to my face. I didn&#x27;t try it on my face until the second bar. When I did I only get maybe two pimples per week (as opposed to 3-5 per day). This has truly done wonders on my face. Perfectly balanced for my skin. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, everything else makes me itch all over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing much a difference in my skin. I brought this, after reading about it on Youtube, with the hope that it would help fade some blemishes, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. Nevertheless, my face does feel clean, and I think it helps that I use this and an exfoliant. It&#x27;s not gentle on the skin, but I learned not to keep it on for too long.</li>
            <li> This soap is ok. It is sort of messy. It leaves the residue in the tub.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible breakout from this soap. I was itching so bad I was bleeding. I had to go to the doctor. he put me on a cortisone week of pills. Day one was twelve pills at one time. This was a awful experience. My last day of taking the pills was last Sunday, my last day of taking this &amp;#34;magical pill&amp;#34; that stop my itch. Now I am dealing with the side effect...acne all over my face from the cortisone pills. Use this soap at your own risk. Just letting others know my experience...</li>
            <li> Love the soap . Nice smell. My skin is not irritated by the soap.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this soap and was hoping that I got the same results as others were getting. I used it for about two months simply as the reviews said I put a little bit on my hands and rubbed it as I washed my face. Overtime, I saw no difference in my face. My blemishes stayed the same as well as my acne scars did not fade one bit, the one thing this soap did do was dry my face completely which was terrible considering I only used it when I showered before I went to bed. I guess the results varies by type of skin that you do have.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any benefits. I already used the 4 bars. I have sensitive skin in my body and acne prone super sensitive skin in my face. It didn&#x27;t help on my face, on the contrary i noticed more breakouts. In my body not much difference from other soaps. Just be careful as this soap sometimes has little granules that might help exfoliate, as I always use soap directly on my skin, it left some big scratches (still have scars). Kinda disappointed of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pretty nice though</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered these soaps! I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I have been usingit for a mouth now and didn&#x27;t notice any difference so far.</li>
            <li> BEST SMELLING NATURAL SOAP THAT IS REASONABLE IN PRICE</li>
            <li> great soap, starts clearing face within a week using.  skin feels really clean.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, but it makes my skin on the palms of my hands peel. Not a fan of that at all. But I believe it serves its purpose when it comes to cleansing and faded scars</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about this stuff, but it&#x27;s cool looking, smells good and does everything a regular bar of soap does, except leaves a trail of brown suds instead of white. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and last a very long time!</li>
            <li> Great product and wonderful</li>
            <li> I have only been using the soap for a relatively short time.  However, my initial results are that it seems to be what I have been looking for!  I love the silky feeling as I wash my face and so far it seems to be improving my adult acne.  There is no excessively dry, tight feeling after using, but just nice and clean!</li>
            <li> Great soap! Both my husband and I like it.  It really helped clear up my face up of occasional acne. Will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> smells great, feels great, and helps with my itchy eczema skin - be advised - anyone with eczema knows theres no cure - our best defense is prevention.  This is the soap you want to help prevent the outbreak.  all natuiral and keeps that moisture barrier up.</li>
            <li> This soap has cleared up my skin a little.  Lathers well and smells good. It does tend to dry out the skin a bit but only for the first week or so.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I had a severe case of acne this product has greatly helped clear my skin! So hooked on it now!</li>
            <li> The soap was delivered sooner than expected.  So far my skin loved it and it has a really nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I just started using these about a month ago. I haven&#x27;t seen all of the benefits that everyone claims yet, but i love the smell and the natural ingredient list.</li>
            <li> I cant wait for the day to end so that I can start using the product:) Hopefully it doesnt irritate my supersensitive acne/rash-prone skin further *crossingfingers*.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly an original kind of soap, unlike the brands over here. This soap lathers up really nice and smells very good. And knowing that it&#x27;s all natural is a plus. I will end up buying more when I run out. I also bought some for my family and there opinion of it was the same. Great bath soap!</li>
            <li> The Dudu-osun soap smells great and lathers up nicefully. It did dry out my skin a little so I was unable to use it every day on my face. I have oily, sensitive skin and this helped to combat the oiliness, but it did it a little too good. I bought some Moroccan oil to help soothe the dryness, especially on my cheeks. The soap is very nice, but not a miracle cure for eczema, which I have. It does what soap was designed to do, cleanse the skin without a lot of perfumes or additives.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. Do not use around your eyes and beware of the sting if you leave it on for a few minutes. But, it does what it says it will do. My skin is clear of dark spots.</li>
            <li> Great soap. I love what its doing to my skin although it can make your skin very dry yet tight. I use extra virgin coconut oil as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The Dudu-Osun African Black soap has worked great for keeping my acne at bay.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands of black soap but this one is the purest.  It is pretty pure so i don&#x27;t recommend using it in sensitive areas.  I only use it on my face.</li>
            <li> With the amount of amazing reviews my expectations were a bit high.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to make me break out so that&#x27;s good but haven&#x27;t noticed anything that great as far as fading acne scars and improving overall complexion.</li>
            <li> Good soap, but nothing special compared to other</li>
            <li> I have severe psoriosis and this soap has helped a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Its scent is a little strange but feels nice.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. This soap is the best when it comes to moisturizing your skin. I can really see a difference in the tone and texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about this soap is it stains your washcloths..Other than that it&#x27;s a pretty good soap. The smell isn&#x27;t bad and you feel extra clean after washing with it...I don&#x27;t use this soap on sensitive areas as my face.. But it&#x27;s a great soap! I would defiantly recommend this soap to others.</li>
            <li> This soap is marketed as all natural. But it is bears a strong pungent fragrance that obviously is an unnatural, unnecessary ingredient. The whole bathroom smells, when you open it; and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t dissipate for days. I hate soap that contains nonessential ingredients, whether it be fragrance, chemicals, or whatever it is.  I have bought competing brands, and I know that natural African Black Soap should have a faint earthy smell and nothing more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my soap for several days and I can already tell a difference in my face.  My wrinkles seem to be doing better, my pores seem to be closing up nicely.  I have oily skin and bigger pores.  It is hard to get rid of big pores, but this seems to be doing a great job.  I have also started using in the shower and all over my body.  I just break off or cut w/ a knife small portions of the bar and keep at the sink and also in the shower, so I don&#x27;t waste the soap.  I am trying to get my dad and my daughter to use it, but they are scared of the color.  It smells nice, it leaves you squeaky clean!  I do have long hair and I&#x27;ve used it once around my hairline, to see if it would help w/ the oily-ness it gets in the late day from putting my fingers thru it all day.  It did make it feel a little dry, I read a review that you would have to use conditioner, but in the hairline area where it tends to get oily, that isn&#x27;t a place to put conditioner, if you are already oily.  So I&#x27;m not sure if I will use it again on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy w/ this soap.  I like that I get 4 soaps at once and I like the price!</li>
            <li> This is the soap I use daily.&lt;br /&gt;Love- love - love - love it.&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say?&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product!! I got my daughter using it too.</li>
            <li> This soap is very harsh, so please DO NOT rinse it off your face with hot water and only use ONCE a day. I love it as a body soap especially moisturizing with coco butter after, sticking to the Ghanaian version for my face though.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap. I can really see a difference in my skin after using this soap. The damage from using bleaching products have been corrected by using this soap. I will continue use this soap and recommend it to others as it really does work.</li>
            <li> I love this soap !!! U feel so clean and fresh after using! But remember !! It&#x27;s acidic so don&#x27;t let it sit on ur skin for too long !!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap. I have never been one to wash my face with soap.  This soap keeps my oils balanced and keeps my face clear.</li>
            <li> i have been using this soap for about a month and I really like it. My face feels really clean and slightly tingly when I wash with it. My complexion seems to be clearing up.</li>
            <li> I have been having problems with itchy-ness. I was looking around for soap and I can&#x27;t honestly say why I settled on this but I do like it. The smell is very nice and relaxing. My skin is very sensitive and I have not had any problems using this soap. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, just because I don&#x27;t see any big difference but it is a really nice soap, suds are creamy and rich, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. It lasts a really long time, I am still on my first bar. I noticed some people mentioned skin color in their reviews, I&#x27;m not sure why that matters but I am white. My skin tends to be dry and I apply lotions and sunscreens every day. I haven&#x27;t noticed a change for the better or worse since using this skin. If I do buy it again it will be because it is a natural soap and has such a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50-year-old biracial woman who has been experiencing changes in my skin (dryness, spots, looseness) which initiated my investigation in skin care products.  I wanted simple, natural, effective and affordable otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t stick with it.  Now, I&#x27;ve only had the soap a few days but I&#x27;ve used it on my face daily - only once a day for now.  I found it slightly drying (but good reason to start using moisturizer which had not been my practice) and just a little burn around my sensitive skin (eyes) but only for the duration the soap was on my face.  I also lather thickly so I&#x27;m sure if it was too much of a discomfort, I could use less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me - just seeing what I wanted to see.  Once my face recovered from the first wash - about 15 minutes - I liked how my skin looked.  I thought I was going crazy so I made sure to really inspect my skin so I can compare the next time.  When I did, it was confirmed.  Yes, my skin is evening out and my pores are becoming smaller which makes my skin look so much more smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to try as an all body soap and use as a shampoo and will report back on that once I have something to share.  But, with just a few days of use, I have reordered 8 more bars on top of the 4 I just received since I intend to use it exclusively if it in fact works as well all over.</li>
            <li> I like this soap! Fresh citrusy clean smell. I had a really dark freckle on my leg and after using the soap for awhile, the freckle literally just scraped off as if it was a scab. Natural products do wonders!</li>
            <li> I like this soap a lot. African black soap is great. I was using a different kind but it had scrubby stuff in it and I didn&#x27;t like how scratchy it was. This one is nice and smooth and smells nice. It&#x27;s great for the complexion -- I use it head-to-toe to simplify my life and shower.</li>
            <li> This soap broke me out and I had to throw it away</li>
            <li> Awesome soap. I can&#x27;t live without it. My three year old daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li> Ended up buying a 12 pack after using these four up, it helps my complexion and acne as well as being nice smelling.</li>
            <li> I am a senior guy who skin is starting to thin.  While this stuff cleans you body it also strips it of oils.  The Margo soap is superior because of the Neem oil. Dudu-Osum is for ages between puberty to about 30.  It last a long while and if you do purchase some get it with the Shea Butter in it because it will strip oil then the Shea Butter will help seal it. I ordered the bulk order of Dudu and it will probably last 2 years since a bar last about 30-40 days.  The Margo is a far superior product because of the Neem oil is a natural anti- bacterial/viral since these organisms have a difficult time with find it difficult to breath though their exoskeletons if you apple same over a period of time. It also has many other uses such as wards off bugs (hopefully not your mate), is very good for Psoriasis and other skin diseases.  You should be aware just about everyone has 180 bacteria on their skin and at least two of these can kill you.  I once did a study of same at Johns Hopkins.  My recommendations would be try 1 bar of Dudu-Osum if you have oily skin, but beware it will dry you out with little protection. I use it once a week at most.  One other thing the use of Neem oil over a period of time seems to reduce \\&quot;liver spots\\&quot; has nothing to do with the liver, but the overall aging process.  Use it daily.</li>
            <li> Great soap for problem skin. Just stick with it and you will see results.</li>
            <li> This a very good soap, it smells good, and it moisturises the skin so well, it also clears up acne and takes away blemishes. I have used this soap many times before in the past, my whole family loves this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble with my skin the past year, possibly from stress, but who knows. I&#x27;ve had the worst acne I&#x27;ve ever had all over my chin that seemed like it would never go away, it left behind pink marks from almost every breakout I&#x27;ve had and I was really starting to hate the way my skin looked. I tried everything from over the counter products to proactiv and nothing seemed to work until I bought this soap. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week an a half, maybe 2 weeks and I can already see an improvement in my skin. Every single day I have less and less acne and I&#x27;m starting to see the pink/red marks fade. I use it morning and night, but I would make sure you use a moisturizer because it tends to dry my skin out a bit, though it seems to be adjusting the more I use the soap. I was so skeptical about this soap since I was starting to feel like nothing would work for me, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has trouble with their skin.</li>
            <li> A decent soap, but not magical or anything.</li>
            <li> i like this soap, it doesn&#x27;t HELP my psoriasis, but i know it&#x27;s better than other soaps out there&lt;br /&gt;i will buy again, and i would recommend.</li>
            <li> I guess ya gotta love soap to take the time to critique it; but this soap is unusual and lives up to the positive reviews. Curious that the bars each have an expiration date but then that makes sense- it&#x27;s all natural fruit based ingredients. The smell is neutral to nice, the bar size is fairly large, and it leaves you feeling squeaky clean but not dry or drawn tight.</li>
            <li> I have to give this product a five star, I&#x27;ve been suffering with acne on my back and chest for as long as I could remember, and by using this soap for like three weeks I&#x27;m acne free..I would never go back to using any other soap.thanks dudu osun. .</li>
            <li> This is a very good soap. As i grow older I realized I cannot use any type of soap anymore without getting dry itchy and irritated skin. Since I have been using this soap I haven&#x27;t had the same problem. I only use Dudu Osun soap now for bathing, nothing else.</li>
            <li> This soap appears to be working so far on my skin. It leaves my face feeling clean and I have not experienced any irritation as some others have mentioned or skin dryness. I will continue to use it because my skin has had no outbreaks since I&#x27;ve started using it!</li>
            <li> love this soap.  heard about it on Dr. Oz&#x27;s show several years ago and have used it every since on my face.</li>
            <li> This is great soap. It smells good and has kept my acne at bay since I started using it. I will continue buying it.</li>
            <li> I have skin problems and have used a bunch of different products and this is one of the better ones. I get face and body acne and most of the product I have tried irritate my skin This does not and keeps the acne at bay. I will say not to use a scrubber with this soap as it is fairly strong and could cause irritation. I use every day for my face and every other for my body and it got rid of my acne. I went on a trip for a week and forgot to bring this and three days later I had acne all over again but as soon as I got back I started using it again and it went away so make sure to use it often.</li>
            <li> It leaves brown soap scum wherever I set it.  Cleans off easily, but doesn&#x27;t look the best.  It smells ok, but nothing great.  I was really hoping for something more impressive based on the other reviews.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this soap again.</li>
            <li> Starting to use the soap, feel great just need more time to juge the effects.... The shipping was super fast... Im satisfy</li>
            <li> My acne has cleared! Even on my period my face remained acne-free. I&#x27;ve thrown out all of my neutrogena acne wash because they are no longer needed. I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in stretch marks but I&#x27;ve only been using the soap for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I like soap.  It makes me clean.  I like clean.  People around me seem to like me being clean.  The fact that this stuff is accidentally named &amp;#34;Dudu something&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t take away from it&#x27;s charm.  It&#x27;s like the creators are so sure of their product, they took the name challenge and added a prefix usually used to describe feces by my 4-year-old nephew.  That&#x27;s confidence in clean.  If you are the maker of this soap and you want to use that last sentence as a new business motto... please give me a job and pay me well.  Very well.  Here&#x27;s another freebie:  &amp;#34;Get clean.  Get... clean as Dudu.&amp;#34;  My dog accidentally got ahold of one of these and started running around the yard trying to eat it.  Joke was on him.  It wasn&#x27;t what he thought.  Now my dog&#x27;s breath smells like plantains and will never be in danger of getting rare dog mouth acne.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using African Black Soap, and I can tell won&#x27;t be my last. You feel so clean and your skin feels so smooth after using it, that I will definitely make this my day to day soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little strong for my taste, but this is only when using it in the shower. When you dry yourself, the smell fades out and you end up smelling really clean and fresh. My body is greatful for this buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 10 days now and my skin is so soft, even my husband noticed it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been having so much problems with dry and itchy skin, I tried so many different product and if it wasn&#x27;t the product that gave me a rash, I didn&#x27;t like the smell. But this soap smells very fresh and clean and makes my skin nice and silky,&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even have to put on lotion after my shower, awesome</li>
            <li> I love this product. I feel clean all over and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my skin. I have recommended this product to everybody. If you have any samples of other product please send me a few. Thank you .</li>
            <li> I bought this because the price was a great deal.. It&#x27;s safe to say that although it&#x27;s inexpensive, they don&#x27;t skimp on the quality. I&#x27;ve loved this soap. I use it daily and notice changes in my skin</li>
            <li> Careful it burns your eyes. Works pretty good .my daughter is allergic to everything but can use this!</li>
            <li> Smells great, lathers well, all natural, but the downside of all natural is it doesn&#x27;t kill the bacteria. My balls stunk big time after using this soap down there. You need to use a regular antibacterial soap for your genitals.</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent &amp; healty for the skin.  It will melt however if left in a pool of water.  It&#x27;s my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great quality.</li>
            <li> This soap does NOT contain the ingredients in the Black Soap that Dr Oz has recommended.  That soap, I believe, was to contain plaintain.  This soap does not.  This soap is high in perfume scent, which I didn&#x27;t like.  It also dried out my skin.  I think there&#x27;s probably a more authentic &amp;#34;Black Soap&amp;#34; on Amazon for purchase.  I&#x27;m going to try.</li>
            <li> I got this soap from my beauty supply store I used to have flawless skin til I started using this b.s this soap caused me to get acne on my face my chest and back and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin I use regular soaps and never had this problem the only thing nice I have to say about this soap is that it smells good oh and btw this soap made me have dark spots everywhere I used this soap I got it cause of the good reviews now I know better smh</li>
            <li> I like it except there is not much of a smell. Works pretty well. I like nubian better though.</li>
            <li> Smells good, makes my skin soft, but not like the typical soap that you buy in stores.  I love that it is a natural soap.</li>
            <li> This soap has a great scent to it and also it leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturize. This particular soap has help me with hyperpigmentation and discoloration that a lot of people have experienced. My skin tone has started even out all over and I will continue to purchase this soap. Thanks so much for having other comments on products because it helped me to purchase this product and give it a try. I will have another comment in 30 days after I purchase this soap again and let you guys know how much more my skin has improved.</li>
            <li> Great soap. My granddaughter and I love it. We do have oily skin, which we love. Less wrinkles. Always moisturize even if you do have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Love it. I&#x27;m planning to reorder</li>
            <li> I really like how gentle it is on my skin, and how clean my face feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> OK I posted a old review about this in the first week of me using it but after a month it started to burn every time I used also it started to break me out,leave black spots on my face idk if it&#x27;s because my skin is sensitive but I want be purchasing it again.  Goodluck!</li>
            <li> The best soap money can buy.  The black soap has a very pleasant scent and once you use it your skin invigorates with a nice glow.  I have sensitive skin that is prone to eczema and I swear by this product because it does not irritate my skin like other store bought soaps.</li>
            <li> This soap has the perfect ingredients that you need for your skin!  It&#x27;s so creamy and I have definitely noticed a change in my skin.  I plan to continue using it!</li>
            <li> A lil pricey but I Love the soap</li>
            <li> good price, fast shipping, however, the item itself is a little overrated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing black soap for almost two years now it is the only thing I wash my body with even my hands but this was my first time using Dudu-Osun. Ok so first the packaging was to my liking the boxes we stacked evenly inside a plastic vacuum sealed bag. I have read reviews about the scent on amazon, make up alley, ect but its of course TOTALLY different when you open your box and smell the soap through the packaging.... It&#x27;s that strong. Which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. The smell isn&#x27;t awful it&#x27;s different but not in a bad way, over time I got used to it and actually like it  my roommate loves it. BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU STASH YOUR UNUSED BOXES I put the rest of my boxes in my dresser with all my clothes ( college student) and now my clothes have the scent. I personally don&#x27;t mind but if your not unto that, don&#x27;t do it. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger after washing up so that&#x27;s a plus. Washing was great its really soapy and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like I was expecting its only been a few days so let&#x27;s see but u reckon I&#x27;ll be ok since black soap is all I use but who knows because this one has lemon. When washing your face rinse with cold so your face won&#x27;t sting or burn and don&#x27;t wash with super hot water settle for warm you&#x27;ll thank me later. Overall I&#x27;m feeling this soap</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about 4 years now. The very first time anyone tries it, there will always be a burning sensation. Your skin has to get used to it for a couple of days. But the major problem is the fact that many people are using a cloth towel/ shower puff to apply the product. Never do that. I also made that mistake during the first couple of months of my use. I gave up on it because it seemed to make my acne worse. However after watching a youtube video about this soap, I learned that not using a cloth to apply the soap on you skin is key for the soap to work. Try using your hands instead (like I do). It really makes such a difference!</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, I couldn&#x27;t use the product. Not because of the quality, but because it was so fragranced I couldn&#x27;t stand it. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, definitely flowery but also definitely not natural. By the way, I do not have a sensitive nose, it is truly just that strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have good skin and like fragrance in your soap (that you want to last), then this product is for you. If you&#x27;re like me and have skin issues and are looking for a \\&quot;black soap\\&quot; since it&#x27;s supposed to be good for acne-prone/sensitive skin, then it&#x27;s not (as simple as that). If you ARE like me and looking for the latter, I recommend trying SheaMoisture&#x27;s Black Soap instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you get this, understand that it will leave a filmy, nasty looking residue in your shower. The soap is truly brown and runs that color.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I&#x27;m a 66 yr old male who doesn&#x27;t usually get excited over soap, but this is now my favorite. First, it smells, to me, just slightly like Vicks cherry cough drops. Quite pleasant. Second, it lathers like crazy. The more you rub the more it lathers. One pass over the bar with your hand will give you plenty of lather to wash your hands. And last, for an experiment, For the last 3 days I&#x27;ve showered, shaved, and washed my hair with this stuff, and I swear, my hair looks and feels like it does when I use my usual shampoo/conditioner combo which  starts with a P.  Heading over to buy more.</li>
            <li> This soap is lasting me about 90 days so far.</li>
            <li> This is great soap, I always thought that I was just destined to have dry chapped skin, but all of that is gone with Dudu_Osun African Black Soap!</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, im 32 and still get pimples from having oily skin this soap really stops break outs. I use it like every other day because it really drys out the skin for me good because skin is so oily but if you have dry skin id steer clear i gave a bar to my girl friend and she has dry skin bad idea. but if you have oily skin like me and break out easy get this soap and it will stop pimples before the fully form</li>
            <li> I first bought this soap from an African festival in chicago this past summer. I love it! It has a nice, light smell. It cleans well, and it keeps my acne away.</li>
            <li> Not sure I noticed any difference. Would not buy again. On to the next product.</li>
            <li> Dude, Dudu definitely did do its dutiful duty, decisively dissuading dirt, damning it down da drain. Do da Dudu, dude!</li>
            <li> I will never use another bar soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It&#x27;s great. And for anyone wondering whether or not it&#x27;s &amp;#34;real black soap&amp;#34;, it is. The ingredients are all natural and even the address on the soap box is from Lagos, Nigeria. To my knowledge, the only thing not natural is the fragrance. They sell this on an African website called africaimports.com. I really like black soap. My only complaint about this specific brand is the smell. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was unscented or had the natural smell of black soap like another bar I had that I got at a local swapmeet.&lt;br /&gt;A question I have though, is if black soap is okay to use for a woman&#x27;s V? Sorry if that question is TMI but for people with sensitive skin and areas I think it&#x27;s important to know. I&#x27;ve only ever used it topically. Could anyone reply with their experience please?</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;And I loved it! Especially, the scent of it.&lt;br /&gt;Very natural and fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;I will repeat!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this soap for a few weeks and there had been no improvement in her skin condition.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome. Very excellent at getting greasy sweaty grime off. I bought it on a whim and now I want more. Good soap!!</li>
            <li> I am now addicted to black soap. I have tried other bands but this stuff is my favorite. I actually love the tropical scent. And my skin has never looked better. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend washing privates and avoid the eyes. Also a soap tray is necessary it will stain your tub. I will be buying this again after I run out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely looove this soap it has gotten rid of my back acne, and i was starting to get pimples on my thighs (idk why ) but this had completely erased it. It does dry your skin out so i recommend using its every other day or every three days.</li>
            <li> I love this s***. So good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Black soap is the best for every skin type, help with acne and softens skins, it does an amazing job. I bought from 2 different sources and the shipping charge on one of them was a high as the product, so My mistake for not looking..</li>
            <li> The American English-speaking consumer may snerk at the fact that the soap is pronounced &amp;#34;doo-doo&amp;#34; and is dark brown in color. Go ahead and giggle, people: this is my new favorite soap, and has a lovely fragrance, rather the opposite of the slang term it unfortunately brings to mind. I suffer from skin dry enough that I sometimes fear it will flake off in giant sheets like something out of a horrible movie starring Brendan Fraser. Dudu-Osun moisturizes and cleans without stripping off normal amounts of skin oil, and without overmoisturizing. I&#x27;m thrilled I discovered this.</li>
            <li> The soap only made my acne worse and turned my face super red. I stopped after two weeks. I was hoping it would work for me but sadly it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> this soap is wonderful.  Lathers well, great smell. Huge bars of soap that last for quite a while.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> All natural soap that cleans and leaves you completely refreshed. This soap is pure and you just feel your skin breathing after using it. It won&#x27;t stand up to staying wet so keep the bar in a dry place.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old Caucasian woman who has had acne almost my whole life. Not terrible acne, but enough to be embarrassed about when it happens. I have tried mail order face systems, all natural face systems, over the counter, and regular drug store brand stuff. I have to say that the mail order stuff worked, but was expensive and bleached many items on contact including towels and pillow cases. This Dudu-Osun soap is the cheapest AND the best stuff I have ever tried. I have been using it now for over six months, daily. Within a few weeks I was confident enough to go out in public without ANY makeup!!!!! In a few more weeks I was completely free of acne and have been ever since. This INCLUDES monthly cycle time, high stress level time, and even the summer when I tend to breakout from sunscreen. Dudu-Osun is something I will continue to buy without a doubt. At less than $3.oo a bar, it is a HUGE savings to me. I JUST started my 4th bar and it has been seven months. I noticed that some other reviewers said that it made their skin drier. I think this was a benefit to me. Since using this soap, I have never had dry skin or even dry patches, but I typically use a daily moisturizer. I could see how it might be different in the winter if I hadn&#x27;t used a moisturizer, but I still don&#x27;t think it would have been terribly dry, just something I wanted to mention. I HIGHLY recommend this soap for teens (my son uses it) and adults who have mild to medium acne issues.</li>
