            <li>Perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Not so sure what to use it for besides lipgloss or change, but the material is of good quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more the size of a coin purse</li>
            <li>easy to clean.</li>
            <li>nice for a young girls pocket book.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that the Seller didn&#x27;t rip me off for more than $8 because this actually costs $7 plus tax.</li>
            <li>Lucky to hold a tube of lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $15 though.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for women who carry small items such a lipsticks, lip gloss, eyeliner, and etc.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty content.</li>
            <li>Be smart shoppers ;)</li>
            <li>You can probably fit your eyeliner and lipstick only!</li>
            <li>This tiny bag was not work the money and the material is very,very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>The bag it is labeled as a cosmetic bag, they really should fined a new name for it.</li>
            <li>If you want a cute LITTLE bag, perhaps for a lipgloss or two, then this is it.</li>

            <li> This cosmetic bag is a &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; joke.  Lucky to hold a tube of lipstick.  I guess I did not pay attention to size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than it appears. It fits my mascara, lip stick, and lip gloss in it so I&#x27;m pretty content. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $15 though.</li>
            <li> This tiny bag was not work the money and the material is very,very cheap plastic. Not even worth the effort to send it back.</li>
            <li> nice for a young girls pocket book.  easy to clean.</li>
            <li> As a VS employee I will let you all know that this went on sale for $2.99 . With the money you&#x27;d pay for this you can buy 8!! Be smart shoppers ;)</li>
            <li> I got this bag for my wife. she said it very classy, fits a lot of her cosmetic products. total recommend for the other ladies!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be that small but it still worked for me i use as a pencil case.</li>
            <li> Item was received promptly. Perfect condition. Although item can not be used as a cosmetic bag unless you are just carrying lipstick. It&#x27;s more the size of a coin purse</li>
            <li> I was expecting it t be bigger, it was quite small I was very surprised when I received it in the mail. The bag it is labeled as a cosmetic bag, they really should fined a new name for it. I hate looking at how much I paid for it and keep kicking myself for keeping it :( .... Basically it barley fits in the palm of my hand, I use it for a change purse, credit cards and cash ect... well I think you get the idea. If you are excepting a cosmetic bag, sorry to bust your bubble...</li>
            <li> If you want a cute LITTLE bag, perhaps for a lipgloss or two, then this is it. Not so sure what to use it for besides lipgloss or change, but the material is of good quality.</li>
            <li> Found it very small for any make-up to put in. I use it as a coin pouch.</li>
            <li> the size is too small, I do not understand why they say it&#x27;s portacosmetico when in fact be nothing</li>
