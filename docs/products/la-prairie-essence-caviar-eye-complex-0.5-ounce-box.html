            <li> Excellent product. Does not irritate the eyes. I have been using it on a daily basis for the past year or so, and will definitely continue doing it.</li>
            <li> Great results. Under eye lines are deminished and eyes look refreshed.</li>
            <li> Not sure I see any difference yet after two weeks of daily use</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on, my eye puff disappeared in a few minutes! It is the best eye essence I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This product does such a good job around my 70 yr old eyes.  I highly recommend this product.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I regret paying the money for this product.  It has caused &amp;#34;blister like&amp;#34; bumps around my eyes, and certainly did not product the results I was expecting from this brand.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day. My eyelids are sensitive to some shadows.  I apply la Prairie Essence Eye Complex first. It&#x27;s one of the few products of this kind you can put on your eyelids. Then I apply shadow, which goes on great. I also apply below my eyes before applying concealer. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying so many different eye serums before none of them can compare La Prairie Essence Caviar Eye Complex. I use just a small drop every time and I can feel my skin gets immediate relief. After one week of using it I can see noticeable reducing of fine lines around my eyes. I love this product I think I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go without this product!  It has done wonders for my eyes.  I also use this with the La Prairie Caviar Eye Lift Cream, and it has virtually eliminated fine lines, dark circles and puffiness.  This is the best product!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.and it looks cute~I hope it will good effect for my skin.I will come back ,It&#x27;s a nice buying drip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in 44s and have no problems with my eye areas, no puffiness,  dark circles, wrinkles,  but using as prevention for past year and like it since no wrinkles so far, may be just naturally they will appear a bit later. Very light transparent clear texture, smell free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and really love it.  However, I have been buying from a department store and paying $145.00 plus tax and shipping.  This was much cheaper, same product and same results.  Best thing about this product is that you can use it on eye lid and it does not smear your eye shadow.  No primer necessary for shadow.  Saves a product and a step.</li>
            <li> Finished the entire jar thinking I just need more time, same puffiness under eyes without any changes.  Unsure about wrinkles since bought this after such great reviews about puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> The best eye complex if all.</li>
            <li> There is nothing on the market that can even come close to the quality and reliability of this product.  I have been using it for the past 25 years and my results continue to be extraordinary.  The skin around my eyes  remain wrinkle free and show no signs of aging.  No matter what your age, this product will decrease the visibility of lines, soften the skin and protect the eye area from any&lt;br /&gt;and all current and future aging.</li>
            <li> Great product , more like a lifting serums, works great with the eye cream on top</li>
            <li> This truly is the fountain of youth for eyes.  No other product ones close for eyelids and under eye wrinkles. Incredible!!!!</li>
            <li> my eye area is very sensitive ,,didn&#x27;t have any allergy,nice moisturizer,but didn&#x27;t see any difference,wont bye any  more,too expensive.</li>
            <li> La Prairie Caviar Eye Complex is the very best eye product I have every used.  Only need one drop of the gel and it will work wonders.</li>
            <li> Great product. True to the presentation of the products. The product works. Highly recomend it. Worth the money. The price is lower than the major department stores.</li>
            <li> I have tryed so many things for my eyes &amp; then I discovered this amazing product. I tryed on one eye only &amp; could tell instantly it helped my puffiness &amp; dark circles. Now I&#x27;m totally sold this is definately made for people with my bad eye problems. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> this serum is rather lightweight compared to others I&#x27;ve used.  I would like to see information about whether it&#x27;s hypoallergenic or not.  I&#x27;m also using it on my chin to get the same lift it does for my eyes.  So far, so good after 2 weeks.  This is my first La Prairie product, and I am reasonably pleased.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and I think it is the best one for my eyes, I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using this essence and found it has visible changes compare with other branded eye serum and eye essence that I tried before. This is a lot more cheaper than the one I&#x27;ve got last time which is SGD170 in the airport, now I got it for around SGD115 which I got at least 30% discount. I ordered this along with some other purchases from Amazon and paid at the same day, never expect to receive this much earlier than my another order. It arrived 1 day earlier than the expected delivery date, keep up the good work and I will recommend friends to buy from you.</li>
            <li> Good, arrived on time.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product, i am happy with it. it is the most effective eye cream i used for fine lines</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 25 years maybe more.  I do not have wrinkles around my eyes.  I&#x27;m 66 years old and I truly believe this is due to the use of this produce every day for the past 25 to 30 years.</li>
            <li> Seems so-so for my age(24). Wrinkles are still there.</li>
            <li> Like that Amazon has it for much less than in stores. Product works well. Light, hydrating, and affective. Worth it!</li>
            <li> I have used this eye complex for years and fine it goes on very easy and helps with the lines.</li>
            <li> This product does reduce the puffy eye, but does little for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Another wonderful product from this company.  Sometimes it does pay to buy something expensive.  I have tried other brands and thrown out all of them.  This is the only brand I use, for eyes, for face washes.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. It does not replace the eye cream but is a great addition to my skin care routine. I will buy again. My eyes look brighter and rested with fewer fine lines.</li>
