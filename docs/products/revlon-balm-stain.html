            <li>Love these balm stains, and have gotten tons of compliments on the color.</li>
            <li>I like this better than lipstick.</li>
            <li>I saw this in a store, never heard of it before, and I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that it is here at Amazon now, since sometimes you can&#x27;t find it in stores.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered two of them, and will order more when they come on sale</li>
            <li>They truly do stay moist as a balm does, and, the stain lasts longer than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried (and that includes more pricey brands).</li>
            <li>The colors are all very nice and the product stains my lips along with a nice glaze of matte gloss to keep them soft.  </li>

            <li>A wise choice indeed considering the price of much of the competition in the long-wearing lipstain field.</li>
            <li>too hot or &#x27;melts&#x27; - perfect - have bought several colors and love them all</li>
            <li>However, once you see the color it leaves you quickly get over it!</li>
            <li>Beware that there is a light peppermint scent, not overpowering, but it is there.</li>
            <li>I got Crush, which looks perfect and natural on me, and bought one of that is a brighter pink, and still nice.  </li>
            <li>I have so many colors, but Crush is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used Revlon&#x27;s Balm Stain, and I love it.</li>
            <li>What I think makes this product so unique though is the ease of reapplication.</li>
            <li>Great product with just some minor imperfections.</li>
            <li>the color is very nice its not too drying and it lasts a long time( about 6 hours or so)</li>
            <li>My new favorite color to wear this season.  </li>
            <li>It also has a fresh, minty flavor.</li>
            <li>lovely deep purple colour.</li>
            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>I love that the stain and balm are mixed together....</li>
            <li>If you buy one, I can pretty much guarantee that you too will be hooked, and will buy several more colors.</li>
            <li>Got the Crush and Romantic, love it so much that I have order the Adore and Sweetheart.</li>
            <li>Fast in shipping.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a different color from expected it&#x27;s still one of my favorites, and this product is definitely good.</li>
            <li>The Lipstain is just light, long lasting and absolutely easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, build-able, and doesn&#x27;t dry out lips at all.</li>
            <li>This is the best!&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I still like this product; I&#x27;ve bought a few more and the cap ALWAYS splits and breaks...</li>
            <li>I love reds and dark pinkish red.</li>
            <li>I really like it, but if you want red, that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>I love it--my only complaint is the current color selection.</li>
            <li>It outlines your lips easily and lasts a long time without getting dry like other stains I have tried.</li>

            <li> but it is long lasting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and very long lasting!</li>
            <li> It does come off sooner than expected especially with snacking and drinking water here and there.  </li>
            <li> The color really does stay without a lot of the thick, cakey feeling of lipstick or the sticky feeling of lip gloss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, but you can look a little silly putting this big crayon to your face.</li>
            <li> With that said, the stain does dry a bit and can where off when eating and drinking.</li>
            <li> Similar products priced $24.+ leave my lips dry, tight, and looking like peeling paint before you can say &amp;#34;Lordy</li>
            <li> Crush is pink, a muted raspberry sort of color.</li>
            <li> Also, it is a stain so it will leave your lips pink after.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love Don&#x27;t hate some where in the middle.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a dark fuscia</li>
            <li> but it is VERY pink.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gone in less than an hour for me.  </li>
            <li> Love the texture, not too thick as to feel uncomfortable or heavy and stains your lips without drying them out, so there&#x27;s a subtle hint of color throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The taste is a little minty for my taste, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Stain lasts a LONG time and that&#x27;s not good if you don&#x27;t like the color.</li>
            <li> I have Lipsticks from MAC, Bobbi Brown, Loreal and MAX Factor however this one is my fav for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The product has the color impact of lipstick without the messy application.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I like the color (Crush).</li>
            <li> The formulation is lightweight but slick and pigmented.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy again?</li>
            <li> (Smokers will know what I mean</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t stop yourself with just one of these lip stain pencils--well, at least I can&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dramatic without being costume-y.</li>
            <li> I wear it for work, and casual and dress-up....</li>
            <li> but it turned out to be an ugly plum color.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast in shipping. Great price! !! Love my purchase.</li>
            <li> Crush is the color that came, but it&#x27;s not the one pictured. Crush is pink, a muted raspberry sort of color. I really like it, but if you want red, that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re getting. Even though it&#x27;s a different color from expected it&#x27;s still one of my favorites, and this product is definitely good.</li>
            <li> The color was lighter than the picture but it is long lasting</li>
            <li> lovely deep purple colour. this is my 2nd just bitten balm stain and I love them.goes on glossy and then dries to give a nice finish</li>
            <li> Love this! Goes on smoothly, build-able, and doesn&#x27;t dry out lips at all. I get about 4 hours of coverage before it begins to fade; however, if you apply another coat around the 4 hour mark, then you can go for another 6+ hours without having to reapply. Beware that there is a light peppermint scent, not overpowering, but it is there. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Pros: It is very easy to apply. I love that it&#x27;s a crayon-looking stick. If you want it darker, just apply it heavier. If you want a lighter shade, just apply it and blot some of it off with a tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You do have to re-apply it after several hours, especially after you eat. Don&#x27;t expect it to stay on after drinking/eating a meal!</li>
            <li> This is one my favorite lip products ever! It&#x27;s moisturizing and very long lasting! I would definitely recommend this deep berry color!</li>
            <li> It goes on and stays on but it is VERY pink.  Perhaps a different color would get a different review.  Stain lasts a LONG time and that&#x27;s not good if you don&#x27;t like the color.</li>
            <li> It has a nice minty smell to it and goes on really smoothly but I&#x27;m not sure I like the color (Crush). I expected it to be a dark fuscia but it turned out to be an ugly plum color.</li>
            <li> i have bought several shades now.  The formulation is lightweight but slick and pigmented.  The cap stays on well in my purse.  The taste is a little minty for my taste, but not overpowering.  Definitely my favorite drugstore brand makeup product at the moment.  I&#x27;ve even given them as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have Lipsticks from MAC, Bobbi Brown, Loreal and MAX Factor however this one is my fav for everyday use. The Lipstain is just light, long lasting and absolutely easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just carry the stick in my purse and Im good for the whole day. Remains on the lips even with drinking liquids, eating and smoking (Smokers will know what I mean here)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just lovely colors as well. Got the Crush and Romantic, love it so much that I have order the Adore and Sweetheart. I am Asian with wheatish skin and I love that this suits my skin tone so well!</li>
            <li> best lip color ever - I love the way they go on quickly with great color and keep my lips moist - even keep a spare in the car and it never gets too hot or &#x27;melts&#x27; - perfect - have bought several colors and love them all</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love Don&#x27;t hate some where in the middle. I&#x27;m not a fan of the peppermint taste. Colors are not concentrated. I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy again?</li>
            <li> I love these balm stains. I have so many colors, but Crush is my new favorite. It&#x27;s dramatic without being costume-y.</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> Love these balm stains, and have gotten tons of compliments on the color. Works for me!</li>
            <li> Pretty color. I like this better than lipstick.</li>
            <li> Nice colour, has a minty scent to it</li>
            <li> I saw this in a store, never heard of it before, and I am so pleased.  I love that the stain and balm are mixed together....no put on the stain, then the balm...and it looks and feels great.  I got my friends to buy it too.  I got Crush, which looks perfect and natural on me, and bought one of that is a brighter pink, and still nice.  I wear it for work, and casual and dress-up....every occasion. I&#x27;m glad that it is here at Amazon now, since sometimes you can&#x27;t find it in stores.  This is the best!&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I still like this product; I&#x27;ve bought a few more and the cap ALWAYS splits and breaks...a problem if you carry them in your purse.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used Revlon&#x27;s Balm Stain, and I love it. It outlines your lips easily and lasts a long time without getting dry like other stains I have tried. This color is very nice and flattering. I have silver hair and a medium complexion.</li>
            <li> My new favorite color to wear this season.  I don&#x27;t go without it.  It does come off sooner than expected especially with snacking and drinking water here and there.  It&#x27;s gone in less than an hour for me.  For others who don&#x27;t carry a water bottle with them, it might last longer.</li>
            <li> I love the color, and it&#x27;s a wonderful balm. I have ordered two of them, and will order more when they come on sale</li>
            <li> This lip stain is simply amazing. Whenever I wear this product I always get compliments. It&#x27;s easy to apply, but you can look a little silly putting this big crayon to your face. However, once you see the color it leaves you quickly get over it! I keep this baby in my purse at all times. It&#x27;s a great pop of color when you want to make a bold statement. This lip stain is a 5 seconds to fabulous product and I am so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> the color is very nice its not too drying and it lasts a long time( about 6 hours or so)</li>
            <li> just the color of the pic</li>
            <li> First of all, this is one of the best lip stain products I have tried so far. The color really does stay without a lot of the thick, cakey feeling of lipstick or the sticky feeling of lip gloss. With that said, the stain does dry a bit and can where off when eating and drinking. What I think makes this product so unique though is the ease of reapplication. The product has the color impact of lipstick without the messy application. It can be applied just like chap stick, no mirror necessary. It also has a fresh, minty flavor. Great product with just some minor imperfections.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a very deep deep plum red this is the one. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it regularly but for those looks that require such a deep plum color this is the one that I wanted. Love the color! Also, it is a stain so it will leave your lips pink after.</li>
            <li> Yes. A wise choice indeed considering the price of much of the competition in the long-wearing lipstain field. Similar products priced $24.+ leave my lips dry, tight, and looking like peeling paint before you can say &amp;#34;Lordy, what&#x27;s she done to her mouth?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;But not a chance when my lips are &amp;#34;just bitten&amp;#34;. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Got this in the color Crush and got tons of compliments. Love the texture, not too thick as to feel uncomfortable or heavy and stains your lips without drying them out, so there&#x27;s a subtle hint of color throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I got 2 of these in different colors (very similar to &#x27;Crush&#x27; which I couldn&#x27;t find). They truly do stay moist as a balm does, and, the stain lasts longer than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried (and that includes more pricey brands). I love it--my only complaint is the current color selection.I love reds and dark pinkish red. I&#x27;ll keep waiting as the places I checked were out of several colors.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t stop yourself with just one of these lip stain pencils--well, at least I can&#x27;t!  The colors are all very nice and the product stains my lips along with a nice glaze of matte gloss to keep them soft.  If you buy one, I can pretty much guarantee that you too will be hooked, and will buy several more colors.</li>
