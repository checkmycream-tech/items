            <li>And this is also good for traveling and keeping in a pocket.</li>
            <li>Then a dentist told me that I am allowed to suck on Xylitol mints, as they won&#x27;t discolor the mouth trays AND are actually good for teeth.  </li>
            <li>Great tasting mints (and strong!)</li>
            <li>Tasty, great for your gums, and great at genuinely freshening breath and not just adding mint into the mix of tastes in your mouth.</li>

            <li>study suggests that it&#x27;s more effective if you space out the xylitol.</li>
            <li>Not too sweet and a pleasant mint flavor without sugar.</li>
            <li>mostly started with Epic because in addition to peppermint, they also offer an excellent cinnamon mint.  </li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and in good packaging.  </li>
            <li>Love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>Refreshing flavor.</li>
            <li>Better than Altoids, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I tried these &amp; the Spry mints, and these are way better.  </li>
            <li>, everything&#x27;s just better.  </li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t take more then 4-6 per day.</li>
            <li>fresh bright minty, no sugar and</li>
            <li>I like that this promotes healthy teeth too.  </li>
            <li>so I never have to worry about buying more.</li>
            <li>I found them while seeking products for maintaining healthy gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>These are our favorite xylitol mints of the ones we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it were packages better.</li>
            <li>I read many papers on Xylitol on the theory of how it works.</li>
            <li>I love these mints.  </li>
            <li>Much better for you than sorbitol or sugar.</li>
            <li>But Altoids are sweetened with sorbitol instead of xylitol, and xylitol is better at preventing cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These have made the process much more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t chew gum, and this is the next best thing for freshening my breath and preventing cavities.</li>
            <li>Love using the xylitol products and this mint is no exception.</li>
            <li>Great taste, refreshing and  just the right amount of &#x27;sweet&#x27; ....</li>
            <li>Gives your mouth a nice clean minty taste.  </li>
            <li>I like the flip top carriers because they are easy to access</li>
            <li>Of all xylitol mints I&#x27;ve tried, these are my favorite for flavor, easy of carrying as the tin fits neetly in my fanny pack and perceived benefit.</li>
            <li>These mints are not too sweet and have a nice, slightly strong peppermint flavor.</li>
            <li>Great tasting, mouth freshening mints, great little container!</li>
            <li>I prefer the peppermint over the cinnamon which is too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice minty flavor, not too strong and lasts a good while, being slightly larger than a baby aspirin.</li>
            <li>The mints were light in flavor and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>I was too cheap to throw them away.  </li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no risk of crushing it in your pocket.</li>
            <li>This is an important product for dental health.</li>
            <li>There are plastic bottles of 180 mints and refill bags of 1000 mints available from epicdental, but I haven&#x27;t seen them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the second time I order these  really good and healthy  </li>
            <li>Worth going to the customer friendly website to view!</li>
            <li>They really are very minty and come in a handy tin with a pop top.</li>
            <li>Strong peppermint flavor, but not so strong as to feel hot.</li>
            <li>Clean tasting.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference as far as digestive problems form the xylitol, but maybe if I ate more than a couple each day it would be more of an issue.</li>
            <li>They actually taste really good and the kids ask to have one after a meal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more astringent than most peppermint I&#x27;ve used, and the flavor is very strong, so it took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful stuff and had saved me a ton.  </li>
            <li>These are by far my favorite mints.</li>
            <li>No gluten, no corn, and no artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li>They have just the right amount of minty flavor and keep my mouth moisturized longer than the gum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing Invisalign right now</li>
            <li>They are just the right size for portioning out you desired needs.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer smaller for pocket use, since that&#x27;s where most people are going to keep them.  </li>
            <li>First time trying these mints.</li>
            <li>Only wish I have is for more flavors.</li>
            <li>I thought 5 pack would last me months, it was more like weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(it cost like $5), but that&#x27;s still not exactly the kind of result you expect from a tin of mints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(it cost like $5), but that&#x27;s still not exactly the kind of result you expect from a tin of mints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cost is about 5 cents each, which is okay, but I often toss back 3 or 4 at a time, so I go through them fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was no clear and clinically relevant preventive effect of xylitol on caries in adults with adequate fluoride exposure when non cavitated plus cavitated lesions were assessed.</li>
            <li>They taste fine just not sure I love them.</li>
            <li>For a lighter flavor, try the very minimal fresh fruit from Epic, and for a nice change of pace, try the cinnamon.</li>
            <li>The container is a bit flimsy so if you open the lid a bit too strongly the latch will snap.</li>
            <li>They taste like moderately strong mints and seem to last after they are dissolved.</li>
            <li>They have a strong enough flavor, without making you regret you popped one in your mouth.</li>
            <li>They are strong mints, similar to an Altoid.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just strong enough to freshen your breath without clearing your sinuses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe those obnoxiously large, but plastic, Spry bottles.e</li>
            <li>Maybe those obnoxiously large, but plastic, Spry bottles.</li>
            <li>But what was lacking was a large clinical trial on xylitol mints for adults.</li>
            <li>Packaged in a nice little tin with a flip cap.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast and arrived intact.</li>
            <li>Consequently, the bacteria in my mouth is out of control and my teeth are rotting fast.</li>
            <li>They come in tins that are a fairly reasonable shape &amp; size -</li>
            <li>I ended up stuffing cotton balls into the bottom of the tins, which works, but the sound gets louder with every mint you eat, until there&#x27;s enough room to dump them all out and add another cotton ball.  </li>
            <li>I have this product on my Subscribe and Save program here at Amazon, very convenient.</li>
            <li>My pharmacist told me that aspartame really &amp;#34;messes with your hormones&amp;#34; and takes 4 months to get out of your system.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced that using this after meals really helps prevent cavities.</li>
            <li>I like everything about these mints (except perhaps the price, which can really add up).</li>
            <li>Very convenient size to carry in pocket or purse.</li>
            <li>This is important to pay attention to because xylitol helps with dental health in multiple ways.</li>
            <li>Exposed root surfaces are more common in older adults.&lt;br /&gt;There was no statistically significant difference between xylitol and control participants in the incidence of smooth-surface caries (p &#x3D; .100), occlusal-surface caries (p &#x3D; .408), or proximal-surface caries (p &#x3D; .159).</li>
            <li>The are not too strong and helps with dry mouth too.  </li>
            <li>Since the price of spry peppermints has gone up since I first tried them, I went ahead and tried this epic flavor as well.  </li>
            <li>These do not upset my stomach like other sugar free mints that I keep in my top drawer at work to wet my whistle as I talk my way to t through the work day.  </li>
            <li>These mints are decent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are made by Epic dental who has a VERY informative website about how much Xylitol it takes to prevent decay</li>
            <li>This is more convenient and portable than the powder but so much more expensive.</li>
            <li>but I am a dental hygienist &amp; originally tried these to see if they were something I wanted to recommend to my patients who have dry mouth</li>
            <li>Very tasty and natural.</li>
            <li>so no complaint there.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m not a big gum fan anyway, these mints are right up my alley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Xylitol is a new revolutionary sugar I use in all my pastries, sauces, on fruits...</li>
            <li>The hinges on about 40% of them are messed up before you even open them the first time, so they either stick or threaten to come apart.  </li>
            <li>Exposed root surfaces are more common in older adults.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second and more importantly, it can can help prevent future damage from other meals by suppressing bacteria that would other generate cavity-causing acids.</li>
            <li>The top of the metal container is hard to remove and doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>I use this when it is not feasible to chew the Epic gums</li>
            <li>The tins are also extremely loud.  </li>
            <li>Xylitol for Adult Caries Trial (X-ACT) is a three-year, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to determine the effectiveness of xylitol lozenges in reducing the incidence of coronal and root caries in caries-active adults.</li>
            <li>part of the Xylitol for Adult Caries Trial (X-ACT), non cavitated and cavitated caries lesions were assessed in subjects who were experiencing the disease.</li>
            <li>Including non cavitated lesion assessment in this full-scale, placebo-controlled, multisite, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial in adults experiencing dental caries did not achieve added trial efficiency or demonstrate practical benefit of xylitol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANOTHER CONCLUSION OF THIS TRIAL:&lt;br /&gt;Participants in the xylitol arm developed 40% fewer root caries lesions (0.23 D2FS/year) than those in the placebo arm (0.38 D2FS/year; IRR &#x3D; 0.60; 95% CI [0.44, 0.81]; p &amp;lt; .001).  </li>
            <li>but once you do, search for Epic Dental 100% Xylitol Sweetener Pouch, 5 Pounds.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are (in order): xylitol, gum acacia, natural flavors, magnesium stearate.</li>
            <li>With a mint that has .5 grams, you&#x27;ll need to be sure to eat 12 to 20 mints every day to get this secondary preventative benefit.</li>
            <li>Since each Epic mint contains 0.5 grams, that means it would take 12 mints to get the minimum 6 grams.</li>
            <li>What was Epic was the speed at which I consumed them.</li>
            <li>I am on the Atkins low carb diet and very restricted on what I can eat.</li>
            <li>The latter is only true if you get enough xyiltol per day, spread throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Restricting the present assessment to those subjects with a higher baseline lifetime caries experience showed possible but inconsistent benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Major name brands frequently have an insignificant amount of xylitol per mint.</li>
            <li>I love the fact they are soft, as Lifesavers mints were too hard on the outside for my teeth.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just big enough &amp; strong enough to help with dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>No hard coating on the outside.</li>
            <li>The flavor is a bit weak though so the mints tend to go pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>One container actually lasts a long time with so many little mints.  </li>
            <li>The flavor &amp; texture are better (read: consistent, as opposed to awkwardly changing partway through),</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are only 3 ingredients in these mints: Xylitol, Natural Flavors, Magnesium Stearate.</li>
            <li>texture is somewhat granular as opposed to being completely smooth, but the mints hold up well in my mouth and dissolve slowly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purpose of the trial is to determine the extent to which daily use of xylitol lozenges reduces the appearance of new caries lesions in adults who tend to experience such lesions (i.e., caries-active adults)&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mean annualized noncavitated plus cavitated lesion transition scores in coronal and root surfaces, from sound to carious favoured xylitol over placebo, during the three cumulative periods of 12, 24, and 33 months, but these clinically and statistically nonsignificant differences declined in magnitude over time.</li>
            <li>recommend them all the time b/c I like the flavor &amp; that they last much longer than other mints containing xylitol that I have tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that xylitol is highly toxic to dogs (and possibly other animals).</li>
            <li>All in all it performs a little better than expected by me due to the taste and the lasting effects after it dissolves (two for me).</li>

            <li> Great taste, refreshing and  just the right amount of &#x27;sweet&#x27; ....</li>
            <li> Gives your mouth a nice clean minty taste.  </li>
            <li> I like the flip top carriers because they are easy to access</li>
            <li> Of all xylitol mints I&#x27;ve tried, these are my favorite for flavor, easy of carrying as the tin fits neetly in my fanny pack and perceived benefit.</li>
            <li> These mints are not too sweet and have a nice, slightly strong peppermint flavor.</li>
            <li> Great tasting, mouth freshening mints, great little container!</li>
            <li> I prefer the peppermint over the cinnamon which is too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice minty flavor, not too strong and lasts a good while, being slightly larger than a baby aspirin.</li>
            <li> The mints were light in flavor and not too strong.  </li>
            <li> I was too cheap to throw them away.  </li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no risk of crushing it in your pocket.</li>
            <li> This is an important product for dental health.</li>
            <li> There are plastic bottles of 180 mints and refill bags of 1000 mints available from epicdental, but I haven&#x27;t seen them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the second time I order these  really good and healthy  </li>
            <li> Worth going to the customer friendly website to view!</li>
            <li> They really are very minty and come in a handy tin with a pop top.</li>
            <li> Strong peppermint flavor, but not so strong as to feel hot.</li>
            <li> Clean tasting.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference as far as digestive problems form the xylitol, but maybe if I ate more than a couple each day it would be more of an issue.</li>
            <li> They actually taste really good and the kids ask to have one after a meal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more astringent than most peppermint I&#x27;ve used, and the flavor is very strong, so it took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> It is powerful stuff and had saved me a ton.  </li>
            <li> These are by far my favorite mints.</li>
            <li> No gluten, no corn, and no artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li> They have just the right amount of minty flavor and keep my mouth moisturized longer than the gum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing Invisalign right now</li>
            <li> They are just the right size for portioning out you desired needs.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer smaller for pocket use, since that&#x27;s where most people are going to keep them.  </li>
            <li> First time trying these mints.</li>
            <li> Only wish I have is for more flavors.</li>
            <li> I thought 5 pack would last me months, it was more like weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it cost like $5), but that&#x27;s still not exactly the kind of result you expect from a tin of mints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it cost like $5), but that&#x27;s still not exactly the kind of result you expect from a tin of mints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cost is about 5 cents each, which is okay, but I often toss back 3 or 4 at a time, so I go through them fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was no clear and clinically relevant preventive effect of xylitol on caries in adults with adequate fluoride exposure when non cavitated plus cavitated lesions were assessed.</li>
            <li> They taste fine just not sure I love them.</li>
            <li> For a lighter flavor, try the very minimal fresh fruit from Epic, and for a nice change of pace, try the cinnamon.</li>
            <li> The container is a bit flimsy so if you open the lid a bit too strongly the latch will snap.</li>
            <li> They taste like moderately strong mints and seem to last after they are dissolved.</li>
            <li> They have a strong enough flavor, without making you regret you popped one in your mouth.</li>
            <li> They are strong mints, similar to an Altoid.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just strong enough to freshen your breath without clearing your sinuses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe those obnoxiously large, but plastic, Spry bottles.e</li>
            <li> Maybe those obnoxiously large, but plastic, Spry bottles.</li>
            <li> But what was lacking was a large clinical trial on xylitol mints for adults.</li>
            <li> Packaged in a nice little tin with a flip cap.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast and arrived intact.</li>
            <li> Consequently, the bacteria in my mouth is out of control and my teeth are rotting fast.</li>
            <li> They come in tins that are a fairly reasonable shape &amp; size -</li>
            <li> I ended up stuffing cotton balls into the bottom of the tins, which works, but the sound gets louder with every mint you eat, until there&#x27;s enough room to dump them all out and add another cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> I have this product on my Subscribe and Save program here at Amazon, very convenient.</li>
            <li> My pharmacist told me that aspartame really &amp;#34;messes with your hormones&amp;#34; and takes 4 months to get out of your system.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced that using this after meals really helps prevent cavities.</li>
            <li> I like everything about these mints (except perhaps the price, which can really add up).</li>
            <li> Very convenient size to carry in pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> This is important to pay attention to because xylitol helps with dental health in multiple ways.</li>
            <li> Exposed root surfaces are more common in older adults.&lt;br /&gt;There was no statistically significant difference between xylitol and control participants in the incidence of smooth-surface caries (p &#x3D; .100), occlusal-surface caries (p &#x3D; .408), or proximal-surface caries (p &#x3D; .159).</li>
            <li> The are not too strong and helps with dry mouth too.  </li>
            <li> Since the price of spry peppermints has gone up since I first tried them, I went ahead and tried this epic flavor as well.  </li>
            <li> These do not upset my stomach like other sugar free mints that I keep in my top drawer at work to wet my whistle as I talk my way to t through the work day.  </li>
            <li> These mints are decent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are made by Epic dental who has a VERY informative website about how much Xylitol it takes to prevent decay</li>
            <li> This is more convenient and portable than the powder but so much more expensive.</li>
            <li> but I am a dental hygienist &amp; originally tried these to see if they were something I wanted to recommend to my patients who have dry mouth</li>
            <li> Very tasty and natural.</li>
            <li> so no complaint there.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m not a big gum fan anyway, these mints are right up my alley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Xylitol is a new revolutionary sugar I use in all my pastries, sauces, on fruits...</li>
            <li> The hinges on about 40% of them are messed up before you even open them the first time, so they either stick or threaten to come apart.  </li>
            <li> Exposed root surfaces are more common in older adults.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second and more importantly, it can can help prevent future damage from other meals by suppressing bacteria that would other generate cavity-causing acids.</li>
            <li> The top of the metal container is hard to remove and doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> I use this when it is not feasible to chew the Epic gums</li>
            <li> The tins are also extremely loud.  </li>
            <li> Xylitol for Adult Caries Trial (X-ACT) is a three-year, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to determine the effectiveness of xylitol lozenges in reducing the incidence of coronal and root caries in caries-active adults.</li>
            <li> part of the Xylitol for Adult Caries Trial (X-ACT), non cavitated and cavitated caries lesions were assessed in subjects who were experiencing the disease.</li>
            <li> Including non cavitated lesion assessment in this full-scale, placebo-controlled, multisite, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial in adults experiencing dental caries did not achieve added trial efficiency or demonstrate practical benefit of xylitol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANOTHER CONCLUSION OF THIS TRIAL:&lt;br /&gt;Participants in the xylitol arm developed 40% fewer root caries lesions (0.23 D2FS/year) than those in the placebo arm (0.38 D2FS/year; IRR &#x3D; 0.60; 95% CI [0.44, 0.81]; p &amp;lt; .001).  </li>
            <li> but once you do, search for Epic Dental 100% Xylitol Sweetener Pouch, 5 Pounds.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are (in order): xylitol, gum acacia, natural flavors, magnesium stearate.</li>
            <li> With a mint that has .5 grams, you&#x27;ll need to be sure to eat 12 to 20 mints every day to get this secondary preventative benefit.</li>
            <li> Since each Epic mint contains 0.5 grams, that means it would take 12 mints to get the minimum 6 grams.</li>
            <li> What was Epic was the speed at which I consumed them.</li>
            <li> I am on the Atkins low carb diet and very restricted on what I can eat.</li>
            <li> The latter is only true if you get enough xyiltol per day, spread throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Restricting the present assessment to those subjects with a higher baseline lifetime caries experience showed possible but inconsistent benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Major name brands frequently have an insignificant amount of xylitol per mint.</li>
            <li> I love the fact they are soft, as Lifesavers mints were too hard on the outside for my teeth.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just big enough &amp; strong enough to help with dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> No hard coating on the outside.</li>
            <li> The flavor is a bit weak though so the mints tend to go pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> One container actually lasts a long time with so many little mints.  </li>
            <li> The flavor &amp; texture are better (read: consistent, as opposed to awkwardly changing partway through),</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are only 3 ingredients in these mints: Xylitol, Natural Flavors, Magnesium Stearate.</li>
            <li> texture is somewhat granular as opposed to being completely smooth, but the mints hold up well in my mouth and dissolve slowly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purpose of the trial is to determine the extent to which daily use of xylitol lozenges reduces the appearance of new caries lesions in adults who tend to experience such lesions (i.e., caries-active adults)&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mean annualized noncavitated plus cavitated lesion transition scores in coronal and root surfaces, from sound to carious favoured xylitol over placebo, during the three cumulative periods of 12, 24, and 33 months, but these clinically and statistically nonsignificant differences declined in magnitude over time.</li>
            <li> recommend them all the time b/c I like the flavor &amp; that they last much longer than other mints containing xylitol that I have tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that xylitol is highly toxic to dogs (and possibly other animals).</li>
            <li> All in all it performs a little better than expected by me due to the taste and the lasting effects after it dissolves (two for me).</li>
            <li> At that rate, a single tin of 60 mints would last only 5 days.</li>
            <li> Definitely will purchase again and try a couple other flavors for something different.</li>
            <li> With major brands that only use a little xylitol, you&#x27;ll never get enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but, if I have the same results as other dental patients, this product is something that will become a regular part of my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a hollow metal container full of little hard things - think metal maraca.  </li>
            <li> They do what I got them for (protect teeth after a meal), but have come open several times in my purse and made a mess.  </li>
            <li> In other words, a single mint could be enough to kill a 10 pound dog.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It promotes the production of saliva and thus reduces the detrimental impact of dry mouth syndrome.</li>
            <li> my dry mouth problem!  </li>
            <li> Lots of brands offer cinnamon gum, but mints are harder to come by.  </li>
            <li> (cavities).&lt;br /&gt;They have other products too.</li>
            <li> It tastes like any other mint but has anti-cavity effects.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another researcher in this trial found a 40% reduction in root caries but insignificant improvement on all other tooth surfaces.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like nutrasweet, Malitol or other sweeteners but have found that Xylitol doesn&#x27;t not upset my intestinal tract (TMI alert) nor leave an aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it because I don&#x27;t like seeing people chewing on gum like a cow.</li>
            <li> These, along with a number of other smaller brands, have at least .5 grams.</li>
            <li> So until the manufacturer fixes the tins (which is half the reason I&#x27;m writing this review), I guess I&#x27;ll keep buying these and putting them in other containers.  </li>

            <li> Tasty and supposed to be helpful in keeping mouth bugs down.</li>
            <li> I like the taste if I eat several at a time (very small).  </li>
            <li> I like it a lot but for some odd reason the wife does not.</li>
            <li> the size &amp; shape are less obtrusive/noticeable (if you put it in your cheek while talking, etc.)</li>
            <li> But since I use these for health, not fun, I don&#x27;t mind having to adapt a little.  </li>
            <li> Beats sugary mints or mints using other more dangerous fake sweeteners.</li>
            <li> The lids on the little metal boxes do not stay on and I often end up with mints in my pocket,</li>
            <li> No more certs and other mouth freshening candies over the counter.  </li>
            <li> That also means you&#x27;ll be accumulating lots of little metal tins, which are not always recyclable.</li>
            <li> Tin is just over 3 inches tall, a bit over an inch wide, and about 3/4 inch thick.</li>
            <li> This helps slow down the decay by keeping moisture in my mouth.</li>
            <li> But other than that, the tins are no good.  </li>
            <li> I actually end up keeping the few working tins, even after they&#x27;re empty, and dumping the mints from bad tins into them.  </li>
            <li> I usually take about 1-2 mints per hour 7-8x per day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was not overnight but not more than three business days</li>
            <li> You can see the roots of your teeth in your mouth if your gums have shrunk from gum disease, brushing improperly or with too hard a toothbrush and some age-related gum changes.  </li>

            <li> Finally, the tins are really destructive.  </li>
            <li> There is risk of hypoglycemia around 0.1 grams xylitol per kilogram of body weight, and liver failure around 0.5 g/kg.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the trial concluded that xylitol mints showed no significant improvement in reducing cavities.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kept peppermints in my pocket for years, and they, not surprisingly, ended up giving me problems in a couple teeth.  </li>
            <li> Not good for inconspicuous mint usage.  </li>
            <li> and my mouth has been really dry, but I&#x27;m only allowed to drink water, which got really boring.  </li>
            <li> Another 20-30% develop bad hinges after a few days in your pocket.  </li>
            <li> Come on guys - a little ingenuity!!!!</li>
            <li> Helps to control bad breath.</li>
            <li> biggest drawback I see with these, and the reason they lost one star in my review, is that the packaging is terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These things are addicting. Love &#x27;em. Shipment was fast and arrived intact.</li>
            <li> I tried these mints when they came up when ordering the Xylitol gum. I decided to try it because I don&#x27;t like seeing people chewing on gum like a cow. These are amazing! They have just the right amount of minty flavor and keep my mouth moisturized longer than the gum. I have Sjogren&#x27;s so I no longer make saliva. Consequently, the bacteria in my mouth is out of control and my teeth are rotting fast. This helps slow down the decay by keeping moisture in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Clean tasting. Harmless, possibly helpful. Refreshing flavor.</li>
            <li> Great tasting, mouth freshening mints, great little container!</li>
            <li> Taste great. The lids on the little metal boxes do not stay on and I often end up with mints in my pocket, so now I&#x27;m repackaging them. Supposed to be anti cavity. Beats sugary mints or mints using other more dangerous fake sweeteners.</li>
            <li> No sugar.  Great product !!</li>
            <li> I love these! Better than Altoids, in my opinion. No harmful sugars. Just perfect.</li>
            <li> Great tasting and good for  dental health</li>
            <li> Lovely, great sugar-free, cavity preventing and dentist recommended peppermints. Flavor is similar to Altoids. So if you like Altoids, this is a great way to save your teeth.</li>
            <li> These mints are decent. The flavor is a bit weak though so the mints tend to go pretty quickly. It does feel like it would be good for the teeth but that&#x27;s probably the peppermint talking. The container is a bit flimsy so if you open the lid a bit too strongly the latch will snap.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot but for some odd reason the wife does not. I use this when it is not feasible to chew the Epic gums</li>
            <li> These mints are great.  They&#x27;re just big enough &amp; strong enough to help with dry mouth.  I tried these &amp; the Spry mints, and these are way better.  The flavor &amp; texture are better (read: consistent, as opposed to awkwardly changing partway through), the size &amp; shape are less obtrusive/noticeable (if you put it in your cheek while talking, etc.), everything&#x27;s just better.  My wife, who doesn&#x27;t need these, actually asks for them.  With Spry, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xylitol, of course, makes the big difference between these &amp; regular mints.  I kept peppermints in my pocket for years, and they, not surprisingly, ended up giving me problems in a couple teeth.  These not only don&#x27;t cause problems, but they can actually help prevent them.  Imagine that - a mint that&#x27;s good for your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest drawback I see with these, and the reason they lost one star in my review, is that the packaging is terrible.  They come in tins that are a fairly reasonable shape &amp; size - I would prefer smaller for pocket use, since that&#x27;s where most people are going to keep them.  But other than that, the tins are no good.  The hinges on about 40% of them are messed up before you even open them the first time, so they either stick or threaten to come apart.  Another 20-30% develop bad hinges after a few days in your pocket.  Not good for inconspicuous mint usage.  I actually end up keeping the few working tins, even after they&#x27;re empty, and dumping the mints from bad tins into them.  The tins are also extremely loud.  They&#x27;re a hollow metal container full of little hard things - think metal maraca.  Let&#x27;s put it this way - everyone will know when you&#x27;re coming.  I ended up stuffing cotton balls into the bottom of the tins, which works, but the sound gets louder with every mint you eat, until there&#x27;s enough room to dump them all out and add another cotton ball.  Finally, the tins are really destructive.  Those metal hinges I was talking about?  They&#x27;re tear up anything semi-fragile you put them in your pocket with.  If I have a chance, I&#x27;ll upload a picture of my phone case.  It was scratch-free when I started getting these mints, and within a week, it looked like somebody used it to play soccer on a gravel road.  Granted, it wasn&#x27;t anything nice or fancy (it cost like $5), but that&#x27;s still not exactly the kind of result you expect from a tin of mints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yeah, the tins suck, but the mints are the best I&#x27;ve found.  So until the manufacturer fixes the tins (which is half the reason I&#x27;m writing this review), I guess I&#x27;ll keep buying these and putting them in other containers.  Maybe those obnoxiously large, but plastic, Spry bottles.e you put them in your pocket with.  If I have a chance, I&#x27;ll upload a picture of my phone case.

            <li> These do not upset my stomach like other sugar free mints that I keep in my top drawer at work to wet my whistle as I talk my way to t through the work day.  I usually take about 1-2 mints per hour 7-8x per day.  I ordered these for their decay prevention property &amp; was pleasantly suprised to find they do not cause gastric upset for myself.  I&#x27;m not prone to decay but I am a dental hygienist &amp; originally tried these to see if they were something I wanted to recommend to my patients who have dry mouth (xerostomia).&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m hooked on them:)&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them all the time b/c I like the flavor &amp; that they last much longer than other mints containing xylitol that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;They are made by Epic dental who has a VERY informative website about how much Xylitol it takes to prevent decay (cavities).&lt;br /&gt;They have other products too. Worth going to the customer friendly website to view!</li>
            <li> Turns your mouth &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34;, as opposed to acidic.  Saves your teeth.  But don&#x27;t take more then 4-6 per day.</li>
            <li> I started using this product based on the recomendation from my hygenist.  It is powerful stuff and had saved me a ton.  I have this product on my Subscribe and Save program here at Amazon, very convenient.</li>
            <li> It tastes like any other mint but has anti-cavity effects. Great to add with sugar-free gum which doesn&#x27;t contain xylitol</li>
            <li> fresh bright minty, no sugar and hopefully the xylitol does prevent toothcay!  I will share with others to see what they think!</li>
            <li> I like the taste if I eat several at a time (very small).  They do what I got them for (protect teeth after a meal), but have come open several times in my purse and made a mess.  I was too cheap to throw them away.  I just started my second container.  I think the closure wears out after repeated openings.  Will put this in a ziplock snack bag just in case.</li>
            <li> No more certs and other mouth freshening candies over the counter.  One container actually lasts a long time with so many little mints.  The are not too strong and helps with dry mouth too.  I like that this promotes healthy teeth too.  Definitely will purchase again and try a couple other flavors for something different.</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and in good packaging.  Gives your mouth a nice clean minty taste.  I like the flip top carriers because they are easy to access and it&#x27;s metal so there&#x27;s no risk of crushing it in your pocket.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the second time I order these  really good and healthy  Xylitol is a new revolutionary sugar I use in all my pastries, sauces, on fruits...since I hear about it ....</li>
            <li> OKAY, KINDA WEIRD TASTING</li>
            <li> My Dentest told me about these so I purchased some.  They taste good but for me I can not remember to keep taking them.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Very tasty and natural. Good for your teeth too. I subscribe so I never have to worry about buying more.</li>
            <li> I keep a tin of these mints in the car to use when I am out all day. I use a C-PAP at night, and when my sinuses are stuffy, one of these mints helps open my sinuses so I can breath with the mask on.</li>
            <li> First time trying these mints. I found them while seeking products for maintaining healthy gums and teeth. I take 2 at a time after meals and snacks. They taste like moderately strong mints and seem to last after they are dissolved. I can&#x27;t speak to the oral health benefits yet but I trust the science that is already available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was not overnight but not more than three business days so no complaint there. All in all it performs a little better than expected by me due to the taste and the lasting effects after it dissolves (two for me).</li>
            <li> I have been using IceBreakers for years but wanted to find something without processed sugar and without aspartame.  My pharmacist told me that aspartame really &amp;#34;messes with your hormones&amp;#34; and takes 4 months to get out of your system.  So, I tried these, and they taste just like IceBreakers.  I will be using these from now on.  They really are very minty and come in a handy tin with a pop top.</li>
            <li> These are our favorite xylitol mints of the ones we&#x27;ve tried. The peppermint and cinnamon are both great.</li>
            <li> I like these mints.  They have a strong enough flavor, without making you regret you popped one in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Tasty, great for your gums, and great at genuinely freshening breath and not just adding mint into the mix of tastes in your mouth.</li>
            <li> These are by far my favorite mints. I prefer the peppermint over the cinnamon which is too strong for my taste. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it were packages better. The top of the metal container is hard to remove and doesn&#x27;t stay on. This should be an easy fix!!!! Come on guys - a little ingenuity!!!!</li>
            <li> I read many papers on Xylitol on the theory of how it works. I was convinced that it was the biggest dentistry advance since fluoride. But what was lacking was a large clinical trial on xylitol mints for adults. Even the federal government felt that xylitol showed great promise. Unfortunately, the trial concluded that xylitol mints showed no significant improvement in reducing cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another researcher in this trial found a 40% reduction in root caries but insignificant improvement on all other tooth surfaces.  Root caries are cavities that forms on the roots of your teeth.  You can see the roots of your teeth in your mouth if your gums have shrunk from gum disease, brushing improperly or with too hard a toothbrush and some age-related gum changes.  Exposed root surfaces are more common in older adults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2007 Trial Statement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purpose of the trial is to determine the extent to which daily use of xylitol lozenges reduces the appearance of new caries lesions in adults who tend to experience such lesions (i.e., caries-active adults)&lt;br /&gt;The Xylitol for Adult Caries Trial (X-ACT) is a three-year, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to determine the effectiveness of xylitol lozenges in reducing the incidence of coronal and root caries in caries-active adults. The intervention is the daily use of xylitol lozenges. Participants will be 750 adults (ages 25-75) with current or recent caries lesions who are dental school patients at one of three Clinical Centers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2011 Trial Results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;METHODS:&lt;br /&gt;As part of the Xylitol for Adult Caries Trial (X-ACT), non cavitated and cavitated caries lesions were assessed in subjects who were experiencing the disease. The trial was a test of the effectiveness of 5 g/day of xylitol, consumed by dissolving in the mouth five 1 g lozenges spaced across each day, compared with a sucralose placebo. For this analysis, seeking trial efficiency, 538 subjects aged 21-80, with complete data for four dental examinations, were selected from the 691 randomized into the 3-year trial, conducted at three sites. Acceptable inter- and intra-examiner reliability before and during the trial was quantified using the kappa statistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;The mean annualized noncavitated plus cavitated lesion transition scores in coronal and root surfaces, from sound to carious favoured xylitol over placebo, during the three cumulative periods of 12, 24, and 33 months, but these clinically and statistically nonsignificant differences declined in magnitude over time. Restricting the present assessment to those subjects with a higher baseline lifetime caries experience showed possible but inconsistent benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSIONS:&lt;br /&gt;There was no clear and clinically relevant preventive effect of xylitol on caries in adults with adequate fluoride exposure when non cavitated plus cavitated lesions were assessed. This conformed to the X-ACT trial result assessing cavitated lesions. Including non cavitated lesion assessment in this full-scale, placebo-controlled, multisite, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial in adults experiencing dental caries did not achieve added trial efficiency or demonstrate practical benefit of xylitol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANOTHER CONCLUSION OF THIS TRIAL:&lt;br /&gt;Participants in the xylitol arm developed 40% fewer root caries lesions (0.23 D2FS/year) than those in the placebo arm (0.38 D2FS/year; IRR &#x3D; 0.60; 95% CI [0.44, 0.81]; p &amp;lt; .001).  Root caries are cavities that form on the roots of your teeth.  You can see the roots of your teeth in your mouth if your gums have shrunk from gum disease, brushing improperly or with too hard a toothbrush and some age-related gum changes.  Exposed root surfaces are more common in older adults.&lt;br /&gt;There was no statistically significant difference between xylitol and control participants in the incidence of smooth-surface caries (p &#x3D; .100), occlusal-surface caries (p &#x3D; .408), or proximal-surface caries (p &#x3D; .159). Among these caries-active adults, xylitol appears to have a caries-preventive effect on root surfaces (ClinicalTrials dot gov NCT00393055).r proximal-surface caries (p &#x3D; .159). Among these caries-active adults, xylitol appears to have a caries-preventive effect on root surfaces (ClinicalTrials dot gov NCT00393055).</li>
            <li> I read that xylitol would be good to help balance the ph in my family&#x27;s teeth so I thought I&#x27;d try these.  They actually taste really good and the kids ask to have one after a meal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these! Great tasting mints (and strong!) No gluten, no corn, and no artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li> great flavor and refreshing</li>
            <li> This is more convenient and portable than the powder but so much more expensive. It&#x27;s a good way to get used to using xylitol but once you do, search for Epic Dental 100% Xylitol Sweetener Pouch, 5 Pounds. And this is also good for traveling and keeping in a pocket. I&#x27;m convinced that using this after meals really helps prevent cavities.</li>
            <li> I like everything about these mints (except perhaps the price, which can really add up). There&#x27;s plenty of xylitol. The ingredients are (in order): xylitol, gum acacia, natural flavors, magnesium stearate. 1 calorie per mint. Size is about .4 inch circle. No hard coating on the outside. Strong peppermint flavor, but not so strong as to feel hot. Cost is about 5 cents each, which is okay, but I often toss back 3 or 4 at a time, so I go through them fast. Packaged in a nice little tin with a flip cap. Tin is just over 3 inches tall, a bit over an inch wide, and about 3/4 inch thick. Very convenient size to carry in pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> This is an important product for dental health. It promotes the production of saliva and thus reduces the detrimental impact of dry mouth syndrome.</li>
            <li> Major name brands frequently have an insignificant amount of xylitol per mint. These, along with a number of other smaller brands, have at least .5 grams. This is important to pay attention to because xylitol helps with dental health in multiple ways. First, it does not cause cavities like a sugar-based mint would and by stimulating saliva, tends to repair past damage. Second and more importantly, it can can help prevent future damage from other meals by suppressing bacteria that would other generate cavity-causing acids. The latter is only true if you get enough xyiltol per day, spread throughout the day. From what I&#x27;ve read, that means 6-10 grams every day. With a mint that has .5 grams, you&#x27;ll need to be sure to eat 12 to 20 mints every day to get this secondary preventative benefit. With major brands that only use a little xylitol, you&#x27;ll never get enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gum is arguably a better delivery system for xylitol, however it also frequently contains titanium dioxide (which may or may not be dangerous) and it is more expensive.  As I&#x27;m not a big gum fan anyway, these mints are right up my alley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly started with Epic because in addition to peppermint, they also offer an excellent cinnamon mint.  Lots of brands offer cinnamon gum, but mints are harder to come by.  Since the price of spry peppermints has gone up since I first tried them, I went ahead and tried this epic flavor as well.  It&#x27;s a little more astringent than most peppermint I&#x27;ve used, and the flavor is very strong, so it took some getting used to.  But since I use these for health, not fun, I don&#x27;t mind having to adapt a little.  For a lighter flavor, try the very minimal fresh fruit from Epic, and for a nice change of pace, try the cinnamon.</li>
            <li> If the dentist that recommended these had been in my earlier years, ALL of my teeth would be healthier! Of all xylitol mints I&#x27;ve tried, these are my favorite for flavor, easy of carrying as the tin fits neetly in my fanny pack and perceived benefit. My teeth no longer feel like they&#x27;re wearing sweaters. Only wish I have is for more flavors. Joyce Shaffer, PhD, Psychologist. IdealAging.com</li>
            <li> I love these mints.  I love the fact they are soft, as Lifesavers mints were too hard on the outside for my teeth.  Lifesavers should be called Teethchippers.  Also, they taste great!</li>
            <li> Great xylitol mints. Much better for you than sorbitol or sugar. Xylitol actually kills germs.</li>
            <li> I have had these for a couple weeks now.  I don&#x27;t tend to have them regularly, but munch on them during the day at work.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference as far as digestive problems form the xylitol, but maybe if I ate more than a couple each day it would be more of an issue.</li>
            <li> Tasty and supposed to be helpful in keeping mouth bugs down.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product.  I like the mints.  I will have to wait several months to see if they make a difference but, if I have the same results as other dental patients, this product is something that will become a regular part of my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> Great taste, refreshing and  just the right amount of &#x27;sweet&#x27; ....with no sugar&lt;br /&gt;Helps my dry mouth problem!  I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I like these but I wish they had a stronger flavor. For comparison, Altoid Sugar-Free Smalls are quite a bit stronger. But Altoids are sweetened with sorbitol instead of xylitol, and xylitol is better at preventing cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daily intake of xylitol required to have an effect is supposedly around 6-10 grams. Since each Epic mint contains 0.5 grams, that means it would take 12 mints to get the minimum 6 grams. At that rate, a single tin of 60 mints would last only 5 days. That also means you&#x27;ll be accumulating lots of little metal tins, which are not always recyclable. There are plastic bottles of 180 mints and refill bags of 1000 mints available from epicdental, but I haven&#x27;t seen them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One study suggests that it&#x27;s more effective if you space out the xylitol. That makes sense, since it&#x27;s having an inhibitory effect on your mouth bacteria and eventually that wears off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that xylitol is highly toxic to dogs (and possibly other animals). There is risk of hypoglycemia around 0.1 grams xylitol per kilogram of body weight, and liver failure around 0.5 g/kg. In other words, a single mint could be enough to kill a 10 pound dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only 3 ingredients in these mints: Xylitol, Natural Flavors, Magnesium Stearate.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan.  They taste fine just not sure I love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing Invisalign right now and my mouth has been really dry, but I&#x27;m only allowed to drink water, which got really boring.  Then a dentist told me that I am allowed to suck on Xylitol mints, as they won&#x27;t discolor the mouth trays AND are actually good for teeth.  These have made the process much more enjoyable.  They are strong mints, similar to an Altoid.  I like them a lot.</li>
            <li> What was Epic was the speed at which I consumed them. I thought 5 pack would last me months, it was more like weeks.&lt;br /&gt;So the bottom line is that these mints are awesome. I am ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;Holding back one star because the lid on the pack is a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> These mints are not too sweet and have a nice, slightly strong peppermint flavor. It&#x27;s just strong enough to freshen your breath without clearing your sinuses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is somewhat granular as opposed to being completely smooth, but the mints hold up well in my mouth and dissolve slowly. They don&#x27;t disintegrate as soon as you start sucking on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have issues with my jaw so I can&#x27;t chew gum, and this is the next best thing for freshening my breath and preventing cavities.</li>
            <li> These mints are so refreshing &amp; absolutely a wonderful way to freshen up breath or use them as a quick pick me up.</li>
            <li> Love using the xylitol products and this mint is no exception. It&#x27;s a nice minty flavor, not too strong and lasts a good while, being slightly larger than a baby aspirin.</li>
            <li> The mints were light in flavor and not too strong.  They are just the right size for portioning out you desired needs.  The tin needs some work as the lid has a tendency to fall off.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet and a pleasant mint flavor without sugar. Helps to control bad breath.</li>
            <li> This aluminum container has a bunch of no-carb sweetness within. I am on the Atkins low carb diet and very restricted on what I can eat. I don&#x27;t like nutrasweet, Malitol or other sweeteners but have found that Xylitol doesn&#x27;t not upset my intestinal tract (TMI alert) nor leave an aftertaste. I like these mints -</li>
