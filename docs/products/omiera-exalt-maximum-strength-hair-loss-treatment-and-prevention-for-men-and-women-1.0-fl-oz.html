    <ol>
            <li>The Exalt, however is astonishing !!</li>
            <li>Eve tried to used this and this is really great, my hair is growing faster, i love it!</li>
            <li>I have stopped using Exalt after the formula change as I find it to now be fairly ineffectual.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: All in all, this is a good product from a good company and it should help many people.</li>

            <li>The Exalt Hair loss treatment was delivered in protective packaging and in a nice product box, however some of the product has leaked.  </li>

            <li>the effect seems to be better for Exalt.</li>

            <li>Exalt were very good about my complaint and sent me a replacement bottle.</li>
            <li>so it is worth it.  </li>

            <li>My husband started using it right away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely update again in another month for progress, so far so good.</li>
            <li>This is a good customer-friendly seller that offers a No-Risk 30 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>It has natural, healthy ingredients and is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It has natural, healthy ingredients and is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I still kept applying the treatment after the initial hair growth, which i think helped make my hair more thicker and luscious.  </li>
            <li>Packaging is kind of a let down.</li>
            <li>it comes to application, it is easy since the packaging is simple and straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>The instructions for use are simple and the product is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very highly recommended for men with pattern baldness or fast thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They could probably fit it in that big box</li>
            <li>They could probably fit it in that big box</li>
            <li>I think that the mistake was from omiera, and when I complain for amazon, they deal very well with the problem (</li>
            <li>thanks amazon)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the bottle is tiny and cheaply made .the</li>
            <li>, I had to lessen the dosage of this drops since it is particularly formulated for me.&lt;br /&gt;A month after use, I am able to see hair growth, also, since using this product twice a day (morning and night), my unhealthy scalp (which is more or brown color) turned a bit lighter.</li>
            <li>I do use about five drops instead of the recommended &#x27;one drop&#x27; mainly because one drop doesn&#x27;t really seem to  spread out to all the affected scalp.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to regrow their hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell is minimal and application is fairly easy.</li>
            <li>The package design was far better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>also purchased Acdue from Omiera 3 weeks ago, and their was also a missing item in it that was the pump tube for pumping the product out, and I&#x27;m opening the whole bottle to use the product now, and till today their is no obvious results, but I want to keep my review for Acdue more time to grant it chance</li>
            <li>and I have tried several things to make it grow back quickly.  </li>
            <li>The serum seems to be working, though my father has not been using it long enough for us to see a significant amount of hair growth.  </li>
            <li>is an update on the Exalt product: The original product was produced in a solvent base, probably Alcohol, while the product was effective, it&#x27;s shelf life was pretty severely constrained.</li>
            <li>, I just think for the sake of clear communication they should explain why.</li>
            <li>Omiera Exalt is a natural treatment for hair loss.</li>
            <li>What I find also is the the the other normal hair is now thicker and grows much faster.</li>
            <li>and i have very fine and thin hair</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this for a short time, and he has seen some new growth.</li>
            <li>The bottle is almost 3.5&amp;#34; tall if you measure from very bottom to the tip of cap and 1.25&amp;#34; wide.</li>
            <li>and bacause I live in Middle east, so it costs me extra charge for shipping the product from amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used it now for about 2 months on a daily basis and ACTUALLY have new hair growing in areas which had become shiny bald patches.</li>
            <li>So i thought i must act fast before I&#x27;m to late, searched the market and ended up purchasing &amp;#34;Exalt&amp;#34;, seemed like a very fast acting treatment, and came with a 30 day back guarantee which definitely swayed me into my decision.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to see how much, but it doesn&#x27;t seem significant, so we decided against returning the product.  </li>

            <li> Started losing my hair around the top of my head a few months back, which worried me as I&#x27;m only aged around my late twenties!</li>
            <li> I precede the application with washing the hair with an invigorating shampoo such as the Saw Palmetto Cayenne shampoo and other mint / menthol infused shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have tried a large variety of herbal and pharmaceutical products to correct the issue but they all seemed to just slow down the hair loss process but not reverse it.</li>
            <li> The new hair is very thin and soft but nonetheless it is there !</li>
            <li> She has been using it for a little over a week now and her hair is thickening and there are all kinds of baby hairs growing back!!</li>
            <li> Massage a few drops in thinning/bald areas daily.</li>
            <li> Only takes a few seconds once</li>
            <li> think the products of this company doesn&#x27;t worth the expensive price they set.</li>
            <li> I will post a further update on the progress in a few month.</li>
            <li> Once the item arrived I immediately applied it, and within a few weeks my hair was coming back!</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Please just be weary of the scent, my guess is the witch hazel.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> so I will get several uses out of this small bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told there are no more shiny bald patches left.</li>
            <li> I vary the shampoo every other day just on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Over a period the active ingredients would crystallize and become unusable.</li>
            <li> It seems confusing, is a women&#x27;s scalp somehow different that it doesn&#x27;t need full-strength?&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big box of 5&amp;#34; L by 6.5&amp;#34; W and is almost 1.5&amp;#34; thick - yet</li>
            <li> Works but half way through the bottle clogs from whatever minerals are in it.</li>
            <li> all that was in this box was one little bottle.</li>
            <li> , I have always used minoxidil and took HSN, and biotin everyday of my life.&lt;br /&gt;Omiera</li>
            <li> but it took a few minutes to realize you have to pierce the opening.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> We will update the review in a few weeks or when we notice the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I ended up puncturing the tip with a pin to allow a small amount to come out at a time.  </li>
            <li> and I got a box for revimour product in it , with a small label of exalt product on the box.</li>
            <li> I will try and post a image soon, sorry dont have an image prior to me using this product.</li>
            <li> So, you&#x27;re just getting about a 1 oz bottle and the bottle itself is very plain.</li>
            <li> at least help.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> inside is a little dirty and its not worth the price at all.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was a little difficult to figure out after it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid of balding and wanted to try a growth solution.</li>
            <li> The revised product was in an oil base.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m a woman and i have very fine and thin hair, I have always used minoxidil and took HSN, and biotin everyday of my life.&lt;br /&gt;Omiera Labs exalt sent me this for me to try and test, I had to lessen the dosage of this drops since it is particularly formulated for me.&lt;br /&gt;A month after use, I am able to see hair growth, also, since using this product twice a day (morning and night), my unhealthy scalp (which is more or brown color) turned a bit lighter.

            <li> Omiera Exalt is a natural treatment for hair loss. I decided to give it a try as I&#x27;d like thicker hair - it&#x27;s especially thinned in the temple areas. Here&#x27;s what I think -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Ingredients are proven to work - Saw Palmetto Extract Concentrate, Gamma-Linolenic Acid (GLA), Deonized Water, Vegetable Glycerin, and Phenoxyethanol. I feel confident this will work or at least help.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use. Massage a few drops in thinning/bald areas daily. This is just a liquid solution that is applied topically - no shampoos or pills. Only takes a few seconds once a day.&lt;br /&gt;- This is a good customer-friendly seller that offers a No-Risk 30 day money back guarantee. I feel like they would do what they could to make all their customers happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Packaging is kind of a let down. It&#x27;s a big box of 5&amp;#34; L by 6.5&amp;#34; W and is almost 1.5&amp;#34; thick - yet all that was in this box was one little bottle. The bottle is almost 3.5&amp;#34; tall if you measure from very bottom to the tip of cap and 1.25&amp;#34; wide. It contains 30 ml which translates into 1.01 oz. So, you&#x27;re just getting about a 1 oz bottle and the bottle itself is very plain. It came with nothing else, no package insert or instructions. Tried to get the liquid out but it took a few minutes to realize you have to pierce the opening.&lt;br /&gt;- On the back of the box it says &amp;#34;Not for frontal baldness from medical conditions or hormonal changes.&amp;#34; I would imagine that&#x27;s going to exclude a lot of people and should be in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;- It also says, &amp;#34;Men use as is. For use by women, dilute 1 part with 50% distilled water.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not listing this is a con because I object to mixing it, I just think for the sake of clear communication they should explain why. It seems confusing, is a women&#x27;s scalp somehow different that it doesn&#x27;t need full-strength?&lt;br /&gt;- I received this product to try for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review. Therefore, I&#x27;m pleased with this deal. But when I review a product I do consider the regular pricing. With Amazon, prices fluctuate, but at the pricing level it&#x27;s at right now (and considering cons) I probably wouldn&#x27;t be as likely to repurchase. If it were in the $40 range, I may.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: All in all, this is a good product from a good company and it should help many people. It has natural, healthy ingredients and is simple and easy to use. However, I do think seller should be more communicative in description on who it won&#x27;t help, include literature and instructions in box, and consider offering more product at same price. Maybe a 2 oz bottle? They could probably fit it in that big box they currently package the 1 oz bottle in.ased with this deal. But when I review a product I do consider the regular pricing.

            <li> still no result ...from this product been using this for 3 weeks..</li>
            <li> Many factors have caused my hair to fall out and I have tried several things to make it grow back quickly.  I have been using Omiera Labs Exalt hair loss treatment for a couple of weeks and have noticed my hair is starting to grow back in.  The bottle was a little difficult to figure out after it arrived.  I never got it figured out because it leaked out of the sides.  I ended up puncturing the tip with a pin to allow a small amount to come out at a time.  I diluted it with water and massaged it on my entire scalp.  A little goes a long way so I will get several uses out of this small bottle.  It is very pricey but the benefits of having hair grow back is priceless so it is worth it.  It does not need to be rinsed out and dos not leave my hair looking greasy.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to regrow their hair.  Even though I received a discounted product to review, my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> I ordered Exalt and I got a box for revimour product in it , with a small label of exalt product on the box. and bacause I live in Middle east, so it costs me extra charge for shipping the product from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;so I think that the mistake was from omiera, and when I complain for amazon, they deal very well with the problem (thanks amazon)&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased Acdue from Omiera 3 weeks ago, and their was also a missing item in it that was the pump tube for pumping the product out, and I&#x27;m opening the whole bottle to use the product now, and till today their is no obvious results, but I want to keep my review for Acdue more time to grant it chance so it may works.&lt;br /&gt;I think the products of this company doesn&#x27;t worth the expensive price they set.</li>
            <li> The Exalt Hair loss treatment was delivered in protective packaging and in a nice product box, however some of the product has leaked.  It is difficult to see how much, but it doesn&#x27;t seem significant, so we decided against returning the product.  We purchased the treatment in a promotion for testing and review.  The serum seems to be working, though my father has not been using it long enough for us to see a significant amount of hair growth.  We will update the review in a few weeks or when we notice the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning on the top of my head. I was afraid of balding and wanted to try a growth solution. My wife bought me this because she liked their products for eyelash enhancers. My hair is coming back fuller and I no longer feel I have to worry.</li>
            <li> My mom has been going through treatment, radiation, and after that, she was put on hormones that made her hair start to fall out. So when I was offered this Hair Growth Treatment from Omiera for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it for my mom. She has been using it for a little over a week now and her hair is thickening and there are all kinds of baby hairs growing back!! She is beyond thrilled that she has been able to reverse her hair loss and turn it into hair growth.  I definitely recommend this Omiera Exalt Hair Growth treatment for your head of hair.</li>
            <li> Eve tried to used this and this is really great, my hair is growing faster, i love it!</li>
            <li> Very good, haven&#x27;t seen much yet though</li>
            <li> I received this product in the mail and it was packaged with care.  The package design was far better than I expected.  The instructions for use are simple and the product is easy to use.  My husband started using it right away.  We can&#x27;t wait to see the results in the upcoming weeks.</li>
            <li> I have gradually been losing hair for about ten years now. I have tried a large variety of herbal and pharmaceutical products to correct the issue but they all seemed to just slow down the hair loss process but not reverse it. The Exalt, however is astonishing !! I have used it now for about 2 months on a daily basis and ACTUALLY have new hair growing in areas which had become shiny bald patches. I do use about five drops instead of the recommended &#x27;one drop&#x27; mainly because one drop doesn&#x27;t really seem to  spread out to all the affected scalp. I precede the application with washing the hair with an invigorating shampoo such as the Saw Palmetto Cayenne shampoo and other mint / menthol infused shampoos. I am unreservedly thrilled with the Exalt product and will continue using it now. I will post a further update on the progress in a few month. Very highly recommended for men with pattern baldness or fast thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have now used the product daily for about 5 months and the hair growth has continued. The new hair is very thin and soft but nonetheless it is there ! My daughter thought I was just being vain and when she looked at my scalp she was stunned. I&#x27;m told there are no more shiny bald patches left. What I find also is the the the other normal hair is now thicker and grows much faster. I will try and post a image soon, sorry dont have an image prior to me using this product. I find if i use any shampoo which is invigorating and gives me a tingling sensation then the effect seems to be better for Exalt. I vary the shampoo every other day just on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;This is an update on the Exalt product: The original product was produced in a solvent base, probably Alcohol, while the product was effective, it&#x27;s shelf life was pretty severely constrained. Over a period the active ingredients would crystallize and become unusable. Exalt were very good about my complaint and sent me a replacement bottle. I suspect they had to replace plenty of bottles to people so they changed the formula. The revised product was in an oil base. I found that this change reduced the effectiveness of the product quite drastically. I have stopped using Exalt after the formula change as I find it to now be fairly ineffectual.</li>
            <li> the item come defected. the box Was leaking and the bottle found leak all&amp;iacute; around the bottle.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for a short time, and he has seen some new growth. The smell is minimal and application is fairly easy. In time, we will hopefully see maximum results.</li>
            <li> Started losing my hair around the top of my head a few months back, which worried me as I&#x27;m only aged around my late twenties! So i thought i must act fast before I&#x27;m to late, searched the market and ended up purchasing &amp;#34;Exalt&amp;#34;, seemed like a very fast acting treatment, and came with a 30 day back guarantee which definitely swayed me into my decision. Once the item arrived I immediately applied it, and within a few weeks my hair was coming back! I was so relieved. I still kept applying the treatment after the initial hair growth, which i think helped make my hair more thicker and luscious.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> i was so excited  about this product until i received  it . the bottle is tiny and cheaply made .the inside is a little dirty and its not worth the price at all.  its a scam .don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> Works but half way through the bottle clogs from whatever minerals are in it.</li>
            <li> I had this product  in discount to give my honest opinion in the review. I been using this product for almost two weeks now and so far it&#x27;s doing great. it&#x27;s adding up volume in my hair.hope that I will really get more results in using this product.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product...</li>
            <li> Not even close to the promises that it claims a waste of time and money thanks for getting my hopes up</li>
