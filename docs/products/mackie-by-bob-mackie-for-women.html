            <li>I get more complements from both men and women when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume its like my signature scent</li>
            <li>Not my favorite</li>
            <li>It is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the bob mackie fragrance, have been wearing it for years and always get compliments......</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>it is easy to hang onto.</li>
            <li>Suitable for winter, high temperatures will make it way too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m familiar with the scent and was looking for this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the soft woodsy scent of Mackie.</li>
            <li>It is by far, and will probably always be, my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat strong so be careful not to spray too much - better to spray and walk into it</li>
            <li>It came in pretty timely</li>
            <li>I was running low and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>One of the only scents I am able to wear.</li>
            <li>Great perfume, have used it for at least 20 years.  </li>
            <li>Smells somewhat old-fashioned,  sweet and reaaaally loud.</li>
            <li>It was just what she wanted and was much cheaper them in stores.</li>
            <li>But I do love it on other people.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a classic fragrance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my sister in law always smelled fresh and different as far as perfume scents.</li>
            <li>this might be an old perfume but you should try it..</li>
            <li>A word of caution when trying this scent for the first time -- be sure to dab it on and walk around for at least 10 minutes before you decide to purchase, as the initial fragrance morphs the longer you wear it -- AND it has a tendency to smell completely different from one person to the next, as well as from a tester strip.</li>
            <li>I had to go through extraordinary efforts to get it because USPS was not available.  </li>
            <li>It is much cheaper on amazon than other purfums.</li>

            <li> This perfume is a tuberose bomb. Smells somewhat old-fashioned,  sweet and reaaaally loud. Evening wear. Suitable for winter, high temperatures will make it way too strong.</li>
            <li> Wore it many years ago.  Still smells great.  I have gotten many complements.</li>
            <li> This is the oddest thing.  It came in pretty timely but it does not smell like my other bottles of this.  I was running low and this is my favorite.  I am not sure if it&#x27;s old or what but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this I&#x27;ve worn it for 20 years</li>
            <li> I love this flagrance.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  I am currently deployed in Afghanistan.  I had to go through extraordinary efforts to get it because USPS was not available.  So, I had it delivered to friends and they brought it back in their personal luggage.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and loved the price. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m familiar with the scent and was looking for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description page indicated it was a 3.4 oz. bottle, but I recieved a 1.7 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I didn&#x27;t recheck that all the details on the order page were the same as on the description page, so I got half the value that I was expecting. I&#x27;m disappointed in the bait-n-switch tactic used by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Mackie for more then 20 years.  I get more complements from both men and women when I wear it.  I ALWAYS get asked by men what fragrance am I wearing so they can buy it for their wife/girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like it used to.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bob Mackie for a least 20yrs. People have asked me what I have on that smells so good. And it last all day.</li>
            <li> My woman smells so good now !!!! It was just what she wanted and was much cheaper them in stores.</li>
            <li> Great price for this perfume. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume its like my signature scent</li>
            <li> this might be an old perfume but you should try it..it smells so good and it lasts forever..hard to find in stores but this product was great and I will buy again from here</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite perfume for almost 20 years! It used to be pretty expensive, but it is now harder to find and way cheaper (which is a plus) but I get compliments everywhere I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love the soft woodsy scent of Mackie. I also like the bottle it comes in - it is easy to hang onto. Sadly Mackie has been discontinued and Amazon is about the only place I have found that still is selling it, but as long as Amazon sells it, I will be buying it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the price and a buddie of mine wears this. It smells pretty good. Not my favorite but I like it. It is much cheaper on amazon than other purfums. So it is a value for the price.</li>
            <li> Worn this for years! It is my favorite. Love, love, love it!!!!  One of the only scents I am able to wear.</li>
            <li> Had purchased this years ago and decided to order it again....but this time...either I&#x27;ve changed...or it wasn&#x27;t quite like what I remembered it to be...oh, well...I am keeping it.  TJ</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this product for several years.  I get many complements and with amazon you have a good price and easy shipping to my door</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter...she loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my sister in law always smelled fresh and different as far as perfume scents. I looked everywhere and was thrilled to see amazon carries it. I hope this scent stays around. I know this was a \\&quot;hot\\&quot; scent in the 1990&#x27;s but to me it&#x27;s a classic fragrance. The smell is like no other perfume I&#x27;ve bought and believe me, I&#x27;ve purchased my fair share!!!</li>
            <li> Great perfume, have used it for at least 20 years.  A fragrance others can smell but you can&#x27;t smell it on yourself.  Last all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scent for 20+ years, and to this day... I still receive compliments every time I go out.  It is by far, and will probably always be, my favorite fragrance. A word of caution when trying this scent for the first time -- be sure to dab it on and walk around for at least 10 minutes before you decide to purchase, as the initial fragrance morphs the longer you wear it -- AND it has a tendency to smell completely different from one person to the next, as well as from a tester strip.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance; fabulous price; perfect, timely shipping.  What more could anyone ask!  Just what I expect from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I loved this on a lady who walked into our jewelry store.  I really love the smell of it on my cloths, but it doesn&#x27;t do well on my skin :( which can&#x27;t be helped.  But I do love it on other people.  Nice perfume and it lasts.  It&#x27;s somewhat strong so be careful not to spray too much - better to spray and walk into it so it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I love the bob mackie fragrance, have been wearing it for years and always get compliments......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t like chasing after products but some department store clerk told me to try amazon, so thank you.......</li>
            <li> I always smell women who wear this and they smelled great so decided to try it for some reason just smelled musky grandma-ish! :( don&#x27;t know if counterfeit or just smelled good on others and not me</li>
