            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal Amazon customer for many years.  </li>
            <li>fantastic value.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, but it doesn&#x27;t work like my Shea butter does.  </li>

            <li>The cocoa butter is in great bundles and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out soon  because I order a total of 3</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>

            <li>Super product.  </li>
            <li>It has become my family&#x27;s new favorite body cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Palmer&#x27;s for years I really love it remove dark spots and leave your skin feeling smooth, gave my mother &amp; sister some of my order they love it too.</li>
            <li>This cocoa butter is very nicely scented---very mild and not too heavy like some.</li>
            <li>The contents were fresh.  </li>
            <li>I would take a hot shower in the morning when i got up and put it all over my body</li>
            <li>I love Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter for facial creme.  </li>
            <li>I paid the extra money because I thought I was getting more cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought I&#x27;ll regret buying it</li>
            <li>My wife tried many different creams before settling to following:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost through with the first jar of this cocoa butter</li>
            <li>What I love most is; I have very dry skin and those areas that are prone to be dry; stay moist and ash-free all day.</li>
            <li>I added coconut oil and grapeseed oil for more moisture for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell, it always smell so sweet and a little like chocolate!</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>but it turned out to be more than i expected.</li>
            <li>I was all ready to return it and had written a review all</li>
            <li>and there was a posting that replied to it stating that the walls of the 13.25 oz jar were much thinner than the one for the 9.5 oz jar..</li>
            <li>Major plus is these super sized jars.</li>
            <li>I live in a really hot country where the summers don&#x27;t see a drop of rain for four months</li>
            <li>then I went back and found the original review</li>
            <li>This product is soothing, long-lasting; applied daily it will makes a difference in my quality of life because I&#x27;m not constantly scratching myself. :)</li>
            <li>, i filled the empty 13.25 oz jar with water and then poured the water into a liquid measuring cup ...</li>
            <li>my legs are dry pretty much</li>
            <li>I was at first concerned because I read a review that claimed it was the same size as the 9.5 oz size, but I ordered it anyway</li>
            <li>huge* containers that will surely last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I put it on my 17 months old, my 10 year</li>
            <li>old(she took the whole big pot to her room ), my husband and of course my self!</li>
            <li>and when I got it, compared the external size of the packaging to the 9.5oz size we normally buy and they are a match!</li>
            <li>I used it everyday while i was pregnant.</li>
            <li>After 2 days of using early in pregnancy I began breaking out in red bumps on my stomach, hips, and thighs.</li>
            <li>It is soft enough to be easily spread but thick enough to earn the name \\&quot;butter\\&quot; and not \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; or \\&quot;cream\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday right out of the pool to heal and protect my skin.</li>
            <li>It was as expected I really like Palmers cocoa butter and would definitely order again.</li>
            <li>I had major surgery and was left with three scars I used this product</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to other families.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, but this product keeps my skin soft and moist all day.  </li>

            <li> I have very dry skin, but this product keeps my skin soft and moist all day.  </li>
            <li> (Any good skin doctor will tell you that expensive creams are a waste of money.)  </li>
            <li> I also use it when I get burned from cooking, or dry cracked skin from having my hands in water often.</li>
            <li> However, I find that my skin is dry by the morning, I was expecting</li>
            <li> For anyone with dry skin or cracked heels and feet this cocoa butter is a must.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both have dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Got the 3 to keep one upstairs, one down, and an extra.  </li>
            <li> Eliminates my dry, flaky, and sometimes rough/bumpy skin!</li>
            <li> I used to have drier than usual skin but ever since I&#x27;d used this product regularly for a little over a year, my skin feels so soft now.</li>
            <li> virtually eliminated problems I have had with dry skin due to diabetes.</li>
            <li> Arrived a day before expected time, carefully wrapped.  </li>
            <li> I emptied out the contents of the 13.25 oz jar and tried to pack it into the empty 9.5 oz jar.</li>
            <li> This is not pure Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li> I used this on my belly throughout my 3 pregnancies and I have very minimal evidence of stretch-marks.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it takes forever to absorb.</li>
            <li> I bought late last year.</li>
            <li> If you find it too greasy, try  Palmer&#x27;s body butter instead, which is less greasy and softer.  </li>
            <li> I use it every night on my feet and elbows and sometime a little on my face as a moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> The base ingredient is cocoa which makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I got my mom a few</li>
            <li> I am nearly seventy and have used creams (anything from expensive body creams to Vaseline and almond oil since I was 15.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone with trouble areas.</li>
            <li> Its consistency is thick</li>
            <li> and the smell is subtle but divine.</li>

            <li> I have been using PALMERS COCOA BUTTER FORMULA since i was 17 I used it everyday while i was pregnant. I would take a hot shower in the morning when i got up and put it all over my body so your pores ubsorb it nicely and then repeat it at night when you take a shower again im 49 now and everyone thinks my son and i are brother and sister. They are amazed that I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles or blemishes its really really good for scars.WELL GOOD LUCK!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this brand of cocoa butter! It&#x27;s an excellent source of moisture and leaves my skin super soft. I especially like it for my elbows. Just rub it in - instant softness! I also love the smell, it always smell so sweet and a little like chocolate!</li>
            <li> This is very good for the winter. Keeps you from getting ashy.</li>
            <li> fantastic value.  best price anywhere, best softener, moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever had.  virtually eliminated problems I have had with dry skin due to diabetes.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, but it doesn&#x27;t work like my Shea butter does.  I added coconut oil and grapeseed oil for more moisture for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Cream. Cant imagine what could I do without it. It helped  with sport strech marks 5 years ago and I hope it would prevent me from getting strech marks now, during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter is very nicely scented---very mild and not too heavy like some. It is soft enough to be easily spread but thick enough to earn the name \\&quot;butter\\&quot; and not \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; or \\&quot;cream\\&quot;. My skin loves it!</li>
            <li> it cocoa butter. has the great traditional smell but the texture is greasier than the stuff in the bottle. This is well packed but softens in your hands.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different Cocoa Butter products in my Therapeutic Massage practice, and Palmer&#x27;s is without doubt the best.  Its fragrance is clear, but not dominating, and its consistencey is excellent for the deep tissue work I do.</li>
            <li> Besides the incredible smell and superb spreadable texture...it&#x27;s the fact that the whole family can use it! I put it on my 17 months old, my 10 year old(she took the whole big pot to her room ), my husband and of course my self!</li>
            <li> Very nice!!! Almost inmidiate effect!!!</li>
            <li> My family and I have used this product for over 15 years. It&#x27;s remarkable for stretch marks, scars, bruises, scrapes, facial, and body conditioning. I&#x27;ve strayed away at times to try other&lt;br /&gt;brands however, nothing compares! The 3 pack is a great value at Amazon and I would highly recommend it to other families.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Palmer&#x27;s for years I really love it remove dark spots and leave your skin feeling smooth, gave my mother &amp; sister some of my order they love it too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product (in fact all of palmer&#x27;s product) for years it is the best on the market.  I had major surgery and was left with three scars I used this product and I have not one scar.  My doctor wanted to know what I used to get rid of the scars I told him and he and his wife(she is also a doctor) are telling their patients.  I would recommend this product and all of palmer&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Arrived a day before expected time, carefully wrapped.  I love Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter for facial creme.  No problem with this order, which is a 5 star to me!</li>
            <li> Wonderful on dry and cracked feet!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, thick and rich cream with a wonderful cocoa butter scent.  I&#x27;m almost 60, so my legs are dry pretty much&lt;br /&gt;all year around, this cream does the trick.</li>
            <li> The delivery was on time and I am pleased with the product. I use it every night on my feet and elbows and sometime a little on my face as a moisturizer at night. I also use it when I get burned from cooking, or dry cracked skin from having my hands in water often. I am happy.</li>
            <li> Great price for the size of this tub!</li>
            <li> This is not pure Cocoa Butter. I was very disappointed to find a long list of additional ingredients included in the butter. I will be returning it for a refund. Please list ALL ingredients in products in the future.</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations, it is a great moisturizer and easy to use. However, I find that my skin is dry by the morning, I was expecting the moisture to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;My cream was delivered promthly in a safe and secure box.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this cream for any one looking for a moisturizer for summer outings.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Introduced to it in the shock trauma unit after a horrorific bicycle wreck.  From suture scars to burns this stuff aided recovery, since then it is my go to cream for post ride skin care.  Preferred to lotion.</li>
            <li> My favorite!  The base ingredient is cocoa which makes a huge difference.  It is emolient based, so it doesn&#x27;t crumble, even on cold skin.  I use this everyday right out of the pool to heal and protect my skin.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this 3 pack again. Good value for big tubs of cocoa butter. It&#x27;s way cheaper than buying at a store.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Very moisturizing.  Only complaint is that it takes forever to absorb. I like the packaging because I can get every last drop unlike moisturizers with a pump.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in fine condition and was as advertised.  The contents were fresh.  This is the best value on the product that I have found.</li>
            <li> I used to have drier than usual skin but ever since I&#x27;d used this product regularly for a little over a year, my skin feels so soft now. I got my mom a few and she loved it.</li>
            <li> The best cocoa butter on earth period.</li>
            <li> This cream seems to be the only one that helps heal and moisturize my hands and not feel greasy after a short time.</li>
            <li> The best cocoa butter ever.</li>
            <li> AN EXCELLENT MOISTURIZER</li>
            <li> great transaction - no disappointments at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 10 years... 365 days a year...my skin feels super soft and the volume/price makes it even better!!! What I love most is; I have very dry skin and those areas that are prone to be dry; stay moist and ash-free all day.</li>
            <li> Great value and large containers. These arrived as promised. I use Palmers Cocoa Butter for my feet and all over especially in the winter. This is a bit greasy for dressing in clothes so I use it at nighttime after a shower when preparing for bed. Put it on your feet and put socks on for softer feet. I used this on my belly throughout my 3 pregnancies and I have very minimal evidence of stretch-marks. Very good product. Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Best ever for dry skin!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Palmers. They came through again. Easy to apply and moisturization is very good. 3-pack is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I use this cocoa butter cream for everything, moisturizer, makeup remover, after shaving legs. It is very thick but I just wipe excess of with bath towel, perfect!</li>
            <li> Great product. It keeps my skin moist and toned. The scent is a lot milder than the sprout bottle which i love.</li>
            <li> After 2 days of using early in pregnancy I began breaking out in red bumps on my stomach, hips, and thighs. I stopped using the cocoa butter and they went away.</li>
            <li> Super product.  Great price and I like the larger containers.</li>
            <li> Product is advertised as 13.5 oz when in fact they are 9.5 oz. which cost $6.99 in my local store.  Even though the jar itself has 13.5 oz. printed on it, it is identical to the 9.5 oz. jar I purchased locally.  I paid the extra money because I thought I was getting more cocoa butter.  I&#x27;ve been a loyal Amazon customer for many years.  Amazon should make sure it is delivering what it advertises.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I&#x27;ll regret buying it but it turned out to be more than i expected. It was fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love coco butter &amp; have used it for years. Smells great &amp; makes my skin so soft. Major plus is these super sized jars.</li>
            <li> My wife tried many different creams before settling to following:&lt;br /&gt;- Palmers Cocoa Butter&lt;br /&gt;- CeraVe Cream&lt;br /&gt;- Aquaphor (oily so maybe only for nighttime)</li>
            <li> I have the hereditary disease psoriasis. This ointment is the best thing I have found in 40 years for treating my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Smells really good, and my skin feels noticible moisturized even 24 hours later which I love.</li>
            <li> It was as expected I really like Palmers cocoa butter and would definitely order again. The cocoa butter is in great bundles and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out soon  because I order a total of 3</li>
            <li> For anyone with dry skin or cracked heels and feet this cocoa butter is a must.  I am nearly seventy and have used creams (anything from expensive body creams to Vaseline and almond oil since I was 15.  (Any good skin doctor will tell you that expensive creams are a waste of money.)  I have been using cocoa butter now for the last 6 years and have found it wonderful.  I live in a really hot country where the summers don&#x27;t see a drop of rain for four months so moisturizer is essential.  I use  cocoa butter after I shower every day, including on my face and also rub it well into my hands and nails after doing the washing.  If you find it too greasy, try  Palmer&#x27;s body butter instead, which is less greasy and softer.  This cocoa butter has the texture of Vaseline.  I also gave it to my friend who has to have chemotherapy and it&#x27;s the only cream she can tolerate on her skin.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have dry, itchy skin. This product is soothing, long-lasting; applied daily it will makes a difference in my quality of life because I&#x27;m not constantly scratching myself. :)</li>
            <li> Using for my husband&#x27;s recent knee replacement scar, and the surrounding tissue, recommended by his physical therapist to massage the muscles.  Got the 3 to keep one upstairs, one down, and an extra.  Allows generous use for the cost.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have very dry skin, but this product keeps my skin soft and moist all day.  I use it every morning after showing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost through with the first jar of this cocoa butter I bought late last year. I liked it and when I saw a special on three jars I scooped it up. Good cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> It did, doing what it say and I like it.</li>
            <li> Love this cocoa butter.  It has become my family&#x27;s new favorite body cream.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time and love it. I was at first concerned because I read a review that claimed it was the same size as the 9.5 oz size, but I ordered it anyway and when I got it, compared the external size of the packaging to the 9.5oz size we normally buy and they are a match!! I was all ready to return it and had written a review all P--d off because it seemed like the size thing was scam.. then I went back and found the original review and there was a posting that replied to it stating that the walls of the 13.25 oz jar were much thinner than the one for the 9.5 oz jar.. well that was a plausible explanation so I tested it.  I emptied out the contents of the 13.25 oz jar and tried to pack it into the empty 9.5 oz jar. It didn&#x27;t fit.  But just in case i hadn&#x27;t packed it in well enough, i filled the empty 13.25 oz jar with water and then poured the water into a liquid measuring cup ... yep.. 13.25 - 13.5 oz....... My bad! So Yes, this is a great product and a great buy!  And to all the folks who are used to the 9.5 oz size, while the 13.25 oz jar is the same size on the outside, it is not the same on the inside! The walls are definitely thinner than the 9.5 oz size jar...</li>
            <li> Items. Are always left in front of garage door</li>
            <li> Eliminates my dry, flaky, and sometimes rough/bumpy skin! Gives me a dewy &amp; healthy glow. Its consistency is thick but I actually enjoy that and the smell is subtle but divine. My skin is even and toned with no stretch marks. I would recommend to anyone with trouble areas.</li>
            <li> I have always liked and used this cream but never found it in this size.  I got 3 *huge* containers that will surely last a long time.  Great value.</li>
