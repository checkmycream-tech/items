            <li>Better than that cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>Very soft and smooth, absorbs fairly quickly into the skin leaves a nice smooth feeling and has a very nice aroma.</li>
            <li>I was originally trying to find juba oil, but the body shop doesn&#x27;t do the unscented oil with the drops any more.</li>
            <li>This did not spread easily and made you want to take a shower</li>
            <li>This oil smells SO strong that when I opened it to smell it I felt naseous.</li>
            <li>I thought it had a strong spicy smell</li>
            <li>a bit strong.....</li>
            <li>My girlfriend liked it very much</li>
            <li>We love this oil for full  body massages.  </li>
            <li>IT IS A LITTLE BIT OILY, BUT MAKES FOR A WONDERFUL MASSAGE..</li>

            <li>Well worth your money!  </li>
            <li>but this massage oil from Body Shop has a musky allure that wins every time!</li>
            <li>, the scent is unique.</li>
            <li>from reading other reviews, i was thinking this would smell more pleasant.</li>
            <li>My fiance isn&#x27;t big on oils of any kind, but he&#x27;s perfectly okay</li>
            <li>My room smelled like a clean grandpa for a full week.</li>
            <li>My wife loved it immensely.</li>
            <li>And compared to other massage oils, the price is great for what you get.</li>
            <li>I prefer citrusy, fresh clean smells</li>
            <li>It smells great, a subtle but good smell, and she said her skin felt soft for a couple days after without having to put on any lotion.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Although the consistency of the massage oil is nice and warm, the scent is a little too much like the \\&quot;incense\\&quot; type of scent for me...</li>
            <li>but i really wouldn&#x27;t enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I rubbed a few drops on my skin and it felt great</li>
            <li>finally, it doesn&#x27;t have any taste at all which is nice.</li>
            <li>Ok, so maybe some of that had to do with the way it was being applied to her skin, and the fact that the first time I busted it out was on a wilderness backpacking trip after we spent the day doing 10 miles through rugged terrain :)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sensual and it made us slip all over each other - in a good way..</li>
            <li>and it was the right thickness.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>, obviously my girlfriend likes it more than i do, but that is just because she is the one getting the massage</li>
            <li>Also made me nauseous the first night.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong (kind of peppery) but my partner and I love it.</li>
            <li>The added bonus of being able to get frisky is a major turn-on, and I am excited to use massages as an excuse to fool around with my wife!</li>
            <li>it allows for fast heat transfer with massage and makes it really easy to glide hands along someone&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li>Has a nice silkyness to it and a little warming...</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a soothing kind of smell, maybe make my boyfriend feel more relaxed; I was wrong.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very sensual and relaxing.  </li>
            <li>Very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Cant really smell the oil unless i stick my nose up to my skin either</li>
            <li>The smell was much like the oil from a Spa</li>
            <li>It  does not feel grassy as many of the other oils.</li>
            <li>Great smell, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Nice and long lasting softness.</li>
            <li>Very light oil, not super greasy</li>
            <li>I used this one time and it is really musky - like old spice swagger musky.</li>
            <li>... is that normal?  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the smell particulary appealing, and the oil doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>Not hard to wash off.</li>
            <li>It is super relaxing and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>The product is a little thicker than I had expected and you need a good amount for each use.</li>
            <li>it did not come with a safety seal, which bothered me somewhat, and makes me wonder how they sell it again/ used or new?</li>
            <li>Would recommend to couples seeking something new for the bedroom.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers who said this goes on soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Very odd smell, and it&#x27;s quite strong.</li>
            <li>it smells like sushi ginger to me, so it isn&#x27;t all that romantic to be using this and smelling like a piece of sashimi hahaha.</li>
            <li>did not try to put this in a sensitive area and try to taste it</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s still enough for a few more uses after using it once too.</li>
            <li>Not to thick and not to thin, but was easily worked in to the skin and stayed smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Having said that, a little bit does go a long way and, well, the experience just might be worth it.</li>
            <li>The oil lasted reasonably well and was slightly warming when being rubbed in to the skin.</li>

            <li> Great smell, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Nice and long lasting softness.</li>
            <li> Very light oil, not super greasy</li>
            <li> I used this one time and it is really musky - like old spice swagger musky.</li>
            <li> ... is that normal?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the smell particulary appealing, and the oil doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Not hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> It is super relaxing and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The product is a little thicker than I had expected and you need a good amount for each use.</li>
            <li> it did not come with a safety seal, which bothered me somewhat, and makes me wonder how they sell it again/ used or new?</li>
            <li> Would recommend to couples seeking something new for the bedroom.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers who said this goes on soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Very odd smell, and it&#x27;s quite strong.</li>
            <li> it smells like sushi ginger to me, so it isn&#x27;t all that romantic to be using this and smelling like a piece of sashimi hahaha.</li>
            <li> did not try to put this in a sensitive area and try to taste it</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s still enough for a few more uses after using it once too.</li>
            <li> Not to thick and not to thin, but was easily worked in to the skin and stayed smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Having said that, a little bit does go a long way and, well, the experience just might be worth it.</li>
            <li> The oil lasted reasonably well and was slightly warming when being rubbed in to the skin.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t awful and if i wouldn&#x27;t have been able to return it for free i would have used it.</li>
            <li> but I only give it 4 stars because the bottle is smaller than I expected which means this is a bit on the spendy side.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about how new the product is because the oil was not up to the brim and the bottle was oily.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> A few reviews mentioned a strong (i.e. unpleasant) odour with this massage oil, but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything.</li>
            <li> it also has a lot of natural ingredients, so it isn&#x27;t irritating to skin.</li>
            <li> Smell is not my favorite, but it isn&#x27;t bad at all!</li>
            <li> Not greasy - use a little at a time - spreads well.</li>
            <li> Not very sexy.</li>
            <li> this oil doesn&#x27;t smell nasty but it doesn&#x27;t smell nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, though my wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little small, but recommended.</li>
            <li> but I just couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> Plus the oil was really thick.</li>
            <li> you hate though.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells really awful.</li>
            <li> but it seems the smell is a matter of preference, as it wasn&#x27;t HORRIBLE.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works amazingly. Not hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> My partner loves the warm, spicy scent and it leaves her skin feeling great.  We love it.</li>
            <li> The shipment is very quick! I am satified with the shipment and the oil. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell. Smells like menthol. Also did not heat up upon application</li>
            <li> This stuff smells really awful. I thought it would be a soothing kind of smell, maybe make my boyfriend feel more relaxed; I was wrong. It just wasn&#x27;t pleasant, and because it got on all of the sheets and what-not everything needed washed after using.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Pleasant fragrance and texture.  I would recommend it. And will probably buy more when this one is gone.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to use a lot, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  Absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> Very odd smell, and it&#x27;s quite strong. I should&#x27;ve believed the reviews.  Has a nice texture though.  Next time I&#x27;ll try a different fragrance.</li>
            <li> Works very well, the smell is wonderful. You won&#x27;t even mind it when it takes two washes to get it out of your sheets.</li>
            <li> This smells great and glides easily over the skin.  It&#x27;s perfect when you want to spoil your love with a nice massage.  My fiance isn&#x27;t big on oils of any kind, but he&#x27;s perfectly okay when I break out this massage oil and instantly turns into putty.  :)</li>
            <li> for massage, as a hair and skin oil, as a perfume - always get compliments - smells divine. Very light oil, not super greasy</li>
            <li> We love this oil for full  body massages.  The fragrance is very sensual and relaxing.  It  does not feel grassy as many of the other oils.</li>
            <li> Excellent massage oil, both for the person receiving the massage as well as for the person giving the massage.&lt;br /&gt;I might order a Gallon</li>
            <li> Great smell, and a little goes a long way.  Makes for a very nice massage without being overly greasy, or overly aromatic.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it :) Its one of those smells you either love or you hate though. Nice and long lasting softness.</li>
            <li> This product smells and works great!  The product is a little thicker than I had expected and you need a good amount for each use.</li>
            <li> from reading other reviews, i was thinking this would smell more pleasant. it wasn&#x27;t awful and if i wouldn&#x27;t have been able to return it for free i would have used it. but i really wouldn&#x27;t enjoy it. but it seems the smell is a matter of preference, as it wasn&#x27;t HORRIBLE.  i just opened it to smell...it did not come with a safety seal, which bothered me somewhat, and makes me wonder how they sell it again/ used or new?</li>
            <li> Smells great&lt;br /&gt;Works amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t taste good lol</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife and I. As far as the massage goes, it&#x27;s great. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue or anything like that. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, though my wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars from her.&lt;br /&gt;3 stars from me.</li>
            <li> This massage oil smells great and is a great adjunct to strong hands providing a sensual massage to your partner. My wife loved it immensely. It appears safe even as a lubricant (no sensitivity experienced). Highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers who said this goes on soft and smooth.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily or sticky afterward like some skin products do.  This is more like what the pros use for massage.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be agreement about the smell, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this stuff is perfect but I only give it 4 stars because the bottle is smaller than I expected which means this is a bit on the spendy side.  Having said that, a little bit does go a long way and, well, the experience just might be worth it.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works very well.  Lots of happy endings to be had, y&#x27;all.  We don&#x27;t go on vacation without it.</li>
            <li> The oil works as intended, and has a pleasant smell, obviously my girlfriend likes it more than i do, but that is just because she is the one getting the massage, she wanted to give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels good on your skin. Nourishing., Yet spreads nice with out being greasy. This is some good oil. Tad pricy but It spreads and lasts a bit. Good stuff. Better than that cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> we enjoyed using the massage oil. The quality of the Body Shop oil is better than most but on amazon the price is better.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Not so sensual at all. Nasty at best.</li>
            <li> Great oil to get for your marriage.  It is super relaxing and lasts a long time.  Love this massage oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for about a month with no complaints. It smells nice and works in well. As always The Body Shop provides a quality product. I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love this massage oil! The scent is a little strong (kind of peppery) but my partner and I love it. A little goes a long way, and it does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> I used this one time and it is really musky - like old spice swagger musky. My room smelled like a clean grandpa for a full week. Not very sexy. Also made me nauseous the first night. Plus the oil was really thick. Felt more like jello</li>
            <li> Very good massage oil. Smells like a spa.</li>
            <li> The smell was nice but no too strong. The oil lasted reasonably well and was slightly warming when being rubbed in to the skin.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves back rubs so I ordered this awhile back. It smells great, a subtle but good smell, and she said her skin felt soft for a couple days after without having to put on any lotion. I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very good massage oil.  Smells like the ones they use at the salon.  I would recommend and buy again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great Deal!!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Not sure about how new the product is because the oil was not up to the brim and the bottle was oily. Cant really smell the oil unless i stick my nose up to my skin either... is that normal?  I would like an exchange</li>
            <li> Well worth your money!  Perfect to share with the special someone in your life.  My girl couldn&#x27;t stop telling me how much she liked it and how great a job I had done picking it out.  Ok, so maybe some of that had to do with the way it was being applied to her skin, and the fact that the first time I busted it out was on a wilderness backpacking trip after we spent the day doing 10 miles through rugged terrain :)  Speaking of skin, it does tend to leave it smoother after being applied, a nice aftereffect upside.</li>
            <li> The Body Shop Massage Oil worked very good. The smell was much like the oil from a Spa and it was the right thickness. Not to thick and not to thin, but was easily worked in to the skin and stayed smooth and silky. My girlfriend liked it very much and we both enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> This oil smells SO strong that when I opened it to smell it I felt naseous. I rubbed a few drops on my skin and it felt great but I just couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. I had to go wash my hands and skin after putting it on because every time I caught a whiff I felt nauseous again. I thought it had a strong spicy smell and my boyfriend said it smelled like soy sauce!</li>
            <li> I prefer citrusy, fresh clean smells but this massage oil from Body Shop has a musky allure that wins every time! Not too perfumey leaving the body kissable and tasty even after its on. Exotic and sensual and safe to use in every spot (no irritation to privates) and makes the lovemaking all the more enjoyable!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, very relaxing. Has a nice silkyness to it and a little warming...Great for back rubs!</li>
            <li> Too fragrant for my husband, but i like it :)</li>
            <li> GREAT! The best sensual massage oil I have found!&lt;br /&gt;Truly a great blend...fragrant, smooth,sensual, easily absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;You will love it!</li>
            <li> Although the consistency of the massage oil is nice and warm, the scent is a little too much like the \\&quot;incense\\&quot; type of scent for me...a bit strong.....I was originally trying to find juba oil, but the body shop doesn&#x27;t do the unscented oil with the drops any more.</li>
            <li> this oil doesn&#x27;t smell nasty but it doesn&#x27;t smell nice. it smells like sushi ginger to me, so it isn&#x27;t all that romantic to be using this and smelling like a piece of sashimi hahaha. that being said, the consistency is nice. it allows for fast heat transfer with massage and makes it really easy to glide hands along someone&#x27;s back. it also has a lot of natural ingredients, so it isn&#x27;t irritating to skin. finally, it doesn&#x27;t have any taste at all which is nice.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Not greasy - use a little at a time - spreads well.</li>
            <li> This is a great body oil. Smells good, safe on private parts, safe to lick, and very sexy. A little small, but recommended.</li>
            <li> smells great and rubs on wonderful, girlfriend loves it when I break this stuff out after she has a hard day at work!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the smell particulary appealing, and the oil doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> awesome smell; not too much, but very soothing! Came well packaged and on time. THe Body Shop always has top quality products</li>
            <li> The scent is not too overpowering, this is a great massage oil</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good massage oil.  Interesting scent.  We enjoy its sensuality.  Would recommend to couples seeking something new for the bedroom.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the scent is unique. My fiancee does not like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted one that was easier to spread around almost like a lubricant like body oil/lotion to spread easier. This did not spread easily and made you want to take a shower after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you specifically want an oil, then i guess this is OK but for what I want this is not what I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not try to put this in a sensitive area and try to taste it so cannot comment on that.</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells great, feels great, and safe in intimate areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s sensual and it made us slip all over each other - in a good way.. ;) Smell is not my favorite, but it isn&#x27;t bad at all! And compared to other massage oils, the price is great for what you get. There&#x27;s still enough for a few more uses after using it once too.</li>
            <li> A few reviews mentioned a strong (i.e. unpleasant) odour with this massage oil, but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything. The oil itself is perfect for a regular massage, providing excellent skin lubrication so a good physical rub-down is pleasant for both parties. The added bonus of being able to get frisky is a major turn-on, and I am excited to use massages as an excuse to fool around with my wife!</li>
            <li> Very soft and smooth, absorbs fairly quickly into the skin leaves a nice smooth feeling and has a very nice aroma.</li>
            <li> SMELLS WONDERFUL! LIKE YOU ARE GETTING A $150 MASSAGE.. IT IS A LITTLE BIT OILY, BUT MAKES FOR A WONDERFUL MASSAGE..</li>
