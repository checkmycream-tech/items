            <li>Her curls came out beautiful.</li>
            <li>You will NOT sleep lol.</li>
            <li>and they turned out great.</li>
            <li>Works great with just rollers and water too.</li>
            <li>It would be great to have the rollers specs</li>
            <li>Great curls without heat damage.</li>
            <li>I took then out this time and my hair was amazing!</li>
            <li>I went out on a limb and tried them on my transitioning hair, and I was most impressed by the results.</li>
            <li>Curlformers are really good, however I can&#x27;t sleep on them.</li>
            <li>these worked magically on my hair!</li>
            <li>glad  got them!</li>
            <li>My first try it didn&#x27;t come out the way I wanted it to, but practice makes perfect.</li>
            <li>I love these curlformers!</li>
            <li>, it would have been nice if it came with instructions.</li>
            <li>Also would be nice if there was a latch on the part you put your hair into.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a good setting lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and is very light weight when in the hair.</li>
            <li>They really are a great deal.</li>
            <li>Love em Love em Love.</li>
            <li>I was more than pleased with these curlers.</li>
            <li>Love the way this product because it holds my curls for 2 to 3 days and keeps the shine.</li>
            <li>Also, love the price.</li>
            <li>I think the top of the stick snagged it or something.</li>
            <li>Product is as shown and as reviewed many times.</li>
            <li>I applied it with my hands thoroughly, combed it through with a comb, and then used my brush to make sure the product was all the way through.</li>
            <li>My hair is a bit too long for these and a litttle bit sticks out the bottom of the curlformer, but it still looks awesome in the end.</li>
            <li>This is also a great for natural girls trying to stay away from heat.</li>
            <li>She found them fairly easy to use</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received that very quick as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the type to give up so easy</li>
            <li>They were easy to install for me because I watched YouTube videos on techniques on how to apply them.</li>
            <li>Shipping and company were fine , just dissatisfaction with the product.</li>
            <li>The only con is the hook stick isn&#x27;t great quality</li>
            <li>I used Tresemme Flawless Curls gel and instead of applying it like I normally do, I tried something different.</li>
            <li>and they give this effect of beautiful loose curls!</li>
            <li>The delivery was also super fast!!</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with the product now to find a styling gel or spray to help the long term hold!</li>
            <li>These are a fraction of the cost of the name brand curlformers and totally worth it.</li>
            <li>They are fun to use.</li>
            <li>I would tell anyone that&#x27;s its worth every penny</li>
            <li>I received my order pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Other than that inconvenience I have really loved the curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it might take some time at first, but for the most part, it is a good product, the only bad thing about is trying to get a good sleep with them in your head, they HURT!</li>
            <li>It really does everything that it is supposed to do but the hook will not close for me.</li>
            <li>I use it very time</li>
            <li>This are the &amp;#34;off brand&amp;#34; Curlformers - I ordered this - fast delivery - and received it in about a week - even when I spoke with their customer service</li>
            <li>so I cant really rate the drying time.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The one that comes with this set is kind of weak for kinky textured hair.</li>
            <li>My curls were beautiful and my hair feels as if it was blow dried (and even flat iron a little bit) which was not the case.</li>
            <li>Make sure you arrange them properly so you can sleep a little on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that these worked on my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are soft and the wand is sturdy.</li>
            <li>I first tried SheaMoisture Curl Souffl&amp;eacute; and when I took the curlformers out my hair was weighed down and my curls didn&#x27;t form much.</li>
            <li>I guess I just need regular perm rods, probably ideal for at least shoulder length hair but even then not sure how that would work.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend purchasing the actual curlformer hook for about $4 though.</li>
            <li>I have medium hair length and everytime I take them off the curls are super tight and it makes my hair look short</li>
            <li>Not to mention these rollers at Sally&#x27;s are nearly 80 dollars for a pack of the same amount!!</li>
            <li>I was having a little bit of trouble at first with getting the curls to turn out right.</li>
            <li>but I had used a deep conditioner and had used this product on maybe two day old deep conditioned hair</li>
            <li>I also applied a little more gel to the ends then usual.</li>

            <li> but I had used a deep conditioner and had used this product on maybe two day old deep conditioned hair</li>
            <li> I also applied a little more gel to the ends then usual.</li>
            <li> so my coils were already stretched and stuff</li>
            <li> the only thing is the stick is about a half inch too short, but I made it work!</li>
            <li> My hair was dry when I used this product I have 4C natural hair, so my hair is very tightly coiled</li>
            <li> but they are the same size as the blue and green ones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers of off-brand Curlformers say that their hooks broke or had rough edges - no such complaints</li>
            <li> but after 20 min they start to loose</li>
            <li> Put them in when your hair is wet and then blow dry</li>
            <li> They work as expected.</li>
            <li> and it just didn&#x27;t curl up how I expected it to</li>
            <li> I used these on wet hair</li>
            <li> My curls were defined and shiny and my curls have lasted through heat, harsh winds, and daily errands.</li>
            <li> These things are not really worth the pain.</li>
            <li> However, they are not very comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them 3 times since I bought them and they haven&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> It does take a few tries to get, but once you get it the process goes a little faster.</li>
            <li> (Using Shea butter leaving conditioner, shea butter oil and castor oil  (4b/4c hair), and a little bit of argan oil eco styler)</li>
            <li> Also, while pulling my hair through one of the curlers tore a little.</li>
            <li> I tried it on blow dried hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and very thick and hard to hold curls.</li>
            <li> A small learning curve to install</li>
            <li> The problem I had is that they look small in the picture</li>
            <li> and it was so hard to put my hair in</li>
            <li> I had to order 2 because of thick hair.</li>
            <li> And I do mean PAIN.</li>
            <li> I slept in them NOT a good idea.  </li>
            <li> And sadly my curls fell by 2 pm (not the cutlers fault just my crazy long hair pulled flat :(</li>
            <li> does what they say and for the money u cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> yeah, they are not comfortable to sleep on so use a hooded dryer or make this a day project because it was one of the worst nights&#x27; sleep I have ever had.</li>
            <li> But sleeping in them is impossible!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> these worked magically on my hair! the only thing is the stick is about a half inch too short, but I made it work! glad  got them!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that these worked on my hair. I&#x27;ve been looking for products that actually work on my hair. However, they are not very comfortable to sleep in. Make sure you arrange them properly so you can sleep a little on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Curlformers are really good, however I can&#x27;t sleep on them. (Using Shea butter leaving conditioner, shea butter oil and castor oil  (4b/4c hair), and a little bit of argan oil eco styler) My curls were beautiful and my hair feels as if it was blow dried (and even flat iron a little bit) which was not the case.</li>
            <li> These knock off curlformers are BOMB! I&#x27;ve used them 3 times since I bought them and they haven&#x27;t let me down. They create perfect spiral curls! They really are a great deal. The only con is the hook stick isn&#x27;t great quality but it gets the job done.  Not to mention these rollers at Sally&#x27;s are nearly 80 dollars for a pack of the same amount!! I don&#x27;t know about yall but I don&#x27;t have time for 80 dollar rollers. Save yourself some money and buy these.</li>
            <li> These things are not really worth the pain. And I do mean PAIN. Ouch. Lost a lot of hair on this product.&lt;br /&gt;Good price for caving into my curiosity of the product. Shipping and company were fine , just dissatisfaction with the product.</li>
            <li> These are a fraction of the cost of the name brand curlformers and totally worth it. My hair is very long and very thick and hard to hold curls. These work awesome! I had to purchase 2 sets for my hair though because it takes about 70 of these to do my head. My hair is a bit too long for these and a litttle bit sticks out the bottom of the curlformer, but it still looks awesome in the end. I have gotten about a hundred compliments on my curls today! One note, i do not recommend putting them in before bed and trying to sleep with them in. You will NOT sleep lol. Put them in when your hair is wet and then blow dry it is my suggestion.</li>
            <li> I lovvvve them I&#x27;ve done 3 perms with them and they turned out great. They are fun to use. Works great with just rollers and water too. I had to order 2 because of thick hair. Love em Love em Love. If u want curly hair get em. &amp;#34;Would Recommend&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It really does everything that it is supposed to do but the hook will not close for me. I have had everyone I know try to get it to lock together but it is about 1/2&amp;#34; out of place. Other than that inconvenience I have really loved the curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, they are not comfortable to sleep on so use a hooded dryer or make this a day project because it was one of the worst nights&#x27; sleep I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I was more than pleased with these curlers. I went out on a limb and tried them on my transitioning hair, and I was most impressed by the results. I am going to purchase another set.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift for my daughter. They work as expected. She found them fairly easy to use and she loves the type of curl they give.</li>
            <li> This product is the bees knees! I use it very time I need a go to style. I am a curly girl so when I feel the need to try something different this is where its at!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM!!! They work wonderful. I have medium hair length and everytime I take them off the curls are super tight and it makes my hair look short but after 20 min they start to loose and they give this effect of beautiful loose curls! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This are the &amp;#34;off brand&amp;#34; Curlformers - I ordered this - fast delivery - and received it in about a week - even when I spoke with their customer service and they said it was being shipped from outside the US. A small learning curve to install but once you have it it&#x27;s easy and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are soft and the wand is sturdy. I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers of off-brand Curlformers say that their hooks broke or had rough edges - no such complaints here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> Love the way this product because it holds my curls for 2 to 3 days and keeps the shine. Also, love the price.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry when I used this product I have 4C natural hair, so my hair is very tightly coiled but I had used a deep conditioner and had used this product on maybe two day old deep conditioned hair so my coils were already stretched and stuff and it just didn&#x27;t curl up how I expected it to and it was so hard to put my hair in, it would have been nice if it came with instructions. Also, while pulling my hair through one of the curlers tore a little. I think the top of the stick snagged it or something. I couldn&#x27;t get my hair through and was pulling the stick and trying to smooth out the curler material and that just made it worse. I guess I just need regular perm rods, probably ideal for at least shoulder length hair but even then not sure how that would work. Also would be nice if there was a latch on the part you put your hair into.</li>
            <li> it might take some time at first, but for the most part, it is a good product, the only bad thing about is trying to get a good sleep with them in your head, they HURT!</li>
            <li> I love the ringlets these curlers give!!!!...The delivery was also super fast!!</li>
            <li> Very good product that gave excellent results for a fraction of the price. I would highly recommend purchasing the actual curlformer hook for about $4 though. The one that comes with this set is kind of weak for kinky textured hair.</li>
            <li> The problem I had is that they look small in the picture but they are the same size as the blue and green ones.  That presents a problem when ordering.  It would be great to have the rollers specs so a buyer can know what they are getting beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not get to use them in my short hair because of this.</li>
            <li> The curls are gorgeous! But sleeping in them is impossible!  And sadly my curls fell by 2 pm (not the cutlers fault just my crazy long hair pulled flat :( I&#x27;m going to try a different product for my hair during application,  and I haven&#x27;t tried them during the day so I cant really rate the drying time. Overall very happy with the product now to find a styling gel or spray to help the long term hold!</li>
            <li> Im African American and I used these on wet hair and they worked.  I slept in them NOT a good idea.  Make sure you use a good setting lotion my curls  fell after one day !!!</li>
            <li> does what they say and for the money u cant go wrong. I would tell anyone that&#x27;s its worth every penny</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves the product. Her curls came out beautiful. She recommended them to all her friends and family. Thanks</li>
            <li> Product is as shown and as reviewed many times. It&#x27;s well made and is very light weight when in the hair. It does take a few tries to get, but once you get it the process goes a little faster. I received my order pretty quick.My first try it didn&#x27;t come out the way I wanted it to, but practice makes perfect. I&#x27;m very happy with everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put the hook together, it snapped. I contacted the company and immediately received a response. All they needed was an emailed picture of the hook. Once I sent it, they sent out the replacement. I received that very quick as well. Great customer service!</li>
            <li> I love these curlformers! I was having a little bit of trouble at first with getting the curls to turn out right. I first tried SheaMoisture Curl Souffl&amp;eacute; and when I took the curlformers out my hair was weighed down and my curls didn&#x27;t form much. The second try I tried it on blow dried hair and I applied Cantu Defining Custard and when I took the formers out and my hair did the same thing. I&#x27;m not the type to give up so easy so I looked up my curly hair type and I found out that gel works best to define my curls. My third try I used Tresemme Flawless Curls gel and instead of applying it like I normally do, I tried something different. I applied it with my hands thoroughly, combed it through with a comb, and then used my brush to make sure the product was all the way through. I also applied a little more gel to the ends then usual. I took then out this time and my hair was amazing! My curls were defined and shiny and my curls have lasted through heat, harsh winds, and daily errands. I had the curlers in for 8 hours each time I tried them. They were easy to install for me because I watched YouTube videos on techniques on how to apply them. This is also a great for natural girls trying to stay away from heat.</li>
            <li> Just what my daughter wanted.  Great curls without heat damage.</li>
