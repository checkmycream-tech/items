            <li>Nice detailing.</li>
            <li>For the price its great exactly whats in the pictures</li>
            <li>pretty good but the string broke but can easily be replaced and still look good</li>
            <li>this product is very cheaply crafted and fell apart within hours.  </li>
            <li>but I still love it.</li>
            <li>Everything was ok except the tooth part.</li>
            <li>The tooth was made of a plastic when I thought it was going to be something better.</li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>, it looks ok hung up against another necklace.</li>
            <li>I am sure you will like it.</li>
            <li>I love these and plan to order more.</li>
            <li>more than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>This one looks more costume</li>
            <li>I ordered one of these on an auction site but paid 5 times more for it -</li>
            <li>Picture more appealing than what I have.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I&#x27;m not a horribly picky person.</li>
            <li>Sent this to a friend he loved  it very much just the cord</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase, and I received the items a week or two sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li>exactly as shown, packaged well, love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tooth is transparent, easy to brake, made from a style mold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you can see the glue on the tooth but for the price fine.</li>
            <li>This necklace is great for a teen boy.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth more than the 2 dollars I paid for it.</li>
            <li>so I used one from another seller that gives away free ropes anyways.</li>
            <li>I know it was cheap</li>
            <li>The wire part broke before i even pulled it out of the package all the way and the tooth part was extremely cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Lesson learned for them that when you buy something cheap, you can expect it to break extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>we had to hot glue it back on to fix it.but over A VER BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF JEWELRY</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s total length is a good 2 in.  </li>
            <li>I prefer stainless steel or a non metal material if deciding to go CHEap!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However the pendant is the only good thing</li>
            <li>I guess we&#x27;ll see what happens when the full moon comes.</li>
            <li>The tooth was kinda slim when going into the metal piece holding it but other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>The necklace is very cool and it really stands out.</li>
            <li>This necklace was great and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This product was pretty much a time waster, the shipping took three months and the necklace piece was more like a choker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My sister loves it and is pretty certain she&#x27;ll gain wolf powers if she wears it under the light of the full moon.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>Nice pendant, perfect size and looks well made, the cord its kinda short but its okay, got it at least 2 weeks before expected, good shippment and you pay much less than its worthy for the necklace.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my older sister&#x27;s 25th birthday and let me tell you, I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>You could see where it was glue in with what seemed like a hot glue gun</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, It is larger than I thought it would be and a bit &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Additionally the package took a very long time to arrive (more than 3 weeks) having been shipped from overseas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it was a decent size!</li>
            <li>#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; and these are very inexpensive...</li>
            <li>the chains where they latch together is really weak.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Even for a man, its a bit much.</li>
            <li>Also,  it says it&#x27;s made with a real tooth</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really what it ought to be.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>These look to be decent quality, and they were quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>string ir comes with is decent but</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>and it is the same exact thing!  </li>
            <li>had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>It came earlier than expected and with no delivery issues :)</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; fell out of the first one almost immediately and the second one within 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty and bigger</li>
            <li>Originally I was going to buy a wolf shirt, but as it turns out, they are more expensive than one would think.</li>
            <li>ALSO the tooth is just hot glued in there on the back side</li>
            <li>The design is good but the chain is very weak</li>
            <li>Superglue fixed the problem.  </li>
            <li>but there is clearly a white hard material built up and around the tooth to make it much bigger in length and around at the top where it inserts into the \\&quot;wolf\\&quot; piece.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my 11 year old niece,  her last name is Wolf and she collects wolf themed stuff.  </li>
            <li>surprised to get so much for so little</li>
            <li>But I bought it for my 9 yr old daughter who loves wolves and has a small claw on a chain that is delicate and pretty cool.</li>
            <li>But my kids had far higher expectations of the products that they purchased with their hard earned money.  </li>

            <li> need a new string for adult males though as the necklace runs a bit small for larger framed guys.</li>
            <li> Plus I will add since it&#x27;s soo flipping huge, the wolf&#x27;s mean aggressive expression, makes this piece even less desireable.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like the size of a long, fat, pinky finger.  </li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than the expected date</li>
            <li> Tooth bigger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> A bit bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Very long shipping though.</li>
            <li> I wear it almost every single day</li>
            <li> I putit on a different necklace becase it cmes with a plan black necklace</li>
            <li> I ordered 4, and like that the tooth on each on is a little different size.  </li>
            <li> however a couple day after he wore it, the tooth fell of the other part of the charm.</li>
            <li> but I have to say the actual necklace rope is way to small for a man I could not even put it on</li>
            <li> but nothing less than wut I expected!</li>
            <li> It took them over a month and a half to send it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with werewolves and supernatural stuff</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s when I spotted this little gem.</li>
            <li> my 17yr old son is OBSESSED with wolves, dragons, zombies &amp; vampires</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a necklace you can wear everyday.</li>
            <li> The texture is uneven where the tooth ends and the added marital is put.  </li>
            <li> Maybe not all are put together the same, but this one is not great  </li>
            <li> And the took is hanging out really badly and hot glued into there.</li>
            <li> I was worried it maybe to small</li>
            <li> it comes with is fairly fairly small</li>
            <li> I gave it to my boyfriend for our 2 year anniversary and her apsolutly loves it wears it everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I even want to give this too her</li>
            <li> so small</li>
            <li> Not sure what material they used for the tooth.</li>
            <li> kinda hard 2 get it on ur neck being the links</li>
            <li> Desperate to find her a present that was wolf themed but wouldn&#x27;t break the bank I turned to jewelry</li>
            <li> And also the tooth was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.</li>
            <li> I bought them for gifts, shipping wasn&#x27;t too bad coming from China.</li>
            <li> CRAZY!</li>
            <li> but I earned that money myself and it&#x27;s crap.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Nice pendant, perfect size and looks well made, the cord its kinda short but its okay, got it at least 2 weeks before expected, good shippment and you pay much less than its worthy for the necklace.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with werewolves and supernatural stuff so I thought this was something that I wold like to have. It&#x27;s a good price for a nice piece.  I putit on a different necklace becase it cmes with a plan black necklace but I still love it.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and he loved it!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend, It came quickly and it was the perfect size. I was worried it maybe to small but it was a decent size!</li>
            <li> Everything was ok except the tooth part. You could see where it was glue in with what seemed like a hot glue gun and there were spaces between the tooth and metal. The tooth was made of a plastic when I thought it was going to be something better. My fiance liked it though and she wears it often so I guess it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> The product delivers good quality and is well made. need a new string for adult males though as the necklace runs a bit small for larger framed guys.</li>
            <li> The tooth was kinda slim when going into the metal piece holding it but other than that, it&#x27;s great. It came earlier than expected and with no delivery issues :)</li>
            <li> this product is very cheaply crafted and fell apart within hours.  We purchased two.  The &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; fell out of the first one almost immediately and the second one within 24 hours.  The glue they used was somewhat silicone and did not adhere to the metal.  Superglue fixed the problem.  Additionally the package took a very long time to arrive (more than 3 weeks) having been shipped from overseas.&lt;br /&gt;I realize that &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; and these are very inexpensive... But my kids had far higher expectations of the products that they purchased with their hard earned money.  Lesson learned for them that when you buy something cheap, you can expect it to break extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> my 17yr old son is OBSESSED with wolves, dragons, zombies &amp; vampires so when I came across this necklace I HAD to get it for Christmas.. It came in a timely manor and he loves it also this picture does it no justice, looks much better in person! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Sent this to a friend he loved  it very much just the cord it comes with is fairly fairly small</li>
            <li> IT BROKE THREE DAYS AFTER HAVING IT!</li>
            <li> it took a wile to get hear .but good thing come to those who wheat</li>
            <li> so I guess no one cares about ware these teeth come from, or that its killing wolf hounds?</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Heads up&amp;#34; The tooth is not real.&lt;br /&gt;The tooth is transparent, easy to brake, made from a style mold.&lt;br /&gt;The string ir comes with is decent but the chains where they latch together is really weak.&lt;br /&gt;But, it looks ok hung up against another necklace.</li>
            <li> The necklace is very cool and it really stands out. It&#x27;s a necklace you can wear everyday.</li>
            <li> The necklace is beautiful! I gave it to my boyfriend for our 2 year anniversary and her apsolutly loves it wears it everyday! however a couple day after he wore it, the tooth fell of the other part of the charm. we had to hot glue it back on to fix it.but over A VER BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF JEWELRY</li>
            <li> Good product My friend loved it</li>
            <li> It is my favriot neklace of all time I recommend this neklace for people who like theeth  I am sure you will like it.</li>
            <li> Dissapointed.  This does say \\&quot;man&#x27;s necklace\\&quot;  but I didn&#x27;t think it would be this big.  Even for a man, its a bit much. It&#x27;s total length is a good 2 in.  Example it&#x27;s like the size of a long, fat, pinky finger.  Also,  it says it&#x27;s made with a real tooth but there is clearly a white hard material built up and around the tooth to make it much bigger in length and around at the top where it inserts into the \\&quot;wolf\\&quot; piece.  The texture is uneven where the tooth ends and the added marital is put.  Looks kinda cheesey and not well crafted.  Maybe not all are put together the same, but this one is not great  Plus I will add since it&#x27;s soo flipping huge, the wolf&#x27;s mean aggressive expression, makes this piece even less desireable.  Got this for my 11 year old niece,  her last name is Wolf and she collects wolf themed stuff.  I&#x27;m not sure I even want to give this too her</li>
            <li> This is a great item.  Love it!  Good Quality.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Very long shipping though.</li>
            <li> The design is good but the chain is very weak</li>
            <li> This necklace was great and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> the chain already broke. had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I love this necklace! It&#x27;s so pretty and bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> broke the second I got it</li>
            <li> kinda hard 2 get it on ur neck being the links r so small but nothing less than wut I expected!</li>
            <li> incredible wolf tooth. me and my best bud loves it. recommend it to all wolf fans</li>
            <li> I love these and plan to order more. I see them along with my own creations or use the pendents on my necklaces. Really nice!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, It is larger than I thought it would be and a bit &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; more than I was expecting. But I bought it for my 9 yr old daughter who loves wolves and has a small claw on a chain that is delicate and pretty cool. This one looks more costume but honestly she loves it and for the price it&#x27;s really what it ought to be. Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great ,Necklace could of been longer .</li>
            <li> Amazing necklace. It arrived earlier than the expected date</li>
            <li> These look to be decent quality, and they were quite reasonable. I bought them for gifts, shipping wasn&#x27;t too bad coming from China.</li>
            <li> This necklace is great for a teen boy.  I ordered 4, and like that the tooth on each on is a little different size.  I ordered one of these on an auction site but paid 5 times more for it - and it is the same exact thing!  Very happy with this purchase, and I received the items a week or two sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> U get what u paid for it look nice in the beginning after 2wks it begin to fad or rust! CRAZY! Smdh! I prefer stainless steel or a non metal material if deciding to go CHEap!</li>
            <li> Really nice !!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loved it !</li>
            <li> pretty good but the string broke but can easily be replaced and still look good</li>
            <li> I wear it almost every single day</li>
            <li> This product was pretty much a time waster, the shipping took three months and the necklace piece was more like a choker.&lt;br /&gt;However the pendant is the only good thing but I don&#x27;t recommend purchasing just for the fact that it was estimated to arrive in three weeks but it got lost and I had to get a replaced and it took longer to arrive.</li>
            <li> Tooth bigger than I expected.  Picture more appealing than what I have.</li>
            <li> Loved it it never comes off</li>
            <li> Saving as a gift for my son.  I think he&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my older sister&#x27;s 25th birthday and let me tell you, I was not disappointed. Originally I was going to buy a wolf shirt, but as it turns out, they are more expensive than one would think. Desperate to find her a present that was wolf themed but wouldn&#x27;t break the bank I turned to jewelry and that&#x27;s when I spotted this little gem. My sister loves it and is pretty certain she&#x27;ll gain wolf powers if she wears it under the light of the full moon. I guess we&#x27;ll see what happens when the full moon comes.</li>
            <li> 5 stars. Definitely worth more than the 2 dollars I paid for it.</li>
            <li> For the price its great exactly whats in the pictures but I have to say the actual necklace rope is way to small for a man I could not even put it on so I used one from another seller that gives away free ropes anyways. ALSO the tooth is just hot glued in there on the back side you can see the glue on the tooth but for the price fine. the shipping took for dam ever also.</li>
            <li> So I bought this necklace December 26 and I didn&#x27;t get it until April 6. Almost 4 months until I got this. I sent an email asking where it is. It was miss placed. So they had to send another. It took them over a month and a half to send it again. Really? And also the tooth was broken when I got it. And the took is hanging out really badly and hot glued into there. Very poorly made. I know it was cheap but I earned that money myself and it&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> exactly as shown, packaged well, love it!</li>
            <li> it was good for a while then the tooth fell out</li>
            <li> This was a gift. Nice look and price. Not sure what material they used for the tooth. Just took forever to arrive from another country.</li>
            <li> surprised to get so much for so little</li>
            <li> Thank you. I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very nice. A bit bigger than I expected. Nice detailing.</li>
            <li> The wire part broke before i even pulled it out of the package all the way and the tooth part was extremely cheaply made. Luckily, I&#x27;m not a horribly picky person. But this product sucked basically.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the necklace, hasn&#x27;t taken it off.  Thanks</li>
