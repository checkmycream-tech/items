            <li>The smell is really great</li>
            <li>It smells so great, and works so well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s of great quality.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and not overpowering...</li>
            <li>so the deal isn&#x27;t as great as it seems.</li>
            <li>The scrub itself works great, but it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like Lavender or Chamomile.</li>
            <li>I think it would also be a great gift to give someone.</li>
            <li>lol</li>

            <li>The fragrance is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Amazing Amazing Amazing !!</li>
            <li>It smells so good</li>
            <li>Oh my, what a wonderful feeling this body scrub gives and how light the scent.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>This smells really good and exfoliates quite well for a sugar body scrub.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scrub and found it wonderful from head to toe.</li>
            <li>The rejuvenating effect is good.</li>
            <li>The smell, it is soooo good</li>
            <li>It seems like your getting a good deal for the 18oz jar</li>
            <li>Great smell, works nice, but just as with any exfoliating scrub you MUST moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li>scrub every two days, and it will make your skin feels good.  </li>
            <li>But you have to continue to use every two days to continue having good sofft/  </li>
            <li>it s a good produck</li>
            <li>This comes in a good sized jar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good quality salt or sugar scrub with no luck.</li>
            <li>and I loved the scent</li>
            <li>Nature fragrance, feels good after scrub.</li>
            <li>I really loved this to begin with.</li>
            <li>, I loved the scent of it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so good for the price, but it smells delightful--very relaxing, and exfoliates so well.  </li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>I liked how this product smelled very nice.</li>
            <li>I would say &amp;#34;just another scrub&amp;#34;, but it was nice, feeling good on skin, smelling good but nothing that I would be in love it!</li>
            <li>I have been using this scrub for about a month, and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I liked it using every morning in the shower, and felt good.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SCRUB!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than mango&#x27;s one!</li>
            <li>I love this body scrub!</li>
            <li>I love this scrub!</li>

            <li>love the scent!</li>
            <li>I love how this makes my skin feel and smell!</li>
            <li>This sugar body scrub is a wonderful exfoliate and the smell is absolute heaven!  </li>
            <li>It has a great fragrance that is not too strong, but lingers a bit after showering.</li>
            <li>This brand is an amazing value.  </li>
            <li>This scent is beyond amazing.  </li>
            <li>It also smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I kind of agree.  </li>
            <li>The Lavender &amp; Vanilla scents are nice additions to the product line.</li>
            <li>smells nice since it was not sealed in anyway and is leaked all over box ...</li>
            <li>It arrived before my sister&#x27;s arrival - thrilled at the processing / ship time.</li>
            <li>Smells so nice.</li>
            <li>But when I&#x27;m not making my own scrubs, I use Tree Hut.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but the oils in it do nothing to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li>it has the perfect amount of roughness to really exfoliate the skin well.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a nice scrub.</li>
            <li>The scent was nice too.</li>
            <li>The product quality is great and the variety of scents is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This body scrub has such a pleasant scent and feels so wonderful on my skin.</li>
            <li>texture is good and easily  apply on skin!&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the fragrance is really light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>This product has a very strong scent</li>
            <li>Very easy to handle, applied with just my hands.</li>
            <li>The product makes my skin so soft and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>This product is nice, but you can buy a huge bag of Epsom salt from Walmart for ONE of these!</li>
            <li>and it is wonderful on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I digress, the scent is good and smooth.</li>
            <li>good price for a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;Helps with dry, scaling skin.  </li>
            <li>I love scrubs and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Awesome product that I plan to purchase more into the future.</li>
            <li>pleasure, to be sure.</li>
            <li>The olive oil also feels much better then the shea.  </li>
            <li>I love this body scrub.</li>
            <li>My daughter and my father are stealing from my jars (one on the bathroom sink, one in the shower), so I have to keep ordering more to keep us stocked up.</li>
            <li>Basically, I do prefer tropical scent more than soothing or aromatic smells like this one.</li>
            <li>so I picked this one- because it was the best seller one from same seller.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and texture of this product.  </li>
            <li>After paying up to 3 times as much for popular brands, I&#x27;m delighted to find a comparable product at a sensible price.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub.</li>
            <li>but when you use it  smells alot better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling like a baby&#x27;s bottom:)</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this body scrub.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy more and give it to all of my friends and family.</li>
            <li>This scrub is quite a bit thicker than most scrubs, which I like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a look for more</li>
            <li>When you begin to rub it in and exfoliate,it gets better...</li>
            <li>It smells ok</li>
            <li>I bought it because I love all things lavender, and I wanted to try a chamomile product.</li>
            <li>I am glad I tried this scrub</li>
            <li>and that was my favorite until this one.  </li>
            <li>I immediately ordered more after opening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scrub or butter...</li>
            <li>Love this product and am def buying it again.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub</li>
            <li>I love their scrub but cannot justify $40 for a product like this.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week when I shower, and love how the skin looks and feels immediately after and always.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>You will love it too.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scrub.</li>

            <li>Love how this made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>This is much better than lots of things I tried in my life on my skin.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Now I use it about once a week (all over my body) and it keeps my skin healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love this scrub and will for sure purchase again and again.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub.</li>
            <li>Bought it for body scrub, but use it as facial scrub &amp; is best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I just ordered more.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s lavender, i love how soothing it smells.</li>
            <li>I have tried this body scrub in so many scents--lavender and chamomile is so good for relaxation, so using this in a steamy hot shower, I have found love.</li>
            <li>So totally soothing and the scent is very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s offered at a good price thanks to Amazon!</li>
            <li>My body scrub arrived today and I was so excited to use it!</li>
            <li>Instead of a nice smooth light oil residue, leaves you feeling sticky and unwashed.</li>
            <li>This scrub has a lovely fresh smell and nice texture.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean after use!</li>
            <li>Does a perfect job on my skin the scent is nice, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments after a shower lol Definitely a steel in comparison to some other sugar scrubs.</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t sure if those could ever be improved, but this scrub really does smooth them out!  </li>
            <li>There are many fragrances available, and I have tried all of them.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and my skin is moisturised and skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>Scent is very soothing and good for before bedtime use.</li>
            <li>It also smells good and makes me feel really relaxed using it in the shower.</li>
            <li>When you feel sweaty or dirty from play or work this scrub makes your skin feel absolutely wonderful, so clean and refreshing and gives my skin a glow.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I love this scrub, it smells so good and leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The sugary bits softened my skin just fine.</li>
            <li>It is not as moisturizing as Aveda&#x27;s but considering the difference in price, I am fine with that.</li>
            <li>At the beginning when I smelled it straight from the jar it didn&#x27;t smell too nice, I guess it was too strong</li>
            <li>I did not expect such an elegant and pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>This leaves your skin so smooth and silky feeling.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking to have silky smooth skin, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for my sister&#x27;s visit for her to use and was happy there was plenty left for me to use after her departure.  </li>
            <li>when washed away your skin is as smooth as butter and the scent lingers for hours.</li>
            <li>Needed to look for a cheap body scrub.</li>
            <li>It also smells good and it&#x27;s not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>Immediately after opening, I loved the smell and how it leaves my skin feeling really soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you all will enjoy it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t like sugar scrubs because the sugar isn&#x27;t course enough, but this one is perfect!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, my skin do feel smoother after using it and its price is very reasonable, will order it again.</li>
            <li>I had Mango one at first time and really satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>and I must say I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This new aroma is so fragrant, makes the house smell nice too.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, the lavender and chamomile are super relaxing</li>
            <li>Also when you use it the smell is so relaxing and clean.  </li>
            <li>see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad thing for me is, it get&#x27;s over pretty quickly, or maybe I am applying bit more.</li>
            <li>Amazon shoppers were right!</li>
            <li>After a couple of showers using this scrub, it cleared right up!  </li>
            <li>It also smells amazing and keeps my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>The scent is also the nice and soft without being over bearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many scrubs have too much oil in them and leave you feeling slimy.  </li>
            <li>something sweet- scent in it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin baby soft and soo nice.</li>
            <li>It smells really good, and this scrub actually works.</li>
            <li>This is good enough to give as a gift.</li>
            <li>It felt so good when I was exfoliating my legs prior to shaving....</li>
            <li>Full size body scrub.</li>
            <li>Not bad..........</li>
            <li>The scent is beautiful, a little muskier than I expected, but still great.</li>
            <li>Nothing great happens like other scrubs work...</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on how soft and smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li>It really does scrub--your skin is clean and it must exfolliate!  </li>
            <li>This is such a great way to get rid of dead skin in the winter and smell good after doing it.  </li>
            <li>This scrub is super grainy, which is the whole point of using scrubs--exfoliation!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good quality, the aroma is nice &amp; subtle.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and smooth after using it!</li>
            <li>I love its scent and after using, my skin feels so soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more!</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>However, my skin feels smooth after I use it, as if I applied lotion already, thanks to the shea butter in the body scrub.</li>
            <li>(so does the hubby), but it filled our whole apartment.  </li>
            <li>Not too harsh and it smell great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a body scrub that not only works, but smells nice too.</li>
            <li>The price is definitely worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>(I make my own, actually.)</li>
            <li>After she botched the procedure I had many skin issues, and this helped clear it up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich, creamy, and very exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Baby skin right after the shower</li>
            <li>I love body scrubs in general.</li>
            <li>Iv used this many times different scents , it&#x27;s lovely my skin feels soft</li>
            <li>Feels nice and tingly on my feet after a long day of work.</li>
            <li>I like this product for several reasons: It does a very good job at smoothing out rough spots on feet, elbows, knees...</li>
            <li>They are all equally effective, so the only question you should really be asking yourself is, \\&quot;What scent</li>
            <li>great product and gently remove the dead skin without hurt.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong but it didn&#x27;t seem to bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>How could a scrub cost so little be so good?</li>
            <li>I barely rubbed it on my face and my face turned bright red!</li>
            <li>I absolutely looooove this product!</li>
            <li>My two favorite essential oil scents in a body scrub.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried anything like this.</li>
            <li>I plan to get more in the future once I&#x27;m done with mine.</li>
            <li>I love the way it exfoliates the skin especially when I use exfoliating gloves to spread it all over.</li>
            <li>The two make my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the prices for all Tree Hut products especially since you can get them in packs.</li>
            <li>and I just generally enjoy how soft my skin becomes after using it.</li>
            <li>but it takes more of this product to actually work</li>
            <li>My skin broke out like never before after the first use.</li>
            <li>The scrub makes my skin feel soft even in the shower and silky smooth when out the shower.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll be buying the body butter very soon!</li>
            <li>This leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Did not leave my skin greasy and the scent was soft and light.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I love this coarse stuff that can go for a while.</li>
            <li>Its not very &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;, has a nice smell and is exactly the type of scrub that I have wanted.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I had used a sugar scrub.  </li>
            <li>I did use it on my face once and it worked really well too!  </li>
            <li>The price is great, and the scrub goes a long way which means it will last a long time and be an even better deal.</li>
            <li>I slather the scrub all over my body, scrub a little bit, wash off, and my body feels smooth and sexy.</li>
            <li>It really does make my skin really soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I hate apricots, coconut, and alot of the scents most of these types of products use, but this one was perfect and of course it is what you expect otherwise from an exfoliate.</li>
            <li>It made my body super soft!</li>
            <li>I always enjoy lavender so the scent is nice.. very subtle and sweet.</li>
            <li>it really exfoliates your skin, the little scrubs are a good size so they really get around your skin</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant to purchase it without seeing it in person, but with all the positive reviews I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>When I first tried sugar scrubs the didn&#x27;t sting like the salt ones but they would dissolve too fast.</li>
            <li>I tend to get dry and flaky skin on my legs all summer, so I use this on days that I don&#x27;t shave and it works great and keeps my legs from being dry.  </li>
            <li>I suspect it may take over a year before my skin is tone and defined, but adding this to the arsenal certainly won&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have large pores on my nose and cheeks</li>
            <li>After washing this scrub feel fresh ready for a new day.</li>
            <li>This scrub feel fresh and I ready for a new day.</li>
            <li>The scrub particles are not too coarse nor too fine.</li>
            <li>This scrub is amazing and cheaper than the dead sea scrub I use which s $25.</li>
            <li>The scrub works very well to exfoliate your skin</li>
            <li>Very soothing &amp; relaxing</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really convinced by the reviews.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates gently, and does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month, and there is still plenty of it, and my skin is really improved.</li>
            <li>I really like the lime-coconut ...</li>
            <li>I use it before I shave to make my legs extra smooth and it works out well.</li>
            <li>if you think you really need to try it, you would save three dollars on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li>I really like this body scrub...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>so basically I just need to take  a shower to get the whole apartment to smell like it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I have tried others that have a drier consistency, which makes it difficult to apply, but this one has the perfect balance of solidity that makes it easy to apply without losing half of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to try other fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I always feel extra clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I usually make my own scrubs but wanted to try this product.  </li>
            <li>This particular version (Lavender and Chamomile) has the highest concentration of exfoliating elements.  </li>
            <li>I am considering mixing in some body oil now that I have used a decent amount</li>
            <li>I guess I was convinced that the more expensive something is, the better it</li>
            <li>It works as well as the more expensive body scrubs, at a much better price.</li>
            <li>Its not for those with very sensitive skin as it could hurt!</li>
            <li>I just purchased this scrub a few days ago, I just use it for exfoliating my shoulders and chest and it works well, makes my skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend...</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try something a little cheaper....not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it whenever I need a little pick-me-up.</li>
            <li>Skin soft after use !!</li>
            <li>This one actually seem worth it.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and smooth after and it doesn&#x27;t feel dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for me to find one that strong enough but not so strong to the point of it scratching me.</li>
            <li>I used it last night right before bed</li>
            <li>My dad says his nose has never been this free from blackheads and other ickies since before puberty.</li>
            <li>Also, the scent is really nice and natural which is hard to find in cheaper products.</li>
            <li>The jar seemed small when I first got it (maybe the picture made it seem huge)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and it made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I use it all over my body and my skin is soooo soft after I use it!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The skin is soft and fragrant!</li>
            <li>This makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong.  </li>
            <li>This smells so amazing, its hard to describe!</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel much smoother with the natural ones and your body will thank you later.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft after my shower.</li>
            <li>Their products aren&#x27;t 100% organic (which I look for in beauty products), but they do use some organic and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>FELT SOFT AFTERWARDS, NOT SLIMEY OR OILY</li>
            <li>soft--</li>
            <li>This will make your skin sooooo soft.</li>
            <li>tried a sample of different product but similar thoughts (salt/sugar scrub) &amp; found other produce was a bit better.</li>
            <li>You would be better off going with an all natural scrub and getting a smaller size such as 10oz or 12 oz as it will last as long</li>
            <li>It leaves a very pleasant faint smell after that lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li>It smells like a perfume but not as heavy, and it leaves my hands feeling silky and clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves your body so soft and smooth, it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li>Its rough enough to get the job done but smooth enough not to hurt your skin.</li>
            <li>The sugar scrub is exactly what I need in the winter to get rough skin gone and soften too.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to help soften in my skin a little more in the rough wintertime.</li>
            <li>The only negative is that it arrived with the top not screwed on correctly</li>
            <li>Gentle enough, with enough sugar to exfoliate skin.</li>
            <li>My eleven-year-old daughter uses it daily and loves how soft it makes her feel.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets getting this scrub.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this one as much as I like some of the other scrubs will look for a different product next time</li>
            <li>I like the consistency and smell of the product, but it doesn&#x27;t have that oil I like in a scrub like this to keep me feeling soft and moisturized, it left me dry.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t anything bad, it&#x27;s just that I love my Hawaiian Alba so much</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The smell is really great</li>
            <li> It smells so great, and works so well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s of great quality.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and not overpowering...</li>
            <li> so the deal isn&#x27;t as great as it seems.</li>
            <li> The scrub itself works great, but it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like Lavender or Chamomile.</li>
            <li> I think it would also be a great gift to give someone.</li>
            <li> lol</li>

            <li> Oh my, what a wonderful feeling this body scrub gives and how light the scent.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> This smells really good and exfoliates quite well for a sugar body scrub.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scrub and found it wonderful from head to toe.</li>
            <li> The rejuvenating effect is good.</li>
            <li> The smell, it is soooo good</li>
            <li> It seems like your getting a good deal for the 18oz jar</li>
            <li> Great smell, works nice, but just as with any exfoliating scrub you MUST moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li> scrub every two days, and it will make your skin feels good.  </li>
            <li> But you have to continue to use every two days to continue having good sofft/  </li>
            <li> it s a good produck</li>
            <li> This comes in a good sized jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good quality salt or sugar scrub with no luck.</li>
            <li> and I loved the scent</li>
            <li> Nature fragrance, feels good after scrub.</li>
            <li> I really loved this to begin with.</li>
            <li> , I loved the scent of it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so good for the price, but it smells delightful--very relaxing, and exfoliates so well.  </li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> I liked how this product smelled very nice.</li>
            <li> I would say &amp;#34;just another scrub&amp;#34;, but it was nice, feeling good on skin, smelling good but nothing that I would be in love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this scrub for about a month, and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I liked it using every morning in the shower, and felt good.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SCRUB!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than mango&#x27;s one!</li>
            <li> I love this body scrub!</li>
            <li> I love this scrub!</li>
            <li> I bought the mango scented one and fell in love with it for the quality and the price!</li>
            <li> I love this smell!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the texture of this scrub!</li>

            <li> I just love it !</li>
            <li> love the scent!</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my skin feel and smell!</li>
            <li> This sugar body scrub is a wonderful exfoliate and the smell is absolute heaven!  </li>
            <li> It has a great fragrance that is not too strong, but lingers a bit after showering.</li>
            <li> This brand is an amazing value.  </li>
            <li> This scent is beyond amazing.  </li>
            <li> It also smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I kind of agree.  </li>
            <li> The Lavender &amp; Vanilla scents are nice additions to the product line.</li>
            <li> smells nice since it was not sealed in anyway and is leaked all over box ...</li>
            <li> It arrived before my sister&#x27;s arrival - thrilled at the processing / ship time.</li>
            <li> Smells so nice.</li>
            <li> But when I&#x27;m not making my own scrubs, I use Tree Hut.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but the oils in it do nothing to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> it has the perfect amount of roughness to really exfoliate the skin well.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a nice scrub.</li>
            <li> The scent was nice too.</li>
            <li> The product quality is great and the variety of scents is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This body scrub has such a pleasant scent and feels so wonderful on my skin.</li>
            <li> texture is good and easily  apply on skin!&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the fragrance is really light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> This product has a very strong scent</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle, applied with just my hands.</li>
            <li> The product makes my skin so soft and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product is nice, but you can buy a huge bag of Epsom salt from Walmart for ONE of these!</li>
            <li> and it is wonderful on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I digress, the scent is good and smooth.</li>
            <li> good price for a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;Helps with dry, scaling skin.  </li>
            <li> I love scrubs and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Awesome product that I plan to purchase more into the future.</li>
            <li> pleasure, to be sure.</li>
            <li> The olive oil also feels much better then the shea.  </li>
            <li> I love this body scrub.</li>
            <li> My daughter and my father are stealing from my jars (one on the bathroom sink, one in the shower), so I have to keep ordering more to keep us stocked up.</li>
            <li> Basically, I do prefer tropical scent more than soothing or aromatic smells like this one.</li>
            <li> so I picked this one- because it was the best seller one from same seller.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and texture of this product.  </li>
            <li> After paying up to 3 times as much for popular brands, I&#x27;m delighted to find a comparable product at a sensible price.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.</li>
            <li> but when you use it  smells alot better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling like a baby&#x27;s bottom:)</li>
            <li> lovely.</li>
            <li> so Just ok</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body scrub.</li>
            <li> While I absolutely love Aveda&#x27;s Caribbean Therapy body scrub, it is just too pricy for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body scrub.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy more and give it to all of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> This scrub is quite a bit thicker than most scrubs, which I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a look for more</li>
            <li> When you begin to rub it in and exfoliate,it gets better...</li>
            <li> It smells ok</li>
            <li> I bought it because I love all things lavender, and I wanted to try a chamomile product.</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried this scrub</li>
            <li> and that was my favorite until this one.  </li>
            <li> I immediately ordered more after opening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scrub or butter...</li>
            <li> Love this product and am def buying it again.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub</li>
            <li> I love their scrub but cannot justify $40 for a product like this.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week when I shower, and love how the skin looks and feels immediately after and always.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> You will love it too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scrub.</li>
            <li> Lavender is one of my favorite scents, and I love the scrub.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and texture.</li>
            <li> Love how this made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This is much better than lots of things I tried in my life on my skin.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Now I use it about once a week (all over my body) and it keeps my skin healthy.  </li>
            <li> I love this scrub and will for sure purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.</li>
            <li> Bought it for body scrub, but use it as facial scrub &amp; is best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I just ordered more.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s lavender, i love how soothing it smells.</li>
            <li> I have tried this body scrub in so many scents--lavender and chamomile is so good for relaxation, so using this in a steamy hot shower, I have found love.</li>
            <li> So totally soothing and the scent is very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s offered at a good price thanks to Amazon!</li>
            <li> My body scrub arrived today and I was so excited to use it!</li>
            <li> Instead of a nice smooth light oil residue, leaves you feeling sticky and unwashed.</li>
            <li> This scrub has a lovely fresh smell and nice texture.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean after use!</li>
            <li> Does a perfect job on my skin the scent is nice, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments after a shower lol Definitely a steel in comparison to some other sugar scrubs.</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t sure if those could ever be improved, but this scrub really does smooth them out!  </li>
            <li> There are many fragrances available, and I have tried all of them.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and my skin is moisturised and skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> Scent is very soothing and good for before bedtime use.</li>
            <li> It also smells good and makes me feel really relaxed using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> When you feel sweaty or dirty from play or work this scrub makes your skin feel absolutely wonderful, so clean and refreshing and gives my skin a glow.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I love this scrub, it smells so good and leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The sugary bits softened my skin just fine.</li>
            <li> It is not as moisturizing as Aveda&#x27;s but considering the difference in price, I am fine with that.</li>
            <li> At the beginning when I smelled it straight from the jar it didn&#x27;t smell too nice, I guess it was too strong</li>
            <li> I did not expect such an elegant and pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin so smooth and silky feeling.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking to have silky smooth skin, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my sister&#x27;s visit for her to use and was happy there was plenty left for me to use after her departure.  </li>
            <li> when washed away your skin is as smooth as butter and the scent lingers for hours.</li>
            <li> Needed to look for a cheap body scrub.</li>
            <li> It also smells good and it&#x27;s not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> Immediately after opening, I loved the smell and how it leaves my skin feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you all will enjoy it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t like sugar scrubs because the sugar isn&#x27;t course enough, but this one is perfect!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, my skin do feel smoother after using it and its price is very reasonable, will order it again.</li>
            <li> I had Mango one at first time and really satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> and I must say I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This new aroma is so fragrant, makes the house smell nice too.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, the lavender and chamomile are super relaxing</li>
            <li> Also when you use it the smell is so relaxing and clean.  </li>
            <li> see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad thing for me is, it get&#x27;s over pretty quickly, or maybe I am applying bit more.</li>
            <li> Amazon shoppers were right!</li>
            <li> After a couple of showers using this scrub, it cleared right up!  </li>
            <li> It also smells amazing and keeps my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> The scent is also the nice and soft without being over bearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many scrubs have too much oil in them and leave you feeling slimy.  </li>
            <li> something sweet- scent in it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin baby soft and soo nice.</li>
            <li> It smells really good, and this scrub actually works.</li>
            <li> This is good enough to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> It felt so good when I was exfoliating my legs prior to shaving....</li>
            <li> Full size body scrub.</li>
            <li> Not bad..........</li>
            <li> The scent is beautiful, a little muskier than I expected, but still great.</li>
            <li> Nothing great happens like other scrubs work...</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on how soft and smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li> It really does scrub--your skin is clean and it must exfolliate!  </li>
            <li> This is such a great way to get rid of dead skin in the winter and smell good after doing it.  </li>
            <li> This scrub is super grainy, which is the whole point of using scrubs--exfoliation!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quality, the aroma is nice &amp; subtle.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and smooth after using it!</li>
            <li> I love its scent and after using, my skin feels so soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more!</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> However, my skin feels smooth after I use it, as if I applied lotion already, thanks to the shea butter in the body scrub.</li>
            <li> (so does the hubby), but it filled our whole apartment.  </li>
            <li> Not too harsh and it smell great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a body scrub that not only works, but smells nice too.</li>
            <li> The price is definitely worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> (I make my own, actually.)</li>
            <li> After she botched the procedure I had many skin issues, and this helped clear it up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich, creamy, and very exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Baby skin right after the shower</li>
            <li> I love body scrubs in general.</li>
            <li> Iv used this many times different scents , it&#x27;s lovely my skin feels soft</li>
            <li> Feels nice and tingly on my feet after a long day of work.</li>
            <li> I like this product for several reasons: It does a very good job at smoothing out rough spots on feet, elbows, knees...</li>
            <li> They are all equally effective, so the only question you should really be asking yourself is, \\&quot;What scent</li>
            <li> great product and gently remove the dead skin without hurt.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong but it didn&#x27;t seem to bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> How could a scrub cost so little be so good?</li>
            <li> I barely rubbed it on my face and my face turned bright red!</li>
            <li> I absolutely looooove this product!</li>
            <li> My two favorite essential oil scents in a body scrub.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried anything like this.</li>
            <li> I plan to get more in the future once I&#x27;m done with mine.</li>
            <li> I love the way it exfoliates the skin especially when I use exfoliating gloves to spread it all over.</li>
            <li> The two make my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the prices for all Tree Hut products especially since you can get them in packs.</li>
            <li> and I just generally enjoy how soft my skin becomes after using it.</li>
            <li> but it takes more of this product to actually work</li>
            <li> My skin broke out like never before after the first use.</li>
            <li> The scrub makes my skin feel soft even in the shower and silky smooth when out the shower.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll be buying the body butter very soon!</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Did not leave my skin greasy and the scent was soft and light.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I love this coarse stuff that can go for a while.</li>
            <li> Its not very &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;, has a nice smell and is exactly the type of scrub that I have wanted.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time I had used a sugar scrub.  </li>
            <li> I did use it on my face once and it worked really well too!  </li>
            <li> The price is great, and the scrub goes a long way which means it will last a long time and be an even better deal.</li>
            <li> I slather the scrub all over my body, scrub a little bit, wash off, and my body feels smooth and sexy.</li>
            <li> It really does make my skin really soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I hate apricots, coconut, and alot of the scents most of these types of products use, but this one was perfect and of course it is what you expect otherwise from an exfoliate.</li>
            <li> It made my body super soft!</li>
            <li> I always enjoy lavender so the scent is nice.. very subtle and sweet.</li>
            <li> it really exfoliates your skin, the little scrubs are a good size so they really get around your skin</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to purchase it without seeing it in person, but with all the positive reviews I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> When I first tried sugar scrubs the didn&#x27;t sting like the salt ones but they would dissolve too fast.</li>
            <li> I tend to get dry and flaky skin on my legs all summer, so I use this on days that I don&#x27;t shave and it works great and keeps my legs from being dry.  </li>
            <li> I suspect it may take over a year before my skin is tone and defined, but adding this to the arsenal certainly won&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my nose and cheeks</li>
            <li> After washing this scrub feel fresh ready for a new day.</li>
            <li> This scrub feel fresh and I ready for a new day.</li>
            <li> The scrub particles are not too coarse nor too fine.</li>
            <li> This scrub is amazing and cheaper than the dead sea scrub I use which s $25.</li>
            <li> The scrub works very well to exfoliate your skin</li>
            <li> Very soothing &amp; relaxing</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really convinced by the reviews.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates gently, and does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month, and there is still plenty of it, and my skin is really improved.</li>
            <li> I really like the lime-coconut ...</li>
            <li> I use it before I shave to make my legs extra smooth and it works out well.</li>
            <li> if you think you really need to try it, you would save three dollars on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I really like this body scrub...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> so basically I just need to take  a shower to get the whole apartment to smell like it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have tried others that have a drier consistency, which makes it difficult to apply, but this one has the perfect balance of solidity that makes it easy to apply without losing half of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to try other fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I always feel extra clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I usually make my own scrubs but wanted to try this product.  </li>
            <li> This particular version (Lavender and Chamomile) has the highest concentration of exfoliating elements.  </li>
            <li> I am considering mixing in some body oil now that I have used a decent amount</li>
            <li> I guess I was convinced that the more expensive something is, the better it</li>
            <li> It works as well as the more expensive body scrubs, at a much better price.</li>
            <li> Its not for those with very sensitive skin as it could hurt!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this scrub a few days ago, I just use it for exfoliating my shoulders and chest and it works well, makes my skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend...</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try something a little cheaper....not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it whenever I need a little pick-me-up.</li>
            <li> Skin soft after use !!</li>
            <li> This one actually seem worth it.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and smooth after and it doesn&#x27;t feel dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find one that strong enough but not so strong to the point of it scratching me.</li>
            <li> I used it last night right before bed</li>
            <li> My dad says his nose has never been this free from blackheads and other ickies since before puberty.</li>
            <li> Also, the scent is really nice and natural which is hard to find in cheaper products.</li>
            <li> The jar seemed small when I first got it (maybe the picture made it seem huge)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and it made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I use it all over my body and my skin is soooo soft after I use it!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> The skin is soft and fragrant!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong.  </li>
            <li> This smells so amazing, its hard to describe!</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel much smoother with the natural ones and your body will thank you later.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft after my shower.</li>
            <li> Their products aren&#x27;t 100% organic (which I look for in beauty products), but they do use some organic and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> FELT SOFT AFTERWARDS, NOT SLIMEY OR OILY</li>
            <li> soft--</li>
            <li> This will make your skin sooooo soft.</li>
            <li> tried a sample of different product but similar thoughts (salt/sugar scrub) &amp; found other produce was a bit better.</li>
            <li> You would be better off going with an all natural scrub and getting a smaller size such as 10oz or 12 oz as it will last as long</li>
            <li> It leaves a very pleasant faint smell after that lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li> It smells like a perfume but not as heavy, and it leaves my hands feeling silky and clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves your body so soft and smooth, it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Its rough enough to get the job done but smooth enough not to hurt your skin.</li>
            <li> The sugar scrub is exactly what I need in the winter to get rough skin gone and soften too.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help soften in my skin a little more in the rough wintertime.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it arrived with the top not screwed on correctly</li>
            <li> Gentle enough, with enough sugar to exfoliate skin.</li>
            <li> My eleven-year-old daughter uses it daily and loves how soft it makes her feel.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets getting this scrub.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this one as much as I like some of the other scrubs will look for a different product next time</li>
            <li> I like the consistency and smell of the product, but it doesn&#x27;t have that oil I like in a scrub like this to keep me feeling soft and moisturized, it left me dry.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t anything bad, it&#x27;s just that I love my Hawaiian Alba so much</li>
            <li> I love how thick it is, iv&#x27;e used other body scrubs and they aren&#x27;t as thick and don&#x27;t have much scrubby properties.</li>
            <li> not bad - not great.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and supple after using this scrub and I only used a little.</li>
            <li> To get the benefits, you have to really rub it into your skin for several minutes (at least 5) and then rinse.</li>
            <li> I get really dry skin during winter time and have to switch different types of body washes because none work and lotion just wont do.</li>
            <li> old, so there&#x27;s little I&#x27;ve not sampled.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and after moving up north my dry skin only worsened.</li>
            <li> The body scrub didn&#x27;t take long to ship, and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> It looks like a tiny jar but you only need a little each time you exfoliate.</li>
            <li> It does wonders for my Keratosis Pilaris, (little bumps on the back of my upper arms).  </li>
            <li> I will order again, not only the scent I ordered, but also other scents.</li>
            <li> I use it about every other day to every third day.  </li>
            <li> So I thought body scrub would irritate my dry skin</li>
            <li> THE SMELL IS SOFT AND NOT OVERWHELMING.</li>
            <li> Salt scrubs can be very expensive and the cheap ones can often be gross, this one is neither!  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin all season</li>
            <li> but when the weather gets cold my skin get instantly super dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> but after seeing how thick the consistency was, I realised that it would last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Would try other flavors and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other scrubs where the salts or sugar all sink to the bottom, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to try the other fragrances.</li>
            <li> This and other scents of this brand is a must have.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have used &amp;#34;facial scrub&amp;#34; products in the past, but none has been as gritty as this product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give an opinion on the smell because I have a cold right now and can&#x27;t smell a single thing</li>
            <li> IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A SCRUB TO GET RID OF DEAD SKIN BUT NOT FEEL DRY THEN TRY THIS ONE.  </li>
            <li> Totally try it out, at least if you don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Not worth it, its cheaper in Walmart</li>
            <li> Its a bit rough and seems harsh on the skin</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t like Lavender scent, there&#x27;s slightly sugary-</li>
            <li> My chief complaint is the use of microbeads as recent reports have shown that the plastic is choking lakes as waste is run off into them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a product that will not completely strip moisture out of your skin while exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Warning, close lid tightly or ants may try to get in as it is a sugar scrub.</li>
            <li> I usually have a really hard time finding something that will actually exfoliate and \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; my face ...</li>
            <li> IT FOAMS A LITTLE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not one to give a bad review but this product forced me to do so because it just didn&#x27;t work like some of the all natural scrubs did for me.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week or so , just to exfoliate the body to get rid of the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, the smell does go away after a few minutes, but I like the feel of the sugar and that it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue at all.</li>
            <li> I was planning to purchase another scent, but it was not available when I wanted to order, so settled for the Olive and Shea Sugar.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on your face every day though because it may be too harsh.  </li>
            <li> A little &#x27;dab&#x27; will do ya!</li>
            <li> I follow up with a small application of Nivea Q10 lotion.  </li>
            <li> Usually i have a problem going to sleep</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help with a small percentage of the sale to MPP.</li>
            <li> I have eczema, rosacea, and other skin problems and have found this scrub is IMPROVING my skin rather than irritating it.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to be firming up, ever so slowly, but this skin protocol seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> I hate buying body scrubs that are so gentle</li>
            <li> Its a thick sugar material like a \\&quot;ploppy\\&quot; material lol.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It works like the other expensive version but for the fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to buying scrubs.</li>
            <li> Not great ...</li>
            <li> so I tried a little on my face, BAD IDEA.</li>
            <li> This product was accidentally sent to the wrong address (my fault).</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wrong, wrong, wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> but sadly it doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> I was sad that this happened</li>
            <li> I agree with some other reviews that the oily feel does not stay on all day, but that is because it doesn&#x27;t contain mineral oil which is very bad for your skin.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> The price is not too bad either.</li>
            <li> So ditch the beads, they were annoying anyway, leaving a trail of shame in the bottom of my tub when I drained the water.</li>
            <li> I hate wimpy scrubs that fade away with the water.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When people smell it on me, they say I smell like candy.  I kind of agree.  I was worried about the scents they offer for body scrubs.  I hate apricots, coconut, and alot of the scents most of these types of products use, but this one was perfect and of course it is what you expect otherwise from an exfoliate.</li>
            <li> This product has a very strong scent but I like it.  This leaves your skin so smooth and silky feeling.  I will probably buy this again!</li>
            <li> Warning, close lid tightly or ants may try to get in as it is a sugar scrub. Product leaves skin feeling refreshed and ex-foliated.  Scent is very soothing and good for before bedtime use. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This scrub is the living end!! It smells so good you don&#x27;t want to stop exfoliating your skin. This is a money saver too. A little &#x27;dab&#x27; will do ya! Great product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely looooove this product! I&#x27;ve used sugar scrubs before but this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever tried. I use it all over my body and my skin is soooo soft after I use it! I even use it on my face and I swear my face glows!! It gets rid of everything on your face - I usually have a really hard time finding something that will actually exfoliate and \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; my face ... I will never use another product on my face. It looks like a tiny jar but you only need a little each time you exfoliate. The smell is pleasant and relaxing.</li>
            <li> My two favorite essential oil scents in a body scrub.  Awesome product that I plan to purchase more into the future.</li>
            <li> Oh my, what a wonderful feeling this body scrub gives and how light the scent.&lt;br /&gt;A pleasure, to be sure.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried the mango and cocunut lime versions from Tree Hut.  This particular version (Lavender and Chamomile) has the highest concentration of exfoliating elements.  The olive oil also feels much better then the shea.  The scent is also the nice and soft without being over bearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using exfoliating scrub, with a loofah bar,  2-3 times a weeks for 2 months now.  I follow up with a small application of Nivea Q10 lotion.  My skin seems to be firming up, ever so slowly, but this skin protocol seems to be working.  I&#x27;ve also lost some weight, which also helps.  I suspect it may take over a year before my skin is tone and defined, but adding this to the arsenal certainly won&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> TreeHut body scrub products are a great value.  The product quality is great and the variety of scents is pretty good.  Many scrubs have too much oil in them and leave you feeling slimy.  Others are grossly overpriced.  TreeHut is the perfect blend of price and quality.  The Lavender &amp; Vanilla scents are nice additions to the product line.</li>
            <li> I love this body scrub. My daughter and my father are stealing from my jars (one on the bathroom sink, one in the shower), so I have to keep ordering more to keep us stocked up. My dad says his nose has never been this free from blackheads and other ickies since before puberty. My eleven-year-old daughter uses it daily and loves how soft it makes her feel. I have eczema, rosacea, and other skin problems and have found this scrub is IMPROVING my skin rather than irritating it. The scent is beautiful, a little muskier than I expected, but still great. I LOVE THIS SCRUB! The [[ASIN:B005VOGAB8 Tree Hut Olive &amp; Shea Moisturizing Shower Wash - Lavender &amp; Chamomile: 16 OZ]] and [[ASIN:B005TI2AII Tree Hut Body Butter, Lavender and Chamomile, 7 Ounce]] are also divine!</li>
            <li> Basically, I do prefer tropical scent more than soothing or aromatic smells like this one. I had Mango one at first time and really satisfied with it. It smells amazing and very easy to use. But I wanted to try another scent so I picked this one- because it was the best seller one from same seller. And guess what? It&#x27;s way better than mango&#x27;s one! Although I don&#x27;t like Lavender scent, there&#x27;s slightly sugary- something sweet- scent in it. I would recommend this one to anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a body scrub that not only works, but smells nice too. When I read the reviews about this one, I decided to give it a try and I must say I was not disappointed. It leaves your body so soft and smooth, it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and texture of this product.  The price is definitely worth the purchase.  And my skin is feeling great after using this scrub in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have tried this body scrub in so many scents--lavender and chamomile is so good for relaxation, so using this in a steamy hot shower, I have found love.</li>
            <li> I would say &amp;#34;just another scrub&amp;#34;, but it was nice, feeling good on skin, smelling good but nothing that I would be in love it!</li>
            <li> This smells really good and exfoliates quite well for a sugar body scrub. The price is not too bad either.</li>
            <li> I love this body scrub! I have tried others that have a drier consistency, which makes it difficult to apply, but this one has the perfect balance of solidity that makes it easy to apply without losing half of it. I have eczema on my arms and it helps a lot, I never realized an exfoliate would work so well because I assumed it would make my skin drier. However, my skin feels smooth after I use it, as if I applied lotion already, thanks to the shea butter in the body scrub.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scrub and found it wonderful from head to toe. The smell is pretty strong but it didn&#x27;t seem to bother my sensitive skin. My chief complaint is the use of microbeads as recent reports have shown that the plastic is choking lakes as waste is run off into them. So ditch the beads, they were annoying anyway, leaving a trail of shame in the bottom of my tub when I drained the water. The sugary bits softened my skin just fine.</li>
            <li> The rejuvenating effect is good. This is the first time I tried anything like this. The sugary pebbles gave the scratching effect initially, however got used to it. I liked it using every morning in the shower, and felt good. Would try other flavors and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad thing for me is, it get&#x27;s over pretty quickly, or maybe I am applying bit more.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the smell of lavender &amp; chamomile. This scrub is a great exfoliant without being over-drying. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it is problably the best scrub I have ever used. The smell, it is soooo good I can&#x27;t wait to get another one. It leaves my skin baby soft and soo nice. Will defenetely keep buying! A must have!!</li>
            <li> I got this so I could exfoliate my skin where I have Keratosis Pilaris, but I often use it all over my body. It doesn&#x27;t clog the drain like some sugar scrubs do. The fragrance is pleasant and not overpowering. It moisturizes your skin but doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like some scrubs do. I have been using the scrub for over a month and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. I&#x27;m sure you all will enjoy it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Salt scrubs can be very expensive and the cheap ones can often be gross, this one is neither!  It&#x27;s a great price for an excellent product!</li>
            <li> This body scrub has such a pleasant scent and feels so wonderful on my skin. After paying up to 3 times as much for popular brands, I&#x27;m delighted to find a comparable product at a sensible price.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub. It feels and smells great. Leaves my skin soft after my shower. I only wish I smelled like this all day!</li>
            <li> My feet have never been smoother.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub! It works like the other expensive version but for the fraction of the price! I like the smell too, I use this two times a week..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, my skin do feel smoother after using it and its price is very reasonable, will order it again.</li>
            <li> This product was accidentally sent to the wrong address (my fault). I requested a reshipment and it arrived promptly. The product makes my skin so soft and it smells wonderful. It&#x27;s perfect for exfoliation. I use it before self tanning. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to purchase it without seeing it in person, but with all the positive reviews I decided to give it a shot. I have no regrets getting this scrub. I plan to get more in the future once I&#x27;m done with mine. I use this once a week or so , just to exfoliate the body to get rid of the dead skin. After using it my skin does feel alot smoother and softer, but I can&#x27;t tell if there was a glow or not. It also smells good and makes me feel really relaxed using it in the shower. At the beginning when I smelled it straight from the jar it didn&#x27;t smell too nice, I guess it was too strong but when you use it  smells alot better. The scent stays on you for awhile after the shower. The scrub contains all sugar, shea, and some exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so I cant use salt scrubs. When I first tried sugar scrubs the didn&#x27;t sting like the salt ones but they would dissolve too fast. I found this one at my nearby Ulta Store. I bought the mango scented one and fell in love with it for the quality and the price! I bought this one for a friend of mine and she is hooked now too. Totally try it out, at least if you don&#x27;t like it it isn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this smell! It smells like a perfume but not as heavy, and it leaves my hands feeling silky and clean. Yes, the smell does go away after a few minutes, but I like the feel of the sugar and that it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this scrub for about a month, and I am very pleased. The price is great, and the scrub goes a long way which means it will last a long time and be an even better deal. It smells really good, and this scrub actually works. I hate buying body scrubs that are so gentle I can&#x27;t even tell they&#x27;re doing anything. This scrub definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I use it at night after the gym and before bed to relax. the only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I wish the product had a scoooper so that I didn&#x27;t have to use my hands.</li>
            <li> I love it! Definitely buying it again! It also smells good and it&#x27;s not harsh at all. It leaves your skin feeling like a baby&#x27;s bottom:)</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the texture of this scrub! It is works perfectly while moisturizing the skin. My skin feels very soft and smooth after using it!</li>
            <li> smells nice since it was not sealed in anyway and is leaked all over box ...what a waste.&lt;br /&gt;they need to step it up</li>
            <li> the scene and texture of the lavender and chamomile scrub makes me feel like i&#x27;m having a spa vacation at home and leaves my skin glowing and moisturized. lovely.</li>
            <li> This product is nice, but you can buy a huge bag of Epsom salt from Walmart for ONE of these!</li>
            <li> I love its scent and after using, my skin feels so soft and moisturized! The scrub particles are not too coarse nor too fine. I will definitely purchase more!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try something a little cheaper....not my favorite. It isn&#x27;t anything bad, it&#x27;s just that I love my Hawaiian Alba so much and this just isn&#x27;t close...so Just ok</li>
            <li> I have made this a staple of mine. I absolutely love this body scrub. I get so many compliments on how soft and smooth my skin is. If you are looking to have silky smooth skin, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift and it is wonderful on my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s hard to find a product that will not completely strip moisture out of your skin while exfoliating. The scent is lovely, too!</li>
            <li> While I absolutely love Aveda&#x27;s Caribbean Therapy body scrub, it is just too pricy for me. This is a great alternative. It is not as moisturizing as Aveda&#x27;s but considering the difference in price, I am fine with that. Also, the scent is really nice and natural which is hard to find in cheaper products. I am considering mixing in some body oil now that I have used a decent amount and there is room in the jar.Hopefully this will help me skip the additional step of applying a moisturizer after I shower.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I purchased it for my sister&#x27;s visit for her to use and was happy there was plenty left for me to use after her departure.  It arrived before my sister&#x27;s arrival - thrilled at the processing / ship time. I recommend and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Instead of a nice smooth light oil residue, leaves you feeling sticky and unwashed. Don&#x27;t recommend this manufacturer or product.</li>
            <li> The feeling of smoothness and cleanliness I feel after using this product is unrivaled. The fragrance is wonderful as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I used a salt scrub before that they don&#x27;t make anymore and I was looking for something to replace it with.  Normally I don&#x27;t like sugar scrubs because the sugar isn&#x27;t course enough, but this one is perfect! The oils are thicker as well, so the sugar to oil ratio is the same each time you use it.  I&#x27;ve used other scrubs where the salts or sugar all sink to the bottom, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that.  It also smells amazing and keeps my skin soft.  I tend to get dry and flaky skin on my legs all summer, so I use this on days that I don&#x27;t shave and it works great and keeps my legs from being dry.  I agree with some other reviews that the oily feel does not stay on all day, but that is because it doesn&#x27;t contain mineral oil which is very bad for your skin.  It also doesn&#x27;t stick to the bathtub so you won&#x27;t slip when using this in a shower.</li>
            <li> I just love it !&lt;br /&gt;The texture is good and easily  apply on skin!&lt;br /&gt;That is a best thing I brought!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and after moving up north my dry skin only worsened. I started using this body scrub and it has already improved my skin.</li>
            <li> I liked how this product smelled very nice. The sugar scrub is exactly what I need in the winter to get rough skin gone and soften too.</li>
            <li> I like the scrub but did not like the scent.  The scrub works very well to exfoliate your skin but my dislike was the scent.  I would buy the scrub again just not in this scent.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body scrub.  I purchase this from King Soopers (Kroger) locally because it costs under $7 to buy it in the store.  It does wonders for my Keratosis Pilaris, (little bumps on the back of my upper arms).  I honestly wasn&#x27;t sure if those could ever be improved, but this scrub really does smooth them out!  I also use it on my d&amp;eacute;colletage to smooth-out skin there.  There are many fragrances available, and I have tried all of them.  They are all equally effective, so the only question you should really be asking yourself is, \\&quot;What scent do I want?\\&quot;  It really is a wonderful product!  If you are looking for a great body scrub, this is the one to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is meant to be informative of the product I have personally tried, and is not reflective of the seller distributing this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin all season but when the weather gets cold my skin get instantly super dry and itchy. So I thought body scrub would irritate my dry skin but it was opposite. I have tried many products and some were ridiculously expensive so I had to find affordable ones that works. I read very good reviews on this product so I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. Amazon shoppers were right! This body scrub is the best!!! It smells great and my skin is moisturised and skin feels so soft. I&#x27;m going to buy more and give it to all of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> This scrub is quite a bit thicker than most scrubs, which I like. It leaves a very pleasant faint smell after that lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Great body scrub. The smell is really great and it made my skin very soft. I will continue to buy this</li>
            <li> Been using Tree Hut for years. I love the way it exfoliates the skin especially when I use exfoliating gloves to spread it all over. The two make my skin feel so soft and smooth. Smells so nice.</li>
            <li> The body scrub didn&#x27;t take long to ship, and was packaged well. It smells so great, and works so well. It made my body super soft!</li>
            <li> Very soothing &amp; relaxing</li>
            <li> The scrub smells just like the body butter and it&#x27;s of great quality. It reminds me of the sugar scrubs from body shop and bath and body works. I love the prices for all Tree Hut products especially since you can get them in packs. My skin felt soft and supple after using this scrub and I only used a little. The jar seemed small when I first got it (maybe the picture made it seem huge) but after seeing how thick the consistency was, I realised that it would last me a long time. The smell is great and not overpowering...just what I want to relax</li>
            <li> I used this in the shower the night i got it and it helped me sleep so well.  Usually i have a problem going to sleep and this stuff helped me with relaxing. I&#x27;m a look for more</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really convinced by the reviews. How could a scrub cost so little be so good? I guess I was convinced that the more expensive something is, the better it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong, wrong, wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrub is very, very good. To get the benefits, you have to really rub it into your skin for several minutes (at least 5) and then rinse. And the fragrance is really light and pleasant. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This scrub is the best ever.I love scrubs and this is by far the best.Its a bit rough and seems harsh on the skin but that&#x27;s just initially.When you begin to rub it in and exfoliate,it gets better...when washed away your skin is as smooth as butter and the scent lingers for hours.I&#x27;ve yet to try the other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help soften in my skin a little more in the rough wintertime. It&#x27;s definitely done the job! It smells fantastic, the lavender and chamomile are super relaxing and I just generally enjoy how soft my skin becomes after using it.</li>
            <li> It seems like your getting a good deal for the 18oz jar but it takes more of this product to actually work so the deal isn&#x27;t as great as it seems. It smells ok but that&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;m usually not one to give a bad review but this product forced me to do so because it just didn&#x27;t work like some of the all natural scrubs did for me. You would be better off going with an all natural scrub and getting a smaller size such as 10oz or 12 oz as it will last as long if not longer than this one. Your skin will feel much smoother with the natural ones and your body will thank you later.</li>
            <li> not bad - not great.  tried a sample of different product but similar thoughts (salt/sugar scrub) &amp; found other produce was a bit better.</li>
            <li> This scrub has a lovely fresh smell and nice texture. It exfoliates gently, and does not irritate skin. I have been using it for a month, and there is still plenty of it, and my skin is really improved.</li>
            <li> After reading a the postive reviews, I decided to give this sugar scrub a try. Immediately after opening, I loved the smell and how it leaves my skin feeling really soft. I will definitely purchase again!!!</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift for a friend and they like it a lot.  They said it was a great scrub and smelled awesome as well.</li>
            <li> I usually make my own scrubs but wanted to try this product.  It&#x27;s a good quality, the aroma is nice &amp; subtle.  The only negative is that it arrived with the top not screwed on correctly so oils seeped out into the box - additionally, it wasn&#x27;t wrapped up/secured in anyway - just in the box with box fillers.</li>
            <li> I love body scrubs in general. (I make my own, actually.) But when I&#x27;m not making my own scrubs, I use Tree Hut. Their products aren&#x27;t 100% organic (which I look for in beauty products), but they do use some organic and natural ingredients. This stuff smells GREAT!! I bought it because I love all things lavender, and I wanted to try a chamomile product. This scrub is super grainy, which is the whole point of using scrubs--exfoliation!! I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I like this product for several reasons: It does a very good job at smoothing out rough spots on feet, elbows, knees...It has a great fragrance that is not too strong, but lingers a bit after showering. It&#x27;s offered at a good price thanks to Amazon!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to buying scrubs. It&#x27;s hard for me to find one that strong enough but not so strong to the point of it scratching me. This scrub is amazing and cheaper than the dead sea scrub I use which s $25. I am glad I tried this scrub and I&#x27;ve already order some for my friends.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this scrub a few days ago, I just use it for exfoliating my shoulders and chest and it works well, makes my skin feel very smooth. I have large pores on my nose and cheeks so I tried a little on my face, BAD IDEA. I barely rubbed it on my face and my face turned bright red!</li>
            <li> Great smell, works nice, but just as with any exfoliating scrub you MUST moisturize afterwards. I had to use this after I let my girlfriend talk me into letting her wax my back. After she botched the procedure I had many skin issues, and this helped clear it up.</li>
            <li> The scrub itself works great, but it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like Lavender or Chamomile. The scent reminds me of a men&#x27;s product. Needless to say, my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> This brand is an amazing value.  The quality of all products is the same as those that are vastly more expensive.  And, their products are consistently excellent.  The only issue some might have is the different scents.  I really like the lime-coconut ...and that was my favorite until this one.  Wow!  This scent is beyond amazing.  I immediately ordered more after opening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scrub or butter...this is the best value I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> This is such a great way to get rid of dead skin in the winter and smell good after doing it.  Love this product and am def buying it again.</li>
            <li> scrub every two days, and it will make your skin feels good.  But you have to continue to use every two days to continue having good sofft/  U will not regret it. it s a good produck</li>
            <li> great product and gently remove the dead skin without hurt. love the scent!</li>
            <li> Often body scrubs now a days have to be $10-$15 + for it to be &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;. I was looking for an alternative. I usually don&#x27;t buy bath products online without using them first in case of hating the texture or scent, but I tried this anyway. It is really nice! I always enjoy lavender so the scent is nice.. very subtle and sweet. I use it before I shave to make my legs extra smooth and it works out well. I will be buying this again. Plus the tub seems to be never ending!</li>
            <li> I did not expect such an elegant and pleasant smell. After washing this scrub feel fresh ready for a new day. The skin is soft and fragrant! This scrub feel fresh and I ready for a new day.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone!!! When you feel sweaty or dirty from play or work this scrub makes your skin feel absolutely wonderful, so clean and refreshing and gives my skin a glow.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Does a perfect job on my skin the scent is nice, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments after a shower lol Definitely a steel in comparison to some other sugar scrubs. This one actually seem worth it. I think it would also be a great gift to give someone.</li>
            <li> This and other scents of this brand is a must have.  So totally soothing and the scent is very pleasant.  I was planning to purchase another scent, but it was not available when I wanted to order, so settled for the Olive and Shea Sugar.  I will order again, not only the scent I ordered, but also other scents.</li>
            <li> This smells so amazing, its hard to describe! It feels so good and the aroma is wonderful. I love how this makes my skin feel and smell!</li>
            <li> IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A SCRUB TO GET RID OF DEAD SKIN BUT NOT FEEL DRY THEN TRY THIS ONE.  IT FOAMS A LITTLE SO ITS CLEANING ALSO BESIDES SCRUBBING AND MY SKIN FELT SOFT AFTERWARDS, NOT SLIMEY OR OILY BUT LIKE I FEEL WHEN I PUT MOISTURIZER ON MY BODY.  THE SMELL IS SOFT AND NOT OVERWHELMING.</li>
            <li> This scrub is wonderful. It isn&#x27;t liquid-y like your regular body moisturizing scrub. Its a thick sugar material like a \\&quot;ploppy\\&quot; material lol.&lt;br /&gt;But its wonderful on your skin. Its rough enough to get the job done but smooth enough not to hurt your skin.</li>
            <li> Not great ... Not bad..........I used it all.. It simply cleanses the skin.. Nothing great happens like other scrubs work...</li>
            <li> I love this scrub, it smells so good and leaves my skin soft and smooth.  I will  definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out like never before after the first use. Not worth it, its cheaper in Walmart if you think you really need to try it, you would save three dollars on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> This body scrub works well, smells heavenly, and leaves my skin feeling soft-- but not greasy like some body scrubs do. I love this product and use it whenever I need a little pick-me-up.</li>
            <li> This sugar body scrub is a wonderful exfoliate and the smell is absolute heaven!  Does not irritate and just leaves my skin glowing.  .</li>
            <li> This will make your skin sooooo soft. It also lasts  along time. This is good enough to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> This comes in a good sized jar. It works as well as the more expensive body scrubs, at a much better price.</li>
            <li> My body scrub arrived today and I was so excited to use it! I couldn&#x27;t wait to take a shower lol I love how thick it is, iv&#x27;e used other body scrubs and they aren&#x27;t as thick and don&#x27;t have much scrubby properties. I get really dry skin during winter time and have to switch different types of body washes because none work and lotion just wont do. So I figured i&#x27;d try a body scrub to exfoliate and moisturize.I can&#x27;t give an opinion on the smell because I have a cold right now and can&#x27;t smell a single thing so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5. The scrub makes my skin feel soft even in the shower and silky smooth when out the shower. I love this scrub i&#x27;ll be buying the body butter very soon! Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good quality salt or sugar scrub with no luck. In all honesty I&#x27;m trying to find a substitute for the overpriced Arbonne salt scrub. I love their scrub but cannot justify $40 for a product like this. I decided to give Tree Hut Body Scrub a try but sadly it doesn&#x27;t do it for me. It smells nice but the oils in it do nothing to moisturize my skin. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I only opened the jar yesterday!&lt;br /&gt;Smells great! feels great! Skin soft after use !! Amazing Amazing Amazing !! Baby skin right after the shower</li>
            <li> This new aroma is so fragrant, makes the house smell nice too. Price has increased though, especially when you can find items locally.</li>
            <li> I really like this body scrub...it has the perfect amount of roughness to really exfoliate the skin well.  It comes in different scents but I like this scent the best.  Highly recommend...I keep buying them!</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week when I shower, and love how the skin looks and feels immediately after and always.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful body scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Very good price for a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;Helps with dry, scaling skin.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong.  I used it last night right before bed and I loved the scent (so does the hubby), but it filled our whole apartment.  I got it becuase my husband loves the Bath and Body works candel of the Lacender and Chamomile, so basically I just need to take  a shower to get the whole apartment to smell like it.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I purchased and I love it.  You will love it too.This leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scrub. Gentle enough, with enough sugar to exfoliate skin. Not too harsh and it smell great. Try to avoid getting water in the jar.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft! It also smells really good! It&#x27;s a great product! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Lavender is one of my favorite scents, and I love the scrub. It&#x27;s exfoliating without being too abrasive. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Love the scent and texture. This is a great product to use as an exfoliator before shaving or tanning. I don&#x27;t think this product contains micro-beads (plastic particles which harm sea life).</li>
            <li> Love how this made my skin feel. Did not leave my skin greasy and the scent was soft and light.</li>
            <li> This is much better than lots of things I tried in my life on my skin. Nature fragrance, feels good after scrub. I&#x27;d love to try other fragrance. Thank you for the great product. I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help with a small percentage of the sale to MPP. I have not seen any credited activity and I hope I do. I digress, the scent is good and smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use before getting airbrush tanned.  I LOVE it!!  It really does make my skin really soft and smooth.  I&#x27;ve had these tiny bumps on my arms for awhile now and just thought I was doomed to always have them.  After a couple of showers using this scrub, it cleared right up!  Now I use it about once a week (all over my body) and it keeps my skin healthy.  I wish I would have found this product years ago!</li>
            <li> As a self confessed beauty product addict, I have to say that this is one of the best scrubs I have ever used. It&#x27;s rich, creamy, and very exfoliating. It felt so good when I was exfoliating my legs prior to shaving....I love this scrub and will for sure purchase again and again. Not to mention the amazing scent!</li>
            <li> I really loved this to begin with. However, there is not enough oil to protect the sugar should water happen to get into the container, and the sugar will disolve. I was sad that this happened, I loved the scent of it. But once the sugar disolved it was obviously usless.</li>
            <li> I hate wimpy scrubs that fade away with the water. That&#x27;s why I love this coarse stuff that can go for a while. It also smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so good for the price, but it smells delightful--very relaxing, and exfoliates so well.  I&#x27;m guessing the olive oil in the product leaves your skin feeling moisturized after the scrub.  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency and smell of the product, but it doesn&#x27;t have that oil I like in a scrub like this to keep me feeling soft and moisturized, it left me dry.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a nice scrub.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try the brand out before buying for a christmas gift. Loved it. The smell is great and my skin always feels really good afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have used &amp;#34;facial scrub&amp;#34; products in the past, but none has been as gritty as this product.  It really does scrub--your skin is clean and it must exfolliate!  Its not very &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;, has a nice smell and is exactly the type of scrub that I have wanted.  If you are looking for a product that scrubs your skin deeply, this one should do the trick.  One caveat:  Its not for those with very sensitive skin as it could hurt!</li>
            <li> I love this scrub. Bought it for body scrub, but use it as facial scrub &amp; is best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m 61 yrs. old, so there&#x27;s little I&#x27;ve not sampled. I just ordered more. Try this!!!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I had used a sugar scrub.  I wanted it to exfoliate my arms, legs, and chest.  It works perfectly.  My skin is so soft and smooth after and it doesn&#x27;t feel dry.  I use it about every other day to every third day.  Also when you use it the smell is so relaxing and clean.  I did use it on my face once and it worked really well too!  My skin felt great!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on your face every day though because it may be too harsh.  I hope you give it a try, plus the price is great!</li>
            <li> Feels nice and tingly on my feet after a long day of work. Smells amazing! I love the scent. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Needed to look for a cheap body scrub. Found Tree Hut brand and it works great. I slather the scrub all over my body, scrub a little bit, wash off, and my body feels smooth and sexy.</li>
            <li> It smells great, it feels great! My skin feels so clean after use! Plus it&#x27;s lavender, i love how soothing it smells.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this one as much as I like some of the other scrubs will look for a different product next time</li>
            <li> Iv used this many times different scents , it&#x27;s lovely my skin feels soft and I always feel extra clean after using it. I would recommend it! Great price too!</li>
            <li> Full size body scrub. Very easy to handle, applied with just my hands. Made my skin feel very smooth and soft. The scent was nice too. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> smells great. it really exfoliates your skin, the little scrubs are a good size so they really get around your skin</li>
