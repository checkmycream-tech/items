            <li>Met expectations, the quanity at the cost was outstanding compared to not being able to find it locally; I would recommend to others....</li>

            <li>Your hair is healthy &amp; shiny and completely natural-looking.</li>
            <li>In fact, the infected area rose similarly in fashion to a \\&quot;welt.\\&quot;  While my beard \\&quot;masked\\</li>
            <li>and ever since day one i loved how dark and shiny it was.</li>
            <li>if you suffer from greyimoisiosis of the hair ,this is the perfect remedy for you for it does not deal with the symptoms but cures the problem and leaves your hair looking beautifully soft ,fluffy, looking coolblack ,soft and beauty.it also easy to apply nothing complicated.simply simple and the best at least for meand you</li>
            <li>The color starts coloring your hair very fast  </li>
            <li>it is reasonably priced and it&#x27;s super easy to use  and most importantly it&#x27;s not causing irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li>Do your research first and don&#x27;t end up like me.</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite hair dye and it is the only one I use now  </li>
            <li>The hair dye was exactly what I thought it would be package was delivered on time</li>
            <li>I am sure I will shop with you in the future.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my parents back in india after getting good reviews from a friend in the middle east.</li>
            <li>The product worked as advertised nonetheless and performed very well.</li>
            <li>( Thanks )</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This product let you control how much powder you use each time.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for me</li>
            <li>I advise most people to stay away from it due to that fact.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it                  </li>
            <li>Like the color and seem more natural that the other product in the marlet.</li>
            <li>No complaint.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if someone could come up with the same idea - but you wouldn&#x27;t have fear of it running down your face if you get caught in some rain or during your workout.</li>
            <li>I have a short cut hair style and my hair grows very fast.</li>
            <li>it is gentle on and does not dry out or damage your hair   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and Bigen Oriental Black is the most rich, deep black that lasts &amp; lasts.</li>
            <li>It fades a little bit the next day so the color looks more natural.</li>
            <li>The extreme discomfort combined with tremendous swelling to my neck led to an experience most commonly descried as hell.  </li>
            <li>at least I can say that Bigen Power Hair is better than that in terms of effectiveness, quality and cost</li>
            <li>It does not dye your skin unless you leave it unusually long (such as more than half hour etc.)  </li>
            <li>I have used many dyes to keep my naturally dark hair dark and none compare.</li>
            <li>IT IS THE ONLY ONE I USE FOR MY NATURAL HAIR!</li>

            <li> IT IS THE ONLY ONE I USE FOR MY NATURAL HAIR!</li>
            <li> The black looks very natural, doesn&#x27;t look blue</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that gets my african american natural hair as black as I would like it.</li>
            <li> Just last a little beat less time but it worth it.</li>
            <li> I recently used Bigen to, both, mask grey beard hairs as well as give an enhanced look to my overall beard.  </li>
            <li> Bigen powder is gentler than Just For Men, but the dye does not last long before the gray appears again.</li>
            <li> Long story short, DO NOT USE.</li>
            <li> Since moving to new area the products I use are not available.  </li>
            <li> However, after my 3rd use, I encountered an extreme skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t break your hair out and lasts a very long tme.  </li>
            <li> All others make my hair dry and crispy.</li>
            <li> This is the only black haircolor I will use.  </li>
            <li> I used the blue black</li>
            <li> my co worker suggested i tried this only if i really wanted black hair because it was going to be very hard to take the black out.</li>
            <li> it has been  almost 2 months and my color is still dark and shiny.</li>
            <li> Dyes always fade on me no matter how dark they are so</li>
            <li> To complex the issue, my face began showing signs of blistering, and, in fact, even open sores.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very dry after coloring,but it was very black</li>
            <li> but it was a hassle and ever since i decided to go to black hair</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m trying this oriental black because I want it even darker.</li>
            <li> I have used Bigen for a few years now..</li>
            <li> Wished it lasted a little longer but compared for the other stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past, BINGO!</li>
            <li> I usually need to use this product 2 or  3 times a week.</li>
            <li> it was hard.</li>
            <li> and it seems this is a common reaction</li>
            <li> , it was uncomfortable, extremely irritable, and somewhat embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> i am tired of dying my hair over and over.</li>
            <li> I had a bad allergic reaction and then I did research on the web</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did a skin test, like the instructions had said to. Got a severe skin rash. I tried to return the product 2 times and they never replied to me about returning the product. (Note: I had bought 6 ) Do not buy this product !</li>
            <li> Best hair color powder in the market. Even men like me need their hair to be colored.</li>
            <li> Great, outstanding good price! I&#x27;d buy again!</li>
            <li> Does a supper job of coloring hair.It does not smell or burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to henna, they actually use a chemical in this product that prolongs the level of dye used. I advise most people to stay away from it due to that fact. Do your research first and don&#x27;t end up like me. The product worked as advertised nonetheless and performed very well.</li>
            <li> This is the simplest hair coloring product ever.  No funky smells.  Just do not get it on your fingernails because you can&#x27;t remove it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS HAIR DYE IT IS THE ONLY ONE I USE FOR MY NATURAL HAIR!</li>
            <li> Like the color and seem more natural that the other product in the marlet. My hair shine more.  Just last a little beat less time but it worth it.</li>
            <li> I started using Bigen almost 2 years ago. My hairstylist now colors her  hair with Bigen. Totally colors the hair, comes in assorted colors, uses no peroxide and my hair is growing! I recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I used Just for Men before. at least I can say that Bigen Power Hair is better than that in terms of effectiveness, quality and cost</li>
            <li> Met expectations, the quanity at the cost was outstanding compared to not being able to find it locally; I would recommend to others....</li>
            <li> worked as expected and would buy again would definitely recommend to my friends this a great product and a good seller</li>

            <li> This has become my favorite hair dye and it is the only one I use now  the thing I love the most is it is water activated thats all you need   when you mix the powder use warm water it&#x27;s faster it is creamy like   hair conditioner. The color starts coloring your hair very fast  it is gentle on and does not dry out or damage your hair   It gives excellent results the color never fades it&#x27;s premanent  I have used Bigen for a few years now..I highly reccomend it                  ( Thanks )</li>

            <li> Since moving to new area the products I use are not available.  I love being able obtain what I need through Amazon. Great Products!!! Great Service!!!!!</li>
            <li> Using this product for more than 2 years. No complaint.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, but will stain your pillow.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if someone could come up with the same idea - but you wouldn&#x27;t have fear of it running down your face if you get caught in some rain or during your workout. Otherwise, it is an instant &#x27;fix&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. It is the only thing that gets my african american natural hair as black as I would like it.</li>
            <li> I love this haircolor.  I have been using it for years!  The black looks very natural, doesn&#x27;t look blue, you just add water and mix and the color lasts.  This is the only black haircolor I will use.  It doesn&#x27;t burn your scalp at all :)</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Wished it lasted a little longer but compared for the other stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past, BINGO!</li>
            <li> Excellent service and great product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The hair dye was exactly what I thought it would be package was delivered on time</li>
            <li> I have a short cut hair style and my hair grows very fast. I usually need to use this product 2 or  3 times a week. This product let you control how much powder you use each time.  It fades a little bit the next day so the color looks more natural. It does not dye your skin unless you leave it unusually long (such as more than half hour etc.)  I switched to this from another very popular brand and very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works great as a temporary color. I&#x27;ve used it for many year and Amazon gave me a great price for a bundle.</li>
            <li> the best and closest product to natural. i like it</li>
            <li> Amazing hair color! I have used many dyes to keep my naturally dark hair dark and none compare. All others make my hair dry and crispy. Not Bigen, because it does not need chemicals added to work!</li>
            <li> Works great to cover up my grey hair</li>
            <li> Works very well for me</li>
            <li> enjoyed the price the quality.&lt;br /&gt;How quick this order got to me&lt;br /&gt;and I would order again from&lt;br /&gt;this company .</li>
            <li> I believe this is the best hair color out there for covering gray; I&#x27;ve tried several products and love this one best.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fade and easy to use. I used the blue black but now I&#x27;m trying this oriental black because I want it even darker. Dyes always fade on me no matter how dark they are so this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I had a bad allergic reaction and then I did research on the web and it seems this is a common reaction</li>
            <li> Bought these for my parents back in india after getting good reviews from a friend in the middle east. According to my parents these are very easy to use and gives good natural colour for the black hair most indians have.This colour doesnt come off no matter what you do with your hair afterwards. Be sure to do the test as mentioned in the package to see if there are allergies before using it. My parents and in laws are very happy with these and i am buying another set for them when i go to to india next time</li>
            <li> I loved the hair dye. I am sure I will shop with you in the future. Love the products. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I recently used Bigen to, both, mask grey beard hairs as well as give an enhanced look to my overall beard.  After the using the product two times, I, initially had mixed emotions as it, seemingly, washed-out in a matter of 24-48 hours.  However, after my 3rd use, I encountered an extreme skin irritation.  In fact, the infected area rose similarly in fashion to a \\&quot;welt.\\&quot;  While my beard \\&quot;masked\\&quot; the swelling, it was uncomfortable, extremely irritable, and somewhat embarrassing.  To complex the issue, my face began showing signs of blistering, and, in fact, even open sores.  The extreme discomfort combined with tremendous swelling to my neck led to an experience most commonly descried as hell.  After growing increasing concerned, I googled \\&quot;Bigen skin irritation\\&quot; and found this:    [...]  [...]    Long story short, DO NOT USE. I would imagine lawsuites to ensue (if not already).</li>
            <li> Have used this hair color product for many, many years.  Easy to use, colors nicely. Gives hair more body, makes styling easier.</li>
