    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>i&#x27;m not always impressed by the hype.</li>
            <li>but Miss Jessie&#x27;s stretch creme was awesome !</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the perfect combination for my wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Amazing product !!</li>
            <li>My hair looks great.</li>
            <li>and it was a great product.  </li>
            <li>might  be  good  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>LOVE these products!</li>
            <li>The creme has an almost rose scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li>AMAZING product in a fantastic line!</li>
            <li>ALWAYS PLEASED WITH COLOR, TEXTURE AND SMELL OF MS JESSIE&#x27;S PRODUCTS.  </li>
            <li>THE STRETCHING CREME WAS BETTER SUITED.</li>
            <li>I wish they would provide more for the money.</li>
            <li>The Buttercreame is more moisturizing than this product.  </li>
            <li>I have seen reviews saying that the curly meringue works better than the stretch silkening cream, but I have to disagree.</li>
            <li>Great product for my natural hair!</li>
            <li>I think these two products are the best hair creme I have ever had hands down!</li>
            <li>Too harsh to be called the best darn creme.</li>
            <li>I will use until I find a more economical product.</li>
            <li>It is so versatile that I can use it on dry hair as well to keep fly aways in check.</li>
            <li>and I have GORGEOUS soft, natural looking barrel curls.  </li>
            <li>I have been shopping with amazon for a long time and have purchased many products and have never returned and item up until not.  </li>
            <li>when i first tried this product i really didn&#x27;t expect too much, after all i had tried a lot of products.</li>
            <li>Could find a large jar in the store</li>
            <li>It is just not as good of a product for my hair (tightly coiled natural hair) as the Buttercreame.  </li>
            <li>It moisturized &amp; strengthened my hair so much w/o leaving it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I  have very  wavy  hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and residue-free for the first time since I can remember.</li>
            <li>with  normal  hair.</li>
            <li>I decided to switch things up and try this product instead of my normal Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Buttercreame based on reviews.  </li>
            <li>i set my hair with Miss Jessie&#x27;s with a comb twist technique and the results were soft and shiny and lasted well into the work week!</li>
            <li>Has a soft hold</li>
            <li>I find that this product does give some length to the hair, as well as keeping it soft.</li>
            <li>I use this in addition to Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different natural hair puddings and cremes, and this the only one I&#x27;ve come across that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and makes my twist outs look healthy.</li>
            <li>The key really is to use sparingly - too much and it&#x27;ll weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair which can be blown straight with a little effort.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazing product !! My hair looks great. Has a soft hold</li>
            <li> I used this as a styler and it was a great product.  I recommend using it After you apply your jelly.</li>
            <li> when i first tried this product i really didn&#x27;t expect too much, after all i had tried a lot of products.Being a hairdresser i&#x27;m not always impressed by the hype. but Miss Jessie&#x27;s stretch creme was awesome ! i got shiny spirals in the place of frizz. i set my hair with Miss Jessie&#x27;s with a comb twist technique and the results were soft and shiny and lasted well into the work week! Try this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different natural hair puddings and cremes, and this the only one I&#x27;ve come across that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and makes my twist outs look healthy. Less shedfing too.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what this product is does.  It is not good at all!  I was very disappointed in this.  I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Miss Jessies  uses ingredients that are not healthy .  When I ordered the product I could not see the ingredients nor were they listed .  I found out only after I ordered the products that they contained chemical that straightens the hair and formaldehyde.  That information should have been listed on the product page.  As a result I had to cancell an order and am in the process of returning two of the other products.  I am being charge for shipping this stuff back.  I think that I should not have to pay becasue the information was not listed before ordering.  I have been shopping with amazon for a long time and have purchased many products and have never returned and item up until not.  I am very disappointed at the product and the return policy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I received it in my Birchbox a while back and it seriously changed my hair. It moisturized &amp; strengthened my hair so much w/o leaving it feeling greasy. It is so versatile that I can use it on dry hair as well to keep fly aways in check. AMAZING product in a fantastic line!</li>
            <li> my  hair  poofed  up  after  an  hour  in  the  humid  outdoors.  I  have very  wavy  hair.  This  might  be  good  for  someone  with  normal  hair.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Miss Jessie&#x27;s Stretch Silkening Creme at an industry event that I attended and was so blown away!  It is now the only product I will use on my hair.  I have naturally wavy hair which can be blown straight with a little effort.  The problem I usually have with curl cremes is that they make my hair crispy or they don&#x27;t work at all. Just a little creme spread over wet hair, root to tip, let it air dry and I have GORGEOUS soft, natural looking barrel curls.  I have used the blow dryer as well and it&#x27;s basically the same result - maybe a little extra lift.  The key really is to use sparingly - too much and it&#x27;ll weigh your hair down.  And I am always complimented on how my hair smells!  The creme has an almost rose scent.  It&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS PLEASED WITH COLOR, TEXTURE AND SMELL OF MS JESSIE&#x27;S PRODUCTS.  I PREVIOUSLY USED CURLY PUDDING, BUT FOUND WITH MY HAIR VERY SHORT TO THE SCALP THE STRETCHING CREME WAS BETTER SUITED.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!!!!!  Leaves your hair hard and it hurts.  Too harsh to be called the best darn creme. Hard to wash out</li>
            <li> I wish they would provide more for the money. I will use until I find a more economical product. My daughter goes through a lot.</li>
            <li> Great product for my natural hair!</li>
            <li> I decided to switch things up and try this product instead of my normal Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Buttercreame based on reviews.  It is just not as good of a product for my hair (tightly coiled natural hair) as the Buttercreame.  It did not soften the curl pattern in my hair.  The Buttercreame is more moisturizing than this product.  I will use it as a conditioner but once it is gone, i will go back to the Buttercreame.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny, and residue-free for the first time since I can remember. Now, if only I could figure out how to beat these split ends.</li>
            <li> I have seen reviews saying that the curly meringue works better than the stretch silkening cream, but I have to disagree. I find that this product does give some length to the hair, as well as keeping it soft. Now that is not to say that curly meringue is not a great product because often I actually use that as well. Sometimes I use them alone or sometimes I use a little bit of both! I think these two products are the best hair creme I have ever had hands down!</li>
            <li> Could find a large jar in the store</li>
            <li> Love smell; however, seemingly, somethng&#x27;s wrong with it ... it made my hair very dry &amp; brittle and caused really bad breakage (1st time that&#x27;s ever happened) even around my edges and nape , so I think the one I received must be defective or something. I expected it to work well as usual, but sadly it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I use this in addition to Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls and it&#x27;s the perfect combination for my wavy hair. LOVE these products!</li>
