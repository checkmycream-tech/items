            <li>Will be ordering more</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the cream</li>
            <li>but this is a better buy.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t cloying or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>$30 or more coupons you get when you fill out the survey on each receipt).</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments everytime I wear this</li>
            <li>And with the perfume, it made the smell that much more desireable.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents from Bath and Body.</li>
            <li>and she specifically asked for more this year.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to go to the original seller to get this because they can&#x27;t keep them stocked...</li>
            <li>Plus I saved $4.00 buying this through amazon instead of bath and body and free shipping(not</li>
            <li>This smells wonderful but is not overwhelming and the scent does not linger forever like some of the others do.</li>
            <li>This is by FAR my favorite!</li>
            <li>Great lasting scent and hydrates the skin very well.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this and it leaves my hands very soft!</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I am on my third bottle and it is still my favorite!</li>
            <li>I love how soft it leaves my body/hands!</li>
            <li>at first i was like?????</li>
            <li>Please make sure you order enough to defray the shipping cost.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li>I first heard of the name from my sister, then when i wore the fragrance, heads turned.</li>
            <li>I love the entire collection.</li>
            <li>, my boyfriend really likes it too!</li>
            <li>It does wear off after a while, but I love the scent so much I have the smaller bottle of perfume that I keep in my purse to refresh during the day.</li>
            <li>to the above plus (which is huge in my book)</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a local Bath and Body Works, the scent is luxurious, sweet but not cloying with a hint of floral freshness.</li>
            <li>Excuse me, but I am passionate about fragrance, i.e I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have a HUGE list of flower allergies, and this is one of the few fragrances I have found that I have never had a problem with.  </li>
            <li>Its not too light, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the thick consistency.  </li>
            <li>The stuff contains citronellol and it is the same ingredient on Avon&#x27;s Skin So Soft, which does not work for me.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t be surprised if quantities run low.</li>
            <li>The scent is beautiful and complicated and a small amount goes a very long way.  </li>

            <li> Great lasting scent and hydrates the skin very well. Will be ordering more</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!!!! I love the scent and the cream is awesome! one of my friends told me she puts it on her brush after a shower when she brushes her hair out. at first i was like????? then I tried it and that trick works surprisingly well! it makes your hair smell great and it actually helps de-tangle your hair!</li>
            <li> Great Item... Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This is by FAR my favorite! Its not too light, not too heavy. I love the &amp;#34;seductive&amp;#34; scent! I have the body butter, lotions, and perfume! Just wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling product.  It&#x27;s the same product they sell in bath and body works but this is a better buy. Please make sure you order enough to defray the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this moisturizer. If you don&#x27;t have a local Bath and Body Works, the scent is luxurious, sweet but not cloying with a hint of floral freshness. I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it. They put a lot of work into coming up with this scent. It has a lot of different ingredients adding to its depth. The moisturizer itself works great. It is definitely not watery and keeps skin from feeling dry until your next shower. I am on my third bottle and it is still my favorite!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and it leaves my hands very soft! I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> My wife use this on in her office to freshen up after washing her hands.  Great smell and great moisture lotion.</li>
            <li> I am usually the first person bitten by mosquitoes, but ever since I started using this product in May 2013, I have not had one bite. The stuff contains citronellol and it is the same ingredient on Avon&#x27;s Skin So Soft, which does not work for me. I am outside a LOT and so far this wet summer, I have not been eaten alive like I usually am. I usually use 100% DEET on my clothing but have not had to this year.&lt;br /&gt;Add to the above plus (which is huge in my book) the stuff smells SO nice and it isn&#x27;t cloying or overwhelming. My daughter uses the shower scrub and it smells almost as nice as the body cream. One 8 oz tube lasted me for 3 months and that was using it every day on my arms, chest and legs (when I wore shorts). I bought TONS of it at BandB when it was on sale but the price listed here is WELL below retail even with their generous discounts ($10 off $30 or more coupons you get when you fill out the survey on each receipt).</li>
            <li> I have a HUGE list of flower allergies, and this is one of the few fragrances I have found that I have never had a problem with.  The scent is beautiful and complicated and a small amount goes a very long way.  I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I get so many compliments everytime I wear this</li>
            <li> The smell of this fragrance will have people hugging. It is an intoxicating smell.  I first heard of the name from my sister, then when i wore the fragrance, heads turned. And with the perfume, it made the smell that much more desireable. Excuse me, but I am passionate about fragrance, i.e I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents from Bath and Body. Has a beautiful rich scent and feels luxurious and is perfect for wearing as a perfume.</li>
            <li> I typically buy these products directly from Bath &amp; Body Works, but because I had a credit on Amazon, I decide to go that route. The scent lasts all day and is not too overpowering that it would annoy others. I love how soft it leaves my body/hands!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a lot when I apply it after I shower. It smells wonderful and is long lasting. I love the entire collection.</li>
            <li> very nice product with a great price compared to retail.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful but is not overwhelming and the scent does not linger forever like some of the others do. I will definitely keep using this one!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my girlfriend for Christmas 2012 and she specifically asked for more this year.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with that! She loves the scent, the texture, the moisturizing, and the fact that it is not greasy.  It is one of their most popular so don&#x27;t be surprised if quantities run low.</li>
            <li> bath and body works has been out for awhile Ive been told, I couldnt get it online and they had some left so it makes this a 8 star rating for me! depending on when it actually ships will depend on the rest of the rating.</li>
            <li> excellent quality lotion, great scent, would definetly purchase it again as I love the quality of this product-I recommend it</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the thick consistency.  It is a wonderful lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought the body spray, lotion, shower gel, and the triple moisturising cream(triple moisture body cream through amazon-the rest at bath and body). It does wear off after a while, but I love the scent so much I have the smaller bottle of perfume that I keep in my purse to refresh during the day. I can&#x27;t get enough of the scent, my boyfriend really likes it too! I hope Bath and Body continue&#x27;s to produce this fragrance, because I know I will be using it for a long time! Plus I saved $4.00 buying this through amazon instead of bath and body and free shipping(not all the products had this option-just an FYI).</li>
            <li> the love of my life!!! I have not been able to go to the original seller to get this because they can&#x27;t keep them stocked...Scent last ALL DAY!</li>
