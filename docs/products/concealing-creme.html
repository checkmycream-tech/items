            <li> Great for covering bruises or any kind of spot that is bothersome.  I will certainly keep using it.</li>
            <li> This product goes on very easy and does not have the thick coverage like some of the other products.  I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Favorite product works very well  great seller</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cover or stay on well-</li>
            <li> Could not use it because it was too light so I don&#x27;t if would have worked or not.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product!  I purchased it initially because it was advertised to cover spots on the face.  The advertisement showed people who had huge red marks on their face and this concealing creme covered these marks.  I started to use it and it was like a miracle.  It covers everything.  It stays on, it must be waterproof, but I don&#x27;t think it is advertised as such.  I am allergic to all makeup, but I have no problem with Smart Cover.  I highly recommend trying at least one tube.</li>
            <li> I do not use this to cover any spots, just as a general all over the face foundation. I have tried so many different products but they all sweat or fade off in just a few hours. It goes on smooth, it&#x27;s a little thick but that&#x27;s why it works so good. I put this on then cover with a loose powder and it makes my face look smooth and clean. I just wish that it came in a bigger tube.</li>
            <li> Does not cover as well as I thought it would.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I give this product two stars because it really did not work for me.  I had to use a lot to cover up spots and freckles, which gave it a caked on look.  I recommend this product only if you don&#x27;t mind the caked on look.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using for over a year. Saved the day as a last minute touch at a wedding</li>
            <li> a friend recommended this to me and let me try it before I bought it.  Very good coverage. My friend says it helps fade spots with use</li>
            <li> It really covers spider veins well and light brusing.</li>
            <li> Perfect cover-up for varicose veins. It blends well with my skin. Great product, have ordered more!</li>
            <li> This make-up is natural looking, long wearing, easy to apply and goes a long way. I thoroughly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> love this product.  Arrived on time</li>
            <li> This company show great concern for their customers. I would do business with this company again.&lt;br /&gt;This company stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> Smartcover does exactly what it says it does.. Have been using for a few years now and willl continue to.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!I use to cover my dark circles under my eyes. Just dab on with my figure tip and put powder on top. This stuff stays all day, even in super hot weather.Can not live without!</li>
            <li> It is too thick, color was too light, showed. Waste of money for me. It didn&#x27;t cover my spider veins.</li>
            <li> I tried this and it does not cover very well. I have dark blotches on my face and I thought it would work. It doesn&#x27;t. Such a small tube also.</li>
            <li> this product is not as advertised on tv. it gives you some coverage but not even close to the ads.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It does cover and conceal as it says it will. I would order more of this product.</li>
            <li> works great I love this product</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I don&#x27;t sun anymore. My legs have ugly dark marks, varicose veins, and spider veins.  I put a small amount on my fingertips and cover my legs from the knees down-who sees the rest? It makes my legs look great and doesn&#x27;t rub off while sleeping or showering. I put it on the tops of my hands, too. Just wish it came in a bigger tube!</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis, some on my face a lot on arms &amp; other areas.  When I scratch the itching big  blood blotches occur.  A need for a good coverup is essential.  Smart Cover does the job but the makeup smudges.  I have enough problems with bloodstains on my clothing, I don&#x27;t need makeup stains as well...product not good for what ails me.</li>
