            <li>or so (the primer is really light and controls frizz, adds thermal protection and tons of shine).  </li>
            <li>Hair looks great for several days.</li>
            <li>This is too light of a hold for my super curly hair, but it will have to do for now.</li>
            <li>Not that great, makes my hair dry</li>
            <li>By far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get this product, but I wasn&#x27;t to excited once I used it.</li>
            <li>My stylist was right!  </li>
            <li>My stylist was right!  </li>
            <li>I just hope it is always available online as everyone nowadays seems to want straight hair and products for curly hair seem to becoming rarer.</li>
            <li>I love my curls and cannot stand my hair straight .</li>
            <li>The container is almost full and the dispenser is defective.</li>
            <li>Obviously the more product you use the better, but even with a light application it holds.</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy, so creams and gels tend to weigh it down, but this is super light and provides great definition.</li>
            <li>(this is the first time I had been to this particular stylist) but I liked my haircut</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not frizzy but needs help to look respectable and show a decent curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t buy  what the stylist recommends because they&#x27;re always trying to sell the brands they carry which may not be very good at all</li>

            <li>I&#x27;d been using Catwalk Extra Strong Mousse for many years.</li>
            <li>Although it was about $7 more than I&#x27;d paid for the Extra Strong Mousse, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>#34;crunchy&amp;#34;.I&#x27;ve tried lots of different brands of mousse on my fine hair and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>This product works great for my long naturally curly hair!  </li>
            <li>BUT THE PRODUCT BEWARE STRONG OLD LADY SMELL.</li>
            <li>Service very fast.</li>
            <li>The last time I went to buy more mousse, I found out that Catwalk was no longer selling the Extra Strong Mousse but had a new one, Curl Collection Curlesque Strong Mousse.  </li>
            <li>I remember using many different brands of mousse that were either whipped air and did nada or else made my hair crunchy</li>
            <li>I recently had my hair cut in a very chic layered lob and although it looked great when I left the salon, I knew there was no chance of recreating it at home.  </li>
            <li>I recently had my hair cut in a very chic layered lob and although it looked great when I left the salon, I knew there was no chance of recreating it at home.  </li>
            <li>At first it holds up well</li>
            <li>Fwiw, my hair is fairly thick but fine, with curls kind of like curling ribbon.  </li>
            <li>I found that it was the only product that gave my very straight, fine hair curl and body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Eventually, I tried putting a good amount of mousse in my wet hair, and then a firm gel on top, and that worked reasonably well.  </li>
            <li>Its OK, but not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend !</li>
            <li>Thanks You.</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>The combination really defines my curls and keeps my hair from drying out.</li>
            <li>This does what it says, but it doesn&#x27;t spread through my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>If your hair gets the slightest bit moist, your hair will get that crunchy feeling you get after using way too much hairspray.</li>
            <li>This works very well</li>
            <li>Like I said, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with styling products precisely because my hair will never hold a style for long.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with styling products precisely because my hair will never hold a style for long.</li>
            <li>it works for your hair and you&#x27;re only using it as a special occasion thing</li>
            <li>Well, the scent is overbearing especially for someone with scent migraines and an office full of women with scent causing migraines.</li>
            <li>high as well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I apply a primer (Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil but Smooth Criminal from Sally Beauty Supply is also good) to damp hair and then let it dry a bit, 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li>well-packed and Fragrance Net did include some other nice samples.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>and I live in an area where the humidity is high and the heat index &amp;#34;hair ruining&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I SPENT GOOD MONEY ON THIS WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, no crunch, just very soft curls.  </li>
            <li>The seller did provide the product quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li>I use this mousse to help hold the curl and shape of my fine limp hair.</li>
            <li>It holds my naturally curly hair well.</li>
            <li>OLD LADY SMELL....</li>
            <li>ITS LIKE WHEN CURLY SMELLED WILD HYACINTH.</li>
            <li>(I have naturally wavy-ish hair).&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t give my hair the body or curl of the old mousse.</li>
            <li>Thru flexible hold hairspray all over (which provides invisible natural hold that lasts all day)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t completely understand this mousse.  </li>
            <li>will also say that I ordered this from Fragrance Net, because they were close by, and it took forever to travel from New York to New Jersey.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, and I have personally bought it time and time again.</li>
            <li>I adore this mousse have been using it on my fine wavy/curly hair since being recommended it a few years ago at a local salon.</li>
            <li>Not quite a strong enough hold for my thick natural curls.</li>
            <li>(yes I&#x27;m old enough to remember 80s hair,lol).  </li>
            <li>how surprised I was that a styling product actually worked!!  </li>
            <li>how surprised I was that a styling product actually worked!!  </li>
            <li>I have thick hair and this is the only strong mousse that holds my hair without a lot of product build up.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much on super-fine hair or it will weigh down.  </li>
            <li>However it was over New Year&#x27;s and the USPS has mislaid some other packages of mine recently.  </li>

            <li> it works for your hair and you&#x27;re only using it as a special occasion thing</li>
            <li> Well, the scent is overbearing especially for someone with scent migraines and an office full of women with scent causing migraines.</li>
            <li> high as well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I apply a primer (Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil but Smooth Criminal from Sally Beauty Supply is also good) to damp hair and then let it dry a bit, 10-15 minutes</li>

            <li> Lightweight, no crunch, just very soft curls.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t completely understand this mousse.  </li>
            <li> will also say that I ordered this from Fragrance Net, because they were close by, and it took forever to travel from New York to New Jersey.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, and I have personally bought it time and time again.</li>
            <li> I adore this mousse have been using it on my fine wavy/curly hair since being recommended it a few years ago at a local salon.</li>
            <li> Not quite a strong enough hold for my thick natural curls.</li>
            <li> (yes I&#x27;m old enough to remember 80s hair,lol).  </li>
            <li> how surprised I was that a styling product actually worked!!  </li>

            <li> However it was over New Year&#x27;s and the USPS has mislaid some other packages of mine recently.  </li>
            <li> It holds all my curls all day long without making my hair crunchy and gross.</li>

            <li> Tried other kinds but always end up going back to it.</li>

            <li> Good  Works nice and gives nice shine.  Have short hair and does put a little curl in it. Holds style</li>
            <li> Great hold without being too &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;.I&#x27;ve tried lots of different brands of mousse on my fine hair and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It holds my naturally curly hair well. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I&#x27;ve tried the lighter version of the same mousse but it doesn&#x27;t hold as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent--beautiful smell and a wonderful mousse.  Have used it for years but haven&#x27;t been able to find it until now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much on super-fine hair or it will weigh down.  Just a tablespoon or two, liquify by rubbing hands together and aim for the roots.  Works especially well partnered with the Curlesque defining shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to flowers and the scent is so strong it gives me a horrible headache.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a gift for a friend who swore that all hair products weighed her hair down and prevented it from curling.  She abuses her hair, by using henna and then getting it permed, and it looks like straw and she must use rollers to get it to curl.  I got the strongest mousse to make sure that it would set her curl.  Despite protest, I convinced her to use it just once, with the result that it held her curl better than anything else she had tried!  She is happy with it, now.</li>
            <li> OLD LADY SMELL.... ARGGGGGG... IT SMELLS SO BAD. I COLLAPSED ON THE FLOOR. I OFFICIALLY SMELL LIKE MY GREAT GREAT GRANDMOTHER. YOU CANT RETURN THIS STUFF. THE PEOPLE SOLD IT TO ME ARE GREAT BUT THE PRODUCT BEWARE STRONG OLD LADY SMELL. MO LARRY THE CHEESE... ITS LIKE WHEN CURLY SMELLED WILD HYACINTH. IF YOU WANT A MORE CLEARER PICTURE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WHEN I SMELLED THIS GO TO YOU TUBE /Wild Hyacinth makes me crazy ... I GET DEATHLY ILL WHEN I SMELL O L D L A D Y  S M E L L.... I DON&#x27;T EVEN KNOW IF THIS STUFF WORKS. I SPENT GOOD MONEY ON THIS WASTE OF MONEY. THE SMELL NEVER ENDS IT SEEMS LIKE IT GETS STRONGER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM GOING TO SLAM DUNK THIS IN THE TRASH WHERE IT BELONGS.</li>
            <li> I use this mousse to help hold the curl and shape of my fine limp hair. I would not be without it.</li>
            <li> I like the rock amplifier from Catwalk, but this stuff would not even qualify as a weak mousse. So unless I just got a bad bottle, this stuff doesn&#x27;t hold anything at all. You might as well apply water.</li>
            <li> Great for making your hair curl when your hair gas no curl.</li>
            <li> Love this mousse. Works like a charm. By far my favorite! (I have naturally wavy-ish hair).&lt;br /&gt;Even more so, I loved the price ... until it went up almost $3.  1 month ago, it was $10.84; now it&#x27;s listed at $13.49.  Doesn&#x27;t save me that much money to buy it online anymore :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Catwalk Extra Strong Mousse for many years. I found that it was the only product that gave my very straight, fine hair curl and body. The last time I went to buy more mousse, I found out that Catwalk was no longer selling the Extra Strong Mousse but had a new one, Curl Collection Curlesque Strong Mousse.  Although it was about $7 more than I&#x27;d paid for the Extra Strong Mousse, I decided to try it. It didn&#x27;t give my hair the body or curl of the old mousse. I&#x27;ve tried three other mousses and none has worked well. I&#x27;m very disappointed and wish Catwalk would bring back the old Extra Strong Mousse.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Adds body. Wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
            <li> Strong mousse is a good value for the dollar.  The quality is that of a  salon level product and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not to heavy of a mousse, but give my hair body. My hair is slightly curly and it helps leave that look.</li>
            <li> Its OK, but not what I expected.  It doesn&#x27;t give me the volume that I was expecting and when I add the other Catwalk Curl products it really makes my hair limp.  Just not for me.  The seller did provide the product quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, medium texture hair and I&#x27;ve always had a problem trying to find something, anything, that would hold my hair.  This does!  I am a convert.  For years, I tried the high end brands and was always disappointed. I also have tried every drugstore brand of gel and mousse, looking for anything that would make my bratty hair stay in place.  This mousse was recommended by my stylist but I was skeptical.  I remember using many different brands of mousse that were either whipped air and did nada or else made my hair crunchy (yes I&#x27;m old enough to remember 80s hair,lol).  I&#x27;ve had tons of product recommendations over the years and nothing has worked.  So I was very skeptical (this is the first time I had been to this particular stylist) but I liked my haircut and he did use it to create the final style so I decided to try it.  I was expecting to return the product after the usual epic fail.  However, that&#x27;s not what happened.  It worked like nothing has before. WOW!!  It must really be STRONG!  This is what I do:  I apply a primer (Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil but Smooth Criminal from Sally Beauty Supply is also good) to damp hair and then let it dry a bit, 10-15 minutes or so (the primer is really light and controls frizz, adds thermal protection and tons of shine).  Then I apply a good amount of Catwalk mousse, working in from roots to ends.  My hair is a bit below my shoulders so I use two egg sized dollops.  I then let my hair air dry overnight.  In the morning I use a curling iron to create loose waves.  The mousse gives the curls definition and hold.  When I&#x27;ve done my entire head and the curls have cooled, I run my fingers through to loosen the waves a bit.  I then spray Nexxus Comb Thru flexible hold hairspray all over (which provides invisible natural hold that lasts all day) and I&#x27;m set.  This mousse doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff or sticky.  In fact, you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s there at all and yet the hold lasts even through the Florida humidity (and that&#x27;s quite a feat).  My hair now looks like I&#x27;ve stepped out of the salon.  My stylist was right!  This stuff is golden!! The price at the salon was $16 so since then I&#x27;ve ordered it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.  However, from time to time I find a few cans at TJ Maxx for $10 and I stock up.  It lasts quite a while even though I use quite a bit each time.  I can&#x27;t state clearly enough how surprised I was that a styling product actually worked!!  My jaw dropped to the floor when I came home from a long work day and saw that my waves still looked great!  I hope TIGI continues to make this product.  I recently had my hair cut in a very chic layered lob and although it looked great when I left the salon, I knew there was no chance of recreating it at home.  I usually don&#x27;t buy  what the stylist recommends because they&#x27;re always trying to sell the brands they carry which may not be very good at all (sometimes the product lines pay the stylists to retail their products so the bias is huge).  Like I said, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with styling products precisely because my hair will never hold a style for long. But I&#x27;ve never given up and have been looking for a holy grail product for a very long time.  Now I&#x27;ve finally found it and I hope they never change the formula, it&#x27;s perfect as it is.  I heartily recommend this product for anyone who struggles with hard-to-hold hair.  If it holds mine, it&#x27;ll hold yours.  Promise.ite a feat).  My hair now looks like I&#x27;ve stepped out of the salon.  My stylist was right!  This stuff is golden!!

            <li> Love this product! Gives me body and doesn&#x27;t take the shine away! Hair looks great for several days. Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> Thanks You. Service very fast. Me gusta el producto. Mis rizos se ven saludables y brillosos, le da vida. Ya no ando con mi cola de caballo para no peinarme ahora llevo el pelo suelto mucho mas tiempo</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and they stopped selling it in the stores and salons.  I am so glad I could find it online.  I hope I can continue to find it.</li>
            <li> I adore this mousse have been using it on my fine wavy/curly hair since being recommended it a few years ago at a local salon. As others have said, all products weigh my hair down exept this, it gives  body, gets rid of frizz and defines curls. I just hope it is always available online as everyone nowadays seems to want straight hair and products for curly hair seem to becoming rarer. I love my curls and cannot stand my hair straight .</li>
            <li> The mouse was OK when I could get it to come out of the container. The container is almost full and the dispenser is defective. When I realized this it had been several months.  I would like to return this defective product but I’m thinking its too late.</li>
            <li> great product great price....</li>
            <li> Love this mousse. I have a hard time finding it in the stores. I have very coarse hair, and this mousse makes my curls come to life!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Honestly I was hoping for a stronger hold. This is too light of a hold for my super curly hair, but it will have to do for now.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and I live in an area where the humidity is high and the heat index &amp;#34;hair ruining&amp;#34; high as well.  Catwalk Curl Collection Curlesque Strong Mousse is AWESOME.  I leave home for work, out from work to lunch, back to work, and my hair is still awesome. Thank you for a product I can depend on!!!  5 stars all the way!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t completely understand this mousse.  When you dispense it into your hand, the mound is so firm it seems like you could use it to lay bricks.  Or even make bricks themselves.  But I put it my hair and just...*meh*.  At first my hair actually looked pretty terrible, and I had ordered it specifically because of the reviews here on Amazon.  Fwiw, my hair is fairly thick but fine, with curls kind of like curling ribbon.  It&#x27;s not frizzy but needs help to look respectable and show a decent curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, I tried putting a good amount of mousse in my wet hair, and then a firm gel on top, and that worked reasonably well.  But it seems kind of unneccessary.  Plus this mousse is rated ~extremely~ poorly on ewg.org&#x27;s &amp;#34;Skin Deep.&amp;#34;  I mean, mousses tend to have more bad chemicals than gels, but seriously, Skin Deep rates only two mousses worse than this, and one is off the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it works for your hair and you&#x27;re only using it as a special occasion thing, I think it&#x27;s okay.  But I will never order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also say that I ordered this from Fragrance Net, because they were close by, and it took forever to travel from New York to New Jersey.  However it was over New Year&#x27;s and the USPS has mislaid some other packages of mine recently.  The mousse was well-packed and Fragrance Net did include some other nice samples.  I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> This works so much better than gels on my hair. My hair is wavy, so creams and gels tend to weigh it down, but this is super light and provides great definition.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that needs a little help , this just  doesn&#x27;t do the trick just leaves my hair sticky</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews and how good it smelled. Well, the scent is overbearing especially for someone with scent migraines and an office full of women with scent causing migraines. I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I have literally tried over 50 products for my thick and naturally wavy hair throughout the years, 90% being &amp;#34;professional brands&amp;#34;.  I initially took a shot on this when I saw it on Groupon and SO glad I did.  It is the first product to control the friz AND creates the greatest curls I&#x27;ve ever had (since the perm days! haha) It holds all day!  Lightweight, no crunch, just very soft curls.  I get many compliments and &amp;#34;what do you use?&amp;#34; since I have been using this mousse!</li>
            <li> It stinks so bad I can&#x27;t even use it. Squirted some in my hand and immediately washed it off! The smell gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> Works ok. Not quite a strong enough hold for my thick natural curls. I use in combo with deva.</li>
            <li> Love this mousse it really works great on my curly hair</li>
            <li> this product is always the best for a curly hair like mine, not terribly curly but needs something to keep it defined but without sticking it.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get this product, but I wasn&#x27;t to excited once I used it. At first it holds up well but as the day goes by it limps out. The smell is great but product not so much. I gave it away after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Really works great &amp; adds volume</li>
            <li> My favorite mousse! It gives me the perfect beachy waves especially when used with sea salt spray. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i have to use almost double per my last product for pantene</li>
            <li> I use a combination of the Catwalk Curlesque leave in condition, the Curlesque mousee, and L&#x27;Oreal Ever Curl Cream-Gel to keep my fine wavy/curly hair looking good.  The combination really defines my curls and keeps my hair from drying out.</li>
            <li> This does what it says, but it doesn&#x27;t spread through my hair very well.  It seems to want to stay in a mousse-ball instead of dissolving into the hair.  I would not use this on a rainy or humid day though.  If your hair gets the slightest bit moist, your hair will get that crunchy feeling you get after using way too much hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have used it since it came out. Tried other kinds but always end up going back to it. My hair is curly and it just makes it more relaxed, soft and it looks like the kind of curls that celebrities do! It will not make your hair look neither &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair mousse I have found.  It creates lots of body, especially for thinning hair.  After blowing my hair dry, the style lasts all day and sometimes two.  It is not sticky or stiff, but leaves the hair shiny and natural.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I makes my hair manageable and I can still it how I want.&lt;br /&gt;The price is just right!!</li>
            <li> This product works great for my long naturally curly hair!  I used to use Redkin Touch Control and absolutely loved it but it was discontinued. This works very well, it is lighter weight. The one draw back is I notice it doesn&#x27;t hold as well the second day if I don&#x27;t wash my hair again.</li>
            <li> vey good product to keep your curls still</li>
            <li> Love this curl stuff. It holds all my curls all day long without making my hair crunchy and gross. It also reduces  frizz in the hair. Obviously the more product you use the better, but even with a light application it holds. I highly recommend this product, and I have personally bought it time and time again.</li>
            <li> Not that great, makes my hair dry</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this is the only strong mousse that holds my hair without a lot of product build up.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.  That usually happens to products I like.  This gives my hair body.</li>
            <li> Great fast shipping my grandmother loves this product</li>
