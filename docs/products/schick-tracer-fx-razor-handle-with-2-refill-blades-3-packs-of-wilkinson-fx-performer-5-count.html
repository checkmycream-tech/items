            <li> Not sure why the brand is Wilkinson rather than Schick but it and the blades are identical to my 30 year old Schick Tracer.</li>

            <li> These blades work great with the Tracer Fx Razor that I&#x27;ve owned for 20 years.  Now the Tracer Fx blades are either incredibly overpriced or just unavailable.  The Wilkinson Blades at a reasonable Price was a great find.</li>
            <li> This is the old razor I used before they were discontinued. I can&#x27;t use a &amp;#34;pivoting&amp;#34; head razor. Only &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; head razors give the results that are comfortable. And the price of this item is very comparable to &amp;#34;Dollarshaveclub&amp;#34; and definitely works better for me.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find.  Good price compared to Schick brand.</li>
            <li> Only razor I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> great product and great vendor service</li>
            <li> Good blades, glad they are making them</li>
            <li> This is the only place i can find these razors, works good with line your beard. and shave really close.</li>
            <li> My search is finally over for the best shave ever !! I do not know why they took this razor off the market. Oh wait... probably to be fair to the other brands. Because when you sell the best  why buy anything else !!</li>
            <li> Because I really dislike not being able to get refill blades for my Schick Tracer FX Razor, this prolongs my having to find a new razor that truly does a good job for me.</li>
            <li> If you prefer this type razor as I do, it&#x27;s a super price and delivery was ahead of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jp</li>
            <li> Husband loves this razor.....and thinks it is a terrific product. He has been unable to find it in&lt;br /&gt;our local stores.</li>
            <li> I go out of my way to find this product.  It cuts close but helps avoid the ingrown hairs. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> pricey  im happy as a clam that i have it and here are a few more words well ok  well</li>
            <li> Best razor ever. It&#x27;s only got 2 blades which means it&#x27;s small and skinny and can fit into tight places and corners with ease. Not only does it pivot, it also flexes to match the contours of your face. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you working the neck, jaw, chin, you don&#x27;t have to hold it a precise angle to get a good close shave.</li>
            <li> The Wilkinson blades Gives a great shave and last just as long as the others I used .Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>

            <li> I have been using these razors for years I love them.  The new razors on the market with five blades I can&#x27;t do any good shaping to many blades</li>
            <li> Wonderful!!!!!! I will be back when I need refills</li>
            <li> I love a tool that does its job well, even if it&#x27;s simple. I&#x27;ve been using these for over 20 years and do not want to change, so I bought a lot of them when I found them. Yay for me!!</li>
            <li> Cheapest replacement blades for my Schick Tracer I could find.  Can&#x27;t tell the difference.  Really hope they keep making them. Fast service by provider too.</li>
            <li> Nice pistol grip razor. Blades are OK: not as sharp as OEM blades.</li>
