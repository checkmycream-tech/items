            <li>brush does an excellent job of whipping up the lather.</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>Excellent brush for the money.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent horse hair brush.</li>
            <li>brush is simply delightful to use for applying the lather.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed with the heft and quality feel and appearance of this brush.  </li>
            <li>The price puts it at a best value &amp; for all you animal rights shavers, no animals were harmed in making this brush as the hairs harvested are a byproduct of horse grooming.</li>
            <li>Perfect for face lathering!</li>
            <li>LOL)</li>
            <li>the horsehair is great on the face.  </li>
            <li>Great shave brush.  </li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to badger hair.</li>
            <li>great product</li>
            <li>very nice floppy horse hair shaving brush</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more happy!</li>
            <li>Go with what feels good.  </li>
            <li>This brush excels at whipping up a good lather with soap quicker than any boar or badger hair brush I have tried.</li>
            <li>It fits nicely in the stand and looks great.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good to</li>
            <li>The horsehair has a very pleasant texture, a bit stiffer than badger which is not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>Top quality too!</li>
            <li>You should own one of these.  </li>
            <li>handle is why you should own this.  </li>
            <li>Horse hair isn&#x27;t terribly popular in the wet-shaving world, but I honestly have no idea why.  </li>
            <li>and I own two (1305 and 830) Semogue boar bristle brushes made in Portugal.  </li>
            <li>Nice and hefty, the horsehair soaks up water like a sponge and it lathers like a champ; face or bowl.</li>
            <li>Nice tall loft holds a lot of lather.</li>
            <li>I picked up a nice safety razor, some nice shave cream, and this brush.</li>
            <li>EDIT: after more than 1 month use, this badger doesn&#x27;t lose hair anymore, doesn&#x27;t smell, and retains more moisture than before (maybe needs some kind of \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; ?</li>
            <li>brush cleans easily and, though people claim it&#x27;s required for horsehair brushes, doesn&#x27;t need any kind of combing.  </li>
            <li>It quickly whipped up a cup of rich lather and was a joy to apply to my face.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay....</li>
            <li>The Semogue 2000 boar is my favorite brush.</li>
            <li>It can be more invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Expect this brush to be longer than most badger hair brushes - also expect it to be a bit floppier.  </li>
            <li>This is a pro barber brush so it paints on lather much better than it scrubbing it on.  </li>
            <li>I love that it didn&#x27;t require animals to be hurt.</li>
            <li>Love this brush,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had a horse hair brush before, but I can see why so many do now.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, you couldn&#x27;t get a better brush for the money.  </li>
            <li>this is a great alternative to boar and is soft.</li>
            <li>The length of the brush makes it a good choice for deeper shaving mugs and the brush holds lather very well.  </li>
            <li>Horse hair is soft and yet it builds soap well and can be used to scrub and paint very nicely.</li>
            <li>In the case of lather building it very quickly whips up the lather without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying</li>
            <li>I see horse hair making a strong comeback in shaving brushes.</li>
            <li>It is industrial steel with a knurled strip on a light wood handle.</li>
            <li>you are in the market for a great shaving brush for a price you can&#x27;t beat, this guy is definitely your ticket.</li>
            <li>This brush will hold a fair amount more lather than my other brush and also keeps a better lather.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast becoming my favorite brush.</li>
            <li>It has a much higher loft than most brushes (65mm.)  </li>
            <li>(Although, in my experience badger, horse, boar, and synthetic are all unique shave prep experiences.)  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t bother to clean it before use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve used for hard to lather soap pucks</li>
            <li>This one works great and didn&#x27;t have much of a wet dog smellâ€¦.</li>
            <li>Really awesome brush for building a thick, foamy lather.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what they do to  badgers to make that brush, but it&#x27;s my guess that a horse sheds plenty of hair with grooming, enough to make a good</li>
            <li>3 times as fast with much better lather.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, much better than soft badger hair and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I love old world craftsmanship</li>
            <li>I would recommend this one :) a true professional brush, I personally just love it.</li>
            <li>Then I scruffled it around in my palm like working a lather, rinsed it well, and it fluffed right up and out.</li>
            <li>This is all part of a new mandate I have to purchase products that are more ethically made.</li>
            <li>clearance to not drag on the counter top.</li>
            <li>The brush is very well constructed, nicely weighted, the handle is a good size for the average hand, and it simply looks lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first two to three uses the smell starts to fade.</li>
            <li>My first Vie-Long brush shed like a flea bitten dog.  </li>
            <li>, I love this brush and it is now my only one.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noted with this brush is that it is made in Spain.  </li>
            <li>This brush was a bit funky the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>This baby lathers up quite nicely, and so far, has lost only two hairs after over a month&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li>If you are in need of a new brush you should give this one a try, just make sure your brush stand is tall enough for the length of this brush.</li>
            <li>I had a best badger brush before this and one reason I am moving away from it is because it is so soft it was difficult to load.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it build lather very well, you can use it to apply in a manner that you enjoy.  </li>
            <li>I will start this off by telling you to absolutely buy this brush.  </li>
            <li>This works very well with either one.  </li>
            <li>they are MUCH cheaper than this junk.</li>
            <li>Non of the these were down sides for me, just saying it will take more soap off with every lathering, because the harder bristles can score it better.  </li>
            <li>(they have stopped after several months of use) and the metal ring on the brush is made of some VERY soft material that can be scratched and damaged with something as light as a fingernail - so if you drop it or knock it off your counter, expect some marring.</li>
            <li>Prefer horsehair to badger (have and use both) because the stiffer hair makes for better lather however the unit appears to be cheaply made e.g, glob of dried glue on the bottom of the wooden handle</li>
            <li>After the many tricks of leaving lather in over night and washing with shampoo it has finally let go of it former owners odor.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit longer than my older brush (a Burma boar bristle, nothing fancy).  </li>
            <li>I do like how this brush is longer and can make an adequate lather, even in my deep apothecary mug.  </li>
            <li>It took a lot of time to get used to horse hair brush after using high quality badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this economical but high quality brush to anyone.</li>
            <li>Not as stiff as a boars hair but more backbone than a badger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the world of shaving with anything but crappy disposables.</li>
            <li>If you use very soft brushes, try horsehair for a change of pace.  </li>
            <li>but the tips are very very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noted other Vie-Long examples which are more traditionally assembled.</li>
            <li>I took some people&#x27;s advice and right out of the package I washed it with a few drops of dish soap and much hot water.  </li>
            <li>well so loading is simple and quick; similar to a boar/bristle brush.  </li>
            <li>brush arrived in a heat-sealed bag which made it look pinched and deformed, not fluffy.  </li>
            <li>A bit soft and looses bristles.</li>
            <li>So far this brush is softer than the silver tip badger I have.  </li>
            <li>The next day it is ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am going to buy another of these Vie-Long horse hair brushes to complete my collection of two badger, two boar, and two horse.  </li>
            <li>it is way too soft.  </li>
            <li>but it really had little smell when I first received it.  </li>
            <li>noticed no odd smell, as some others have mentioned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great value brush that lacks a bit on long term durability (slowly becomes kind of floppy).</li>
            <li>The apex of the bristles (center peak) is also pretty tall, as opposed to wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first shave it smelled like nothing other than my shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>My one general suggestion is if you like to use shaving creams go with a badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>brush and handle also seem thinner than my old brush, I like that for using apothecary mugs and deep bowls.  </li>
            <li>If you like the soft application of a badger brush, you can apply using a paint brush type stroke and get that same sensation with this brush.  </li>
            <li>Painting it on also allows the Proraso green to really open up and cool your face prior to the shave.</li>
            <li>It had a very slight odor if I put it right to my nose, but it didn&#x27;t smell like a barnyard or anything.  </li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s pretty stanky out of the box, but a few shampoos</li>
            <li>though probably due to the high loft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>sides,&lt;br /&gt;It might be  a down side to some that the bristles are stiffer than boar (comparing old brush to new, so not a perfect comparison), but this brush uses a bit more soap off of the puck.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s okay....but no horse or badger is any match for a big &#x27;ole BOAR brush. The Semogue 2000 boar is my favorite brush.</li>
            <li> The horsehair has a very pleasant texture, a bit stiffer than badger which is not a bad thing.  Shaving is a sensory experience, your morning mini-spa.  Go with what feels good.  If you use very soft brushes, try horsehair for a change of pace.  It can be more invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush does an excellent job of whipping up the lather. The longer bristles and handle keep my mitts out of the soap mug and I don&#x27;t get soap smutch all over my hands.  The metal collar gives a slightly weighter feel and a workman like appearance.  Yes, it kinda does look &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush arrived in a heat-sealed bag which made it look pinched and deformed, not fluffy.  And some people mentioned horsehair can have an odor.  No worries.  I took some people&#x27;s advice and right out of the package I washed it with a few drops of dish soap and much hot water.  Then I scruffled it around in my palm like working a lather, rinsed it well, and it fluffed right up and out. After two shaves it relaxed into its final shape.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Average. 3rd use, and still lose a lot of hair. Quite smelly also, but I hope it will disappear after a couple of shaves.    EDIT: after more than 1 month use, this badger doesn&#x27;t lose hair anymore, doesn&#x27;t smell, and retains more moisture than before (maybe needs some kind of \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; ? LOL)</li>
            <li> very nice floppy horse hair shaving brush only complaint is the metal is all scratched up but doesn&#x27;t hinder the shave</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for the money.  The brush had no odor to it nor have I noticed any shedding over the last two months.  The length of the brush makes it a good choice for deeper shaving mugs and the brush holds lather very well.  The  brush works very well with creams, but has enough stiffness to handle hard soaps as well.  This brush compares well with my badger brush for overall quality - at less than half the price.  If you are in need of a new brush you should give this one a try, just make sure your brush stand is tall enough for the length of this brush.</li>
            <li> Really awesome brush for building a thick, foamy lather.  It will smell when you get it, but follow some the other suggestions about de-scenting it before you use it.  Shortly thereafter, it will be a non-issue.</li>
            <li> the horsehair is great on the face.  Expect this brush to be longer than most badger hair brushes - also expect it to be a bit floppier.  I&#x27;ve tried several brushes and this is my go-to brush each day.  That said, the quality wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected.  I had quite a few horse hairs come out initially (they have stopped after several months of use) and the metal ring on the brush is made of some VERY soft material that can be scratched and damaged with something as light as a fingernail - so if you drop it or knock it off your counter, expect some marring.</li>
            <li> Great shave brush.  Elsewhere folks have complained about the smell of a horse hair brush but it really had little smell when I first received it.  I did wash it with Dr Bonner&#x27;s liquid a  couple of times before use, however.  Does the job of lathering and doesn&#x27;t lose bristles.</li>
            <li> The brush holds water well, stands up to daily use, and is an inexpensive buy. This is an excellent horse hair brush.</li>
            <li> This baby lathers up quite nicely, and so far, has lost only two hairs after over a month&#x27;s use.  I don&#x27;t know what they do to  badgers to make that brush, but it&#x27;s my guess that a horse sheds plenty of hair with grooming, enough to make a good brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed no odd smell, as some others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> It took a lot of time to get used to horse hair brush after using high quality badger hair brush. My one general suggestion is if you like to use shaving creams go with a badger hair brush. This brush excels at whipping up a good lather with soap quicker than any boar or badger hair brush I have tried. After the first two to three uses the smell starts to fade. Now that I have used the Vie-Long horse hair shaving brush for a about a year, I have noticed the bristles have softened significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value brush that lacks a bit on long term durability (slowly becomes kind of floppy).</li>
            <li> You should own one of these.  It has a much higher loft than most brushes (65mm.)  It is 50% mane 50% tail.  Scritchy yes, but the tips are very very soft. I&#x27;ve never used badger, only boar, and I find the brush to bowl lather 3 times as fast with much better lather. This is a pro barber brush so it paints on lather much better than it scrubbing it on.  Painting it on also allows the Proraso green to really open up and cool your face prior to the shave. Not really a good face latherer though probably due to the high loft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is why you should own this.  It is industrial steel with a knurled strip on a light wood handle. It is almost as heavy as the Parker chrome handle.  If you absolutely hate the horse knot, pull it out, and reknot (21mm) as you please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neg.&lt;br /&gt;This thing smelled so bad the first two weeks I almost chucked it.  Seriously. Wet horse does not mix well with sandalwood.  Trust me. After the many tricks of leaving lather in over night and washing with shampoo it has finally let go of it former owners odor.  Couldn&#x27;t be more happy!</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to badger hair. I didnt notice the smell other mentioned, though I did wash it before using.</li>
            <li> A bit soft and looses bristles.</li>
            <li> Horse hair is soft and yet it builds soap well and can be used to scrub and paint very nicely. So far this brush is softer than the silver tip badger I have.  (Although, in my experience badger, horse, boar, and synthetic are all unique shave prep experiences.)  I&#x27;m not completely sold on the metal ferrule, I tend to bang on with it around the rim of my ceramic apothecary cup.  I&#x27;ve noted other Vie-Long examples which are more traditionally assembled.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, much better than soft badger hair and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this! I love that it didn&#x27;t require animals to be hurt. It fits nicely in the stand and looks great. He loves the way it feels with shaving cream. It dries well when hung hair-side down.</li>
            <li> I prefer this brush to my expensive badger hair.  My first Vie-Long brush shed like a flea bitten dog.  But it was a different model.  This one works great and didn&#x27;t have much of a wet dog smellâ€¦.</li>
            <li> like my other horse hair brush this performed well with my tabac soap. this is a great alternative to boar and is soft. remember it needs to be broken in due to the smell. great product</li>
            <li> Love this brush,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had a horse hair brush before, but I can see why so many do now.  It is a bit longer than my older brush (a Burma boar bristle, nothing fancy).  I do like how this brush is longer and can make an adequate lather, even in my deep apothecary mug.  This brush will hold a fair amount more lather than my other brush and also keeps a better lather.&lt;br /&gt;This brush and handle also seem thinner than my old brush, I like that for using apothecary mugs and deep bowls.  The apex of the bristles (center peak) is also pretty tall, as opposed to wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down sides,&lt;br /&gt;It might be  a down side to some that the bristles are stiffer than boar (comparing old brush to new, so not a perfect comparison), but this brush uses a bit more soap off of the puck.  Non of the these were down sides for me, just saying it will take more soap off with every lathering, because the harder bristles can score it better.  The stench also takes a bit of time to wear out in the break in period.... so be warned of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a second brush I would recommend this one :) a true professional brush, I personally just love it.</li>
            <li> I will start this off by telling you to absolutely buy this brush.  Horse hair isn&#x27;t terribly popular in the wet-shaving world, but I honestly have no idea why.  I&#x27;ll break down each aspect of what I feel this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box:&lt;br /&gt;First off, mine had a bit of rust on the chrome bulb.  I think this came as a result of sitting in inventory over a long period because of the small market for these and other horsehair brushes.  About 45 seconds of Never-Dull polishing took care of that and it is likely an isolated issue.  I also saw a video review that said these smell bad out of the box; this is not my experience.  It had a very slight odor if I put it right to my nose, but it didn&#x27;t smell like a barnyard or anything.  I suspect it is something they use in the sterilization.  At any rate, it isn&#x27;t an unpleasant odor and I didn&#x27;t bother to clean it before use.  After the first shave it smelled like nothing other than my shaving soap.  The brush is very well constructed, nicely weighted, the handle is a good size for the average hand, and it simply looks lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loading the brush and building lather:&lt;br /&gt;I use softer tub shaving soaps or hard shaving soap pucks.  This works very well with either one.  I had a best badger brush before this and one reason I am moving away from it is because it is so soft it was difficult to load.  This brush is sturdy and holds its water well so loading is simple and quick; similar to a boar/bristle brush.  In the case of lather building it very quickly whips up the lather without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying the lather:&lt;br /&gt;This brush is simply delightful to use for applying the lather.  Some guys use two brushes; a boar brush and a badger brush.  That is entirely unnecessary if you have one of these.  Not only does it build lather very well, you can use it to apply in a manner that you enjoy.  If you like the soft application of a badger brush, you can apply using a paint brush type stroke and get that same sensation with this brush.  If you prefer the scritch of the boar brush, you can use a circular motion with this brush and get that sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post shave:&lt;br /&gt;The brush cleans easily and, though people claim it&#x27;s required for horsehair brushes, doesn&#x27;t need any kind of combing.  I simply rinse, shake out the excess water, and place on a shaving stand (bristles down) on my vanity.  The next day it is ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I love this brush and it is now my only one.  It is well made and is a harvested hair, so the horses aren&#x27;t put to a gruesome death, or at least not for the sake of making your shaving brush.  Furthermore, you couldn&#x27;t get a better brush for the money.  I have used badger brushes in a similar price point and they shed hair into my shaving soap and onto my face.  Not cool.  This one has shed about three small hairs since I started using it and has performed swimmingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a great shaving brush for a price you can&#x27;t beat, this guy is definitely your ticket.</li>
            <li> Just received this brush today.  I used it with some Cold River Soap Works Classic Shaving Soap in the Bay Rum scent.  The first thing I noted with this brush is that it is made in Spain.  I love old world craftsmanship and I own two (1305 and 830) Semogue boar bristle brushes made in Portugal.  I had read in some reviews that these horsehair brushes smell bad.  Not mine.  I gave it a deep sniff and there was nothing out of the ordinary.  I was impressed with the heft and quality feel and appearance of this brush.  It quickly whipped up a cup of rich lather and was a joy to apply to my face.  I am going to buy another of these Vie-Long horse hair brushes to complete my collection of two badger, two boar, and two horse.  I would definitely recommend this economical but high quality brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush. Nice and hefty, the horsehair soaks up water like a sponge and it lathers like a champ; face or bowl. All this for 20 bux? It&#x27;s a no-brainer. Now, it&#x27;s pretty stanky out of the box, but a few shampoos and it&#x27;s good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to give horsehair brushes a shot, thy this.</li>
            <li> Once this brush gets wet it is way too soft.  It will not exfoliate skin or help stand hairs up like a shaving brush is supposed to do.  The only thing it will do is paint on lather.  I don&#x27;t need another paint brush I already have some of those and they are MUCH cheaper than this junk.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim. I had read about horse hair brushes &amp; wanted to give it a try. It&#x27;s fast becoming my favorite brush. Not as stiff as a boars hair but more backbone than a badger. It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve used for hard to lather soap pucks Nice tall loft holds a lot of lather. Quality of materials is 1st rate. The price puts it at a best value &amp; for all you animal rights shavers, no animals were harmed in making this brush as the hairs harvested are a byproduct of horse grooming. I see horse hair making a strong comeback in shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> Prefer horsehair to badger (have and use both) because the stiffer hair makes for better lather however the unit appears to be cheaply made e.g, glob of dried glue on the bottom of the wooden handle makes one wonder what it was glued to? Also difficult to hang bristles down for drying because the handle does not easily fit into most hangers (I have 3 of different sizes) and the long bristles require 3-4&amp;#34; clearance to not drag on the counter top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the different shaving brushes including an expensive Silver Badger. This brush beats them all. Perfect for face lathering! Top quality too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of shaving with anything but crappy disposables. I picked up a nice safety razor, some nice shave cream, and this brush. This is all part of a new mandate I have to purchase products that are more ethically made. Boar or badger products seem to be of sketchy repute. Horse hair, however, comes from horses&#x27; regular haircuts. This is what brought me to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are discussions on the web about horsehair brushes having an unpleasant smell to them. This brush was a bit funky the first time I used it. I have an extremely sensitive nose, and it wasn&#x27;t too bad. This morning was my 2nd time using it, and the smell was undetectable. I like it!</li>
