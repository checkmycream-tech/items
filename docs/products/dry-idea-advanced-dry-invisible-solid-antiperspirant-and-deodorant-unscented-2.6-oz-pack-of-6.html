    <ol>
            <li>Best deoderant that stops sweat....</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>so I was very happy to see it being sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Goes on Great!</li>
            <li>so this is perfect.</li>
            <li>This is perfect.</li>
            <li>and i believe its the best i have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Give it a try its great!</li>
            <li>The 6 pack was a VERY good price for this product.</li>
            <li>but so happy to see it in the Advanced formula.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>But I think this does a better job</li>
            <li>More importantly, EWG gives this deodorant a passing grade.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have glycerine, like Tom&#x27;s, which is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY kind my hubby likes and he was pleased I found it online!  </li>
            <li>This one, the invisible, works fine and is truly fragrance-free, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>This solid works great and</li>
            <li>also not much scent which is great in the summer....doesn&#x27;t attract bugs.</li>
            <li>Good price for several.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old guy who&#x27;s been using Sure unscented forever,</li>
            <li>Then why do people slather scents on their armpits like Va-Va-Vanilla, Passion de Tango, Romantic Rose, Ooh-La-La Lavender, and Cocoa Butter Kiss?  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for much cheaper than i could at the local store.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like those wide ones, so this was the best rated of the narrow ones.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are rated as very benign and safe for human health and use.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how well it works, but it sure goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>I went back to Dove until I can find a better option that has as high of a EWG rating as this one.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;I am very allergic my face and neck looks like road rash from the deodorant I had to use while waiting on this.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, but I am not a fan.</li>
            <li>the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I have used the roll-on one but don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>I always liked the Dry Idea invisible solid and cannot find it anywhere</li>
            <li>Thanks nine teen more words required and it even counts them down for you which s pretty darn groovy.</li>
            <li>This product is a godsend if you are allergic to normal deodorant.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway it&#x27;s here on Amazon and combined with other items you get free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Best sub for the impossible to find roll on of the same unscented.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty dry (as its name would suggest).</li>
            <li>My issue is not serious enough to discourage me from purchasing again.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin in general and am allergic to some deodorant as well.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the stick does not glide on easily,</li>
            <li>I usually use the gel Dry Idea, but it seems this version isn&#x27;t available at Amazon currently.</li>
            <li>I bought this item due to the high rating on the EWG.org site.</li>

            <li> Here it is in a dry stick form.</li>
            <li> No waiting for it to dry!</li>
            <li> like dry versions of stuff as I can avoid that dreaded 311 bag!  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in my usual local store last time I ran out so purchased a 6-pack here.</li>
            <li> I always use unscented due to allergies and this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hypoallergenic deodorants and was always disappointed.  </li>
            <li> They never hold up and are a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it can be hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> it does not have all the dangerous &amp; allergy inducing chemicals that other deodorants have in them.</li>
            <li> I hate sticky, wet roll-ons.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a 311 baggie, sorry....</li>
            <li> If I can smell me, I feel bad for my coworkers.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this deodorant bc it does not have all the dangerous &amp; allergy inducing chemicals that other deodorants have in them. The 6 pack was a VERY good price for this product. Plus, it can be hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Best deoderant that stops sweat....also not much scent which is great in the summer....doesn&#x27;t attract bugs.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I always use unscented due to allergies and this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> Just spent the last week breaking out from allergies to REGULAR deodorant. Stores in my area don&#x27;t sell this solid, just roll-on which rolls off and gel which doesn&#x27;t stick to me.&lt;br /&gt;I am very allergic my face and neck looks like road rash from the deodorant I had to use while waiting on this. I will NOT run out again, I only did this time because I gift my allergic nieces and nephews with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;When you can find a deodorant that works stock up!!!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in my usual local store last time I ran out so purchased a 6-pack here. Works well. It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but I am not a fan. I can smell myself by the afternoon. If I can smell me, I feel bad for my coworkers. I went back to Dove until I can find a better option that has as high of a EWG rating as this one.</li>
            <li> I usually use the gel Dry Idea, but it seems this version isn&#x27;t available at Amazon currently. This one, the invisible, works fine and is truly fragrance-free, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find solid fragrance free deodorant. Local stores only cary liquid.  This solid works great and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Thanks nine teen more words required and it even counts them down for you which s pretty darn groovy. There.</li>
            <li> I always liked the Dry Idea invisible solid and cannot find it anywhere so I was very happy to see it being sold on Amazon. The product they sent me DOES keep me dry as always however it has a scent to it after it&#x27;s been on for awhile, that I do not like.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.  Since I cannot find it anywhere else I&#x27;m not in a position to send it back, but if I could find it I would have.</li>
            <li> No waiting for it to dry! Unscented, which is my preference. Goes on Great! Good price for several. Nothing to not like! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works, but it sure goes on easily.  I&#x27;m an old guy who&#x27;s been using Sure unscented forever, but now I can&#x27;t find it.  Don&#x27;t like those wide ones, so this was the best rated of the narrow ones.  My pals will let me know if it works.</li>
            <li> Best sub for the impossible to find roll on of the same unscented.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hypoallergenic deodorants and was always disappointed.  They never hold up and are a waste of money.  This product is a godsend if you are allergic to normal deodorant.  Lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t the idea of deodorant to not have smelly armpits?  Then why do people slather scents on their armpits like Va-Va-Vanilla, Passion de Tango, Romantic Rose, Ooh-La-La Lavender, and Cocoa Butter Kiss?  If I want to have a scent, I will use my good-smelly lotions-and-potions!  I do not want a scent in my armpits!!!!  I love this stuff and can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get in store anymore so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have always used Dry Idea.  Here it is in a dry stick form. The Big Box Stores in their infinite corporate wisdom have decided they won&#x27;t stock dry deodorants. [?]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it&#x27;s here on Amazon and combined with other items you get free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like dry versions of stuff as I can avoid that dreaded 311 bag!  &#x27;...no sir, I have no liquids and no gels.&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;What?!&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;No  I don&#x27;t have a 311 baggie, sorry....&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant. More importantly, EWG gives this deodorant a passing grade.</li>
            <li> I was thinking they had stopped making it but so happy to see it in the Advanced formula.  I hate sticky, wet roll-ons.  This is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin in general and am allergic to some deodorant as well. I have tried a lot of different ones and finally found this one about 6 months ago locally. I really like it and i believe its the best i have ever tried. I have used the roll-on one but don&#x27;t like it as much. The protection lasts for a long time and will last the entire day and night. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for much cheaper than i could at the local store. Give it a try its great!</li>
            <li> Contains tons of aluminum and smells like smelly bodywash for men.</li>
            <li> I bought this item due to the high rating on the EWG.org site. The ingredients are rated as very benign and safe for human health and use.  My only complaint is that the stick does not glide on easily, it&#x27;s pretty dry (as its name would suggest). It doesn&#x27;t have glycerine, like Tom&#x27;s, which is so easy to apply. But I think this does a better job so I am sticking with it. My issue is not serious enough to discourage me from purchasing again. Go for it.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY kind my hubby likes and he was pleased I found it online!  Will order again in the future</li>
