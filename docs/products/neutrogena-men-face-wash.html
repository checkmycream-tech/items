            <li>This stuff is the best Mens face wash on the market as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>Minty, fresh, great soap for waking up with in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, leaves your face feeling cool and refreshing after every use, and clears your skin.</li>
            <li>Very nice face wash makes face feel fresh and gets rid of oils.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, i can see all ready results in da 1st use, my face feel so refresh an&#x27; clean, i love it :D</li>
            <li>And most importantly, it feels refreshingly good once</li>

            <li>Despite that, this is a good one to clean face.</li>
            <li>The top has a habit of breaking off very easily.</li>
            <li>If you have mild to no acne, this is a great product for a clean face!</li>
            <li>I love this product mainly because it&#x27;s incredibly affordable.  </li>
            <li>I liked the feel it gave me, a nice cool feeling on your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s currently my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>I do love Neutrogena shower gel and bar soap--but, not this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I find myself having to use not dime sized, but quarter or more...</li>
            <li>It is definitely invigorating, perfect for the morning \\&quot;wake-up shower\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes you feel after you rinse it off</li>
            <li>is my favorite face wash found to date.</li>
            <li>But it does run out very quicly and the price isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>I switched this up from some Clearasil face wash and in 2 days, many of my pimples cleared away.</li>
            <li>I felt like it gave me more acne</li>
            <li>Cleans well and feels refreshing and invigorating as indicated by the product name.</li>
            <li>The scent is better than any cologne or aftershave.</li>
            <li>, it was interesting however.</li>
            <li>and I have never felt better about my face.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for much more in a face wash.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully they will resolve this issue so that we can buy with greater confidence.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this until I find something I like better.</li>
            <li>this face wash it seemed as if i had gotten more pimples..</li>
            <li>There is some kind of menthol at work here which leaves a temporary light cooling on the face.</li>
            <li>My husband love these product.</li>
            <li>I hope they stock up some more.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.  </li>
            <li>Love the beads, don&#x27;t love the product density.</li>
            <li>I know this makes it so we have to buy more</li>
            <li>It was okay from day 1 to 3</li>
            <li>Face felt much better after using this product.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using for about a week now and seems to really love it.</li>
            <li>I have used so many products</li>
            <li>and I love the cooling sensation.</li>
            <li>I like the Neutrogena better.</li>
            <li>Really refreshing.</li>
            <li>However, I would really love it if it came as a scrub too.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>They need to user a more impact resistant plastic formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Squeeze container is a hassle to use compared to Neutrogena pump soap which I like a lot more.</li>
            <li>Actually the best one I&#x27;ve tried is sold on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My face is under better control now since using it</li>
            <li>I have not found a better mens facewash.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;-you have to use more</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do when I found that it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Now I know most people would say that it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;Invigorate\\&quot; to the point of waking you up</li>
            <li>I could not imagine a better deal.  </li>
            <li>Really refreshing face wash.</li>
            <li>I do recommend product for a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>Glad to do business with you.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve gotta try out multiple products to see what works best for you.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>If the sight of skin flaking off your face is invigorating, then sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Try to aim toward a product that uses a SLS alternative; they are typically much more forgiving on the face.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>This face wash feels great when I use it in the shower, has a scent and tingle that really helps you wake up.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the last couple years, and I find it the best job for the price.</li>
            <li>There are better choices out there, but not under $10.</li>
            <li>/&gt;An all-around a great buy.</li>
            <li>Keep it up and make sure the availability is there in all stores.</li>
            <li>As a woman I have experimented with countless face wash products and had yet to find the perfect one.</li>
            <li>I just wish it would lather a bit more.</li>

            <li>It efficient and let the ski very clean and protect.</li>
            <li>My face felt very clean and refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>This is the best face wash that i have purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li>Good stuff - might dry out your skin without any moisturizer, but I find that using it with coconut oil makes my skin pretty much flawless.</li>
            <li>those that love a strong scented face wash, this product would be for you.</li>
            <li>My partner uses it every morning and he has to rince his face one more time to not smell the strong perfume all the morning.</li>
            <li>Great not only for face, but if you shave your head, it prepares teh stubble adn ksin nicely.  </li>
            <li>Great for early morning showers!</li>
            <li>nice, smooth, and fresh!</li>
            <li>It makes the whole bathroom smell &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;... in a good way.</li>
            <li>The face wash is nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>Good Job , keep it up Thanks for sending the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and gives you good smells on your face.</li>
            <li>Good products,  very fragrant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of guy that always forgets to wash his face, but when I do remember this thing wakes me right up.</li>
            <li>Makes my face free real clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good wash, it cleans, refreshes, and leaves a good but shortsh scent, just doesn&#x27;t clean deep as claimed.</li>
            <li>I needed a couple more dollars to qualify for Amazon&#x27;s Free shipping and since I needed a new face wash, decided to purchase this Neutrogena product based on the good reviews it has received.</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST face wash I&#x27;ve ever used, it cleans my face very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Recommend it to any guy wanting a clean refreshing face wash</li>
            <li>The clarifying formula gets skin squeaky clean and cuts oiliness, but doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling stripped or tight—a notable plus for a guy who doesn&#x27;t stock his medicine cabinet with face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love it, makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li>bottle is easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the menthol wasn&#x27;t almost overpowering for some, but I kind of like it to be honest.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is overly strong.</li>
            <li>good facial wash, nice quality and ouptut.</li>
            <li>I like it, but if the scent of it wasn&#x27;t too strong, I would have given it a 5 star rating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This face wash is just a gel, no grit, strong smell, and creates lots of foam.</li>
            <li>If you have acne, use strong benzyl peroxide (5-10%).</li>
            <li>way to strong smelling</li>
            <li>The cleanser foams very easily in your hands and leaves your face feeling fresh and revitalized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After washing your face with this product, you face has a cool sensation to it and your face becomes smooth!</li>
            <li>And I love the cool feeling when I use this product.</li>
            <li>I love the COOL feeling it leaves and it will wake you up.</li>
            <li>Ok, not bad at all</li>
            <li>Maybe this is not just right for my skin because it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li>feels very refreshing and minty and keeps my face feeling fresh, very effective at washing dirt/oil off my face after a long work day</li>
            <li>Gets the job fine.</li>
            <li>people said to watch for it being damaged but mine came just fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years, and I love the refreshing cool sensation right after I use them.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but feel that women have a huge selection when it comes to face washes but not guys.</li>
            <li>Just added on to purchase to get free shipping</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great and deep cleaning</li>
            <li>I enjoy the tingling feeling on my face while it opens pores and washes all the crud out.</li>
            <li>It was quite cheap as well.</li>
            <li>being said, I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>it does its work as a face wash, and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, in my case, this stuff acted like a cheap bar of soap with a touch of menthol added to it.</li>
            <li>The reason: Sodium lauryl sulfate, a detergent used in everything from cheap soap to engine degreaser --</li>
            <li>All that I have left to say is it works great</li>
            <li>Now i&#x27;m almost blackhead free.</li>
            <li>Even though  I am a women, I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>It also has a great scent, similar to aftershave.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>The Nivea face wash seems to be by far the superior product.</li>
            <li>Face feels super clean and tingly!</li>
            <li>Especially right under my eyes, I guess my skin is more sensitive there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a face wash that I felt was far superior to the rest, and I don&#x27;t think that this one is particularly special.</li>
            <li>The wash has a very smooth texture, and it does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li>Face feels clean and smooth after use.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no &amp;#34;scrubbing action&amp;#34;, like no grit or anything like some products, so it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Gives you a cooling effect and leaves my face clean and free of oil.</li>
            <li>This is my first month of using the product, but I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>works great at cleaning your face after a long day of work.</li>
            <li>i like them, made my face feel soooooooooooooooo fresh!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy how cool and refreshed my face feels after using this.</li>
            <li>I had to hurry and buy my own because my daddy was tired of me sneaking into his lol :)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure it worsened the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>Since I began using this product, I have noticed that the appearance of my pores has diminished and it has helped significantly with my overly oily skin issues.</li>
            <li>Smells good when I wash my face, and apparently the smell lingers (but, come on, between cologne and deodorant</li>
            <li>feels cool clean and dirt free.</li>
            <li>Like i&#x27;d use this, and while my face feels clean, my pores are still junked up</li>
            <li>ti actually clean well or what.</li>
            <li>and it leaves your face feeling clean.</li>
            <li>After you use this, you know your face is clean.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;It left a tingling sensation&amp;#34; he said when he washed it off with warm water after application and the refreshing feel stayed for an hour.</li>
            <li>You can feel the clean after every use.  </li>
            <li>Face feels really clean too after using it.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that after using it that my face feels clean every time.  </li>
            <li>Seems to clean my face without over drying.  </li>
            <li>my face is clean.</li>
            <li>The menthol in this makes your face tingle and feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>You face feels so clean after using it</li>
            <li>The smell is clean without being medicinal or overly perfumed.  </li>
            <li>I think there are cheaper ways to clean your face without making it feel like you just had some sort of chemical spray.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t feel it can clean your face well.</li>
            <li>thought i&#x27;d get a face wash just to keep my face clean and pristine and this product has done that.  </li>
            <li>if I can confirm that it has ever &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; me but it does help to keep me clean.</li>
            <li>My face is clean, it does not smeel like I just used a girls face wash.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Men Invigorating Face Wash helped clean me up.</li>
            <li>keeps my face clean and invigorated all day.</li>
            <li>After rinsing, my face is clean with a tingly refreshed feel.</li>
            <li>how clean I feel after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It lathers for a good facial massage, and leaves your skin feeling smooth once you rinse it off.</li>
            <li>very good, not too tight after washing</li>
            <li>He found this face wash to be super cool and refreshing to the skin the first time he used it.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was anything special.  </li>
            <li>It cleans and prevents oily skin really well, while leaving your face feeling incredibly clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>: minty, crisp, clean!</li>
            <li>good daily use product.</li>
            <li>I do look the cool sensation I get on my face after washing.  </li>
            <li>Some people don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;intense menthol\\&quot; feeling, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>Overall it is a good facewash, i like how refreshed my face feels after i use it.</li>
            <li>After rinsing it off, there was a really cool sensation that just smacked my face.</li>
            <li>and that wasn&#x27;t cool</li>
            <li>so my pillow isn&#x27;t full of dirt and oil.  </li>
            <li>Refreshingly cool.</li>
            <li>You really have to rub a dub dub to get it to lather up at all.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>but once a month is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I will wash my face and leave the cleanser on my face for a minute or so to get the full effect of that cool menthol feel.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s good, but I might not want to buy this again.</li>
            <li>This lasted me a full semester at school.</li>
            <li>Nice 2/3 clear tube.</li>
            <li>5 Star all the way, only good things.</li>
            <li>Good daily facewash, use it in the morning during shower.</li>
            <li>Has a cool feeling to it when scrabbing your face.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take an expert on deduction to realize it&#x27;s just not as good as the neutrogena exfoliating blue scrub , so</li>
            <li>This is such a good product that I am also going to try and write a review on Neutrogena&#x27;s site.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the cleaning aspect it feels really cool on the face and the freshness lingers for hours.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>This facewash will wake you up, and leave your skin feeling refreshed with its cool, minty feeling.</li>
            <li>And I feel so cool to wash face by this product.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and you can really feel it working with the cool sensation it leaves on your face.</li>
            <li>The strong scent doesn&#x27;t bother me very much, but if you are allergic to any type of perfumes/fragrances, you might want to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many face washes (Clearasil, Nivea, other Neutrogena face washes) but the best ones consistently Asian brands.  </li>
            <li>Available at your supermarket (or, of course, right</li>
            <li>Packaging: container is stable and easy to use; the plastic is strong enough that the top shouldn&#x27;t crack off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried clean and clear morning burst, and it didn&#x27;t give me that awake and alert feeling, and neutrogena acne wash was too strong and irritated and dried my skin, but this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li>The menthol makes your face feel cool, fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li>I give this an easy 5-stars, since it does the rest as good as any other that I have used and</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean all the time.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a tingly feeling when using this item and always leaves me feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean as soon as I use it.  </li>
            <li>After using this your face will fill clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the clean fresh &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feelings fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>but it disappears with another quick wash of the face after the cleaning.</li>
            <li>But you face is quick to recover.</li>
            <li>Overall he think that its a good product but maybe not the right one for him.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap, Biore, Clearasil and many other scrubs before but this one is easily one of the bests.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also burns more than normal soap if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li>It is currently cheap and agrees pretty well to my face, but that is not all.  </li>
            <li>Definitely feels very refreshing.</li>
            <li>It leaves you with a cool, crisp, clean feeling after washing it off.  </li>
            <li>Easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li>I really like that it has a menthol-like refreshening afterburn, but it is too strong for me, and it lasts for about 30 minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, leaves your face well cleaned and tingly, not oily or dry.</li>
            <li>Does a good job and does not make your face feel to dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in gelatin form, is easy to use and lathers on very well.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if this cleans my face any better than my other face wash (Nuetrogena Gentle Cleanse), but it smells great.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>Did the job well and am willing to stick with this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this face wash!!!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for fighting acne or just to get your mug clean!</li>
            <li>Seems to clean pretty well</li>
            <li>It smells great and does its job, but it is a little on the pricey side.</li>
            <li>For me, I enjoy the \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; feeling , but may be too much for some people.  </li>
            <li>This really smooth n gentle.</li>
            <li>I bought him a few fancy products to try, but nothing made him happy.</li>
            <li>Works great for these harsh conditions while overseas</li>
            <li>This face wash was great, i had a few pimples on my face before using it.</li>
            <li>As a college guy that suffers from Acne, I have been on the hunt for a good face wash that, as a guy, would be happy to use.</li>
            <li>The pores on my face seem to shrink after they are scrubbed with that minty fresh feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>leaves a fresh feeling after you rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>There is a tingling in your pores and a fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and it has kept my face clear and kept my skin looking healthy</li>
            <li>it cleans and makes my face feel fresh</li>
            <li>I think I can call that success.</li>
            <li>Your face will feel fresh and awake your senses.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have found most face cleaners to be too abrasive.  </li>
            <li>but it is fresh in the morning or when you feel ur face is sticky</li>
            <li>but I always seem to get acne more frequently when I use this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times so far; and each time, I&#x27;ve been impressed.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin and gives a nice tingling clean.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face wash for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s simple but effective.</li>
            <li>IE I have more frequent and noticeable blemishes using this face wash.</li>
            <li>the fresh scent&lt;br /&gt;Feel rejuvenated after using</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great; it doesn&#x27;t burn your face whatsoever and doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all (for normal skin).  </li>
            <li>Cleanses thoroughly, rinses off easily, smells nice and keep my face less oily longer.</li>
            <li>I felt really clean and really</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I am most definitely not a face wash aficionado.</li>
            <li>Takes too much gel to get clean.</li>
            <li>This type of tube is generally used for thicker fluids/creams, and I felt that the Neutrogena was more suited to a pump</li>
            <li>Although this wash isn&#x27;t for acne skin, it feels great and lathers well with a small amount.</li>
            <li>so you can really feel the deep cleansing and refreshing effects on your skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad other people are having good results with it, I definitely didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>which is a good thing because you will know when you get a new one, if you ever get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is like a old man (30&#x27;s) wedding smell or what i call it, a manly smell.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t clean deep on first use, just removes surface oil and makes it feel clean, cool, and minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave me overly dry.</li>
            <li>Tried this facial cleanser as a more economical alternative to the pricier stuff.</li>
            <li>This really does go on smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and no mess.</li>
            <li>After doing some research I found a much better one that works a little better and is much cheeper.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of keeping your skin clean, even down deep!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Washes well enough, but for me there are too many chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>but this one really makes my face pop!</li>
            <li>I first got this</li>
            <li>I suggest using a wash cloth with this but make sure the wash cloth/hand towel is for your face only</li>
            <li>The first time I used this face wash</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite listerine for your face, but it&#x27;s better than standard facewash IMO.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many face-washing products and this one is in the middle of the pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product since it came pretty soon.</li>
            <li>very invigorating  for my husband&#x27;s skin!</li>
            <li>I feel in love instantly!</li>
            <li>Bought several more tubes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, it&#x27;s pretty sticky.</li>
            <li>no expensive</li>
            <li>I was expecting this stuff to make me pretty.</li>
            <li>The only reason I even tried this product out of all the face washes was because my favorite magazine (Mens Health).  </li>
            <li>HAHA!</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this face wash is that it gives an icy cool, tingling sensation while you apply it, which lasts for a couple minutes after each use</li>
            <li>Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried after trying several face washes.</li>
            <li>I found Kiehls facial fuel and citaphil to be a better product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant enough to use that I actually do so every day.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty nice product</li>
            <li>I will certainly be buying more Neutrogena Men products in the future!</li>
            <li>It feels like any other soap but with a nice menthol tingle.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty strong and cologne-ish  at first, but it doesn&#x27;t last after rinsing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it if you&#x27;re looking for a decent morning face wash.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt it would last a while since you really do only need a dime sized blob to get a good lather</li>
            <li>so my only thought though it worked phenomenally on my face that the effect on my hands was too much.  </li>
            <li>Works good burns a little!</li>
            <li>I love any kind of product that leaves me feeling minty fresh, and this face wash has a chilling effect on your face.</li>
            <li>But the menthol is a bit much, kind of intense especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>pretty much made me break out even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Using this for the first time it was almost too much for me.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll definitely feel the cool invigoration as soon as this cleansing solution hits your face!</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing, but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li>A lot of people don&#x27;t know that most of these face cleaners will inadvertently dry out your face.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I think this prevents less acne build up, and does virtually nothing to acne once it has surfaced.</li>
            <li>this product is okay for those with oily facial conditions like me, relatively strong, makes skin really dry, it got a reasonable price anyway</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reduced blemishes a little on first day and was very happy but 2nd and 3rd days it showed hell literally</li>
            <li>Most brands over dry or sting from too much alcohol.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be very effective, I was surprised because I never had any past experience with this brand</li>
            <li>strongly recommend this to everyone - and I usually don&#x27;t recommend and review products like this! :)</li>
            <li>but I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This really gives me a punch in the face.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the rundown:  Scent: a distinctly masculine odor that&#x27;s fresh but not overdone</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day.</li>
            <li>This cleans really well</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t take much at all.  </li>
            <li>real winner for me is the cooling, tingling feel.</li>
            <li>This face wash completely cleans out all the pores in my face, and leaves it with a fresh and &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li>I would say I really like this product, hence the four stars.</li>
            <li>I really like the invigorating factor of it as well.</li>
            <li>But why do they not indicate as much on the label?</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>This has been a fantastic product for daily use.</li>
            <li>It really feels invigorating when you wash your face.</li>
            <li>Too much fragrance.</li>
            <li>I really cannot tell whether it really works</li>
            <li>After doing much research and reading a review by user&#x27;s in Men&#x27;s Health</li>
            <li>It has really helped my skin.</li>
            <li>It lasted me a while, but I can see how people would think it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s really about how much you use and how often you wash your face.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need to use as much product.  </li>
            <li>I have a very oily nose, and it removes that layer</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with the Gentle Scrub as well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Way too much hype for what it is.</li>
            <li>It really burns if a bit gets in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works...  </li>
            <li>I dont use face wash that often and enjoy it, but this is different.</li>
            <li>I very like the scent of this face wash</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very manly and cleans the face without over drying</li>
            <li>When I do, I don&#x27;t experience the dryness as much.</li>
            <li>May be too much for all you sissy boys who like using your girlfriends face wash.</li>
            <li>Since personally the experience of using it is almost as important as the results per se</li>
            <li>Clears my acne really well and smoothes my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the smell and \\&quot;invigorating\\</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash because of the smell and the minty feeling it leaves on the skin.</li>
            <li>but I find too much comes out as soon as you tip into your hand.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my son and he really likes the product.</li>
            <li>The good news is that this product is neither overpriced (at least on Amazon) nor inferior.  </li>
            <li>just plain face wash with a nice scent, but</li>
            <li>I found my hands to start becoming seriously dry and skin to start peeling.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really seem to clean that deep.</li>
            <li>Really helps clean my face, I&#x27;m 29, male and suffer from oily skin.</li>
            <li>More highly scented than I expected.</li>
            <li>However, I would still recommend Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scurb over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:B004NU44BY Neutrogena Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scrub, 4.2 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can create a layer to keep further clean.</li>
            <li>My face is left CLEAN.</li>
            <li>Feel squeaky clean regularly</li>
            <li>This is not necessarily better than the others, but I love it because of a fresh and icey feel on the skin while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>After washing it off my face, my skin feels clean, open and recharged.  </li>
            <li>, I rotate between this and super moisturizing Vitamin B face wash which does a good job moisturizing but is 10x as expensive.</li>
            <li>I would not have bought this in the first place if the product attempted to make this at all clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 30 year old guy and this is the first face wash I found that I&#x27;ve stuck with.</li>
            <li>After washing off your face instantly feels refreshed and cool.</li>
            <li>ill go back to paying top dollar for the good stuff</li>
            <li>It gives a satisfying tingly feeling when using it, but I don&#x27;t really notice much difference over traditional body gel or soap in the long run.</li>
            <li>Finish: leaves skin feeling oil-free, smooth, and perhaps a bit dry, depending on your skin type.  </li>
            <li>The cooling effect from the menthol lasts for about half an hour, but it is refreshing in the morning.</li>
            <li>OK, it is \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; and gives off a slightly tingly feeling</li>
            <li>The smell I noticed is very similar to Old Spice&#x27;s Smooth Blast scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>personal favorite in this category is Kiehl&#x27;s Facial Fuel.</li>
            <li>I love how this product smells, but I try to use it only when I actually need it</li>
            <li>It has a vibrant cooling sensation that indescribably refreshes your senses and awakens you.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different face washes over the years, and this is definitely in regular rotation (disclaimer: my friend, the makeup artist, explained that switching skincare products every 3-6 months is beneficial for your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman in my 20s with mostly normal skin and occasional mild acne.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the cleaning power, it helps clear my blackheads much better than soap with no real scrubbing, and not drying my face too much, follow the directions.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this stuff highly.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the product to anyone who needs a face wash</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I like it, And highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this face wash.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Very soft, foamy, lathers up very well, literally needs only a dime size amount, leaves your skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Because of the strong initial scent, I don&#x27;t recommend it to those with sensitive noses, and I can&#x27;t say how sensitive skin would react.</li>
            <li>I wish it would lather up a little better, but I can deal with that.  </li>
            <li>My husband is very picky about the products he will use because he has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It has not broken out his sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I noticed that this is pretty much the only face wash that doesn&#x27;t make my face ashy and it works well!</li>
            <li>I love using this product actually since every thing else I seemed to use would make my skin feel too dry.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t dry out a man&#x27;s skin as many of these off-the-shelf cleansers do.</li>
            <li>but honestly I don&#x27;t think that is what the word is intended to mean.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s right up there next to Biotherm Face Cleansing Gel.  </li>
            <li>This facial wash does a great job of deep cleansing and it requires very little product during each use.</li>
            <li>I have used more expensive products from the mall and higher brands, but I love this product more than any other products I have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, my face has been getting cleaner (less pimples) after the use of this product.</li>
            <li>thought i would try something new...</li>
            <li>ensure that I apply e-vitamin cream to keep the newly exfoliated skin supple and</li>
            <li>I still had new pimples on my  face evening after using the product.</li>
            <li>Not too rough and feels clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>It dries my face a bit too much for the liking, so if you have sensitive skin, go for the Clearasil or Nivea Men sensitive facewashes.</li>
            <li>(Thus, it doesn&#x27;t compete with my other girly scented products and I don&#x27;t walk around smelling particularly masculine, so I&#x27;d say this face wash is fine for</li>
            <li>Then I used it for a week and my skin was clear as air!</li>
            <li>(though for those first weeks I recommend some Gold Bond Extra Strength lotion!)</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My advice is if you are looking for a face wash that this should definitely be one of the first you should try because you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an inexpensive alternative to higher end facial soaps.  </li>
            <li>My face cleared up within a couple of days and it definitely has an overall clean appearance.</li>
            <li>translucent blue gel produces a lasting cooling effect and has an energizing, cologne-like scent that&#x27;s clean and masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also smells amazing, leaving a faint clean shaven smell similar to aftershave.  </li>
            <li>After using it, my face is really oil-free and having no dry feeling.</li>
            <li>After rinsing, my face feels very clean, and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; slick feeling.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena face wash feels cool on my skin, mainly due to the menthol.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I found this on amazon because it was basically half the price of the neutrogena face wash I&#x27;ve used for about a decade, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clear and wakes me up in the morning.</li>
            <li>But I have found face washes that were clearly inferior to the rest, and I have found face washes that were ludicrously overpriced.</li>
            <li>Leaving your face dry and clean makes it well prepped for facial lotion or moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This brand is one I trust for all health and beauty products, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised that even their men&#x27;s facial cleanser really does what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li>I used to wash my face twice a day to keep my face clear.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been this clear.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to smell then I would pass.</li>
            <li>As far as that signifying that it is &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;, I have no idea.</li>
            <li>I have a naturally oily skin, hence I need a face wash that can get rid of the access oil without over drying.  </li>
            <li>I also like feeling the tiny beads on my face when I am scrubbing because I feel like my face is really cleansed and exfoliated somehow.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is masculine and light--my wife likes it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have highly sensitive skin, I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li>After using this face wash I am elated that my old wash was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I use this about once or twice a week only because it feels like I&#x27;m getting a real treat for my face.  </li>
            <li>in mind as this product vacuums all the natural oils out of your pores that your body will try to restore that moisture, which means it will overly produce oils and make your face look as greasy as the bottom of a pizza box by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Sensitive Face Wash works well.</li>
            <li>I gave it a few days and actually enjoy using this now.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this may not be for you, but I like the way my face feels after using it.  </li>
            <li>do not waste your money on it</li>
            <li>Its like a soft breeze is blowing at you yet</li>
            <li>I would recommend it it but don&#x27;t use to frequent as it kinda dries the skin.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t get the big deal.</li>
            <li>Try this for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive, but worth it,</li>
            <li>For the few bucks this costs it&#x27;s worth a try - you may like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I use neutrogena face wash daily for six months it&#x27;s making my face fresh and deep cleaning 100% recommend ...</li>
            <li>Not too impressed, but don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not kidding about the &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34; part, and honestly I found it a bit irritating.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a ton of the face wash and it should last a while since I only use enough to clean my face twice a day.</li>
            <li>With my oily skin I have found that most face washes either dry my face out completely or leave a not clean oily feeling on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have found this gem inbetween other brands such as Dove and Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
            <li>Only use once in a while now when out of my main face exfoliating soap</li>
            <li>This is my first regular facial wash</li>
            <li>No one says I&#x27;m looking younger but no one says I&#x27;m looking older.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is there is a strong menthol smell that takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin and general problems with acne.</li>
            <li>The wash is a fantastic choice for men looking to improve their usual regimen without having to keep around products they might feel embarrassed about.</li>
            <li>Seems to clean deep down well.  </li>
            <li>With the winter drying out my skin and how my skin can get oily while sleeping, this product works very well in cleaning the skin and yet, doesn&#x27;t make it dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several face washes and this is my least favorite.  </li>
            <li>- The \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; feature of this cleaner is very menthol-like and actually burns my eyes unless I spend extra time rinsing and scrubbing my face with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I find that I have to use half a palm&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>Before I start this review, I have to say that reviewing skin care products is a pointless exercise, as everyone&#x27;s skin is unique.</li>
            <li>For some reason I was breaking out again after not getting any major breakouts for a while....</li>
            <li>and I have yet to have a major breakout since.</li>
            <li>It does make my face a little dry after but that&#x27;s easily remedied with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face wash for my tough skin.</li>
            <li>After using Clean &amp; Clear daily face wash for the past 11 years</li>
            <li>But I have no idea if it works as I didnt use it for long enough and never saw much of a difference in the time I did use it.</li>
            <li>but the liquids inside it is actually blue, and the container is actually clear.</li>
            <li>Im in my late 20s, asian american, generally speaking i dont get too many pimples</li>
            <li>It cleans without overdrying and leaves my skin ready for a wet shave once I get out.  </li>
            <li>recommended for sensitive skin and essential for pre shave</li>
            <li>So far this is the only one I would use&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>reminds me of the old product SeaBreeze only a gel form.</li>
            <li>Despite me having lots of stress and sleepless nights due to the military lifestyle, my acne has reduced significantly.</li>
            <li>A pretty standard face wash for every day use and works as I expected.</li>
            <li>My face feels fresh but no over dried.  </li>
            <li>Not great for reducing acne since there are stronger and better products out there.</li>
            <li>Additionally, its price is reasonable comparing to other peers.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything special about this product versus any other basic soap plus it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li>I switched to CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser, which I&#x27;ve also been really happy with, but I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using it daily for the last 2 weeks and so far no complaints to report.</li>
            <li>It is a normal face wash, no surprising, no disappointment.</li>
            <li>Also the consistency of the gel has a tendency of slipping right off your wet hands onto the shower floor.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin while keeping my skin clear.</li>
            <li>This face wash seems to be the real deal - leaves a slight tingle on the face because of the eucalyptus oil in it  -</li>
            <li>/&gt;The squeeze-tube is extremely easy to use, but I find that the wash gel is too thin and tends to drip a bit when you squeeze it out.</li>
            <li>My husband has a beard, and sensitive skin that can get very dry.</li>
            <li>Not exactly what I expected, the cooling minty feel is a little too strong for me.</li>

            <li> It smells great, leaves your face feeling cool and refreshing after every use, and clears your skin.</li>

            <li> Despite that, this is a good one to clean face.</li>
            <li> The top has a habit of breaking off very easily.</li>
            <li> If you have mild to no acne, this is a great product for a clean face!</li>
            <li> I love this product mainly because it&#x27;s incredibly affordable.  </li>
            <li> I liked the feel it gave me, a nice cool feeling on your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s currently my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> I do love Neutrogena shower gel and bar soap--but, not this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I find myself having to use not dime sized, but quarter or more...</li>
            <li> It is definitely invigorating, perfect for the morning \\&quot;wake-up shower\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes you feel after you rinse it off</li>
            <li> is my favorite face wash found to date.</li>
            <li> But it does run out very quicly and the price isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> I switched this up from some Clearasil face wash and in 2 days, many of my pimples cleared away.</li>
            <li> I felt like it gave me more acne</li>
            <li> Cleans well and feels refreshing and invigorating as indicated by the product name.</li>
            <li> The scent is better than any cologne or aftershave.</li>
            <li> , it was interesting however.</li>
            <li> and I have never felt better about my face.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for much more in a face wash.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully they will resolve this issue so that we can buy with greater confidence.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this until I find something I like better.</li>
            <li> this face wash it seemed as if i had gotten more pimples..</li>
            <li> There is some kind of menthol at work here which leaves a temporary light cooling on the face.</li>
            <li> My husband love these product.</li>
            <li> I hope they stock up some more.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  </li>
            <li> Love the beads, don&#x27;t love the product density.</li>
            <li> I know this makes it so we have to buy more</li>
            <li> It was okay from day 1 to 3</li>
            <li> Face felt much better after using this product.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using for about a week now and seems to really love it.</li>
            <li> I have used so many products</li>
            <li> and I love the cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> I like the Neutrogena better.</li>
            <li> Really refreshing.</li>
            <li> However, I would really love it if it came as a scrub too.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> They need to user a more impact resistant plastic formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Squeeze container is a hassle to use compared to Neutrogena pump soap which I like a lot more.</li>
            <li> Actually the best one I&#x27;ve tried is sold on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My face is under better control now since using it</li>
            <li> I have not found a better mens facewash.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;-you have to use more</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do when I found that it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Now I know most people would say that it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;Invigorate\\&quot; to the point of waking you up</li>
            <li> I could not imagine a better deal.  </li>
            <li> Really refreshing face wash.</li>
            <li> I do recommend product for a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> Glad to do business with you.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve gotta try out multiple products to see what works best for you.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> If the sight of skin flaking off your face is invigorating, then sure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Try to aim toward a product that uses a SLS alternative; they are typically much more forgiving on the face.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> This face wash feels great when I use it in the shower, has a scent and tingle that really helps you wake up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last couple years, and I find it the best job for the price.</li>
            <li> There are better choices out there, but not under $10.</li>
            <li> /&gt;An all-around a great buy.</li>
            <li> Keep it up and make sure the availability is there in all stores.</li>
            <li> As a woman I have experimented with countless face wash products and had yet to find the perfect one.</li>
            <li> I just wish it would lather a bit more.</li>

            <li> I needed a couple more dollars to qualify for Amazon&#x27;s Free shipping and since I needed a new face wash, decided to purchase this Neutrogena product based on the good reviews it has received.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST face wash I&#x27;ve ever used, it cleans my face very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Recommend it to any guy wanting a clean refreshing face wash</li>
            <li> The clarifying formula gets skin squeaky clean and cuts oiliness, but doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling stripped or tight—a notable plus for a guy who doesn&#x27;t stock his medicine cabinet with face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love it, makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li> bottle is easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the menthol wasn&#x27;t almost overpowering for some, but I kind of like it to be honest.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is overly strong.</li>
            <li> good facial wash, nice quality and ouptut.</li>
            <li> I like it, but if the scent of it wasn&#x27;t too strong, I would have given it a 5 star rating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This face wash is just a gel, no grit, strong smell, and creates lots of foam.</li>
            <li> If you have acne, use strong benzyl peroxide (5-10%).</li>
            <li> way to strong smelling</li>
            <li> The cleanser foams very easily in your hands and leaves your face feeling fresh and revitalized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After washing your face with this product, you face has a cool sensation to it and your face becomes smooth!</li>
            <li> And I love the cool feeling when I use this product.</li>
            <li> I love the COOL feeling it leaves and it will wake you up.</li>
            <li> Ok, not bad at all</li>
            <li> Maybe this is not just right for my skin because it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> feels very refreshing and minty and keeps my face feeling fresh, very effective at washing dirt/oil off my face after a long work day</li>
            <li> Gets the job fine.</li>
            <li> people said to watch for it being damaged but mine came just fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years, and I love the refreshing cool sensation right after I use them.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but feel that women have a huge selection when it comes to face washes but not guys.</li>
            <li> Just added on to purchase to get free shipping</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great and deep cleaning</li>
            <li> I enjoy the tingling feeling on my face while it opens pores and washes all the crud out.</li>
            <li> It was quite cheap as well.</li>
            <li> being said, I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> it does its work as a face wash, and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, in my case, this stuff acted like a cheap bar of soap with a touch of menthol added to it.</li>
            <li> The reason: Sodium lauryl sulfate, a detergent used in everything from cheap soap to engine degreaser --</li>
            <li> All that I have left to say is it works great</li>
            <li> Now i&#x27;m almost blackhead free.</li>
            <li> Even though  I am a women, I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> It also has a great scent, similar to aftershave.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> The Nivea face wash seems to be by far the superior product.</li>
            <li> Face feels super clean and tingly!</li>
            <li> Especially right under my eyes, I guess my skin is more sensitive there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a face wash that I felt was far superior to the rest, and I don&#x27;t think that this one is particularly special.</li>
            <li> The wash has a very smooth texture, and it does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li> Face feels clean and smooth after use.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no &amp;#34;scrubbing action&amp;#34;, like no grit or anything like some products, so it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Gives you a cooling effect and leaves my face clean and free of oil.</li>
            <li> This is my first month of using the product, but I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li> works great at cleaning your face after a long day of work.</li>
            <li> i like them, made my face feel soooooooooooooooo fresh!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how cool and refreshed my face feels after using this.</li>
            <li> I had to hurry and buy my own because my daddy was tired of me sneaking into his lol :)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure it worsened the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> Since I began using this product, I have noticed that the appearance of my pores has diminished and it has helped significantly with my overly oily skin issues.</li>
            <li> Smells good when I wash my face, and apparently the smell lingers (but, come on, between cologne and deodorant</li>
            <li> feels cool clean and dirt free.</li>
            <li> Like i&#x27;d use this, and while my face feels clean, my pores are still junked up</li>
            <li> ti actually clean well or what.</li>
            <li> and it leaves your face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> After you use this, you know your face is clean.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;It left a tingling sensation&amp;#34; he said when he washed it off with warm water after application and the refreshing feel stayed for an hour.</li>
            <li> You can feel the clean after every use.  </li>
            <li> Face feels really clean too after using it.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that after using it that my face feels clean every time.  </li>
            <li> Seems to clean my face without over drying.  </li>
            <li> my face is clean.</li>
            <li> The menthol in this makes your face tingle and feel really clean.  </li>
            <li> You face feels so clean after using it</li>
            <li> The smell is clean without being medicinal or overly perfumed.  </li>
            <li> I think there are cheaper ways to clean your face without making it feel like you just had some sort of chemical spray.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t feel it can clean your face well.</li>
            <li> thought i&#x27;d get a face wash just to keep my face clean and pristine and this product has done that.  </li>
            <li> if I can confirm that it has ever &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; me but it does help to keep me clean.</li>
            <li> My face is clean, it does not smeel like I just used a girls face wash.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Men Invigorating Face Wash helped clean me up.</li>
            <li> keeps my face clean and invigorated all day.</li>
            <li> After rinsing, my face is clean with a tingly refreshed feel.</li>
            <li> how clean I feel after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It lathers for a good facial massage, and leaves your skin feeling smooth once you rinse it off.</li>
            <li> very good, not too tight after washing</li>
            <li> He found this face wash to be super cool and refreshing to the skin the first time he used it.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was anything special.  </li>
            <li> It cleans and prevents oily skin really well, while leaving your face feeling incredibly clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li> : minty, crisp, clean!</li>
            <li> good daily use product.</li>
            <li> I do look the cool sensation I get on my face after washing.  </li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;intense menthol\\&quot; feeling, but I love it.  </li>
            <li> Overall it is a good facewash, i like how refreshed my face feels after i use it.</li>
            <li> After rinsing it off, there was a really cool sensation that just smacked my face.</li>
            <li> and that wasn&#x27;t cool</li>
            <li> so my pillow isn&#x27;t full of dirt and oil.  </li>
            <li> Refreshingly cool.</li>
            <li> You really have to rub a dub dub to get it to lather up at all.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> but once a month is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I will wash my face and leave the cleanser on my face for a minute or so to get the full effect of that cool menthol feel.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s good, but I might not want to buy this again.</li>
            <li> This lasted me a full semester at school.</li>
            <li> Nice 2/3 clear tube.</li>
            <li> 5 Star all the way, only good things.</li>
            <li> Good daily facewash, use it in the morning during shower.</li>
            <li> Has a cool feeling to it when scrabbing your face.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take an expert on deduction to realize it&#x27;s just not as good as the neutrogena exfoliating blue scrub , so</li>
            <li> This is such a good product that I am also going to try and write a review on Neutrogena&#x27;s site.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the cleaning aspect it feels really cool on the face and the freshness lingers for hours.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> This facewash will wake you up, and leave your skin feeling refreshed with its cool, minty feeling.</li>
            <li> And I feel so cool to wash face by this product.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and you can really feel it working with the cool sensation it leaves on your face.</li>
            <li> The strong scent doesn&#x27;t bother me very much, but if you are allergic to any type of perfumes/fragrances, you might want to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many face washes (Clearasil, Nivea, other Neutrogena face washes) but the best ones consistently Asian brands.  </li>
            <li> Available at your supermarket (or, of course, right</li>
            <li> Packaging: container is stable and easy to use; the plastic is strong enough that the top shouldn&#x27;t crack off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried clean and clear morning burst, and it didn&#x27;t give me that awake and alert feeling, and neutrogena acne wash was too strong and irritated and dried my skin, but this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> The menthol makes your face feel cool, fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li> I give this an easy 5-stars, since it does the rest as good as any other that I have used and</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean all the time.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a tingly feeling when using this item and always leaves me feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean as soon as I use it.  </li>
            <li> After using this your face will fill clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the clean fresh &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feelings fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> but it disappears with another quick wash of the face after the cleaning.</li>
            <li> But you face is quick to recover.</li>
            <li> Overall he think that its a good product but maybe not the right one for him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap, Biore, Clearasil and many other scrubs before but this one is easily one of the bests.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also burns more than normal soap if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> It is currently cheap and agrees pretty well to my face, but that is not all.  </li>
            <li> Definitely feels very refreshing.</li>
            <li> It leaves you with a cool, crisp, clean feeling after washing it off.  </li>
            <li> Easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li> I really like that it has a menthol-like refreshening afterburn, but it is too strong for me, and it lasts for about 30 minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, leaves your face well cleaned and tingly, not oily or dry.</li>
            <li> Does a good job and does not make your face feel to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in gelatin form, is easy to use and lathers on very well.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this cleans my face any better than my other face wash (Nuetrogena Gentle Cleanse), but it smells great.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Did the job well and am willing to stick with this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this face wash!!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for fighting acne or just to get your mug clean!</li>
            <li> Seems to clean pretty well</li>
            <li> It smells great and does its job, but it is a little on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> For me, I enjoy the \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; feeling , but may be too much for some people.  </li>
            <li> This really smooth n gentle.</li>
            <li> I bought him a few fancy products to try, but nothing made him happy.</li>
            <li> Works great for these harsh conditions while overseas</li>
            <li> This face wash was great, i had a few pimples on my face before using it.</li>
            <li> As a college guy that suffers from Acne, I have been on the hunt for a good face wash that, as a guy, would be happy to use.</li>
            <li> The pores on my face seem to shrink after they are scrubbed with that minty fresh feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> leaves a fresh feeling after you rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> There is a tingling in your pores and a fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> and it has kept my face clear and kept my skin looking healthy</li>
            <li> it cleans and makes my face feel fresh</li>
            <li> I think I can call that success.</li>
            <li> Your face will feel fresh and awake your senses.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have found most face cleaners to be too abrasive.  </li>
            <li> but it is fresh in the morning or when you feel ur face is sticky</li>
            <li> but I always seem to get acne more frequently when I use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times so far; and each time, I&#x27;ve been impressed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin and gives a nice tingling clean.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s simple but effective.</li>
            <li> IE I have more frequent and noticeable blemishes using this face wash.</li>
            <li> the fresh scent&lt;br /&gt;Feel rejuvenated after using</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great; it doesn&#x27;t burn your face whatsoever and doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all (for normal skin).  </li>
            <li> Cleanses thoroughly, rinses off easily, smells nice and keep my face less oily longer.</li>
            <li> I felt really clean and really</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I am most definitely not a face wash aficionado.</li>
            <li> Takes too much gel to get clean.</li>
            <li> This type of tube is generally used for thicker fluids/creams, and I felt that the Neutrogena was more suited to a pump</li>
            <li> Although this wash isn&#x27;t for acne skin, it feels great and lathers well with a small amount.</li>
            <li> so you can really feel the deep cleansing and refreshing effects on your skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad other people are having good results with it, I definitely didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> which is a good thing because you will know when you get a new one, if you ever get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is like a old man (30&#x27;s) wedding smell or what i call it, a manly smell.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t clean deep on first use, just removes surface oil and makes it feel clean, cool, and minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave me overly dry.</li>
            <li> Tried this facial cleanser as a more economical alternative to the pricier stuff.</li>
            <li> This really does go on smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and no mess.</li>
            <li> After doing some research I found a much better one that works a little better and is much cheeper.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of keeping your skin clean, even down deep!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Washes well enough, but for me there are too many chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> but this one really makes my face pop!</li>
            <li> I first got this</li>
            <li> I suggest using a wash cloth with this but make sure the wash cloth/hand towel is for your face only</li>
            <li> The first time I used this face wash</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite listerine for your face, but it&#x27;s better than standard facewash IMO.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many face-washing products and this one is in the middle of the pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product since it came pretty soon.</li>
            <li> very invigorating  for my husband&#x27;s skin!</li>
            <li> I feel in love instantly!</li>
            <li> Bought several more tubes.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, it&#x27;s pretty sticky.</li>
            <li> no expensive</li>
            <li> I was expecting this stuff to make me pretty.</li>
            <li> The only reason I even tried this product out of all the face washes was because my favorite magazine (Mens Health).  </li>
            <li> HAHA!</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this face wash is that it gives an icy cool, tingling sensation while you apply it, which lasts for a couple minutes after each use</li>
            <li> Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried after trying several face washes.</li>
            <li> I found Kiehls facial fuel and citaphil to be a better product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pleasant enough to use that I actually do so every day.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty nice product</li>
            <li> I will certainly be buying more Neutrogena Men products in the future!</li>
            <li> It feels like any other soap but with a nice menthol tingle.</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty strong and cologne-ish  at first, but it doesn&#x27;t last after rinsing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth it if you&#x27;re looking for a decent morning face wash.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt it would last a while since you really do only need a dime sized blob to get a good lather</li>
            <li> so my only thought though it worked phenomenally on my face that the effect on my hands was too much.  </li>
            <li> Works good burns a little!</li>
            <li> I love any kind of product that leaves me feeling minty fresh, and this face wash has a chilling effect on your face.</li>
            <li> But the menthol is a bit much, kind of intense especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> pretty much made me break out even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Using this for the first time it was almost too much for me.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitely feel the cool invigoration as soon as this cleansing solution hits your face!</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing, but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> A lot of people don&#x27;t know that most of these face cleaners will inadvertently dry out your face.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I think this prevents less acne build up, and does virtually nothing to acne once it has surfaced.</li>
            <li> this product is okay for those with oily facial conditions like me, relatively strong, makes skin really dry, it got a reasonable price anyway</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reduced blemishes a little on first day and was very happy but 2nd and 3rd days it showed hell literally</li>
            <li> Most brands over dry or sting from too much alcohol.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very effective, I was surprised because I never had any past experience with this brand</li>
            <li> strongly recommend this to everyone - and I usually don&#x27;t recommend and review products like this! :)</li>
            <li> but I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This really gives me a punch in the face.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the rundown:  Scent: a distinctly masculine odor that&#x27;s fresh but not overdone</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day.</li>
            <li> This cleans really well</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t take much at all.  </li>
            <li> real winner for me is the cooling, tingling feel.</li>
            <li> This face wash completely cleans out all the pores in my face, and leaves it with a fresh and &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> I would say I really like this product, hence the four stars.</li>
            <li> I really like the invigorating factor of it as well.</li>
            <li> But why do they not indicate as much on the label?</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> This has been a fantastic product for daily use.</li>
            <li> It really feels invigorating when you wash your face.</li>
            <li> Too much fragrance.</li>
            <li> I really cannot tell whether it really works</li>
            <li> After doing much research and reading a review by user&#x27;s in Men&#x27;s Health</li>
            <li> It has really helped my skin.</li>
            <li> It lasted me a while, but I can see how people would think it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s really about how much you use and how often you wash your face.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need to use as much product.  </li>
            <li> I have a very oily nose, and it removes that layer</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with the Gentle Scrub as well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Way too much hype for what it is.</li>
            <li> It really burns if a bit gets in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works...  </li>
            <li> I dont use face wash that often and enjoy it, but this is different.</li>
            <li> I very like the scent of this face wash</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very manly and cleans the face without over drying</li>
            <li> When I do, I don&#x27;t experience the dryness as much.</li>
            <li> May be too much for all you sissy boys who like using your girlfriends face wash.</li>
            <li> Since personally the experience of using it is almost as important as the results per se</li>
            <li> Clears my acne really well and smoothes my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and \\&quot;invigorating\\</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash because of the smell and the minty feeling it leaves on the skin.</li>
            <li> but I find too much comes out as soon as you tip into your hand.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son and he really likes the product.</li>
            <li> The good news is that this product is neither overpriced (at least on Amazon) nor inferior.  </li>
            <li> just plain face wash with a nice scent, but</li>
            <li> I found my hands to start becoming seriously dry and skin to start peeling.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really seem to clean that deep.</li>
            <li> Really helps clean my face, I&#x27;m 29, male and suffer from oily skin.</li>
            <li> More highly scented than I expected.</li>
            <li> However, I would still recommend Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scurb over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :B004NU44BY Neutrogena Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scrub, 4.2 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can create a layer to keep further clean.</li>
            <li> My face is left CLEAN.</li>
            <li> Feel squeaky clean regularly</li>
            <li> This is not necessarily better than the others, but I love it because of a fresh and icey feel on the skin while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> After washing it off my face, my skin feels clean, open and recharged.  </li>
            <li> , I rotate between this and super moisturizing Vitamin B face wash which does a good job moisturizing but is 10x as expensive.</li>
            <li> I would not have bought this in the first place if the product attempted to make this at all clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old guy and this is the first face wash I found that I&#x27;ve stuck with.</li>
            <li> After washing off your face instantly feels refreshed and cool.</li>
            <li> ill go back to paying top dollar for the good stuff</li>
            <li> It gives a satisfying tingly feeling when using it, but I don&#x27;t really notice much difference over traditional body gel or soap in the long run.</li>
            <li> Finish: leaves skin feeling oil-free, smooth, and perhaps a bit dry, depending on your skin type.  </li>
            <li> The cooling effect from the menthol lasts for about half an hour, but it is refreshing in the morning.</li>
            <li> OK, it is \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; and gives off a slightly tingly feeling</li>
            <li> The smell I noticed is very similar to Old Spice&#x27;s Smooth Blast scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> personal favorite in this category is Kiehl&#x27;s Facial Fuel.</li>
            <li> I love how this product smells, but I try to use it only when I actually need it</li>
            <li> It has a vibrant cooling sensation that indescribably refreshes your senses and awakens you.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different face washes over the years, and this is definitely in regular rotation (disclaimer: my friend, the makeup artist, explained that switching skincare products every 3-6 months is beneficial for your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman in my 20s with mostly normal skin and occasional mild acne.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the cleaning power, it helps clear my blackheads much better than soap with no real scrubbing, and not drying my face too much, follow the directions.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this stuff highly.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the product to anyone who needs a face wash</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like it, And highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this face wash.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very soft, foamy, lathers up very well, literally needs only a dime size amount, leaves your skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Because of the strong initial scent, I don&#x27;t recommend it to those with sensitive noses, and I can&#x27;t say how sensitive skin would react.</li>
            <li> I wish it would lather up a little better, but I can deal with that.  </li>
            <li> My husband is very picky about the products he will use because he has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It has not broken out his sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I noticed that this is pretty much the only face wash that doesn&#x27;t make my face ashy and it works well!</li>
            <li> I love using this product actually since every thing else I seemed to use would make my skin feel too dry.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t dry out a man&#x27;s skin as many of these off-the-shelf cleansers do.</li>
            <li> but honestly I don&#x27;t think that is what the word is intended to mean.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s right up there next to Biotherm Face Cleansing Gel.  </li>
            <li> This facial wash does a great job of deep cleansing and it requires very little product during each use.</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive products from the mall and higher brands, but I love this product more than any other products I have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, my face has been getting cleaner (less pimples) after the use of this product.</li>
            <li> thought i would try something new...</li>
            <li> ensure that I apply e-vitamin cream to keep the newly exfoliated skin supple and</li>
            <li> I still had new pimples on my  face evening after using the product.</li>
            <li> Not too rough and feels clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> It dries my face a bit too much for the liking, so if you have sensitive skin, go for the Clearasil or Nivea Men sensitive facewashes.</li>
            <li> (Thus, it doesn&#x27;t compete with my other girly scented products and I don&#x27;t walk around smelling particularly masculine, so I&#x27;d say this face wash is fine for</li>
            <li> Then I used it for a week and my skin was clear as air!</li>
            <li> (though for those first weeks I recommend some Gold Bond Extra Strength lotion!)</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My advice is if you are looking for a face wash that this should definitely be one of the first you should try because you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive alternative to higher end facial soaps.  </li>
            <li> My face cleared up within a couple of days and it definitely has an overall clean appearance.</li>
            <li> translucent blue gel produces a lasting cooling effect and has an energizing, cologne-like scent that&#x27;s clean and masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also smells amazing, leaving a faint clean shaven smell similar to aftershave.  </li>
            <li> After using it, my face is really oil-free and having no dry feeling.</li>
            <li> After rinsing, my face feels very clean, and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; slick feeling.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena face wash feels cool on my skin, mainly due to the menthol.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I found this on amazon because it was basically half the price of the neutrogena face wash I&#x27;ve used for about a decade, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clear and wakes me up in the morning.</li>
            <li> But I have found face washes that were clearly inferior to the rest, and I have found face washes that were ludicrously overpriced.</li>
            <li> Leaving your face dry and clean makes it well prepped for facial lotion or moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This brand is one I trust for all health and beauty products, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised that even their men&#x27;s facial cleanser really does what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li> I used to wash my face twice a day to keep my face clear.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been this clear.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to smell then I would pass.</li>
            <li> As far as that signifying that it is &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;, I have no idea.</li>
            <li> I have a naturally oily skin, hence I need a face wash that can get rid of the access oil without over drying.  </li>
            <li> I also like feeling the tiny beads on my face when I am scrubbing because I feel like my face is really cleansed and exfoliated somehow.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is masculine and light--my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have highly sensitive skin, I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> After using this face wash I am elated that my old wash was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I use this about once or twice a week only because it feels like I&#x27;m getting a real treat for my face.  </li>
            <li> in mind as this product vacuums all the natural oils out of your pores that your body will try to restore that moisture, which means it will overly produce oils and make your face look as greasy as the bottom of a pizza box by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Sensitive Face Wash works well.</li>
            <li> I gave it a few days and actually enjoy using this now.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this may not be for you, but I like the way my face feels after using it.  </li>
            <li> do not waste your money on it</li>
            <li> Its like a soft breeze is blowing at you yet</li>
            <li> I would recommend it it but don&#x27;t use to frequent as it kinda dries the skin.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t get the big deal.</li>
            <li> Try this for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive, but worth it,</li>
            <li> For the few bucks this costs it&#x27;s worth a try - you may like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I use neutrogena face wash daily for six months it&#x27;s making my face fresh and deep cleaning 100% recommend ...</li>
            <li> Not too impressed, but don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not kidding about the &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34; part, and honestly I found it a bit irritating.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a ton of the face wash and it should last a while since I only use enough to clean my face twice a day.</li>
            <li> With my oily skin I have found that most face washes either dry my face out completely or leave a not clean oily feeling on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have found this gem inbetween other brands such as Dove and Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
            <li> Only use once in a while now when out of my main face exfoliating soap</li>
            <li> This is my first regular facial wash</li>
            <li> No one says I&#x27;m looking younger but no one says I&#x27;m looking older.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is there is a strong menthol smell that takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and general problems with acne.</li>
            <li> The wash is a fantastic choice for men looking to improve their usual regimen without having to keep around products they might feel embarrassed about.</li>
            <li> Seems to clean deep down well.  </li>
            <li> With the winter drying out my skin and how my skin can get oily while sleeping, this product works very well in cleaning the skin and yet, doesn&#x27;t make it dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several face washes and this is my least favorite.  </li>
            <li> - The \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; feature of this cleaner is very menthol-like and actually burns my eyes unless I spend extra time rinsing and scrubbing my face with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I find that I have to use half a palm&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> Before I start this review, I have to say that reviewing skin care products is a pointless exercise, as everyone&#x27;s skin is unique.</li>
            <li> For some reason I was breaking out again after not getting any major breakouts for a while....</li>
            <li> and I have yet to have a major breakout since.</li>
            <li> It does make my face a little dry after but that&#x27;s easily remedied with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash for my tough skin.</li>
            <li> After using Clean &amp; Clear daily face wash for the past 11 years</li>
            <li> But I have no idea if it works as I didnt use it for long enough and never saw much of a difference in the time I did use it.</li>
            <li> but the liquids inside it is actually blue, and the container is actually clear.</li>
            <li> Im in my late 20s, asian american, generally speaking i dont get too many pimples</li>
            <li> It cleans without overdrying and leaves my skin ready for a wet shave once I get out.  </li>
            <li> recommended for sensitive skin and essential for pre shave</li>
            <li> So far this is the only one I would use&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> reminds me of the old product SeaBreeze only a gel form.</li>
            <li> Despite me having lots of stress and sleepless nights due to the military lifestyle, my acne has reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> A pretty standard face wash for every day use and works as I expected.</li>
            <li> My face feels fresh but no over dried.  </li>
            <li> Not great for reducing acne since there are stronger and better products out there.</li>
            <li> Additionally, its price is reasonable comparing to other peers.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything special about this product versus any other basic soap plus it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> I switched to CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser, which I&#x27;ve also been really happy with, but I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily for the last 2 weeks and so far no complaints to report.</li>
            <li> It is a normal face wash, no surprising, no disappointment.</li>
            <li> Also the consistency of the gel has a tendency of slipping right off your wet hands onto the shower floor.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin while keeping my skin clear.</li>
            <li> This face wash seems to be the real deal - leaves a slight tingle on the face because of the eucalyptus oil in it  -</li>
            <li> /&gt;The squeeze-tube is extremely easy to use, but I find that the wash gel is too thin and tends to drip a bit when you squeeze it out.</li>
            <li> My husband has a beard, and sensitive skin that can get very dry.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected, the cooling minty feel is a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve tried out of a variety of face washes, shampoos, and conditioners that leaves my face and beard feeling soft and not too dry all day long.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know if you have to use this constantly for a long period for it</li>
            <li> My beard is getting to be about an inch long and throughout the process of growing it, washing has been essential.</li>
            <li> and even then it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not left feeling dry either.  </li>
            <li> when I open the package, this one seems only a half bottle, and the cover is open.</li>
            <li> Only slight defect is that it can&#x27;t come too close to your eyes, but not a big enough deal where that would stop you from buying.</li>
            <li> from.the expensive to cheap</li>
            <li> It dried my face and didn&#x27;t help clear my skin issues at all.</li>
            <li> Took a bit too long to figure that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as it doesn&#x27;t continue to break him out</li>
            <li> I think he&#x27;ll be using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> The lather really gets down under his beard and removes those dead skin cells that were causing breakouts and beard dandruff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is untransferable to a new container, like a small laboratory style container I had for shampoo when traveling.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a little bit to cover the entire face.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;ve had breakouts and more pimples than anytime in the past ten years</li>
            <li> I feel it cleans my face thoroughly and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.  </li>
            <li> : this isn&#x27;t a moisturizing face wash (those always made my husband break out), so people who complain that their skin gets dry after using this face wash - you should probably follow up with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over dry my face.</li>
            <li> After years and years of searching for a product that does not make my skin itchy and dry.</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money ,too bad what I could get out of tube was good.</li>
            <li> As others mentioned it does dry your face out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out and doesn&#x27;t make my skin flake.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my face out and throughly cleans my pores.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it can leave your face feeling dry.</li>
            <li> and yes it doesn&#x27;t over dry the skin,</li>
            <li> I never get that dry feeling anymore around my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> as i do have oily skin and it makes my skin to dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with psoriasis and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that it can leave you with dry skin.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out</li>
            <li> Leave my skin really really dry afterwards&lt;</li>
            <li> I would buy again if there are no new improved one yet.</li>
            <li> I did not bother to return the item (how do you ship a big wet mess back to Amazon), but I did provide feedback to Amazon about the packaging problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now continuously and haven&#x27;t had a single problem with it.  </li>
            <li> It is double the price but will also last about 4 times longer since you only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Consider Lab Series Power Wash and Jack Black Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I used the Neutrogena Men Acne Wash and it made my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; to wash your face.  </li>
            <li> have a small acne problem, nothing major, but I came from using Cetaphil (which was recommended by dermatologists to me a decade ago) to using this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t, as other reviewers claim, leave my face dry or burn.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry and flaky like some other face washes do.</li>
            <li> but it worked not as much as I expected.</li>
            <li> and I hope every tries this product out to see if it works for them as well.</li>
            <li> I have never really used a face wash before.  </li>
            <li> I actually look forward to using this everyday.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I expected to get out of it</li>
            <li> But rest assured that as other reviewers have said this will leave your face *very* dry.</li>
            <li> However after constant application he found this feeling lasted less and less.</li>
            <li> this is not a good product , don&#x27;t listen to the guys who give 4-5 stars.may be good for them ,but bad for you.</li>
            <li> This face-wash burns ever so slightly and leaves my skin feeling a bit dry.</li>
            <li> Masculine, but subtle and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> It is thicker - less diluted, and doesn&#x27;t make my face dry like the Neutrogena face wash does.</li>
            <li> It is less expensive than the facial cleansers for women and works really well.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> It does not go into other containers.</li>
            <li> Other than that, for the price, product does what it says.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m wide awake!</li>
            <li> IT does feel a little dry though.</li>
            <li> face wash does tend to leave my face a little dry afterwards but it is very minimal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but my local Target has them for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I wanted something made for active men who work out and can&#x27;t wash their face all the time.</li>
            <li> Came opened and spilled all over the Doves men face lotion I bought that was also half empty when I recieved it as if it had been used before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buying it through AMAZON is a real benefit since it is extremely expensive at the drug store.</li>
            <li> The ONLY DRAWBACK here with this product is that it contains parabens which have all sorts of negative connotations.</li>
            <li> but the product not for people with Dark skin I guess.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is it&#x27;s a little pricey compared to other face-washes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly a beauty guru or anything, either, so take my review with a grain of salt!</li>
            <li> A word that was hard to achieve from other products, without leaving my face incredibly dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> If you wash your eyes, keep-em closed tight!</li>
            <li> I paired it with a few other Neutrogena items for Men and a travel bag.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin tingly and tight, but not overly tight, and used with Dermalogica Active Moist</li>
            <li> Not very strong, and not an exfoliating cream/mask,</li>
            <li> My girlfriend doesn&#x27;t mind using it also even though it smells slightly cologney.</li>
            <li> I have yet to see any signs of over-drying and my skin seems to break out a lot less.</li>
            <li> My face has way less breakouts after I started using this face wash.</li>
            <li> I bought two of them but each one just remained half.</li>
            <li> Also helps my skin produce less oil through out the day.</li>
            <li> gets rid of all my black heads, which i use to  have infested all over my face.</li>
            <li> It has a slight tingle/burn to it, that gives you that invigorating feeling.</li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> accidentally dropped a few drops down there</li>
            <li> And a few times he felt the titling sensation escalate into a slightly burning one.</li>
            <li> My husband was a little unsure when I bought this for him</li>
            <li> The scent lingers just a little the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> They did little to no help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just put a little on my fingertips in the shower and washed my face once a day.</li>
            <li> One star removed because maybe it could be a little cheaper?</li>
            <li> Container arrived broken and wash constantly dripping everywhere and making a mess</li>
            <li> I live in a dry area, I workout a lot and have bad acne problems and scars from pimples and black heads on my face.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few face wash</li>
            <li> This face wash was given to me by a friend who tried it and disliked it because the scent was too strong--otherwise I would have never tried this stuff.</li>
            <li> I recommend St. Ives Blackhead Clearing Green Tea Scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the cooling effect because I&#x27;d prefer to know if this stuff has indeed washed my face and cleaned off the surface dead cells of my face.  </li>
            <li> Still using it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Cleans up oily faces and won&#x27;t leave it dried.</li>
            <li> After few uses I am look &amp;#34;100 years&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t  waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> This Face Wash cleans and protects by eliminating build up of dead skin over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I admit I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I know this is probably a deal-breaker for a few.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this product with an acne wash as well, using in combination severely dried out my face.</li>
            <li> Dried up my face like anything .</li>
            <li> I do feel cool on my cheek after washing my face, but doesn&#x27;t erase oil and can&#x27;t keep my face from breaking out :(.</li>
            <li> I find that in order for the face wash to have the &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34; effect, I have to rub it on my face a few times and let it sit for around 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> The smell is not strong and it&#x27;s non-drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to work up into a lather and apply to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the smell is like a cool, but the fumes are horrible when I open my eyes after washing my face.</li>
            <li> it burned my face and gave me dry peeling itchy unhealthy skin....</li>
            <li> , however, i&#x27;v always been annoyed at how hard it is to work up into a lather with a lot of the gel slipping through my fingers and just being wasted.</li>
            <li> A blast of this in the afternoon and even after the most boring classes I feel awake and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Its not too expensive and works relatively well at cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrendous, it smells like dirty old man feet.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for the past 2 months I had to stop using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; is the word I&#x27;d choose to describe Neutrogena&#x27;s Invigorating Face Wash for men.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> But, I noticed after using for a couple of days I would have a small breakout here or there on my face.</li>
            <li> I am pretty disappointed about it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past decade in conjunction with a mint body soap</li>
            <li> Just using soap will not help exfoliate the skin, especially in those difficult creases in your skin.</li>
            <li> I usually use what ever is in the shower.  </li>
            <li> cleans by removing built up dead skin cells, leaving your skin feeling ultra-clean and rejuvenated!</li>
            <li> Hence, rotation) for the past 12 months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They must have used a poor quality plastic because, I have dropped all sorts of shampoo and other creams and gels and none ever broke.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We just don&#x27;t like the way it makes your face cold, especially when you use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> It is thick and a very small dollop will do the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so ridiculous</li>
            <li> Nothing serious, but still.</li>
            <li> Chemical smell, super drying and terrible for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> The face wash leaves a bad burning sensation around my eyes but this would be different from person to person depending on their skin type!</li>
            <li> Or in my case contain salycic acid, which was not a good idea to use with an adapalene gel.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> The worst packaging ,you can&#x27;t use last half of product.</li>
            <li> Texture: slippery gel that works into a thin lather as you scrub.  </li>
            <li> as of late.. sadly to say i wont rebuying this product.</li>
            <li> But worse because it is a gooey, gel like soap.</li>
            <li> Invigorating is the wrong word.</li>
            <li> sorry if this doesnt help you decide if you wanna buy this or not.</li>
            <li> &quot; feeling this has; however unfortunately when I&#x27;m done with this tube I&#x27;ll try something else in hopes of better/average acne management.</li>
            <li> Add a splash of cold water</li>
            <li> I have used Clearasil face washes in the past and those are the worst.</li>
            <li> Too bad Amazon took it off the Subscription List</li>
            <li> Caused a bad reaction to my face .</li>
            <li> Bad at oil control.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m just too ugly.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s annoying and you just want the feeling to go away.  </li>
            <li> The tingly menthol feeling is awful.</li>
            <li> The feeling is horrible, it&#x27;s a burn-like sensation on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a horrible face wash that  does nothing to help your face.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works pretty well. Keeps me nice and refreshed after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now. It&#x27;s currently my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> good daily use product. Keep on using!</li>
            <li> Washes well enough, but for me there are too many chemicals in it. I won&#x27;t buy it again for this reason. I do love Neutrogena shower gel and bar soap--but, not this stuff.</li>
            <li> Wakes you up.  I&#x27;m guessing my face is cleaner, but keep buying more because its cooling effect makes me feel great hopping out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Cooling sensation is nice, and the smell is also that of an aftershave. We&#x27;ve reordered a couple times, home they keep carrying this product.</li>
            <li> The top has a habit of breaking off very easily. Also the consistency of the gel has a tendency of slipping right off your wet hands onto the shower floor. Its great if you can get it to your face in time.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clear and wakes me up in the morning. Been using it for years!</li>
            <li> Just added on to purchase to get free shipping but I really like this product.  I&#x27;m used to exfoliating type face wash but this one really makes my face pop!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old guy and this is the first face wash I found that I&#x27;ve stuck with. been using it for 4-5 years.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the cleaning power, it helps clear my blackheads much better than soap with no real scrubbing, and not drying my face too much, follow the directions.  But the menthol is a bit much, kind of intense especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do look the cool sensation I get on my face after washing.  It&#x27;s very refreshing.  I love the product.</li>
            <li> At first this seemed to be really good, but as time progressed it doesn&#x27;t seem so great after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay yeah, it has a great smell. And yeah it just stops there. Doesn&#x27;t really seem to clean that deep. Like i&#x27;d use this, and while my face feels clean, my pores are still junked up, I don&#x27;t know if you have to use this constantly for a long period for it ti actually clean well or what. But it doesn&#x27;t clean deep on first use, just removes surface oil and makes it feel clean, cool, and minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I find myself having to use not dime sized, but quarter or more... and even then it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good wash, it cleans, refreshes, and leaves a good but shortsh scent, just doesn&#x27;t clean deep as claimed.</li>
            <li> It has a menthol type smell that I can&#x27;t stand.  If you are sensitive to smell then I would pass.</li>
            <li> Smells good, and does what is meant for. I would buy again if there are no new improved one yet.</li>
            <li> Kinda tingly in the morning. Cleans my face. I like it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best Mens face wash on the market as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  It cleans and prevents oily skin really well, while leaving your face feeling incredibly clean and healthy.  It also smells amazing, leaving a faint clean shaven smell similar to aftershave.  Some people don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;intense menthol\\&quot; feeling, but I love it.  It opens your sinuses and over all makes you feel great.  I wish it would lather up a little better, but I can deal with that.  Definitely pick some up!</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST face wash I&#x27;ve ever used, it cleans my face very thoroughly. It is definitely invigorating, perfect for the morning \\&quot;wake-up shower\\&quot;. I love the way this makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I first got this and I was like pshh this will never work, but i&#x27;ll try. Then I used it for a week and my skin was clear as air! But it kinda dulled my face thats why you use moisturizer. Yup. YOU SHOULD GET IT!</li>
            <li> This really gives me a punch in the face.  For me, I enjoy the \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; feeling , but may be too much for some people.  I feel it cleans my face thoroughly and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.  Def a great buy with subscribe and save!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash for my tough skin.This really smooth n gentle.I subscribed for Neutrogena, it&#x27;s comes automatic to me. Now it&#x27;s doing wonderful job for my face.</li>
            <li> Can definitely feel the cooling sensation on your face. As far as that signifying that it is &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;, I have no idea. Despite me having lots of stress and sleepless nights due to the military lifestyle, my acne has reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> My beard is getting to be about an inch long and throughout the process of growing it, washing has been essential. This is the only product I&#x27;ve tried out of a variety of face washes, shampoos, and conditioners that leaves my face and beard feeling soft and not too dry all day long. It eliminates almost all itch associated with having a beard (though for those first weeks I recommend some Gold Bond Extra Strength lotion!)</li>
            <li> Seems to clean pretty well but I&#x27;m not a fan of the menthol. This face-wash burns ever so slightly and leaves my skin feeling a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I use this product every morning before my 9 AM class and I love the way it makes you feel after you rinse it off: minty, crisp, clean! The smell is very nice too!</li>
            <li> I needed a couple more dollars to qualify for Amazon&#x27;s Free shipping and since I needed a new face wash, decided to purchase this Neutrogena product based on the good reviews it has received. After using it for about a week or so, I am very satisfied with the product. The cleanser foams very easily in your hands and leaves your face feeling fresh and revitalized. The smell I noticed is very similar to Old Spice&#x27;s Smooth Blast scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash does tend to leave my face a little dry afterwards but it is very minimal. I have used Clearasil face washes in the past and those are the worst. Every person is different so your miles may vary. Other than that, I like this product a lot. However, I would still recommend Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scurb over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004NU44BY Neutrogena Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scrub, 4.2 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> This is a great face wash.</li>
            <li> This face wash seems to be the real deal - leaves a slight tingle on the face because of the eucalyptus oil in it  - it&#x27;s great and deep cleaning but you need to moisturize your face afterwards...</li>
            <li> I have a naturally oily skin, hence I need a face wash that can get rid of the access oil without over drying.  I have tried a few face wash and I am deciding to stick with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on the skin.  I have been using it daily for the last 2 weeks and so far no complaints to report.</li>
            <li> As a college guy that suffers from Acne, I have been on the hunt for a good face wash that, as a guy, would be happy to use. I can&#x27;t help but feel that women have a huge selection when it comes to face washes but not guys. They all smell like flowers or something. Or in my case contain salycic acid, which was not a good idea to use with an adapalene gel. Took a bit too long to figure that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this face wash is great. It&#x27;s a little expensive, but my local Target has them for a decent price. I have no doubt it would last a while since you really do only need a dime sized blob to get a good lather going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that stands out about this face wash is the menthol. It says invigorating on the package and they aren&#x27;t kidding. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the menthol wasn&#x27;t almost overpowering for some, but I kind of like it to be honest. A blast of this in the afternoon and even after the most boring classes I feel awake and refreshed. My face feels very clean after having used it, it does a great job of getting rid of the day&#x27;s dirtiness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, all face washes say \\&quot;Cleans without overdrying!\\&quot; Yeah. Not true. BUT, I can&#x27;t take off stars for that because that&#x27;s a claim made across the board. It&#x27;s never been the case. A good moisturizer will help after this face wash because I do find it to be quite drying. Effective, but drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite face wash found to date. I would highly recommend this for fighting acne or just to get your mug clean!</li>
            <li> This truly is invigorating.  My face feels tingly.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a good facewash, i like how refreshed my face feels after i use it. Since almost all products are for females, i like how this one is designed for men. But it does run out very quicly and the price isn&#x27;t that great. After doing some research I found a much better one that works a little better and is much cheeper. Its called CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser. Please read all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> This stuff works good for men. I switched this up from some Clearasil face wash and in 2 days, many of my pimples cleared away. Its not too expensive and works relatively well at cleaning your skin. I wanted something made for active men who work out and can&#x27;t wash their face all the time. I recommend this stuff highly.</li>
            <li> Best face wash I have used. I love using this product actually since every thing else I seemed to use would make my skin feel too dry. I enjoy the tingling feeling on my face while it opens pores and washes all the crud out. I find its best used right before bed.</li>
            <li> I felt like it gave me more acne but maybe that&#x27;s just me</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning your face. Easy and fast to use. I suggest using a wash cloth with this but make sure the wash cloth/hand towel is for your face only</li>
            <li> Works great!!! Not too rough and feels clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and feels refreshing and invigorating as indicated by the product name. I was expecting an even cooler feeling on my face when using this face wash and my rating reflects this</li>
            <li> My husband has a beard, and sensitive skin that can get very dry. I bought him a few fancy products to try, but nothing made him happy. Once he found this face wash the search was over. It&#x27;s a GREAT price, and he loves the way it feels on his skin. The lather really gets down under his beard and removes those dead skin cells that were causing breakouts and beard dandruff. He&#x27;s been using this face wash for almost two years now and his skin and beard look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I* like this face wash because my husband always smells incredible after using it! The scent is better than any cologne or aftershave. Masculine, but subtle and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: this isn&#x27;t a moisturizing face wash (those always made my husband break out), so people who complain that their skin gets dry after using this face wash - you should probably follow up with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this face wash I thought I might be allergic to something inside the face wash because it was sort of burning my face. After rinsing it off, there was a really cool sensation that just smacked my face. It was like someone threw a face towel that was soaked in ice water on my face. I felt really clean and really cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally dropped a few drops down there and that wasn&#x27;t cool, it was interesting however.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean all the time. I also like feeling the tiny beads on my face when I am scrubbing because I feel like my face is really cleansed and exfoliated somehow. I use this every day and night and I have never felt better about my face.</li>
            <li> Works well. Doesn&#x27;t over dry my face. Will use again.</li>
            <li> Never used face wash on a regular basis before this; will buy it again.  It&#x27;s not quite listerine for your face, but it&#x27;s better than standard facewash IMO.  Using it after shaving also seems to stop any tiny cuts from bleeding.</li>
            <li> This is the only facial wash I trust and use. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out or cause my face to form patches. The smell is not strong and it&#x27;s non-drying. I like it.</li>
            <li> Let me start by reviewing the product itself. Full disclosure: I am most definitely not a face wash aficionado. I&#x27;ve never found a face wash that I felt was far superior to the rest, and I don&#x27;t think that this one is particularly special. But I have found face washes that were clearly inferior to the rest, and I have found face washes that were ludicrously overpriced. The good news is that this product is neither overpriced (at least on Amazon) nor inferior.  Here&#x27;s the rundown:  Scent: a distinctly masculine odor that&#x27;s fresh but not overdone (this is NOT Brut).  Texture: slippery gel that works into a thin lather as you scrub.  Quantity: a penny-size dollop will take care of your face; this means the product should last several months.  Finish: leaves skin feeling oil-free, smooth, and perhaps a bit dry, depending on your skin type.  Packaging: container is stable and easy to use; the plastic is strong enough that the top shouldn&#x27;t crack off.  For the product alone, I&#x27;d give 4.5 stars. Gets the job done. Can&#x27;t ask for much more in a face wash.  So far, so good. But here&#x27;s the (potential) catch: as a result of inadequate packaging on Amazon&#x27;s end, mine arrived squashed, with about 25 percent of its contents irretrievably lost. I did not bother to return the item (how do you ship a big wet mess back to Amazon), but I did provide feedback to Amazon about the packaging problem. Hopefully they will resolve this issue so that we can buy with greater confidence.</li>
            <li> good face wash, nice price</li>
            <li> I get this monthly via the Amazon Subscribe and Save option.  This is my first month of using the product, but I am satisfied.  It doesn&#x27;t, as other reviewers claim, leave my face dry or burn.  I find the soap pleasant, but I am not a fan of the scent (think bathroom hand soap).&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin will react differently, so take this review with a grain of salt.  I will continue using this until I find something I like better.</li>
            <li> This product does it&#x27;s name justice and leaves your face feeling oil-free. The pores on my face seem to shrink after they are scrubbed with that minty fresh feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many face-washing products and this one is in the middle of the pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Low price;&lt;br /&gt;- Available at your supermarket (or, of course, right here);&lt;br /&gt;- And most importantly, it feels refreshingly good once applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s gloppy;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not easy to work up into a lather and apply to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal favorite in this category is Kiehl&#x27;s Facial Fuel. It&#x27;s more expensive, but worth it,</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonderfully. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin while keeping my skin clear. Good stuff! My girlfriend doesn&#x27;t mind using it also even though it smells slightly cologney.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face deeply, and I can feel the oil limited.&lt;br /&gt;It can create a layer to keep further clean.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Men Invigorating Face Wash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Neutrogena face wash feels cool on my skin, mainly due to the menthol. It&#x27;s advertised as deep cleaning pores and removing excess surface oil and dirt. It doesn&#x27;t foam a lot, but I can feel it remove oil from my face. I have yet to see any signs of over-drying and my skin seems to break out a lot less. The cooling effect from the menthol lasts for about half an hour, but it is refreshing in the morning. The strong scent doesn&#x27;t bother me very much, but if you are allergic to any type of perfumes/fragrances, you might want to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The squeeze-tube is extremely easy to use, but I find that the wash gel is too thin and tends to drip a bit when you squeeze it out. This type of tube is generally used for thicker fluids/creams, and I felt that the Neutrogena was more suited to a pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars, not too pricey, does remove oil/grease from my face without over-drying. It also smells very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling fresh and clean.  I use this before bed so my pillow isn&#x27;t full of dirt and oil.  Works with your beard!</li>
            <li> We just don&#x27;t like the way it makes your face cold, especially when you use it in the shower. It&#x27;s offputting. But the product itself is good quality.</li>
            <li> Face feels clean and smooth after use.  Cleans pores great.</li>
            <li> This is a great face wash. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like that it has a menthol-like refreshening afterburn, but it is too strong for me, and it lasts for about 30 minutes afterwards. It dries my face a bit too much for the liking, so if you have sensitive skin, go for the Clearasil or Nivea Men sensitive facewashes.</li>
            <li> This cleans really well and it smells great!  My husband is very picky about the products he will use because he has sensitive skin and he loves this.</li>
            <li> works great at cleaning your face after a long day of work. leaves a fresh feeling after you rinse it off.  doesn&#x27;t take much at all.  I recommend this face wash for those guys out there.  Easy to use and no mess.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and it leaves your face feeling clean. I tend to have oily skin and I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Cools my skin after wash and have some nice effect on my skin</li>
            <li> Smells good and feels good. It was quite cheap as well. I would recommend this product since it came pretty soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman in my 20s with mostly normal skin and occasional mild acne. This face wash was given to me by a friend who tried it and disliked it because the scent was too strong--otherwise I would have never tried this stuff. I can&#x27;t say if it is overpriced on Amazon because I didn&#x27;t pay for it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I really enjoy it. The scent is pretty strong and cologne-ish  at first, but it doesn&#x27;t last after rinsing. (Thus, it doesn&#x27;t compete with my other girly scented products and I don&#x27;t walk around smelling particularly masculine, so I&#x27;d say this face wash is fine for women.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real winner for me is the cooling, tingling feel. I love any kind of product that leaves me feeling minty fresh, and this face wash has a chilling effect on your face. It lives up to its invigorating name. It lathers nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave me overly dry. Because of the strong initial scent, I don&#x27;t recommend it to those with sensitive noses, and I can&#x27;t say how sensitive skin would react. But if you like a cooling sensation, you&#x27;ll probably like this product.</li>
            <li> After years and years of searching for a product that does not make my skin itchy and dry. I have found this gem inbetween other brands such as Dove and Clean &amp; Clear. This face wash completely cleans out all the pores in my face, and leaves it with a fresh and &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34; feeling. My face is left CLEAN. That is the only word for it. A word that was hard to achieve from other products, without leaving my face incredibly dry and itchy. I will purchase this item in the future, and I hope you will buy this product if you had the same problems as me. You will not be disapointed!</li>
            <li> I came from using the Neutrogena stress power scrub face wash. thought i would try something new... some background info. Im in my late 20s, asian american, generally speaking i dont get too many pimples these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this face wash it seemed as if i had gotten more pimples.. as of late.. sadly to say i wont rebuying this product.</li>
            <li> Good scent. Refreshingly cool. Don&#x27;t use it before bed.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash that i have purchased in a long time. It smells great, leaves your face feeling cool and refreshing after every use, and clears your skin. I have definitely found a product I can stick with!</li>
            <li> This review is from a middle age guy who likes to wash his face after work or before going to bed. I don&#x27;t have acne problems, but I do have oily skin. This facial wash works well for me and I don&#x27;t think it is over-drying. The fragrance is masculine and light--my wife likes it. There is some kind of menthol at work here which leaves a temporary light cooling on the face. If you wash your eyes, keep-em closed tight! I would say I really like this product, hence the four stars.</li>
            <li> Great not only for face, but if you shave your head, it prepares teh stubble adn ksin nicely.  Too bad Amazon took it off the Subscription List - Now I&#x27;ll go back to Target to get it because of the price.</li>
            <li> feels very refreshing and minty and keeps my face feeling fresh, very effective at washing dirt/oil off my face after a long work day</li>
            <li> This is a good face wash! It smells great and does its job, but it is a little on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> The worst packaging ,you can&#x27;t use last half of product.Just a waste of money ,too bad what I could get out of tube was good.</li>
            <li> My husband love these product. Amazon run out too.  I hope they stock up some more. It smells good and hubby says refreshing!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  A great scent, great feeling and most of all a great clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He didn&#x27;t like it and I couldn&#x27;t understand why until I used it myself and figured it out. I don&#x27;t like the fact that it feels like menthol on your face when you use it. It would make my eyes hurt. I guess you shouldn&#x27;t use this on your eyes but when I was my face I just put the wash everywhere. Not good. I actually ended up throwing it away after it sat in the shower for like a year.</li>
            <li> very invigorating  for my husband&#x27;s skin! the only face wash he uses as of now!</li>
            <li> Love the beads, don&#x27;t love the product density. Takes too much gel to get clean. I know this makes it so we have to buy more but.... Yeah... One star off.</li>
            <li> I like the sense of cleansing it leaves and comes at a nice price too.</li>
            <li> Not too impressed, but don&#x27;t hate it. It feels like any other soap but with a nice menthol tingle. Only use once in a while now when out of my main face exfoliating soap</li>
            <li> I have heard good reviews from Neutrogena that&#x27;s why I opted to try this. It was okay from day 1 to 3 but I got break outs after that. Maybe this is not just right for my skin because it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> Face feels super clean and tingly!</li>
            <li> I noticed that this is pretty much the only face wash that doesn&#x27;t make my face ashy and it works well! I love the scent and you can really feel it working with the cool sensation it leaves on your face.</li>
            <li> After you use this, you know your face is clean. As others mentioned it does dry your face out. I didn&#x27;t find it severe.  Leaving your face dry and clean makes it well prepped for facial lotion or moisturizer. Has a more pleasant fragrance than many.</li>
            <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. I really like the invigorating factor of it as well. Face felt much better after using this product. Only complaint is it&#x27;s a little pricey compared to other face-washes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got fairly oily, yet sensitive skin, and this stuff is great.  It feels refreshing, but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  It&#x27;s pleasant enough to use that I actually do so every day.</li>
            <li> Good stuff - might dry out your skin without any moisturizer, but I find that using it with coconut oil makes my skin pretty much flawless. Boom!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my brother to try as he has had some blemishes on this skin. He found this face wash to be super cool and refreshing to the skin the first time he used it. &amp;#34;It left a tingling sensation&amp;#34; he said when he washed it off with warm water after application and the refreshing feel stayed for an hour. However after constant application he found this feeling lasted less and less. And a few times he felt the titling sensation escalate into a slightly burning one. Overall he think that its a good product but maybe not the right one for him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product &amp; similar products from Nivea, Neutrogena, &amp; Dove.  This is among my favorites.  I use in the shower every morning &amp; I like the tingle of the menthol.  It cleans without overdrying and leaves my skin ready for a wet shave once I get out.  For the few bucks this costs it&#x27;s worth a try - you may like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Gives my face the daily freshness it needs! Feels great after each use.</li>
            <li> The tingly menthol feeling is awful. If that&#x27;s for you, then great. But why do they not indicate as much on the label? I would not have bought this in the first place if the product attempted to make this at all clear. Why use euphemistic code language like &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> it does its work as a face wash, and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> very good, not too tight after washing</li>
            <li> My husband was a little unsure when I bought this for him but after one wash he was sold. He&#x27;s been using for about a week now and seems to really love it. It has not broken out his sensitive skin and he&#x27;s used the word &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; when talking about this product. As long as it doesn&#x27;t continue to break him out I think he&#x27;ll be using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several face washes and this is my least favorite.  There&#x27;s no &amp;#34;scrubbing action&amp;#34;, like no grit or anything like some products, so it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling clean and smooth.  The smell is horrendous, it smells like dirty old man feet.  The feeling is horrible, it&#x27;s a burn-like sensation on your skin.  Especially right under my eyes, I guess my skin is more sensitive there, it&#x27;s annoying and you just want the feeling to go away.  I recommend St. Ives Blackhead Clearing Green Tea Scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of guy that always forgets to wash his face, but when I do remember this thing wakes me right up. There&#x27;s a tingly feeling when using this item and always leaves me feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this is one of the best face washes I have ever used and the price and amount is absolutely worth it. I used the Neutrogena Men Acne Wash and it made my skin very dry. Since using this product I have noticed my acne has been going away too. Just use to two times a day. One when I wake up and once I sleep.</li>
            <li> I thought this would help take care of my acne but it worked not as much as I expected. Despite that, this is a good one to clean face.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected, the cooling minty feel is a little too strong for me. Probably not gonna buy again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this cleans my face any better than my other face wash (Nuetrogena Gentle Cleanse), but it smells great. It makes the whole bathroom smell &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;... in a good way. The scent lingers just a little the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Seemed to do the trick. I have pretty oily skin usually, by the end of the day especially. I would use this each night until it was gone. No complaints. I switched to CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser, which I&#x27;ve also been really happy with, but I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash on and off for the last 4 years. I really like it and I think it does a good job of removing the dirt, grime, and oil off my face. Definitely leaves my face feeling invigorated. It does make my face a little dry after but that&#x27;s easily remedied with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The face wash is nice and fresh. I am happy that it feels good and did not make my skin fall off.</li>
            <li> i like them, made my face feel soooooooooooooooo fresh! not even emphasizing it enough, however there is not enough inside the bottle, 45% of the bottle is air.</li>
            <li> Gets the job fine. Great smell. Freshens up the skin in the morning. Best face wash I&#x27;ve used yet. I have oily skin and this helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Great for waking up your face in the morning, I would prefer something with exfoliating properties but I used this till the last drop and wasn&#x27;t disapointed.</li>
            <li> As advertised, great price &amp; quick delivery</li>
            <li> I have used so many products from.the expensive to cheap and this is one of the best for under 10 dollars smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave film.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a horrible face wash that  does nothing to help your face. Invigorating is the wrong word. I wish I could have gotten a refund.</li>
            <li> This has been a fantastic product for daily use. It doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin and I love the cooling sensation. It&#x27;s well priced, making it an even easier purchase to make.</li>
            <li> You can feel the clean after every use.  There is a tingling in your pores and a fresh feeling.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My face has way less breakouts after I started using this face wash. Face feels really clean too after using it. It makes the skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes my face free real clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> been using this for years on my face.  Seems to clean deep down well.  My face feels fresh but no over dried.  Good scent as well.</li>
            <li> I use this as a daily face wash except on the third day when I use the Foaming Scrub.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the cooling effect because I&#x27;d prefer to know if this stuff has indeed washed my face and cleaned off the surface dead cells of my face.  All I can say is that after using it that my face feels clean every time.  So I guess it works.</li>
            <li> Pros - It cleans without drying my skin like regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - The \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; feature of this cleaner is very menthol-like and actually burns my eyes unless I spend extra time rinsing and scrubbing my face with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually prefer regular Neutrogena face cleanser over the this.</li>
            <li> I always &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; before I shave and was using an Aveeno product that I liked. It was semi-course and worked well. I like the Neutrogena better. The combination of gel and scrub particles goes on easy and feels good working it into the skin.</li>
            <li> Still using it everyday.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, leaves your face well cleaned and tingly, not oily or dry. Smells kind of minty, a pleasant masculine scent.</li>
            <li> I like this face wash and it has kept my face clear and kept my skin looking healthy, however, i&#x27;v always been annoyed at how hard it is to work up into a lather with a lot of the gel slipping through my fingers and just being wasted.</li>
            <li> Seems to clean my face without over drying.  Feels refreshing and smells good.  I recommend it as a low cost alternative</li>
            <li> when I open the package, this one seems only a half bottle, and the cover is open. It&#x27;s so ridiculous</li>
            <li> My bf isn&#x27;t the type to go out and get this sort of thing himself, so I did and to my surprise, he actually uses it. And it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> it cleans and makes my face feel fresh</li>
            <li> Really refreshing. After washing off your face instantly feels refreshed and cool.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is overly strong.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how cool and refreshed my face feels after using this. However, I would really love it if it came as a scrub too.</li>
            <li> It is a normal face wash, no surprising, no disappointment. Additionally, its price is reasonable comparing to other peers. Overall, I like it.</li>
            <li> Wow! This cleanser is surprisingly great and effective. For one, it smells great. Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t dry out a man&#x27;s skin as many of these off-the-shelf cleansers do. This brand is one I trust for all health and beauty products, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised that even their men&#x27;s facial cleanser really does what it&#x27;s advertised to do. Next time I&#x27;ll buy in bulk!</li>
            <li> Great product for the people with acne problem.....</li>
            <li> I like this... It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out and doesn&#x27;t make my skin flake.</li>
            <li> My dad brought this and I happened to see it in the bathroom. I read what it does and smelled it. I wanted to know if would do any good for my face so I tried it. I feel in love instantly! Doesn&#x27;t dry my face out and throughly cleans my pores. Yes it smells like a guys cologne but it&#x27;s okay my face is clean. I had to hurry and buy my own because my daddy was tired of me sneaking into his lol :)</li>
            <li> Like the invigorating feel neutra gena men face wash gives my face feels cool clean and dirt free. people said to watch for it being damaged but mine came just fine</li>
            <li> I liked the feel it gave me, a nice cool feeling on your face. But I have no idea if it works as I didnt use it for long enough and never saw much of a difference in the time I did use it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pretty much made me break out even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it immediately once I experienced this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have highly sensitive skin, I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is really nice face wash.  You can feel your skin tingle and then it does seem to open up the pores.  Bought several more tubes.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it especially after he shaves...will buy again and again. It really feels invigorating when you wash your face.</li>
            <li> You really have to rub a dub dub to get it to lather up at all.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s OK. The menthol is a skin drying thing. That is not so good. So use a  moisturizer after for sure.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It fell off a shelf in the bathroom and hit the tile floor. This caused the cap to break and for the plug that goes in the dispensing hole to break off.&lt;br /&gt;They must have used a poor quality plastic because, I have dropped all sorts of shampoo and other creams and gels and none ever broke.&lt;br /&gt;So, don&#x27;t drop it. They need to user a more impact resistant plastic formula.&lt;br /&gt;It is untransferable to a new container, like a small laboratory style container I had for shampoo when traveling. This is like toothpaste in a tube. But worse because it is a gooey, gel like soap. It does not go into other containers.</li>
            <li> Came opened and spilled all over the Doves men face lotion I bought that was also half empty when I recieved it as if it had been used before.</li>
            <li> Too much fragrance. Squeeze container is a hassle to use compared to Neutrogena pump soap which I like a lot more.</li>
            <li> I love how this product smells, but I try to use it only when I actually need it (e.g., my skin is oily/dirty). Otherwise, it can leave your face feeling dry. Of course, you can always apply a moisturizer after that, but the Nitrogena moisturizer doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good as the face wash.</li>
            <li> The menthol in this makes your face tingle and feel really clean.  This is my first regular facial wash and I use it almost daily now.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. You face feels so clean after using it</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for 5 years now and will continue to do so. Great product for subscribe and save too!</li>
            <li> Personally i like this product. Seems to work</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he seems to like it.  I paired it with a few other Neutrogena items for Men and a travel bag.  He was happy.</li>
            <li> Chemical smell, super drying and terrible for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and the similarly priced [[ASIN:B005OKYNW2 Nivea for Men Face Wash]]. The Nivea face wash seems to be by far the superior product. It is thicker - less diluted, and doesn&#x27;t make my face dry like the Neutrogena face wash does.</li>
            <li> OK, it is \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; and gives off a slightly tingly feeling and yes it doesn&#x27;t over dry the skin, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was anything special.  The instructions said to just use a \\&quot;dime size\\&quot; amount and lather it up but I find that I have to use half a palm&#x27;s worth.  I&#x27;ve tried many face washes (Clearasil, Nivea, other Neutrogena face washes) but the best ones consistently Asian brands.  Actually the best one I&#x27;ve tried is sold on Amazon.  It is the Shiseido Perfect Whip.  Very soft, foamy, lathers up very well, literally needs only a dime size amount, leaves your skin feeling soft and clean.  It is double the price but will also last about 4 times longer since you only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I really cannot tell whether it really works but it feels like it does! My face is under better control now since using it however it still depends on you whether you touch your face with oily substances or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing your face with this product, you face has a cool sensation to it and your face becomes smooth!</li>
            <li> The face wash leaves a bad burning sensation around my eyes but this would be different from person to person depending on their skin type!</li>
            <li> This face wash is one of the best out there IMO.  I have an oily face type and this face wash keeps it nice and clean for most of the day.  I use it once in the morning and once at night.  You only have to use a little bit to cover the entire face.  It leaves you with a cool, crisp, clean feeling after washing it off.  For the price you pay I have not found a better mens facewash.</li>
            <li> my bf loved this on his face. will buy him another one.</li>
            <li> Cleanses thoroughly, rinses off easily, smells nice and keep my face less oily longer.</li>
            <li> good facial wash, nice quality and ouptut.</li>
            <li> this face wash is alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;-smells great&lt;br /&gt;-feels great (tingling menthol sensation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-it doesnt lather at all&lt;br /&gt;-you have to use more then you should since it doesn&#x27;t lather.</li>
            <li> I found the scent to be a bit too strong.&lt;br /&gt;It also burns more than normal soap if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Great face cleanser. Great refreshing smell.</li>
            <li> After using Clean &amp; Clear daily face wash for the past 11 years I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do when I found that it was discontinued.  I looked into buying designer face wash from Kiehls or even Saphora but figured I wasn&#x27;t frantic enough to spend $18.  After doing much research and reading a review by user&#x27;s in Men&#x27;s Health I thought I would give Neutrogena Men Invigorating Face Wash a try.  With my oily skin I have found that most face washes either dry my face out completely or leave a not clean oily feeling on my face.  After using this face wash I am elated that my old wash was discontinued.  I love it.  Now I know most people would say that it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;Invigorate\\&quot; to the point of waking you up but honestly I don&#x27;t think that is what the word is intended to mean.  It removes all the oil from my face throughout the entire day without over drying.  It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean as soon as I use it.  After a month of using it I can&#x27;t imagine anything else.  For the price and how well it works I could not imagine a better deal.  My advice is if you are looking for a face wash that this should definitely be one of the first you should try because you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;  After using this product for the past 2 months I had to stop using it.  I found my hands to start becoming seriously dry and skin to start peeling.  Since I stopped using it my hands have vastly improved so my only thought though it worked phenomenally on my face that the effect on my hands was too much.  I full heartedly think this is a great product still even though I had to quit using it.</li>
            <li> Really refreshing face wash.</li>
            <li> After using this your face will fill clean and fresh. The directions say to use it daily but once a month is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and works well!</li>
            <li> Tingly and cooling.  This works great to clean your face without overdrying.  The smell is clean without being medicinal or overly perfumed.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not kidding about the &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34; part, and honestly I found it a bit irritating.  I think there are cheaper ways to clean your face without making it feel like you just had some sort of chemical spray.</li>
            <li> Great product and very quick shipment.  Face wash very refreshing and good cleaner.  I do recommend product for a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> I use this about once or twice a week only because it feels like I&#x27;m getting a real treat for my face.  I will wash my face and leave the cleanser on my face for a minute or so to get the full effect of that cool menthol feel.</li>
            <li> Good Job , keep it up Thanks for sending the product. Glad to do business with you.&lt;br /&gt;Will do it again</li>
            <li> This facial wash does a great job of deep cleansing and it requires very little product during each use. My only gripe is there is a strong menthol smell that takes a little getting used to. Other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty nice product</li>
            <li> Cleans up oily faces and won&#x27;t leave it dried.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is that this face wash does work, and it feels great on the face. Only slight defect is that it can&#x27;t come too close to your eyes, but not a big enough deal where that would stop you from buying.</li>
            <li> More highly scented than I expected.</li>
            <li> Works good burns a little!</li>
            <li> Before I start this review, I have to say that reviewing skin care products is a pointless exercise, as everyone&#x27;s skin is unique. You&#x27;ve gotta try out multiple products to see what works best for you. Nevertheless, in my case, this stuff acted like a cheap bar of soap with a touch of menthol added to it. It dried my face and didn&#x27;t help clear my skin issues at all. I&#x27;m glad other people are having good results with it, I definitely didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is a good face wash. Does a good job and does not make your face feel to dry. IT does feel a little dry though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years, and I love the refreshing cool sensation right after I use them.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Been using it for 12 months.  With the winter drying out my skin and how my skin can get oily while sleeping, this product works very well in cleaning the skin and yet, doesn&#x27;t make it dry.  In combination with the Neutrogena Men Age Fighter Face Moisturizer, it works well.</li>
            <li> It has really helped my skin. I can&#x27;t imagine what condition it would be in if I was using regular soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; is the word I&#x27;d choose to describe Neutrogena&#x27;s Invigorating Face Wash for men. If the sight of skin flaking off your face is invigorating, then sure. But rest assured that as other reviewers have said this will leave your face *very* dry. The reason: Sodium lauryl sulfate, a detergent used in everything from cheap soap to engine degreaser -- it is a known facial irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind as this product vacuums all the natural oils out of your pores that your body will try to restore that moisture, which means it will overly produce oils and make your face look as greasy as the bottom of a pizza box by the end of the day. Good luck out there, guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to aim toward a product that uses a SLS alternative; they are typically much more forgiving on the face. Every Man Jack is a great, similarly-priced brand that comes to mind or even Gillette&#x27;s Fusion ProSeries Sensitive Face Wash works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and gives you good smells on your face. But don&#x27;t feel it can clean your face well. Overall it&#x27;s good, but I might not want to buy this again.</li>
            <li> Container arrived broken and wash constantly dripping everywhere and making a mess</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but it&#x27;s not the best to use.  I like it, but if the scent of it wasn&#x27;t too strong, I would have given it a 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that love a strong scented face wash, this product would be for you.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry area, I workout a lot and have bad acne problems and scars from pimples and black heads on my face. I have taken medication for it, put on all types of prescription products and to no avail. They did little to no help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought i&#x27;d get a face wash just to keep my face clean and pristine and this product has done that.  It is currently cheap and agrees pretty well to my face, but that is not all.  It has cleared up my face, has reduced the color of all scars and it has done this within days of me buying and putting on the product. It feels good on my face and after a shower it makes my face feel better then it did before. I never get that dry feeling anymore around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the product to anyone who needs a face wash and I hope every tries this product out to see if it works for them as well. I will certainly be buying more Neutrogena Men products in the future!</li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell and good feel to it. All that I have left to say is it works great and I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Really good mens&#x27; face wash. Removes oil from skin without drying it out. Recommend it to any guy wanting a clean refreshing face wash</li>
            <li> Works as intended and seems to do a good job of washing your face. It lasted me a while, but I can see how people would think it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s really about how much you use and how often you wash your face. I just put a little on my fingertips in the shower and washed my face once a day. This lasted me a full semester at school.</li>
            <li> Great face scrub.  Feel squeaky clean regularly</li>
            <li> I feel very clean after.  Been using for years with no end in sight.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with this product every day or so. It does a great job to clean my face. I&#x27;m not sure if I can confirm that it has ever &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; me but it does help to keep me clean. Is that the same thing? Who knows.</li>
            <li> The product is very good, cleans good and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> My face is clean, it does not smeel like I just used a girls face wash. I think I can call that success.</li>
            <li> It gives a satisfying tingly feeling when using it, but I don&#x27;t really notice much difference over traditional body gel or soap in the long run. I&#x27;m not exactly a beauty guru or anything, either, so take my review with a grain of salt!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash. The menthol in it really wakes you up and feels great after a good workout. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry and flaky like some other face washes do. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> best facewash I have used!</li>
            <li> Quality - great awakening scent as you wash your face. Constant user.</li>
            <li> Great product, cleans well and leaves that minty freshness in your face.</li>
            <li> This face wash feels great when I use it in the shower, has a scent and tingle that really helps you wake up. But, I noticed after using for a couple of days I would have a small breakout here or there on my face. Nothing serious, but still. I would stop using the product and the breakout would go away, but since then I have resumed it now and then to see if the problem repeats itself and it has. My roommate uses it with no adverse effects, so perhaps it&#x27;s just my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this along with Biotherm which is much more expensive....but you don&#x27;t need to use as much product.  This face wash is just a gel, no grit, strong smell, and creates lots of foam. So it&#x27;s right up there next to Biotherm Face Cleansing Gel.  I have a very oily nose, and it removes that layer so I can follow with a scrub for the next step.  The aroma does last for awhile, so you can use it just before you go out....nice, smooth, and fresh!</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive products from the mall and higher brands, but I love this product more than any other products I have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, my face has been getting cleaner (less pimples) after the use of this product. And I love the cool feeling when I use this product. I wish they had this type of body wash for sale!</li>
            <li> I bought two of them but each one just remained half. Meanwhile, it&#x27;s pretty sticky. I am pretty disappointed about it.</li>
            <li> Using this for the first time it was almost too much for me.  I gave it a few days and actually enjoy using this now.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd one and will continue using this.  If you have sensitive skin, this may not be for you, but I like the way my face feels after using it.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything special about this product versus any other basic soap plus it doesn&#x27;t last that long. I find that the neutrogena face soap bar works just as well and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> this product is okay for those with oily facial conditions like me, relatively strong, makes skin really dry, it got a reasonable price anyway</li>
            <li> i threw it away...it burned my face and gave me dry peeling itchy unhealthy skin....do not waste your money on it</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very effective, I was surprised because I never had any past experience with this brand but I was impressed. Did the job well and am willing to stick with this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have somewhat sensitive skin and general problems with acne. Although this wash isn&#x27;t for acne skin, it feels great and lathers well with a small amount. After rinsing, my face feels very clean, and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; slick feeling. The menthol gives this wash the invigorating feeling, and feels very good. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Good face wash.  Your face will feel fresh and awake your senses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s face wash. It works. One star removed because maybe it could be a little cheaper?</li>
            <li> Good amount. Lathers wells. Has a nice clean feeling bite at the end. Must be the menthol ingredient. Nice 2/3 clear tube. I feel like I&#x27;m taking care of my skin using this product. No one says I&#x27;m looking younger but no one says I&#x27;m looking older.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have found most face cleaners to be too abrasive.  This stuff works great and leaves your skin feeling clean without that burning affect.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last couple years, and I find it the best job for the price. There are better choices out there, but not under $10. The wash is a fantastic choice for men looking to improve their usual regimen without having to keep around products they might feel embarrassed about. It has no lasting scent, does the job, and the \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; portion of the facewash helps to wake you up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An all-around a great buy.</li>
            <li> For some reason I was breaking out again after not getting any major breakouts for a while....Neutrogena Men Invigorating Face Wash helped clean me up. I use it in combination with the Gentle Scrub as well and I have yet to have a major breakout since. Definitely a product to try. I&#x27;ve tried Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap, Biore, Clearasil and many other scrubs before but this one is easily one of the bests.</li>
            <li> The picture plays tricks on you! I thought The blue part was just there to be...there! ha ha, but the liquids inside it is actually blue, and the container is actually clear. which is a good thing because you will know when you get a new one, if you ever get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is like a old man (30&#x27;s) wedding smell or what i call it, a manly smell. The smell is good, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying.&lt;br /&gt;When you apply the liquid on your face, you get a really refreshing feeling!! Its like a soft breeze is blowing at you yet there&#x27;s nothing! I like it, And highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  My husband loves it and uses it daily without issue.  It was shipped quick and arrived in a perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I tried this a few times but the burning was too much. I looked at the ingredients and it contains menthol. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> It seems to do the job. Face feels cleaned after washing it with it. It&#x27;s recommended for men because of the smell</li>
            <li> 5 Star all the way, only good things. Keep it up and make sure the availability is there in all stores.</li>
            <li> As a woman I have experimented with countless face wash products and had yet to find the perfect one. On a whim, I decided to try this product, because my boyfriend swears by it. My face cleared up within a couple of days and it definitely has an overall clean appearance. Also helps my skin produce less oil through out the day. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> After few uses I am look &amp;#34;100 years&amp;#34; younger...Easy to use, no side effects, I will recommended for everyone...no expensive</li>
            <li> been using it for a year. feels great</li>
            <li> Use this daily with a washcloth. Gives you a cooling effect and leaves my face clean and free of oil.</li>
            <li> My skins feels nice after using this product. I would recommend it it but don&#x27;t use to frequent as it kinda dries the skin.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for the price, I rotate between this and super moisturizing Vitamin B face wash which does a good job moisturizing but is 10x as expensive.</li>
            <li> Way too much hype for what it is. I was expecting this stuff to make me pretty. Perhaps I&#x27;m just too ugly.  It&#x27;s just a face wash... I really don&#x27;t get the big deal.</li>
            <li> The invigorating means it has menthol in it.  I don&#x27;t like the tingling feeling it causes.  It really burns if a bit gets in your eyes.  Only used about 25% of it trying to get used to it but couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It dried out my skin too much but it is fresh in the morning or when you feel ur face is sticky</li>
            <li> Good daily facewash, use it in the morning during shower. Not very strong, and not an exfoliating cream/mask, just plain face wash with a nice scent, but the result is nice/noticeable.</li>
            <li> Smells good but I always seem to get acne more frequently when I use this. Maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> Really helps clean my face, I&#x27;m 29, male and suffer from oily skin. Leaves a soothing sensation afterwords which is amazing.</li>
            <li> a nice face wash that makes your skin feel tingly and clean.  recommended for sensitive skin and essential for pre shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s if you use it on a scrabber. Has a cool feeling to it when scrabbing your face. hint of mint</li>
            <li> Tried this facial cleanser as a more economical alternative to the pricier stuff. Instead of invigorating it should be called burning. I don&#x27;t think it cleaned at all. Don&#x27;t  waste your money on this. Consider Lab Series Power Wash and Jack Black Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> it didnt work out for me. as i do have oily skin and it makes my skin to dry. to a point of discomfort. so i stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Never thought face wash would have an effect on my day but man do I feel refreshed and awake after using this.</li>
            <li> Smells good and feels nice to use but I&#x27;m pretty sure it worsened the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I found this on amazon because it was basically half the price of the neutrogena face wash I&#x27;ve used for about a decade, so I decided to give this a try. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve had breakouts and more pimples than anytime in the past ten years so it doesn&#x27;t take an expert on deduction to realize it&#x27;s just not as good as the neutrogena exfoliating blue scrub , so ill go back to paying top dollar for the good stuff</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past decade in conjunction with a mint body soap and I have to admit that it works if you keep using it. Just using soap will not help exfoliate the skin, especially in those difficult creases in your skin. This Face Wash cleans and protects by eliminating build up of dead skin over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ensure that I apply e-vitamin cream to keep the newly exfoliated skin supple and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying it through AMAZON is a real benefit since it is extremely expensive at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times so far; and each time, I&#x27;ve been impressed. It is a very good product; leaves my face clean feeling, without drying it. has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Works Great and Feels Great. A lot of people don&#x27;t know that most of these face cleaners will inadvertently dry out your face. You MUST use a face moisturizer after you use this product. That&#x27;s the only way to prevent your face from having the drying effect. Other than that, for the price, product does what it says.</li>
            <li> Very good it really good face</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin and gives a nice tingling clean. Good price too.  I just wish it would lather a bit more.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitely feel the cool invigoration as soon as this cleansing solution hits your face! It does a great job of keeping your skin clean, even down deep! Great product!</li>
            <li> This leaves you feeling refreshed...  cannot believe it.  I have never really used a face wash before.  I usually use what ever is in the shower.  This stuff really works...  I will recommend it to any body.  This is such a good product that I am also going to try and write a review on Neutrogena&#x27;s site.  The only reason I even tried this product out of all the face washes was because my favorite magazine (Mens Health).  Gave it good reviews too.</li>
            <li> I love the COOL feeling it leaves and it will wake you up. I dont use face wash that often and enjoy it, but this is different. I actually look forward to using this everyday. Its the cool/cold feeling i mostly like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the effectiveness of the wash... Honestly I dont know. I think all face washes are the same. HAHA! sorry if this doesnt help you decide if you wanna buy this or not.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash for my sensitive skin. This really does go on smooth and gentle. I have always liked the Neutrogena line of products and will continue to use their cleaners. Try this for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with psoriasis and dry skin. After using this for one week my face looks like I was 15 again.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also had some blackheads on and around my nose. Now i&#x27;m almost blackhead free. Just after one week.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this to everyone - and I usually don&#x27;t recommend and review products like this! :)</li>
            <li> This thing is great!! keeps my face clean and invigorated all day.</li>
            <li> Face feels very clean after washing with this.</li>
            <li> I very like the scent of this face wash, it&#x27;s very manly and cleans the face without over drying</li>
            <li> It smells good and cleans my face thoroughly. After using it, my face is really oil-free and having no dry feeling. It is thick and a very small dollop will do the job. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great wake up face wash.I get it for my husband but I find I like to use it too.Has a nice cooling effect.</li>
            <li> Contains paraben but well... it smells good.</li>
            <li> My partner uses it every morning and he has to rince his face one more time to not smell the strong perfume all the morning. It efficient and let the ski very clean and protect. The only thing is this smell but it disappears with another quick wash of the face after the cleaning.</li>
            <li> The minute it hits your face you wake up to a &amp;#34;zing&amp;#34; that hits you... Great for early morning showers!</li>
            <li> the smell is like a cool, but the fumes are horrible when I open my eyes after washing my face. It Burns. I wish I didn&#x27;t order 3 bottle for. Anyone want to buy 2 unopened bottles from me lol, just kidding, I&#x27;ll just toss them in the trash and chalk it up to another lesson learned..</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a face wash which helps wake-up your skin look no further. Would highly recommend this face wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problem skin. Most brands over dry or sting from too much alcohol. This product is refreshing. Does a great job keeping my skin clean. Reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that it can leave you with dry skin. But you face is quick to recover. I admit I don&#x27;t use it everyday. When I do, I don&#x27;t experience the dryness as much.</li>
            <li> WHAT IT IS:&lt;br /&gt;An oil-free facial cleanser for men&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT IT DOES:&lt;br /&gt;Deep cleans without stripping moisture, and minimizes pores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KEY INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin (moisturizer); sodium lauryl sulfate and coco-glucoside (cleansers), menthol (skin tightener)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW IT FEELS/SMELLS/LOOKS:&lt;br /&gt;The translucent blue gel produces a lasting cooling effect and has an energizing, cologne-like scent that&#x27;s clean and masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY I LIKE IT:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple but effective. The clarifying formula gets skin squeaky clean and cuts oiliness, but doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling stripped or tight—a notable plus for a guy who doesn&#x27;t stock his medicine cabinet with face moisturizer. The cooling effect is, just as the name suggests, quite bracing, making this the perfect peppy cleanser for morning use.</li>
            <li> This face wash feel really great and amazing on the my face. Aside from the cleaning aspect it feels really cool on the face and the freshness lingers for hours.</li>
            <li> great product at a great economical price</li>
            <li> I use neutrogena face wash daily for six months it&#x27;s making my face fresh and deep cleaning 100% recommend ...</li>
            <li> It only takes a little &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; to wash your face.  For the best effect, rub in for a full minute.  I appreciate the clean fresh &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent.  After rinsing, my face is clean with a tingly refreshed feel.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff and made for a man.  May be too much for all you sissy boys who like using your girlfriends face wash.</li>
            <li> I have used a series of face washes, from simple ones from L&#x27;Oreal and Nivea for men, to more expensive ones like Biotherm and Anthony Logistics. This is not necessarily better than the others, but I love it because of a fresh and icey feel on the skin while I&#x27;m using it. I know this is probably a deal-breaker for a few. Since personally the experience of using it is almost as important as the results per se I give this an easy 5-stars, since it does the rest as good as any other that I have used and it gives me the feel that I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift and I heard good things about it. hopefully it works and my recipient loves it! Will update if it works.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and clearing up blackhead.</li>
            <li> giving this to husband, i;&#x27;ll see what will happen to his face afterwards.</li>
            <li> this is not a good product , don&#x27;t listen to the guys who give 4-5 stars.may be good for them ,but bad for you.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Men&#x27;s Invigorating Face Wash is by far, the best inexpensive, effective face product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I cannot say enough good things about this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now continuously and haven&#x27;t had a single problem with it.  I love this product mainly because it&#x27;s incredibly affordable.  At under $5 you can&#x27;t find anything better.  It&#x27;s great; it doesn&#x27;t burn your face whatsoever and doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all (for normal skin).  It has a vibrant cooling sensation that indescribably refreshes your senses and awakens you.  It&#x27;s in gelatin form, is easy to use and lathers on very well.  After washing it off my face, my skin feels clean, open and recharged.  I love it!  The ONLY DRAWBACK here with this product is that it contains parabens which have all sorts of negative connotations.</li>
            <li> A pretty standard face wash for every day use and works as I expected.</li>
            <li> The menthol makes your face feel cool, fresh, and clean. However, this product isn&#x27;t an acne product, dirt doesn&#x27;t cause acne. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this product with an acne wash as well, using in combination severely dried out my face. If you have mild to no acne, this is a great product for a clean face! If you have acne, use strong benzyl peroxide (5-10%). For others salicylic acid may work.</li>
            <li> Good products,  very fragrant</li>
            <li> feels good after using it</li>
            <li> Was looking for a good face wash gel until I bumped into this one which I am extramly happy with, I still  purchase it on a subscribe and save monthly basis.</li>
            <li> Caused a bad reaction to my face . Dried up my face like anything . Probably a good product but didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reduced blemishes a little on first day and was very happy but 2nd and 3rd days it showed hell literally</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.. cleans your face and leaves it awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. After I tried my boyfriend&#x27;s face wash I was instantly impressed with how well it cleans. Even though  I am a women, I enjoy this product. It is less expensive than the facial cleansers for women and works really well.</li>
            <li> had used several products before that supposed to do the job ,including Mary Kay product.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best product sofar.</li>
            <li> Works great for these harsh conditions while overseas</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because this face wash has a nice smell. My face felt very clean and refreshed after using it. That&#x27;s what I expected to get out of it and I did so I&#x27;m happy. I don&#x27;t use a ton of the face wash and it should last a while since I only use enough to clean my face twice a day.</li>
            <li> Nice invigorating feel.</li>
            <li> Love it, makes my face feel clean. My wife use it to . She looks 5 years younger. Would buy more.</li>
            <li> 3rd bottle i get. Love it, makes my face feel nice and clean. gets rid of all my black heads, which i use to  have infested all over my face.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I have used so far! It lathers up perfectly and deep cleans by removing built up dead skin cells, leaving your skin feeling ultra-clean and rejuvenated! My favorite thing about this face wash is that it gives an icy cool, tingling sensation while you apply it, which lasts for a couple minutes after each use so you can really feel the deep cleansing and refreshing effects on your skin! Since I began using this product, I have noticed that the appearance of my pores has diminished and it has helped significantly with my overly oily skin issues. It also has a great scent, similar to aftershave. Highly recommend this face wash!!!</li>
            <li> I rally needed to get some personal care in my skin and this has been one of the best items I&#x27;ve used so far...get it and you&#x27;ll be satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Clears my acne really well and smoothes my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen.</li>
            <li> i ordered this product not looking to get any results or anything i just needed something to wash my face with. This face wash was great, i had a few pimples on my face before using it. Now after about 2 months of having it my face is clear from any sort of pimples keeps my face clean and it smells good too!!! I&#x27;m going to keep ordering it love how it leaves my face.</li>
            <li> This is great \\&quot;wake you up\\&quot; face wash. It has a slight tingle/burn to it, that gives you that invigorating feeling. Definitely feels very refreshing. I like the scent and how clean I feel after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a small acne problem, nothing major, but I came from using Cetaphil (which was recommended by dermatologists to me a decade ago) to using this. To be honest, I think this prevents less acne build up, and does virtually nothing to acne once it has surfaced. IE I have more frequent and noticeable blemishes using this face wash. I really like the smell and \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; feeling this has; however unfortunately when I&#x27;m done with this tube I&#x27;ll try something else in hopes of better/average acne management.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried clean and clear morning burst, and it didn&#x27;t give me that awake and alert feeling, and neutrogena acne wash was too strong and irritated and dried my skin, but this is PERFECT. I love this face wash because it cleans well without over drying and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> The smell is really good but the product not for people with Dark skin I guess. It did nothing to prevent bumbs or anything like that. I still had new pimples on my  face evening after using the product.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash because of the smell and the minty feeling it leaves on the skin. It&#x27;s definitely worth it if you&#x27;re looking for a decent morning face wash.</li>
            <li> I was worried that switching from one face wash to another would cause my face to break out in the interim until my skin adjusted. Not one problem. I used to wash my face twice a day to keep my face clear. With this, I have been able to wash my face once a day and sometimes skip a day or two without worrying about any acne on my face (it could also be that I&#x27;m getting into my mid-twenties). The scent is pleasant without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Get this. I have moderately oil skin and using this morning and night has stopped all but the occasional zit.  Nothing else works as well. Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried after trying several face washes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a cooling effect and works most of time. Sometimes I feel it over dries my skin. I found Kiehls facial fuel and citaphil to be a better product.</li>
            <li> This facewash will wake you up, and leave your skin feeling refreshed with its cool, minty feeling. It lathers for a good facial massage, and leaves your skin feeling smooth once you rinse it off. I&#x27;ve tried every facewash on the shelf, and this one is now on my top 5 list.</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;The product has a really nice tingling feel to it when it&#x27;s on your face.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry out your face.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is good and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;I get the occasional pimple, and this didn&#x27;t seem to reduce the frequency at which they occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not for the last con, I would give the product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it.  Good to use it during the summer because it cools your face.  I don&#x27;t think i would use it during winter.</li>
            <li> Ok, not bad at all I wish it would lather up more.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been this clear.  This stuff + exfoliating gloves &#x3D; sure thing.  I am very impressed with this product -- it&#x27;s better than the orange bottle \\&quot;liquid face cleanser\\&quot; by Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Great product that leaves your face feeling clean an not oily</li>
            <li> works good, will wake you up!</li>
            <li> So far this is the only one I would use&lt;br /&gt;Love the fresh scent&lt;br /&gt;Feel rejuvenated after using</li>
            <li> Cost effective way to avoid soap on face.</li>
            <li> Minty, fresh, great soap for waking up with in the morning.  Leaves skin feelings fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I do feel cool on my cheek after washing my face, but doesn&#x27;t erase oil and can&#x27;t keep my face from breaking out :(.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive alternative to higher end facial soaps.  It leaves me feeling refreshed with a tingle.  Nice scent too.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> way to strong smelling</li>
            <li> My DH loves it but I find too much comes out as soon as you tip into your hand.</li>
            <li> Pro: cleanse the greasy face well, maybe too well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Leave my skin really really dry afterwards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The beads in the wash irritate my skin. I can feel the burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Bad at oil control. Stopped using for 1 day, then I got  acne outburst.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you, this stuff is EXCELLENT, even more so because of the price.  I just saw it reviewed in Men&#x27;s Health as a top face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different face washes over the years, and this is definitely in regular rotation (disclaimer: my friend, the makeup artist, explained that switching skincare products every 3-6 months is beneficial for your skin. Hence, rotation) for the past 12 months.  It leaves my skin tingly and tight, but not overly tight, and used with Dermalogica Active Moist, I&#x27;m not left feeling dry either.  Smells good when I wash my face, and apparently the smell lingers (but, come on, between cologne and deodorant, how can someone differentiate how your face smells?)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, i can see all ready results in da 1st use, my face feel so refresh an&#x27; clean, i love it :D</li>
            <li> It was so nice! And I feel so cool to wash face by this product. I will still choose this one if mine runs out.</li>
            <li> reminds me of the old product SeaBreeze only a gel form.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son and he really likes the product. He has and will continue to use and recommends to his friends.  He has been using this product for about one year.  I like convenience of shopping through Amazon on line.</li>
            <li> Good for washing and leaves a cooling effect on skin. Not great for reducing acne since there are stronger and better products out there.</li>
            <li> Very nice face wash makes face feel fresh and gets rid of oils. It&#x27;s a great addition to my morning routine</li>
            <li> The wash has a very smooth texture, and it does the job pretty well. I find that in order for the face wash to have the &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34; effect, I have to rub it on my face a few times and let it sit for around 10 seconds. Add a splash of cold water and I&#x27;m wide awake!</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash!</li>
