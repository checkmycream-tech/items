            <li>I really love this perfume, and I am super-picky, too.  </li>
            <li>The scent is sexy and alluring.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>but I love the smell of Realm much better.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume have since it came out</li>
            <li>I read many reviews on this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My 4 yr old grand daughter told me I smell SOOOO good &amp; she has never noticed a perfume before!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fine, and the price was OK, but with all of those pheromones, I was hoping to attract a man.  </li>
            <li>I have to be careful what i wish for lol!!</li>
            <li>but so far I did good the night I went out with it on me :-)</li>
            <li>he was very gentle and kind</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>; at first I thought he didn&#x27;t like it, for the sound of his voice to be honest</li>
            <li>It came quickly and I really love the scent</li>
            <li>Love the scent; have been wearing it for years; quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more sensual scent and this is more of a trendy younger fragrance kinda like the 90s scents.</li>
            <li>My mom loved it and was super surprised that I managed to find it!</li>
            <li>I was excited to see they still make it.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and have lived it since it first came out.</li>
            <li>being said, it has a pleasant smell and I will definitely use it.  </li>
            <li>:) i notice a huge diffrence in the way people treat me while wearing this vs. when i am wearing my normal perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is slightly sweet but not flowery.</li>
            <li>Scent does fade quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, seemed to take a short amount of time to expose my &amp;#34;true scent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne in place of an old favorite of mine that is no longer made, Andron for Women by Jovan.  </li>
            <li>I thought that was pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>The scent lasts over 8 hours; smelling as crisp and clean is when I first put it on me.</li>
            <li>I tried Inner Realm first which was nice</li>
            <li>The best part is you only need a little.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very reasonably priced and is probably worth a try if you are interested in trying one of the pheromone type colognes.  </li>
            <li>As usual, this perfume is amazing!</li>
            <li>used this when i went on our first date</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying it too.  </li>
            <li>but pretty soon can&#x27;t smell it at all.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for making such a unique product available and affordable</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would be what I remembered</li>
            <li>Always one of my fav!  Fast shipping and a bargain price.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of it.  </li>
            <li>So far, no takers!!!</li>
            <li>The bottle is very pretty &amp; comes completely sealed &amp; brand new in box....</li>
            <li>We are both very sensitive to scents but this fades out to a beautiful subtle, soft smell and lasts a long time..</li>
            <li>my husband is very sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>When first applied seems a bit heavy &amp; strong but after a very short (15) min.</li>
            <li>and I really noticed he was different when I wore it then</li>
            <li>It is very reasonably priced yet smells more expensive than it is.  </li>
            <li>Wow, mysterious, sensuous perfume spray!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good but not great and is not nearly as good as Andron for Women was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very long lasting scent.  </li>
            <li> This will go a long way as the bottle was bigger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only other scent I&#x27;ll wear besides my CoCo Chanel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say possibly a gourmand type scent but not necessarily sweet....</li>
            <li> My mom used to wear this perfume in the late 90&#x27;s, early 2000&#x27;s, and then it got discontinued.</li>
            <li> Not only did I get my fragrance, I got other little gifts as well.</li>
            <li> The top, middle and base notes are too overpowering and the silage make other people feel suffocated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Maybe for some other person&#x27;s taste but not for me.</li>
            <li> think I&#x27;ll continue to look for some other brand still though and give it a try too.</li>
            <li> This is a classic scent for daytime casual or evening formal wear.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 this scent, wear it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I think I detect a small bit of amber scent in there</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to pin point because it changes with your body chemistry.</li>
            <li> At least to me it seems that way.  </li>
            <li> It has a subtle aroma and I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li> Just not great.</li>
            <li> Shhhh, it&#x27;s my secret.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t, and I was unable to return it.</li>
            <li> My hubby goes crazy</li>
            <li> It gives me a terrible migraine headache.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awful!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was really hoping this would be what I remembered but it wasn&#x27;t, and I was unable to return it.</li>
            <li> used this when i went on our first date and we have been together for 3 months now :) i notice a huge diffrence in the way people treat me while wearing this vs. when i am wearing my normal perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the trick to making this last is to apply it where body odor is produced, butt, genitals, underarms and boobs and pulse points</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I have found a cheap perfume that smells good. I just tried it so i do not know if it attracts men or not but so far I did good the night I went out with it on me :-)</li>
            <li> Smells a lot like wings. It&#x27;s not exactly what I expected. I was hoping for a more sensual scent and this is more of a trendy younger fragrance kinda like the 90s scents. Pheromones? I&#x27;m not so sure. It&#x27;s fine. Just not great.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, seemed to take a short amount of time to expose my &amp;#34;true scent&amp;#34;. Scent does fade quickly.</li>
            <li> Always one of my fav!  Fast shipping and a bargain price.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.  Exotic with a hint of incense.</li>
            <li> Thank you great price Angelica M</li>
            <li> My husband got this perfume for me our 1st Valentines together. I was excited to see they still make it. It is slightly sweet but not flowery. He loves it on me.</li>
            <li> Wow, mysterious, sensuous perfume spray! When first applied seems a bit heavy &amp; strong but after a very short (15) min. it is delicious!! I&#x27;d say possibly a gourmand type scent but not necessarily sweet.... I think I detect a small bit of amber scent in there but it&#x27;s hard to pin point because it changes with your body chemistry. My 4 yr old grand daughter told me I smell SOOOO good &amp; she has never noticed a perfume before! My hubby goes crazy lol, he loves this &amp; said its sexy but not overpowering. I have to be careful what i wish for lol!! Happy I ordered &amp; will re order! The bottle is very pretty &amp; comes completely sealed &amp; brand new in box....A MUST try &amp; at this price, very unique!</li>
            <li> It gives me a terrible migraine headache. The top, middle and base notes are too overpowering and the silage make other people feel suffocated. Maybe for some other person&#x27;s taste but not for me. It claims that it is supposed to &amp;#34;attract&amp;#34; people to you. I don&#x27;t get it. It actually repels them.</li>
            <li> Best ever!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves the aroma. I put it on to see if he will noticed, and after a wile in the car he said &amp;#34; what&#x27;s that smell?&amp;#34; at first I thought he didn&#x27;t like it, for the sound of his voice to be honest but then, I ask what&#x27;s the matter you don&#x27;t like it? then he said&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; I sure love it &amp;#34;  that&#x27;s way I&#x27;m asking. I don&#x27;t know if is you or is my sister (that happen to be with us in the car) and I said of course it&#x27;s me. then he said o honey I love that perfume you are wearing and the rest of the day he was very gentle and kind and I really noticed he was different when I wore it then when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;In the future I will keep ordering.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and I really love the scent</li>
            <li> As usual, this perfume is amazing! The scent lasts over 8 hours; smelling as crisp and clean is when I first put it on me. People at work have noticed and commented on how awesome I smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this perfume and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Not flowery, kinda reminds me of Obsession by Calvin Klein.  Very long lasting scent.  You don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of it.  Been wearing this for about 10 years or so.  Used to be sold exclusively at Sears but now I can only find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and so does my husband. We are both very sensitive to scents but this fades out to a beautiful subtle, soft smell and lasts a long time..Had tested this but couldn&#x27;t find locally, glad to find it here.</li>
            <li> I really love this perfume, and I am super-picky, too.  It smells wonderful and exotic.  If you are on the fence about trying Realm, I think you should treat yourself!</li>
            <li> love this i especially loved that the company sent coupons and samples also.</li>
            <li> Recommend for every WOMAN!</li>
            <li> my husband is very sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only one I can use a lot of every day and he still likes it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and have lived it since it first came out. The scent is sexy and alluring. When it&#x27;s time to renew, I will use the same seller. Not only did I get my fragrance, I got other little gifts as well.</li>
            <li> I placed my order on Friday and received it by Wedensday. I thought that was pretty quick.  I love the smell.  I tried Inner Realm first which was nice but I love the smell of Realm much better.  This is my first time trying it too.  It is very reasonably priced yet smells more expensive than it is.  The best part is you only need a little.  This will go a long way as the bottle was bigger than I expected.  Thanks Amazon for making such a unique product available and affordable</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE!!!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this scent.  It&#x27;s the only other scent I&#x27;ll wear besides my CoCo Chanel.  When I wear this scent or my CoCo Chanel, I add another product to these.  It&#x27;s unscented pheromone oil by PheromoneOil.com.  It&#x27;s also sold on Amazon.  Will always continue to by Realm as along as it&#x27;s on the market and it stays the same.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume have since it came out it is warm and sexy.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne in place of an old favorite of mine that is no longer made, Andron for Women by Jovan.  It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve had it but have always wished they would come out with it again.  I found Realm on Amazon one day and decided to give it a try.  I would probably rate it a 3.5 if that were possible.  It&#x27;s pretty good but not great and is not nearly as good as Andron for Women was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it has a pleasant smell and I will definitely use it.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to last though.  At least to me it seems that way.  I put it on and like the smell but pretty soon can&#x27;t smell it at all.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just me getting used to it and not noticing it anymore or not.  It&#x27;s very reasonably priced and is probably worth a try if you are interested in trying one of the pheromone type colognes.  I bought it on Amazon and paid about $16 for it.  A very fair price I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll continue to look for some other brand still though and give it a try too.</li>
            <li> My mom used to wear this perfume in the late 90&#x27;s, early 2000&#x27;s, and then it got discontinued. On a whim, I googled this perfume and found it-- where else-- here on Amazon! So I bought it, even though some of the reviews said that it didn&#x27;t smell the same. My mom loved it and was super surprised that I managed to find it! She didn&#x27;t think it smelled any different than she remembered.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a recommendation, and akkk what a mistake. This stuff smells awful!! I only used it once and got rid of it!</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 this scent, wear it everyday.  Shhhh, it&#x27;s my secret.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on this product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it and did not like the musky- man type oriental fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It was inexpensive and smelled cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Not a sensual fragrance to me.&lt;br /&gt;Will not suggest to my friends. Ugh...</li>
            <li> This is a classic scent for daytime casual or evening formal wear. It has a subtle aroma and I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li> Love love love this scent!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and a great value</li>
            <li> Love the scent; have been wearing it for years; quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fine, and the price was OK, but with all of those pheromones, I was hoping to attract a man.  So far, no takers!!!</li>
