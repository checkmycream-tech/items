            <li>This one is a very good choice for 3 main reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a face lotion, I bought every different Nivea aftershave to try them out and compare which one I liked the best.</li>

            <li>Need I say more?</li>

            <li>okay</li>
            <li>okay..</li>
            <li>i love when he uses this product.</li>
            <li>Made in Germany products seem to be much better than the ones made in the states...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s refreshing, cooling sensation on my face</li>
            <li>I have to start this review stating that I love Nivea products - from their body creams to their shower products.  </li>
            <li>I have also used the Q10 balm and love that as well so</li>
            <li>Your face will love you and your spouse will tank you.</li>
            <li>This after shave gel really moisturizes my skin nicely after a good shave.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels nice &amp; smooth after using this gel.</li>
            <li>Nothing to fall in love with.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My face was in love with this gel.  </li>
            <li>It has a refreshing smell and is invigorating.</li>
            <li>As an after-shave gel and moisturizer, this is just an OK product.</li>
            <li>What more do you need from an after shave.  </li>
            <li>my face feels great all day, and I really like the smell too</li>
            <li>Plus the price is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Glad we could find it here, and for such a great price.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and use.</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on easily and is non greasy.</li>
            <li>But, I strongly prefer another Nivea product as opposed to this one -</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my face, and gives a nice cool feeling, with a mild scent.  </li>
            <li>every thing fine.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this after shave gel is so good for my  skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot, it was a fast speed shipping, and a great transaction.</li>
            <li>one must try it its so light and still server the purpose</li>
            <li>Go with what you are comfortable with.</li>
            <li>so this product really cool and moisturized after shaving made my shaved area feel really cool and smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far more superior as a balm - and it actually produces the cooling effect this product advertises as being able to provide.</li>
            <li>The price is right - so give it a try!</li>
            <li>Nivea For Men, Cool Kick - 2</li>
            <li>Cool Kick</li>
            <li>It keeps skin cool</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have anti wrinkle agents and doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the Italian counterpart \\&quot;Intesa\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>And he truly swears by this product to keeping his fresh shaved face so smooth.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong at first but subsides quickly.</li>
            <li>Also shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasing aroma and it disappears on my face quickly.  </li>
            <li>With Arctic Freeze&amp;#34; and such, I was expecting this to contain more menthol and have a better cooling effect, but that isnt the case.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t make the face dry (it says moisturizer, TRUE !), pretty good.</li>
            <li>From the first time l used it I was hooked!  </li>
            <li>It works great, although sometimes it does make my face look a little oily.</li>
            <li>It also smells fresh.</li>
            <li>Worth for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As expected from a product by Nivea, it&#x27;s better than most like it.</li>
            <li>Also the fragrance is pretty mild which I like.</li>
            <li>There is also a light scent; at first I thought it to be a bit too medicine-like, but after a couple days I started finding it pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to last all that long.</li>
            <li>Overall Nivea has done a great job making this product move away from the \\&quot;Aftershave burn\\&quot;, like some of their earlier aftershave formulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good and absorbs fast as long as you don&#x27;t accidently use too much.  </li>
            <li>I would rate this 5 stars if it had a more tame scent or even better, scentless.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much in terms of</li>
            <li>I just found it interesting because I use Nivea&#x27;s Energy Shaving Gel which contains taurine, and energy drinks like Red Bull contain both taurine and caffeine.</li>
            <li>but it does very well!</li>
            <li>Its smooth, and not harsh at all..prevents me from getting in-grown hairs between shaves.</li>
            <li>WIll definitely order again. :)</li>
            <li>Will recommend to anyone interested in this product.</li>
            <li>With the name I expected some kind of cooling feeling or something.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li>For Men Q10 Energy Double Action\\&quot; its a better choice.</li>
            <li>You can probably find a better deal in your local stores.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it promisses.</li>
            <li>Cool Kick is a new after shave from Nivea for Men.</li>
            <li>this feels more like a lotion when applied, whick may take some getting used to, however well worth it, in order to avoid the burning sensation like other aftershaves.</li>
            <li>The prices advertised on Amazon are as good, if not better than I can  find at stores here in town.</li>
            <li>It has a slight fragrance that dissipates quickly so that it won&#x27;t interfere with your favorite cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also seems to last a good long time.</li>
            <li>I think it is doing a fine job keeping my skin moisturized, and I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face sticky or shiny.</li>
            <li>The high quality is evident here.</li>
            <li>after shave gel really soothes my face after using a Norelco electric razor.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>But it does not give much cooling effect after application but</li>
            <li>I really did not think this product would work</li>
            <li>No residual stickiness and a very calming effect.</li>
            <li>my hubby would not like much so m giving 3 because its</li>
            <li>Nivea really represent quality.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this product.</li>
            <li>I really like the cooling sensation this product provides after a close shave -</li>
            <li>We will continue to purchase it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>I prefer the replenishing balm hands down, it feels more like and aftershave.</li>
            <li>There are some brands that cost more, some less.  </li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t regret this buy (i have used it myself after saving legs- no bumps or redness, even when using an older blade.)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They are all just face lotions that smell different except for the replenishing balm (original or sensitive).</li>
            <li>It really helps soothe my face after shaving since I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you are in search of a great, not good, shave gel, guys look no further.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this really helps with my post-shave burn and irritation.</li>
            <li>This was packaged as 2 containers and most places sold single containers for the same price that i got 2!</li>
            <li>i apply feel a little burn (only for one o two minutes)after my face freezes,i feel this nice sensation for hours.</li>
            <li>We first started purchasing this from our local CVS or Walgreens, but they stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>I find the other Nivea after-shave gel that comes in the similar packaging but is much more neutral smelling than this one.</li>
            <li>Love the small BTW.</li>
            <li>It is a translucent blue thick liquid that spreads easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This product far exceeds my expectation.</li>
            <li>I thought the capacity may not be enough before I received the item, while it&amp;#34;s really sufficient.</li>
            <li>Keeps his skin soft and clear, and the double pack was a steal!</li>
            <li>This nivea 2 in 1 Gel &amp; moisturizing is blue fluid liquid,smells very good,whe</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell great (or bad either), but it works well and the scent it does have fades after an hour or so.</li>
            <li>Double Action Shave Balm 3.3 oz]].</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn like other after shaves, and the cooling effect is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>This stuff burns a little on contact, but it really cools and soothes the skin!</li>
            <li>Caffeine is apparently used as an anti-inflammatory ingredient in topical applications.</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin,and i looking for something moisturizing my face after the shave.</li>
            <li>The squeeze bottle is easy to use and is thin enough to tuck into a cabinet or travel bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face gets very dry after washing and sensitive to shaving.  </li>

            <li> one must try it its so light and still server the purpose</li>
            <li> Go with what you are comfortable with.</li>
            <li> so this product really cool and moisturized after shaving made my shaved area feel really cool and smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far more superior as a balm - and it actually produces the cooling effect this product advertises as being able to provide.</li>
            <li> The price is right - so give it a try!</li>
            <li> Nivea For Men, Cool Kick - 2</li>
            <li> Cool Kick</li>
            <li> It keeps skin cool</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have anti wrinkle agents and doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the Italian counterpart \\&quot;Intesa\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> And he truly swears by this product to keeping his fresh shaved face so smooth.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong at first but subsides quickly.</li>
            <li> Also shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasing aroma and it disappears on my face quickly.  </li>
            <li> With Arctic Freeze&amp;#34; and such, I was expecting this to contain more menthol and have a better cooling effect, but that isnt the case.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make the face dry (it says moisturizer, TRUE !), pretty good.</li>
            <li> From the first time l used it I was hooked!  </li>
            <li> It works great, although sometimes it does make my face look a little oily.</li>
            <li> It also smells fresh.</li>
            <li> Worth for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As expected from a product by Nivea, it&#x27;s better than most like it.</li>
            <li> Also the fragrance is pretty mild which I like.</li>
            <li> There is also a light scent; at first I thought it to be a bit too medicine-like, but after a couple days I started finding it pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to last all that long.</li>
            <li> Overall Nivea has done a great job making this product move away from the \\&quot;Aftershave burn\\&quot;, like some of their earlier aftershave formulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells good and absorbs fast as long as you don&#x27;t accidently use too much.  </li>
            <li> I would rate this 5 stars if it had a more tame scent or even better, scentless.  </li>
            <li> I like this product very much in terms of</li>
            <li> I just found it interesting because I use Nivea&#x27;s Energy Shaving Gel which contains taurine, and energy drinks like Red Bull contain both taurine and caffeine.</li>
            <li> but it does very well!</li>
            <li> Its smooth, and not harsh at all..prevents me from getting in-grown hairs between shaves.</li>
            <li> WIll definitely order again. :)</li>
            <li> Will recommend to anyone interested in this product.</li>
            <li> With the name I expected some kind of cooling feeling or something.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li> For Men Q10 Energy Double Action\\&quot; its a better choice.</li>
            <li> You can probably find a better deal in your local stores.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it promisses.</li>
            <li> Cool Kick is a new after shave from Nivea for Men.</li>
            <li> this feels more like a lotion when applied, whick may take some getting used to, however well worth it, in order to avoid the burning sensation like other aftershaves.</li>
            <li> The prices advertised on Amazon are as good, if not better than I can  find at stores here in town.</li>
            <li> It has a slight fragrance that dissipates quickly so that it won&#x27;t interfere with your favorite cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also seems to last a good long time.</li>
            <li> I think it is doing a fine job keeping my skin moisturized, and I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face sticky or shiny.</li>
            <li> The high quality is evident here.</li>
            <li> after shave gel really soothes my face after using a Norelco electric razor.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> But it does not give much cooling effect after application but</li>
            <li> I really did not think this product would work</li>
            <li> No residual stickiness and a very calming effect.</li>
            <li> my hubby would not like much so m giving 3 because its</li>
            <li> Nivea really represent quality.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the cooling sensation this product provides after a close shave -</li>
            <li> We will continue to purchase it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I prefer the replenishing balm hands down, it feels more like and aftershave.</li>
            <li> There are some brands that cost more, some less.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t regret this buy (i have used it myself after saving legs- no bumps or redness, even when using an older blade.)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They are all just face lotions that smell different except for the replenishing balm (original or sensitive).</li>
            <li> It really helps soothe my face after shaving since I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you are in search of a great, not good, shave gel, guys look no further.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this really helps with my post-shave burn and irritation.</li>
            <li> This was packaged as 2 containers and most places sold single containers for the same price that i got 2!</li>
            <li> i apply feel a little burn (only for one o two minutes)after my face freezes,i feel this nice sensation for hours.</li>
            <li> We first started purchasing this from our local CVS or Walgreens, but they stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li> I find the other Nivea after-shave gel that comes in the similar packaging but is much more neutral smelling than this one.</li>
            <li> Love the small BTW.</li>
            <li> It is a translucent blue thick liquid that spreads easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This product far exceeds my expectation.</li>
            <li> I thought the capacity may not be enough before I received the item, while it&amp;#34;s really sufficient.</li>
            <li> Keeps his skin soft and clear, and the double pack was a steal!</li>
            <li> This nivea 2 in 1 Gel &amp; moisturizing is blue fluid liquid,smells very good,whe</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell great (or bad either), but it works well and the scent it does have fades after an hour or so.</li>
            <li> Double Action Shave Balm 3.3 oz]].</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn like other after shaves, and the cooling effect is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> This stuff burns a little on contact, but it really cools and soothes the skin!</li>
            <li> Caffeine is apparently used as an anti-inflammatory ingredient in topical applications.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin,and i looking for something moisturizing my face after the shave.</li>
            <li> The squeeze bottle is easy to use and is thin enough to tuck into a cabinet or travel bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face gets very dry after washing and sensitive to shaving.  </li>
            <li> A small amount keeps my whole face moisturized after shaving.  </li>
            <li> I like it because the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh deodorant type scent that feels awkward putting on your face unless you are some high school aged teen.</li>
            <li> Unlike other Nivea for Men balms that come in this same plastic dispenser, this variety does not come with an outer box.</li>
            <li> Having tried several other aftershave gels which were so</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; effect that stood out from other similar products.</li>
            <li> and I never have dry skin using these products or oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Instantly cools my face down  and moisturizes thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer in this product doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or overbearing like other&#x27;s do.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other Nivea products, and just like the others this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ve used up nearly an entire \\&quot;bottle\\&quot; of this over the past month and a half or so.</li>
            <li> These two bottles would last anyone at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair</li>
            <li> I used other After Shave before this and it use to burn a little</li>
            <li> A dime size or less will do.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little overpriced too.</li>
            <li> so shaving is always hard on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The negative point is this not moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li> It does have a cooling effect on the skin, but I think it is fairly subtle.</li>
            <li> I start to get BAD dry skin and moisturizer is a must.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Nivea For Men, Cool Kick - 2 In 1 Artic Freeze, After Shave Gel and Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cool Kick after shave gel really soothes my face after using a Norelco electric razor. It doesn&#x27;t burn like other after shaves, and the cooling effect is very noticeable. I observed that the ingredient list includes caffeine. Caffeine is apparently used as an anti-inflammatory ingredient in topical applications. I just found it interesting because I use Nivea&#x27;s Energy Shaving Gel which contains taurine, and energy drinks like Red Bull contain both taurine and caffeine. I wonder if Red Bull would work well as a face wash?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cool Kick after shave gel smells good but it isn&#x27;t overpowering, and it won&#x27;t last the entire day. The squeeze bottle is easy to use and is thin enough to tuck into a cabinet or travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5 out of 5 stars, no complaints. It really helps soothe my face after shaving since I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He really likes it. It smells ok. I like it because the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I used other After Shave before this and it use to burn a little but this doesn&#x27;t burn at all and it feels like we are applying a lotion, doesn&#x27;t make the face dry (it says moisturizer, TRUE !), pretty good. Also the fragrance is pretty mild which I like. But it does not give much cooling effect after application but its fine.&lt;br /&gt;The image shown is not the one I received. This one looks larger pack</li>
            <li> Just a face lotion, I bought every different Nivea aftershave to try them out and compare which one I liked the best. They are all just face lotions that smell different except for the replenishing balm (original or sensitive). I prefer the replenishing balm hands down, it feels more like and aftershave.</li>
            <li> I have used various after-shae products over the years and Nivea always seems to deliver.  This after shave gel make your skin very smooth and silky.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Arctic Freeze 2 in 1 Cool Kick is a new after shave from Nivea for Men. Nivea describes it as an \\&quot;after shave &amp; gel moisturizer.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve used up nearly an entire \\&quot;bottle\\&quot; of this over the past month and a half or so. It is a translucent blue thick liquid that spreads easily and absorbs quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky or shiny. It does have a cooling effect on the skin, but I think it is fairly subtle. There is also a light scent; at first I thought it to be a bit too medicine-like, but after a couple days I started finding it pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to last all that long. I think it is doing a fine job keeping my skin moisturized, and I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face sticky or shiny. I have not had any problems with irritation. Unlike other Nivea for Men balms that come in this same plastic dispenser, this variety does not come with an outer box. Made in Germany.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product, and I like it a lot. This after shave gel cools, disinfects, and hydrates my skin. It also smells fresh. Moreover, I no longer have rash after shaving.</li>
            <li> Nice feel and very cool sensation. I really did not think this product would work but it does very well!</li>
            <li> Nivea surely produces the best toiletries for men. The high quality is evident here. No residual stickiness and a very calming effect. The scent is strong at first but subsides quickly. I use this after using my electric razor and it immediately reduces the redness.</li>
            <li> i like this product although it was not what i thought the product was but it did do another job and was very handy it worked very good so this product really cool and moisturized after shaving made my shaved area feel really cool and smooth</li>
            <li> Yea, this is a great lotion to use after shaving with a razor. Its smooth, and not harsh at all..prevents me from getting in-grown hairs between shaves.</li>
            <li> We first started purchasing this from our local CVS or Walgreens, but they stopped carrying it.  Glad we could find it here, and for such a great price.  Also shipped quickly.  WIll definitely order again. :)</li>
            <li> Great product and am completely satisfied. No issues whatsoever. Will recommend to anyone interested in this product. Will do business again with.</li>
            <li> Good cool feeling. Easy to apply and use. Eliminates skin irritation and dryness from shaving. Pleasant fragrance that others enjoy.</li>
            <li> I only use the Nivea After Shave Gel.  It has a pleasing aroma and it disappears on my face quickly.  The prices advertised on Amazon are as good, if not better than I can  find at stores here in town.</li>
            <li> This has a great soothing feel to it and my wife loves the smell!  Two  good points from the get go. This was packaged as 2 containers and most places sold single containers for the same price that i got 2! Great deal, good product, and a happy wife! Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the fact that it moisturizes your face. Gives a nice tingly feeling after. I&#x27;ll buy more once i&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> Nivea Cool Kick is the best of the series aftershaves from Nivea. I used Nivea Balm for more than 10 years but this new product is just perfect - it soothes the skin and is a quite pleasant gel with beautiful aroma.&lt;br /&gt;Just the best!&lt;br /&gt;It can&#x27;t be found in shops but in Amazon is available.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon, you saved me a lot of time.</li>
            <li> my hubby would not like much so m giving 3 because its okay okay..</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  It feels so smooth on my face :D  It smells great, too!  I will definitely stay stocked up on this for a while.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it. Smells delicious too... i love when he uses this product. Keeps his skin soft and clear, and the double pack was a steal! Made in Germany products seem to be much better than the ones made in the states... you won&#x27;t regret this buy (i have used it myself after saving legs- no bumps or redness, even when using an older blade.)</li>
            <li> I like this product very much in terms of it&#x27;s refreshing, cooling sensation on my face and it&#x27;s pleasant fragance.  The product price point is excellent and the shipping was timely as represented.  The only shortcoming I find with the product is that it doesn&#x27;t contain sufficient moisterizers for my skin type and as a consequence I need to apply additional lotion and moisterizer after using the product.</li>
            <li> i switched to this in hopes of stopping razor irritation and it works smells great also about time for me to buy some more</li>
            <li> one of the best after shave moisture that i have ever used... one must try it its so light and still server the purpose</li>
            <li> Great service, super price!</li>
            <li> I like it, works well.</li>
            <li> This gel smells great and adds a very nice cooling sensation after shaving along with moisturizing.  When winter starts to rear it&#x27;s head I start to get BAD dry skin and moisturizer is a must.  The moisturizer in this product doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or overbearing like other&#x27;s do.  The price is right - so give it a try!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you a &amp;#34;freeze&amp;#34; smells good and that is all.</li>
            <li> Nice value. The smell is a bit strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall probably the best 2 in 1 for the price</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell great (or bad either), but it works well and the scent it does have fades after an hour or so. With the name I expected some kind of cooling feeling or something. It doesn&#x27;t irritate skin or sting at all, but there isn&#x27;t any kind of cooling feeling.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this after shave gel is so good for my  skin. Just like this product.</li>
            <li> I have to start this review stating that I love Nivea products - from their body creams to their shower products.  Everything I use from them seems to be the best for my skin and I never have dry skin using these products or oily skin.  This Artic Freeze moisturizer has a wonderful cooling effect and a great smell too!  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice moisturizer with a good clean scent.  I have also used the Q10 balm and love that as well so either way one of these Moisturizers will be a great call!</li>
            <li> It is a good deal for ever compare to another stores,price,quality,quantity every thing fine.I will recommend this to every one.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot. I would recommend it. I got it as a gift for my brother and he loved it. Thanks a lot, it was a fast speed shipping, and a great transaction.</li>
            <li> Nivea really represent quality. This product far exceeds my expectation. Smells great. Your face will love you and your spouse will tank you.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with a preshave oil &amp; Nivea shave gel. This after shave gel really moisturizes my skin nicely after a good shave. Your skin feels nice &amp; smooth after using this gel.</li>
            <li> It is to my expectation. I liked. Worth for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to buy this item. It keeps skin cool</li>
            <li> Wish I would have found this shave gel sooner. Does a good job of cooling and conditioning face after shaving.</li>
            <li> It works great, although sometimes it does make my face look a little oily. Also, the smell is  a bit different.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product. It is exactly what he wanted. We will continue to purchase it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I use different aftershaves depending on my mood. This one is a very good choice for 3 main reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It cools and moisturizers without the burn.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s non-sticky.&lt;br /&gt;3. It has a slight fragrance that dissipates quickly so that it won&#x27;t interfere with your favorite cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> It did not work for my fiancé, it gave him bumps after applying. His skin became irritated when something touched it.</li>
            <li> It is a very good after shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;And I like the price.&lt;br /&gt;But the best thing Nivea did ( refuses to do business with Israel ).</li>
            <li> My face gets very dry after washing and sensitive to shaving.  This aftershave is the perfect mix of soothing and moisture for me.  Plus the price is pretty good.  I would rate this 5 stars if it had a more tame scent or even better, scentless.  It has a fresh deodorant type scent that feels awkward putting on your face unless you are some high school aged teen.</li>
            <li> With Arctic Freeze&amp;#34; and such, I was expecting this to contain more menthol and have a better cooling effect, but that isnt the case. Going back to the time tested Gillette Gels.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin,and i looking for something moisturizing my face after the shave.This nivea 2 in 1 Gel &amp; moisturizing is blue fluid liquid,smells very good,whe i apply feel a little burn (only for one o two minutes)after my face freezes,i feel this nice sensation for hours.The negative point is this not moisturizing my face.If you looks for a good gel aftershave that alleviate the burn this for you,if you want also moisturizing the \\&quot;Nivea For Men Q10 Energy Double Action\\&quot; its a better choice.</li>
            <li> The Nivea quality is as always present. I am not a big fan of this scent though. I find the other Nivea after-shave gel that comes in the similar packaging but is much more neutral smelling than this one.</li>
            <li> Smells good and absorbs fast as long as you don&#x27;t accidently use too much.  A dime size or less will do.</li>
            <li> This product is alright. Nothing to fall in love with. It doesn&#x27;t have anti wrinkle agents and doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the Italian counterpart \\&quot;Intesa\\&quot;. I thought it was a little overpriced too. You can probably find a better deal in your local stores.</li>
            <li> Overall Nivea has done a great job making this product move away from the \\&quot;Aftershave burn\\&quot;, like some of their earlier aftershave formulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, in fact I am thinking of sticking with this product from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note this feels more like a lotion when applied, whick may take some getting used to, however well worth it, in order to avoid the burning sensation like other aftershaves.</li>
            <li> I did got this Nivea For Men 2 In 1 Artic Freeze,After Shave Gel Shave &amp; Moisturizer for my Birthday. And he truly swears by this product to keeping his fresh shaved face so smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have thick facial hair so shaving is always hard on my skin.  This stuff burns a little on contact, but it really cools and soothes the skin!</li>
            <li> Having tried several other aftershave gels which were so so I went in search of yet another.  My girlfriend suggested I checkout Nivea as she uses their products.  Saw the reviews and thought why not.  From the first time l used it I was hooked!  My face was in love with this gel.  Finally a gel that delivers on its promise.  I now have it on subscribe and save.  Since I travel a lot the size works for getting through security.  If you are in search of a great, not good, shave gel, guys look no further.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on easily and is non greasy. It has a refreshing smell and is invigorating. Nice way to wake up in the morning. It also seems to last a good long time.</li>
            <li> As an after-shave gel and moisturizer, this is just an OK product. I didn&#x27;t notice any \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; effect that stood out from other similar products. As expected from a product by Nivea, it&#x27;s better than most like it. But, I strongly prefer another Nivea product as opposed to this one - [[ASIN:B0040QJD80 Nivea Revitalizing Double Action Shave Balm 3.3 oz]]. It&#x27;s far more superior as a balm - and it actually produces the cooling effect this product advertises as being able to provide.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin cool after shave, good item. I thought the capacity may not be enough before I received the item, while it&amp;#34;s really sufficient. Love the small BTW.</li>
            <li> Happy with it.Good face refreshing after shave gel.Does exactly what it promisses.It goes on easly, a nice Arctic breeze feeling.</li>
            <li> The stuff smells and feels good after I shave.  Bam.  Done and done.  What more do you need from an after shave.  There are some brands that cost more, some less.  Go with what you are comfortable with.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this really helps with my post-shave burn and irritation. Instantly cools my face down  and moisturizes thoroughly. The price paid on Amazon cant be beat.</li>
            <li> A small amount keeps my whole face moisturized after shaving.  These two bottles would last anyone at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> I really like the cooling sensation this product provides after a close shave - my face feels great all day, and I really like the smell too (my wife approves as well).</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my face, and gives a nice cool feeling, with a mild scent.  I have tried other Nivea products, and just like the others this one did not disappoint.</li>
