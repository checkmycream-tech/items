            <li>A TAD!  :-)</li>
            <li>the scent is not too strong, it&#x27;s kind of like a mild orange citrus kind of smell.</li>
            <li>I use it in all my laundry - when I open up my washer and dryer a delightful, sweet orange scent billows out.  </li>
            <li>At first I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>First time trying this company and so far i am impressed.</li>
            <li>So deliciously sweet!</li>
            <li>Not too strong.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly, and I am glad I took a chance with this brand.</li>
            <li>A few drops in a bath is wonderfully relaxing.  </li>
            <li>It is such an uplifting, happy aroma.</li>
            <li>Great when mixed with 190 proof vodka!!  </li>
            <li>Also wonderful to put a few drops in vacuum bag to give the whole house a wonderful smell</li>
            <li>Very nice essential oil</li>
            <li>Very nice when you open the door to get a towel.</li>
            <li>It smells like a ripe sweet orange.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to make another batch with just the sweet orange by itself.</li>
            <li>(I WOULD PLACE A DROP OF SWEET ORANGE ONTO THE AIR INTAKES ON MY AIR PURIFIERS).</li>
            <li>I have many other essential oils from this company that I am very happy with it, but this one I am not.</li>
            <li>I bought these oils to treat my pregnant Yorkie for fleas.  </li>
            <li>Was shipped quickly too.  </li>
            <li>I only needed three or four drops but many more dripped in.</li>
            <li>Very intense, delightfully sweet orange scent.  </li>
            <li>It is such a clean fresh scent, love it for my soaps.</li>
            <li>I would buy here again because it was exactly as described and it came quickly.</li>
            <li>When I mix this with vanilla it smells exactly lik orange candy which I remember enjoying when I was young.</li>
            <li>I have used this EO in a couple of my body butters I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery</li>
            <li>Bought this for a gift for my daughter-in-law who is very much into aromatherapy, etc.  </li>
            <li>I love this orange essential oil.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really drip, it pours!</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product several times and I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>but nonetheless I&#x27;ve ordered this before and the quality is comparable to higher end oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for (organic orange oil).</li>
            <li>BUT, it was pretty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that if you intend to mix this with wax to make scented products (surf wax!), you&#x27;ll really need to use a lot of it!  </li>
            <li>Top quality essential oil.  </li>
            <li>This sweet orange is my favorite &#x27;scent&#x27; of all my essential oils so far.</li>
            <li>I use it mixed with mineral oil and epsom salts to make a homemade foot rub that debrides old skin and leaves footsies smooth and sweet.</li>
            <li>The drops come out so fast I need to hold it at an angle and just tip gently to get how much I need.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really smell much when i put it in my oil burner.  </li>
            <li>This oil is very fragrent.  </li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>-I was actually hoping it would be more powerful than it actually was.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not a real strongest smell of orange.</li>
            <li>I order this 10 ml bottle of Organic Sweet Orange EO from Plant Therapy Essential Oils through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The organic sweet orange essential oil smells just like an orange.</li>
            <li>I found that you have to keep constantly monitoring the candle or the water will evaporate quickly and the oil will burn (burned oil</li>
            <li>I mixed it with some other oils to create some nice custom just for me creations.  </li>
            <li>Probably works fine when not mixing with other scents.</li>
            <li>I have used others by different brands and not sure its the same scent but works just fine :)</li>
            <li>I used this for making lip balm, and it added a natural orange flavor without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>NATURAL ORANGE ODOR.</li>
            <li>Ended up using the whole bottle for what I would only need about a quarter of it.</li>
            <li>Seems to be high quality essential oil.  </li>
            <li>Sniffing this gives me an &amp;#34;everything is cozy, sweet, and happy&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in cooking, so far I&#x27;ve only used it to make a home made air freshener.</li>
            <li>Soothes and heals acne but does not dry out my skin like products with that contalin benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>was pretty cheap, mixed in mineral oil for cutting boards.</li>

            <li> was pretty cheap, mixed in mineral oil for cutting boards.</li>
            <li> Still smelled great --- just looked awful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d call it a shaker, not really a dropper.</li>
            <li> Not to waste the leftover oils, I put a few drops on a piece of cotton inside an old glass jar and placed it inside my linen closet.  </li>
            <li> and got this to mix with a couple other EOs in a body butter recipe.</li>
            <li> need to do some research and incorporate this oil into other homemade cleaning and cosmetic</li>
            <li> Then, even if you do keep an eye on the water supply, I found that the oil became a scummy mess in the glass container.  </li>
            <li> I bought the oil &amp;#34;burner&amp;#34; and a few flavors of oil.  </li>
            <li> is not easy to get off the glass saucer).  </li>
            <li> The dropper bottle was a little hard to control.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops and the shampoo smells like oranges!</li>
            <li> The scent is very subtle and won&#x27;t overpower your other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d reorder because of the price &amp; the smell (and maybe I just got a weird bottle).</li>

            <li> I love this orange essential oil.  I mixed it with some other oils to create some nice custom just for me creations.  Loved it.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy never disappoints, this one is no different!  Great quality!</li>
            <li> I have used this EO in a couple of my body butters I like it very much. I&#x27;m sure you would too.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling oil, but I took off a star based on how it drips. It doesn&#x27;t really drip, it pours! The drops come out so fast I need to hold it at an angle and just tip gently to get how much I need. I&#x27;d reorder because of the price &amp; the smell (and maybe I just got a weird bottle).</li>
            <li> I have smelled better but for the price, this is good and energizing. The want me to write more so...........</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Not too strong.  I also love the fact that its not synthetic.  I haven&#x27;t used it in cooking, so far I&#x27;ve only used it to make a home made air freshener.</li>
            <li> I bought these oils to treat my pregnant Yorkie for fleas.  It worked much better than I had hoped.  I add to shampoo and no fleas on Momma or babies.</li>
            <li> I love all of plant therapy oils.  This is a wonderful smelling oil. We difuse it into the air and use it on felt air fresheners.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product several times and I am totally satisfied. I mix this with baking soda for a flea and tick repellant for my dogs instead of putting harmful pestisides on them. I wish it came in larger bottles.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I use it when making my own lip balms and beeswax candles. It smells and tastes heavenly.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of orange, but this one just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  I don&#x27;t really smell much when i put it in my oil burner.  I have many other essential oils from this company that I am very happy with it, but this one I am not.</li>
            <li> I used this for making lip balm, and it added a natural orange flavor without being overpowering.  I would buy here again because it was exactly as described and it came quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted to add to my homemade baby soap shampoo ... Just a few drops and the shampoo smells like oranges!</li>
            <li> Good clean scent. I got it to put in my ice water and use in recipes. It is as described and good price. I have used others by different brands and not sure its the same scent but works just fine :)</li>
            <li> It is such a clean fresh scent, love it for my soaps.</li>
            <li> I used this product to make bath salts. Although the fragrance was pleasing, it did not hold its scent in the bath salts.</li>
            <li> This oil is very fragrent.  It smells like a ripe sweet orange.  It was shipped quickly, and I am glad I took a chance with this brand.</li>
            <li> This has the best aroma and taste ever!</li>
            <li> Very intense, delightfully sweet orange scent.  A few drops in a bath is wonderfully relaxing.  I&#x27;d call it a shaker, not really a dropper.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. I add it to my homemade shampoo and body wash. Very refreshing and wonderful smelling. I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent, I use this for homemade chap stick and hand soap. It adds that light citrusy aroma that makes a product your own. Not overbearing in any way, just a perfect light summery scent. Reminds me of the scent of spiced orange tea, WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> When I mix this with vanilla it smells exactly lik orange candy which I remember enjoying when I was young. the scent is not too strong, it&#x27;s kind of like a mild orange citrus kind of smell.</li>
            <li> I used this to make beard oil for my son. Just a couple drops along with tea tree oil, jojoba and almond oils. He loves it!</li>
            <li> Great if I had received it on time but nonetheless I&#x27;ve ordered this before and the quality is comparable to higher end oils. Blends nicely with my Aloe Vera cream which I use during breakouts. Soothes and heals acne but does not dry out my skin like products with that contalin benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and smells awesome! Used it today when I made DIY carpet fresh😀</li>
            <li> I order this 10 ml bottle of Organic Sweet Orange EO from Plant Therapy Essential Oils through Amazon. This sweet orange is my favorite &#x27;scent&#x27; of all my essential oils so far. I make body butter, lotion bars, sugar scrubs, etc. and got this to mix with a couple other EOs in a body butter recipe. But it smells so good I&#x27;m going to make another batch with just the sweet orange by itself. It&#x27;s such a refreshing smell. I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought the sweet orange oil for use in a diffuser and it smells wonderful! I will be a repeat buyer!</li>
            <li> I know nothing of aromatherapy. I just like things that smell good. Sniffing this gives me an &amp;#34;everything is cozy, sweet, and happy&amp;#34; feeling. I keep it by my bed and it seems to give me good thoughts and sweet dreams too. What a find, and a bargain at twice the price. I will buy again, and am considering it as a gift for family and friends.</li>
            <li> Love plant therapy oils!</li>
            <li> The  aroma from this oil is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Seems to be high quality essential oil.  It has a wonderful smell and blends well with Ylang Ylang oil to make a relaxing roll on scent.  So glad that there is an affordable EO company out there!</li>
            <li> I love the orange.  Great for my home remedies and recipes.  Prompt shipping.  I am pleased with the Plant Therapy product.</li>
            <li> I use it in all my laundry - when I open up my washer and dryer a delightful, sweet orange scent billows out.  And it lasts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to do some research and incorporate this oil into other homemade cleaning and cosmetic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just love it!</li>
            <li> One of the best oils for fragrance, love it in DIY lotions and solid perfumes. Also wonderful to put a few drops in vacuum bag to give the whole house a wonderful smell</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy with my purchase.  I made sugar scrub for a baby shower and this worked out perfectly, all the guests really loved it!  I would definitely purchase this again for my needs in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Very fast delivery</li>
            <li> Bought this for a gift for my daughter-in-law who is very much into aromatherapy, etc.  Based on the wonderful scent she thought the oil was much more expensive than it was.  She was very pleased!</li>
            <li> I cannot get enough of this orange smell! Absolutely love it. Would definitely recommend. It is such an uplifting, happy aroma.</li>
            <li> smells great but need a lot of it to get the scent</li>
            <li> I like using wax melts in my home, so I thought I would try scented oils as well.  I bought the oil &amp;#34;burner&amp;#34; and a few flavors of oil.  At first I was very pleased.  As time progressed. I found that you have to keep constantly monitoring the candle or the water will evaporate quickly and the oil will burn (burned oil is not easy to get off the glass saucer).  Then, even if you do keep an eye on the water supply, I found that the oil became a scummy mess in the glass container.  It looked like something you would see in a swamp after an oil spill.  Still smelled great --- just looked awful.  I decided to go back to the wax melts.  Not to waste the leftover oils, I put a few drops on a piece of cotton inside an old glass jar and placed it inside my linen closet.  Very nice when you open the door to get a towel.</li>
            <li> Product performed perfectly and will definitely purchase more.  Great when mixed with 190 proof vodka!!  Makes an inexpensive Grand Marnier!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil..I mix it with coconut oil for a \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; to put on my kids.. They love it too</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for (organic orange oil). Now to make some yummy organic lip balms!</li>
            <li> I throw about twenty drops of this essential oil along with my fruit enzyme cleaner that I make in with a load of towels that have become a bit funky.  It helps get rid of the musty smell and nothing beats the energizing orange smell of your towel after your morning shower!</li>
            <li> I USED THIS ITEM IN MY BEDROOM (I WOULD PLACE A DROP OF SWEET ORANGE ONTO THE AIR INTAKES ON MY AIR PURIFIERS). IT WORKS VERY WELL. NATURAL ORANGE ODOR.</li>
            <li> was pretty cheap, mixed in mineral oil for cutting boards. Doesn&#x27;t seem that fragrent, but the scent is there-I was actually hoping it would be more powerful than it actually was. Ended up using the whole bottle for what I would only need about a quarter of it. BUT, it was pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;So not terrible.</li>
            <li> I used this in home made lip balm.  It added a nice taste.  Was shipped quickly too.  I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if you intend to mix this with wax to make scented products (surf wax!), you&#x27;ll really need to use a lot of it!  The scent is very subtle and won&#x27;t overpower your other ingredients.  Probably works fine when not mixing with other scents.</li>
            <li> Great smell and true to description. Arrived on time and using for diffusing. First time trying this company and so far i am impressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not a real strongest smell of orange.</li>
            <li> The dropper bottle was a little hard to control.  I only needed three or four drops but many more dripped in.</li>
            <li> Top quality essential oil.  I use it mixed with mineral oil and epsom salts to make a homemade foot rub that debrides old skin and leaves footsies smooth and sweet.</li>
            <li> The organic sweet orange essential oil smells just like an orange. So deliciously sweet! I use this in the laundry with homemade fabric softener and it smells up that area of the house rather nicely.  Makes doing laundry a tad more pleasant...A TAD!  :-)</li>
            <li> Yummy to smell and yummy to taste.  I use this for everything from air freshener to cleaning spray to flavoring in my H2O bottle.</li>
