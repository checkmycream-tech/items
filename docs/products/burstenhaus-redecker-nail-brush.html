            <li>Okay, I did not buy these brushes for cleaning nails.</li>
            <li>instead of Made in China emblazoned on most.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>It’s a great potato scrubber, or use it to clean off garden fresh vegetables.</li>
            <li>in all I am still using it and it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I kept looking for a good nail brush and thought I couldn&#x27;t find one that was reasonably priced and almost gave up.</li>
            <li>It is a very good brush, make sure you give it a chance to dry out, don&#x27;t just let it sit in water.</li>
            <li>which makes it easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>This is a strong, no fuss/no muss nail brush.</li>

            <li>Easy to clean and aesthetically fits in just about anywhere.</li>
            <li>#34;It does exactly what I wanted it to do, and it does it better than the plastic brushes from Walmart.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and looks sexy while doing it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>This brush is what I had been searching for and boy does it clean my hands, nails and cuticles well.</li>
            <li>No matter how often he washed them he couldn&#x27;t get clean.</li>
            <li>I am giving this brush a Clean Thumbs-up.  </li>
            <li>This brush makes clean up a breeze.</li>
            <li>In an age of plastic, its nice to see products made of natural materials.</li>
            <li>It looks good but does not last.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a good brush, look no further.</li>
            <li>Also nice that it&#x27;s wood and natural bristles.</li>
            <li>The size is just right to fit in the palm of your hand while cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this brush and for most people this is more than enough to clean the dirt from off your hands and under your nails</li>
            <li>i would spend the extra $ and buy their really nice brush, its bristles are so soft you can use it on your body and even face, love this company!</li>
            <li>This is a lovey sturdy little brush that looks great in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>This brush provides the fastest and most complete removal of dirt from under nails of any brush I ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Not as stiff as I hoped, but the natural fibers are more abrasive than competing plastic brushes, so this one gets the win.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller right away for clarification.  </li>
            <li>They contacted the manufacturer immediately and found that the country it was made in had changed to Poland, and they corrected it in the product description right away.  </li>
            <li>Just the right stiffness for my purpose.</li>
            <li>Just the right size.</li>
            <li>Strong enough to get used your nails but not painful.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are firm and it&#x27;s easy to hold while washing!!</li>
            <li>These bristles won&#x27;t be falling flat for many years.  </li>
            <li>It is stiff and does a super job on nails, but I also like to use it on a very close buzzed head to help make sure I don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>This nail very well designed and crafted.</li>
            <li>This really does the job.  </li>
            <li>; So there you have it, straight from a cowboy&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li>but then I don&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li>This brush really works.</li>
            <li>I also thought the more narrow side with the firmer bristles would be more harder</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be great for removing grime, but for a daily-use cuticle brush, it&#x27;s a little too rough for my needs.</li>
            <li>and I live in a very low-humidity climate.</li>
            <li>I have assembled a set of similar wooden bath tools, and I love the look.</li>
            <li>High quality workmanship.  </li>
            <li>But besides that for the quality and price I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Nice hard bristles.  </li>
            <li>This lasted a lot longer than I expected and with good quality products, if you take care of them they should last a long time.</li>
            <li>High quality and apparently intended for REALLY grimy fingernails.</li>
            <li>I prefer a harder brush to really clean the nails.  </li>
            <li>and it usually gets most of it</li>
            <li>The natural fibers are still the same as when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li>I tried it at first on dry hands with junk under my nails and it didn&#x27;t work at all, so i was disappointed, but I realized that wasn&#x27;t the best way to use it.</li>
            <li>The bristles are firm yet quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>Old school scrub the grit out of the nails brush.</li>
            <li>It can remove garden dirt, auto, motorcycle, and bicycle grease and other grime from intensive handiwork of hobbies or good old-fashion manual labor--I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it every day, but only when I would embarrass fellows at a dinner party or other social event.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These bristles are natural, and I used to have brush that had very coarse and stiff nylon bristles that worked like magic.  </li>
            <li>The stiff bristles clean hands and under nails.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve only had it for three weeks of normal use.  </li>
            <li>The wood gets wet in the natural fibers don&#x27;t last as long as fake fibers, but while it lasts it is very, very good at the intended purpose.</li>
            <li>The bristles were great, but holy cow there was something seriously wrong with the wood.</li>
            <li>The bristles are quite firm and will occasionally hurt, but it gets my nails clean.  </li>
            <li>This brush is much stiffer than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Stiff enough to do the job but not painful like plastic bristles tend to be.</li>
            <li>This brush really cleans under the nails and the other side of the brush cleans the cuticles.  </li>
            <li>The usual brushes are flimsy &amp; the bristles fall flat quickly.  </li>

            <li> The usual brushes are flimsy &amp; the bristles fall flat quickly.  </li>
            <li> but after a month it is starting to fray out a little like an old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The natural fibers on this brush are very hard and you could scrub a floor with it, so be careful when you first use it.</li>
            <li> Bristles are very tough compared to other brushes, But nice for man hands and getting grease from nails after changing oil in the truck.&lt;br /&gt;Giving it 4 stars cause the wood does seem to be getting some cracks in it after about 6 months from being wet</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too soft or too hard, even for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> This little brush is one very well made little piece of heaven.</li>

            <li> High quality and apparently intended for REALLY grimy fingernails. It can remove garden dirt, auto, motorcycle, and bicycle grease and other grime from intensive handiwork of hobbies or good old-fashion manual labor--I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it every day, but only when I would embarrass fellows at a dinner party or other social event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered another, softer one, the ecoTools Bamboo Nail Brush for softer, daily use (and it&#x27;s great too!) I suggest the combination.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 nail brushes to help clean my hands after working on greasy cars, and this one was the best of the 3. Not as stiff as I hoped, but the natural fibers are more abrasive than competing plastic brushes, so this one gets the win. I tried it at first on dry hands with junk under my nails and it didn&#x27;t work at all, so i was disappointed, but I realized that wasn&#x27;t the best way to use it. Now I soap up my hands, get them wet, and then scrub all over and it usually gets most of it</li>
            <li> Most excellent. I do a lot of yard and home renovation projects. I always forget to wear gloves and my hands take a beating. This brush is what I had been searching for and boy does it clean my hands, nails and cuticles well. The bristles are firm yet quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> I tend to garden bare handed which leaves my nails extremely dirty.  This brush really cleans under the nails and the other side of the brush cleans the cuticles.  I am ordering more because my Hubby stole one of them from me for his shop sink.</li>
            <li> The brush is a nice size. which makes it easy to handle.  There are two bristle sizes.  It does the job!</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  Nice hard bristles.  Not soft and plasticy/fragile like some other nail brushes.  Does a deep cleaning!  What you need!!!</li>
            <li> I use this daily in the shower and it works great. It is stiff and does a super job on nails, but I also like to use it on a very close buzzed head to help make sure I don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs. Does not irritate my head, as the bristles are forgiving when using it on skin.</li>
            <li> Average brush.  I prefer a harder brush to really clean the nails.  If you like a softer brush, this may be for you</li>
            <li> really cleans the grime from under fingernails after gardening, wife and I both use it, fits in your hand nicely.</li>
            <li> this is the best company I&#x27;ve dealt with on amazon, their customer service is superb.  i would spend the extra $ and buy their really nice brush, its bristles are so soft you can use it on your body and even face, love this company!</li>
            <li> I work on cars on the weekend and I work as a process engineer during the week in the mineral processing industry.  My hands get DIRTY.  I wanted a brush that had stiff bristles to scrape the dirt out of my callouses and under my finger nails.  This does an ok job.  These bristles are natural, and I used to have brush that had very coarse and stiff nylon bristles that worked like magic.  That brush was a 6 out of 5, this is a good brush, but compared to that one I used to have its a 2 out of 5.  The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 is because the bristles started falling out as soon as I use it.  It appears to have stopped.  I will continue to use this brush and for most people this is more than enough to clean the dirt from off your hands and under your nails BUT if you work on dirty engines and ultra fine abrasive dust/dirt I would recommend  you look for a brush with stiffer, and perhaps synthetic bristles.</li>
            <li> In an age of plastic, its nice to see products made of natural materials. This nail very well designed and crafted. They are made in Europe. I recommend this product and will purchase another one for myself when the one I have wears out. They make a wonderful stocking stuffer for gardeners!</li>
            <li> The usual brushes are flimsy &amp; the bristles fall flat quickly.  I needed a brush for dirt that was embedded under my nails from gardening.  This really does the job.  These bristles won&#x27;t be falling flat for many years.  The size is just right to fit in the palm of your hand while cleaning.  Besides the surgical scrub brush I once had, this is the second best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nail brush.  It does what it should without losing the bristles.  Great product.  If you need a nail brush, then this is it.</li>
            <li> I got this nail brush for my husband who works with cattle and who has perpetually dirty hands. No matter how often he washed them he couldn&#x27;t get clean. I asked him how many stars to give this brush and he said five. I asked why and he said, &amp;#34;It does exactly what I wanted it to do, and it does it better than the plastic brushes from Walmart.&amp;#34; So there you have it, straight from a cowboy&#x27;s mouth. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t look ugly sitting on the sink.</li>
            <li> Cleans under nails better than any I have ever had.  I am giving this brush a Clean Thumbs-up.  A little pricey but I am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Old school scrub the grit out of the nails brush. Just what I wanted, but can&#x27;t find anywhere locally.</li>
            <li> I shopped to find a quality brush and purchased two of these six months ago. They have been used sparingly and carefully and yet, the wood has cracked. I had hoped this would last for a while but unfortunately, this was not the case. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> The wood cracked after several weeks - no return and no refund.  Cannot recommend this product.  It looks good but does not last.</li>
            <li> This is a strong, no fuss/no muss nail brush. Easy to clean and aesthetically fits in just about anywhere. It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> High quality workmanship.  Great brush until used as the beechwood splits when exposed to water.  Splitting does not seem to impact usability.</li>
            <li> Cleans my fingers and nails just fine.  I like that it has a softer and a stiffer side.  Seems to dry out well between uses, but then I don&#x27;t use it much and I live in a very low-humidity climate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been awhile since I have used a good nail brush and I am so pleased with this one. The bristles are firm and it&#x27;s easy to hold while washing!!</li>
            <li> Supper little brush. Great design and craftsmanship.&lt;br /&gt;Made solid and well. Bristles are very tough compared to other brushes, But nice for man hands and getting grease from nails after changing oil in the truck.&lt;br /&gt;Giving it 4 stars cause the wood does seem to be getting some cracks in it after about 6 months from being wet I suppose. But besides that for the quality and price I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush is much stiffer than I expected.  It&#x27;d be great for removing grime, but for a daily-use cuticle brush, it&#x27;s a little too rough for my needs.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this brush, the product description said it was &amp;#34;made in Germany&amp;#34;.  When I received the brush, there was a sticker attached saying &amp;#34;made in Poland&amp;#34;.  I contacted the seller right away for clarification.  I was totally amazed at the prompt attention that was given to my concern.  They contacted the manufacturer immediately and found that the country it was made in had changed to Poland, and they corrected it in the product description right away.  Definitely the BEST customer service I have received in quite a while.  I am very pleased with both the seller and the brush!</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Just the right stiffness for my purpose.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I thought I was getting something perfect for nail cleaning but after a month it is starting to fray out a little like an old toothbrush. I also thought the more narrow side with the firmer bristles would be more harder then they actual are. I probably expected a lot with the wood handle and all but was a little under-whelmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am still using it and it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Ouch, bristles way too stiff.  Wood cracked.</li>
            <li> The bamboo wood splits and shrivels after a couple months, and then the bristles fall out.</li>
            <li> My family of four have been using it for over a month and it works great. No complaints at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It has been over a year and it still works great. The natural fibers are still the same as when I first bought it.  I always keep it away from water after use and the wood is not moldy. This lasted a lot longer than I expected and with good quality products, if you take care of them they should last a long time. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> After only a week of use, the wood has begun to crack in various spots of the handle.  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I kept looking for a good nail brush and thought I couldn&#x27;t find one that was reasonably priced and almost gave up. Found this nail brush and it&#x27;s just perfect. Cleans underneath my nails beautifully. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> One in the kitchen. One in the bathroom. It is perfect! Just the right size. The bristles are not too soft or too hard, even for my dry sensitive skin. And in a pinch, I use it to scrub tile grout!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several months.  I work in the garden a lot. I&#x27;m not always diligent about wearing gloves.  This brush makes clean up a breeze. Strong enough to get used your nails but not painful.  No issues w the wood ( as mentioned in one or two of the reviews )and it lives in my shower.  I&#x27;m buying another in case they stop making them!!!!</li>
            <li> Wood handle has a nice feel.  Sides of brushes have two different stiffness levels.  Neither one will rip your fingers to shreds. With a good cleaner like Gojo you can get your hands clean after working no problem!</li>
            <li> Very nice , durable fingernail and egg washing brush</li>
            <li> Perfect stiffness and perfect function until the fibers start deforming which is pretty soon - I&#x27;ve only had it for three weeks of normal use.  I will continue to look for the perfect finger nail cleaning brush since this is not it.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a good brush, look no further. You found the company, now just choose your style for your needs!~</li>
            <li> Okay, I did not buy these brushes for cleaning nails. I bought one for that purpose but the others were bought for scrubbing vegetables in the kitchen and scrubbing hard to reach areas in the shower.  The bristles are hard so if you are using it for your finger nails it may be too abrasive for some. I have one for when I work on the car. It gets into areas that simple hand washing does not reach. It’s a great potato scrubber, or use it to clean off garden fresh vegetables. The product is well built and the price point is good.</li>
            <li> The wood became moldy after leaving it in the bathroom for a week.  The bristles were great, but holy cow there was something seriously wrong with the wood.</li>
            <li> The natural fibers on this brush are very hard and you could scrub a floor with it, so be careful when you first use it. It is a very good brush, make sure you give it a chance to dry out, don&#x27;t just let it sit in water. If you like a hard brush that will get the grime of your hands this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> This is a lovey sturdy little brush that looks great in my bathroom.  I have assembled a set of similar wooden bath tools, and I love the look.</li>
            <li> Got this to clean out my nails after dirty projects (like backpacking, gardening, etc).  The bristles are quite firm and will occasionally hurt, but it gets my nails clean.  The bristles do shed, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.  The shape fits great in the hand and it does it&#x27;s job while looking like a nice nail cleaner.  I have considered purchasing another one for scrubbing vegetables, but I have done nothing to make that happen.  I am concerned about how this will age when it&#x27;s left in moist climates (or is just left in the sink).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and looks sexy while doing it.  I probably won&#x27;t purchase another one due to the shedding and I wonder how the wood will hold up over the long haul.  Then again, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to purchase another one of these for several years.</li>
            <li> I have a farm and my nails get super dirty!  With my other nail brushes I have to scrub and scrub and then use a wooden pick to get the rest of the dirt out from under my nails.  This brush provides the fastest and most complete removal of dirt from under nails of any brush I ever tried.  The wood gets wet in the natural fibers don&#x27;t last as long as fake fibers, but while it lasts it is very, very good at the intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush. Feels good.</li>
            <li> This brush really works. The stiff bristles clean hands and under nails. Also nice that it&#x27;s wood and natural bristles. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> great brush with nice bristles</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for cleaning hands and nails.  Stiff enough to do the job but not painful like plastic bristles tend to be.</li>
            <li> This little brush is one very well made little piece of heaven. It does what it says, but it screams, I will be around for a while, which is a good thing these days, instead of Made in China emblazoned on most. Enjoy!</li>
