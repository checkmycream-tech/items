            <li>*, my friends, is the smell-picture I got from this scent when I bought a full size bottle.</li>
            <li>The smell is femine and sweet.</li>
            <li>Nanette Lepore was the only scent I kept coming back to, because it&#x27;s unique blend of notes draws me in and works wonderfully with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>and i loved how long it stayed on!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent by far!</li>
            <li>This pefume is impossible for me to find in stores, so happy I found it here and for a great price.</li>

            <li>This scent is soft and clean but powerful where it counts.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is also pretty.  </li>
            <li>First off the begin this review I have to say one thing:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and has a slight sweet flavor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very picky perfume person.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this perfume for a long time, and it is not always easy to find.</li>
            <li>I wear it when I want to feel extra special.</li>
            <li>My new signature scent!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to smell clean &amp; soft and totally feminine.</li>
            <li>I find most of them to be smelly and heavy</li>
            <li>my body the rose settles in after a little while, so the blend of darker and brighter notes are equal.</li>
            <li>I did this at work, where I had to live with the scent all day....</li>
            <li>Clean not over powering like other smells.  </li>

            <li>I was surprised when I saw this perfume.</li>
            <li>I loved the bottle and after having read the description of the scent on this and other websites listing all notes I thought it was well worth a shot, but it smells awful and very, very strong.</li>
            <li>IT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING A YOUNG 6 - 15 YR OLD GIRL WOULD WEAR.</li>
            <li>This makes it light and romantic yet gives it that oomph needed to set it apart from ordinary floral scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>do you sell like this kind of product, especially perfume?????.The customer who got angry.</li>

            <li> do you sell like this kind of product, especially perfume?????.The customer who got angry.</li>
            <li> IS THAT IT CAME WAAAAY EARLIER THAN EXPECTED</li>
            <li> It has an almost sharp musky scent that honestly smells as if this product had simply gone bad.</li>
            <li> In the same place I&#x27;d sprayed the tiny little sample vial previously.</li>
            <li> A friend sent me a tiny little sample vial of this, and when I smelled it I</li>
            <li> Never really heard of this perfume before, so</li>
            <li> and I only had it for a few days.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last long, my solution is to keep a spare, small bottle at work to reapply as needed.</li>
            <li> and so I kept trying to find a scent so that I could be like all the other girls.</li>
            <li> What a waste........</li>
            <li> (seriously this isnt a joke)  </li>
            <li> Within just a few minutes the scent developed into something indescribably nasty!</li>
            <li> , THAT THIS IS THE WRONG PERFUME AND IT</li>
            <li> boy was I sorry.</li>
            <li> STINKS.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment in something that was so enticing in the sample size.....</li>
            <li> I was obsessed about this scent, just knew THIS was the one I wanted and must have!</li>

            <li> This fragrance is heavenly. If is very light, not overbearing. It is wonderful for work.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped to me very quickly and was a great value for the price I paid.  I love this perfume, I always have people ask me what I am wearing and they love it. I do recommend this fragrance, but I do hope that not too many of you get it because I am enjoying the attention of having this unique fragrance that not too many know about. :)</li>
            <li> Never really heard of this perfume before, so I just tried it out. I love it and I only had it for a few days. Even though the shipping process had some problems, I was glad to get my product.</li>
            <li> The product came on time, just as described. I got it for 25, so the price was really good. I got it as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> The perfume is amazing!    I received the item on time, and i am happy with your services  Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> It smells great and fresh , only perfume I like . I understand why stores are not carrying it anymore</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for a long time, and it is not always easy to find. So glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The perfume is light to the nose but the fragrance is enchanted.  One of the best perfume I bought although the rest are also good.  The bottle is also pretty.  Would not hesitate to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It&#x27;s not too strong and has a slight sweet flavor.  I like fresh perfumes.  This doesn&#x27;t have a musk smell, or old lady smell.  It&#x27;s just nice and fresh and kinda sweet.</li>
            <li> I love sweet scents and this one of my favorites.  So happy I was able to find it here and for a great price!</li>
            <li> I PUCHASED THIS THINKING THAT IT MIGHT BE THE PERFUME THAT I HAVE WANTED FOR A WHILE. WHEN RECIEVED, IT TURNS OUT THESE DUMMIES SENT ME SHOWER GEL. THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT STATES ON AMAZON &amp;#34;Nanette Lepore By Nanette Lepore for Women Eau De Parfum Spray, 3.4-Ounce.&amp;#34; SO WHY IN THE HECK DID I RECIEVE SHOWER GEL?! THE ONLY GOOD THING THAT CAME OUT OF THIS IS THAT IT CAME WAAAAY EARLIER THAN EXPECTED BECAUSE, LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, THAT THIS IS THE WRONG PERFUME AND IT STINKS. IT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING A YOUNG 6 - 15 YR OLD GIRL WOULD WEAR.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  Thanks for making it readily available and affordable!</li>
            <li> Possibly best smelling perfume I own. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years, and nobody else seems to every have heard of it!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume. I got it for her for her birthday. The perfume was packaged well and was shipped pretty quick. Very happy with this transaction.</li>
            <li> My new signature scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very picky perfume person. I find most of them to be smelly and heavy (though I confess to loving Red Door when I was 8), and really prefer the nice smell of soap more than anything else on my body. However, I am a girl and so I kept trying to find a scent so that I could be like all the other girls. Enter Nanette Lepore. I swear I have tried on every scent over the years and one day I methodically went through Sephora&#x27;s collection. Nanette Lepore was the only scent I kept coming back to, because it&#x27;s unique blend of notes draws me in and works wonderfully with my body chemistry. Nothing else in the store worked as well. Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why do I like Nanette Lepore? First off, there&#x27;s that lovely, intoxicating blend of rose and jasmine notes. The rose is light and airy, which I really like, while the jasmine creates a deeper, more lush scent to balance the rose. The amber and sandalwood notes give the depth to this fragrance that it needs. It&#x27;s the perfect everyday scent and it goes easily from day to night wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my body the rose settles in after a little while, so the blend of darker and brighter notes are equal. This makes it light and romantic yet gives it that oomph needed to set it apart from ordinary floral scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my signature perfume. I love it and I couldn&#x27;t be happier that it was created.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It is one of my favorites. It has a feminine smell to it. Whenever I wear it, I get many compliments.</li>
            <li> love the smell would buy it again.</li>
            <li> A friend sent me a tiny little sample vial of this, and when I smelled it I *HAD* to have it. It was all I could think about after I sprayed it on my arm, I couldn&#x27;t keep myself from smelling it over and over. I was obsessed about this scent, just knew THIS was the one I wanted and must have! So I ordered it on Amazon. It couldn&#x27;t get here fast enough, I had to have it..............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it finally arrived I opened it where I stood, and sprayed on a spritz. Just one! In the same place I&#x27;d sprayed the tiny little sample vial previously. I did this at work, where I had to live with the scent all day....boy was I sorry. Within just a few minutes the scent developed into something indescribably nasty! Picture unwashed hooker, strolling through Walgreens spraying on every Designer Imposter fragrance she can find, and calling that a bath. Then as she stands and lights a cigarette outside the Walgreens entrance on her way back to the streets, a cat stops and pees on her leg. *THAT*, my friends, is the smell-picture I got from this scent when I bought a full size bottle. Same formula as the sample, but WTH. Just WTH. The rest of the day I wavered between disgust and nausea as the reeking notes wafted up to my nose. I was embarrassed and humiliated to have to smell like that at work, on purpose!&lt;br /&gt;I gave away the bottle to someone else. What a waste........what a letdown. What a disappointment in something that was so enticing in the sample size.....</li>
            <li> I was devastated when I could not find this in any store. Lucky for me, my fiancee is awesome and found it on here.</li>
            <li> First off the begin this review I have to say one thing: I kind of have this passion about always smelling good.  This obsession has led me to own approx. 40 different perfumes.  I am known as the girl who always smells good. (seriously this isnt a joke)  Now I have always searched for that \\&quot;signature perfume\\&quot; the one I wear the most and the one most people recognize I&#x27;m wearing.  At the moment it is a tie between \\&quot;Lolita Lempika\\&quot; &amp; Philosophy&#x27;s \\&quot;Falling in Love .  But now, after purchasing Nanette Lepore it has beaten them both.  I&#x27;m even purchasing the body lotion/cream.  And I assure you, THAT IS NOT SOMETHING I DO.  I have to absolutely LOVE it to buy bath products.  This scent is soft and clean but powerful where it counts.  Amazing, amazing, amazing.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to smell clean &amp; soft and totally feminine.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  A patient came into our office and was wearing this scent.  I loved it so much I asked her where she got it.  I ordered it for myself.  Absolutely pleased.</li>
            <li> This pefume is impossible for me to find in stores, so happy I found it here and for a great price. The smell is femine and sweet. I wear this daily in the warmer months. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last long, my solution is to keep a spare, small bottle at work to reapply as needed.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my wife. This fragrance has been her staple for years and is very nice, but appears to be going away.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I saw this perfume. There is no box and furthermore, this bottle is scratched here and there.&lt;br /&gt;How do you sell like this kind of product, especially perfume?????.The customer who got angry. This is a trash.</li>
            <li> i love this scent, it smells sweet - warm - floral - cute - flirty.  its a good size bottle, and the packaging is adorable.  i wish there was a hint more rose, but i still love it.</li>
            <li> Smells like a childhood memory.  Clean not over powering like other smells.  Good for daily wear at work or young people</li>
            <li> This perfume has been a fav of mines for years!! Was glad To find it again!!! The product arrive before time .... Excellent!</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  I get a lot of compliments.  It&#x27;s very feminine but not for everyday wear.  I wear it when I want to feel extra special.</li>
            <li> What can i say it&#x27;s my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> awesome!  it smelled great and i loved how long it stayed on! great price too! love it so much! great!</li>
            <li> My daughters favorite perfume</li>
            <li> My daughter calls this her signature fragrance! Happy daughter, happy mom!</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this perfume. So worth the price.i will definetly purchase again</li>
            <li> I loved the bottle and after having read the description of the scent on this and other websites listing all notes I thought it was well worth a shot, but it smells awful and very, very strong. It has an almost sharp musky scent that honestly smells as if this product had simply gone bad.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of Nanette Lepore it&#x27;s has a flowery &amp; sweet smell . It&#x27;s also comes in a very&lt;br /&gt;Cute package.. Great for gift giving!</li>
