            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It is my favorite color!</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>I love the formulation as well!</li>
            <li>The color was great, but it seems to chip off easily.</li>
            <li>The shipping was INCREDIBLY FAST!!!!!</li>
            <li>It looks amazing on toes or fingers, and like all china glaze polishes stays on for along time.</li>
            <li>Love the bright neon coral color of Flip Flop Fantasy.</li>
            <li>I have been looking all over for a nice coral color.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, it&#x27;s very neon and bright and perfect for the summer in Florida.</li>
            <li>I own over 70 bottles.</li>
            <li>Gold sparkles give it a nice look also.</li>
            <li>Super beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend both. :D</li>
            <li>it is my absolute favorite color and looks good with a tan!!</li>
            <li>I bought this polish and it chips very easily</li>
            <li>it chips very very very easily..</li>
            <li>Love this color bright and pretty definitely a good color for the collection if you love bright toes or fingers</li>
            <li>However, the color is still incredibly flattering, sexy, cute, and makes you look super tan.</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a great color and great buy just hope for a non-goopy product!</li>
            <li>and I matched up another China Glaze color that I liked more to go with the coral color</li>
            <li>This one I did get and love the color and the bling toe separator to go with it which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>Most of the china glaze neon colors are amazing, but this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it dries to a matte finish, but put a glossy top coat on and it looks awesome if you&#x27;re not a fan of matte.</li>
            <li>I need that kind of color for the summer, for sure will order some more of it in future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a neon pastel orange, goes great with the hot melon color this Spring/Summer.</li>
            <li>this is such a beautiful neon color, I highly recomended, great for summer and great in combination with othe colors.</li>
            <li>It is very light.  </li>
            <li>I have never owned a china glaze nail polish before,so i decided to give it a try!This is a beautiful neon coral pink color and is GREAT if you are on the go because it dries</li>
            <li>A super bright orange.  </li>
            <li>Bright and pretty summer color on nails!</li>
            <li>and I also thought it&#x27;d be more of a coral color,</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more of a neon orange.</li>
            <li>Overall AWESOME product!</li>
            <li>From the swatches of this polish that I had seen, i fell in love</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>i love this neon coral shade.</li>
            <li>but i love the color!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even with a top coat, it chipped off within days.</li>
            <li>this nail polish is perfect especially because its a neon color.</li>
            <li>but i love the color</li>
            <li>I LOVE china glaze nail polishes</li>
            <li>I  love the color</li>
            <li>Love the neon color.</li>
            <li>The color paints more orange, but it look like the bottle (in my opinion), after hours of being wore.</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t the color I thought it was, but still love it.</li>
            <li>I Love the color.</li>
            <li>It is also matte so a shiny top coat is a must.</li>
            <li>I fix this by using a glossy top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But using a top coat fixes that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting more of a coral/pinkish color based on what some of the reviewer said on here and also the picture on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>She says you always have to use a top coat.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for my daughter since she is in love with neon</li>
            <li>Color really stands out and looks great with strappy sandals.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>

            <li>Get so many compliments on this color</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Plus it dries nicely and gives a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I always keep my toenails painted, especially in the summer, and this is a perfect summer color!  </li>
            <li>i love the color</li>
            <li>and i got more than what i was expecting.</li>
            <li>It seems to apply better</li>

            <li>In love :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>Sure, it chips easier</li>
            <li>but most neons do.</li>
            <li>I love China Glaze nail polish.  </li>

            <li>I got so many compliments on my nails (</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>this color always a spring and summer favorite for me</li>
            <li>It is a bit more of a neon orange to me.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>it looks better on yourself</li>
            <li>The package came in a timely manner, the color is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love this color it is poplular for the summer.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting it on my dogs toes :)  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more products from this company</li>
            <li>and they love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the color and the quality.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it for summer pedicures.</li>
            <li>I just love this color.</li>
            <li>After that, it chips very easily and can be picked off just as easy.</li>
            <li>It kind of dries matte, which I though was cool.</li>
            <li>have pretty good pictures to show the difference, hopefully they will appear on the page soon...</li>
            <li>but China Glaze is pretty good too.  </li>
            <li>China glaze is my fav brand of polish, it is pretty chip resistant and provides good coverage</li>
            <li>It was a much more peachy pink than I was expecting, but I&#x27;m very happy with it despite the fact. :)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t easily chip once covered with a top coat.</li>
            <li>I had to purchase another bottle because my friends loved it so much they took mine.</li>
            <li>Very orange, but a good color.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much I had to buy another; just in case China Glaze stopped making this color.</li>
            <li>It is super bright and fun.</li>
            <li>I thought from the picture this would be a darker pinkish orange color, but when I got it it&#x27;s more of a light orange which is just fine.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, a great polish!</li>
            <li>Just the other day someone came up to me and asked me what color nail polish my dog was wearing because she really liked the color!!!</li>
            <li>This color is so bright but worth it since it is a very unique pretty neon coral-pink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with this shade, it is so bright and vibrant, looks great even without a white bottom coat.</li>
            <li>It chips easily.  </li>
            <li>I would have easily paid twice, maybe even three times, the price of what the seller is asking.</li>
            <li>The nail polish shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>it chips SO easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so bright and vibrant</li>
            <li>it left me a beautiful shine... would not recomend flip flop fantasy.</li>
            <li>I get tons of compliments on this color &amp; its my new favorite! :)</li>
            <li>I put it on my toes and added some black and silver accents and am very happy with how it looks.</li>
            <li>I did apply lots of top coat to make it super shiny which is a must.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and you will FALL IN LOVE with this.</li>
            <li>i just love this nail polish , it does not chip for a couple days , and it stays pretty even threw dish washing !</li>
            <li>wife liked the color a lot, thanks</li>
            <li>Great color, I normally only buy OPI brand</li>
            <li>I love the neon pink/coral color of this polish, even though I bought it when fall is right around the corner.</li>
            <li>So pretty!!</li>
            <li>Pretty Color!!</li>
            <li>and when you put it on without a clear top coat, it chips very easily.</li>
            <li>and it dries super fast which i love!</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s lot more orange than it looks in the picture, to get an accurate idea of its shade, google flip flop fantasy china glaze and click on images, it&#x27;s the lightest/orangest picture you can find.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this specific one on my toes yet, but another China Glaze product (Bright Lights, which is a darker pink-coral) chips really easily.  </li>
            <li>This color really accents it nicely and makes me feel super girly.</li>
            <li>so I got excited.</li>
            <li>I am still pretty pleased because I&#x27;m a nail polish fiend</li>
            <li>I find myself reaching for it more and more frequently!</li>
            <li>The color is more of a bright orange than a pink.</li>
            <li>Loving this color, I like to add a white coat under just for better quality.</li>
            <li>I love the way the pink pops on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>It is such a beautiful neon coral and really makes a tan pop!</li>
            <li>so i would recommend using a clear coating on top of it!</li>
            <li>This is not a bad thing because it&#x27;s a unique shade of neon orange</li>
            <li>you will want a top coat the color is spectacular but not matte at all have run into a few polishes of this vibrancy that dont come out shiny like most polishes</li>
            <li>Lots of compliments on the color even though my boyfriend finds it too bright, I feel there is no such thing.</li>
            <li>so i war it very often and mmy clients love it too,</li>
            <li>Cool color, doesn&#x27;t chip  bd...</li>
            <li>BUT I love the color so much I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather neon in fact, BUT, I am still happy with the color because it&#x27;s a gorgeous orange with just enough coral in it (not much).</li>
            <li>The quality isn&#x27;t good the polish was chipping the next day.</li>
            <li>This color looked promising, but when I put it on it looks mostly orange.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a gorgeous color and as summertime is rolling around</li>
            <li>purchased a real china glaze at a beauty supply store and it&#x27;s more pinky which is true flip flop fantasy.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and didnt chip till the next day (which is really good for me because my hands are hardworking)</li>
            <li>The color is a pretty color but it chips easily and the chip pieces were everywhere from in my food to in my shower to on my floor.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a bright orange color and is flat (not shiny).</li>
            <li>I love the color, but it chips way too much,  too easily, and way too fast.</li>
            <li>Came in a quick time period too.</li>
            <li>This product is beyond extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I would have been ok with the color not looking like the bottle if it didn&#x27;t take 5 coats to make it look decent.</li>
            <li>you need to work quickly.</li>
            <li>The product came as described and it shipped out quick.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend purchasing a high shine topcoat to top off this polish</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous, but you need multiple coats to get it to the right color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After i used it for a couple of time i can tell you that you should paint your nail very fast!</li>
            <li>I decided to overlook this and try it out anyway since i love the color so much - with the first stroke</li>
            <li>the color is not like it seems, is much brighter and really strong, didt like it. . . . .</li>
            <li>I use this color more than any other color that I own, I&#x27;m even wearing it with Essie&#x27;s Penny Talk right now.</li>
            <li>Needs a top clear coat, but that&#x27;s always the case with nail polish if you want a super shiny finish that lasts.</li>
            <li>overall shipping was fast, i loved the color, and it didnt chip off quickly.</li>
            <li>amazing especially for the price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an eye catcher, everyone loves it and the formula is just so amazing to work with.</li>
            <li>If you like a neon nail polish I would buy this bright pink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like neon pink mixed with peach to create a perfect color for summer.</li>
            <li>Attempted to contact seller without success.  </li>
            <li>and they were kind enough to ship me another one.</li>
            <li>Its a pretty color, but its not opaque enough and chips easily, also it requires way too many coats.</li>
            <li>they look streaky if not done right.</li>
            <li>After a day it turns bright hot neon pink.</li>
            <li>You def need to put a clear top coat over it because it&#x27;s really matte when you first put it on, but the clear top coat def makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I liked this color so much that I accidently bought a second bottle after forgetting that I already had one at home!  </li>
            <li>The color is so vibrant!!</li>
            <li>The polish dries very fast because it is MATT.</li>
            <li>The problem of it being matte is easily overcome with one coat of clear polish, or can be left matte for a more alternative/youthful look.</li>
            <li>but it was still a pretty color.</li>
            <li>Since I love the color and get constant compliments about it, I will continue to use it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color,</li>
            <li>its so pretty and just feels like summer.</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li>It is a pretty color when you need that pop of color to wear.</li>
            <li>THIS COLOR IS PRETTY</li>
            <li>&quot; and sure enough, the both China Glaze colors (both are matte) get shiny after the topcoat goes on.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s such a cute summer color.  </li>
            <li>so try it out on your toes first before your hands.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who wants a fun color.</li>
            <li>and I think it is so pretty.</li>
            <li>At first I did not get it even though it said it was delivered.</li>
            <li>This is m first china glaze polish.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll most likely wear it to a summer party or something.</li>
            <li>I overall love this polish.</li>
            <li>Didnt think it was what I wanted at first.</li>
            <li>The color looks pretty when I applied it, though it takes up to three coats to get the look I wanted.</li>
            <li>this is my first china glaze nail polish</li>
            <li>This is an amazing shade of Pink!</li>
            <li>All their colors are fun and vibrant.</li>
            <li>It dries very hard, and very quickly, which is good, and has a slightly matte finish that is fixed easily with a top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is much more neon and light coral like than in the photo I currently see posted on here, I recently purchased this from sallys</li>
            <li>Only thing is that it chips too easy.</li>
            <li>Like most neon nail polishes it does dry matte so if you want a shiny finish, topcoat is a must.</li>
            <li>really fast!I think this nail polish is matte though,because it doesnt dry shiny,but that can be fixed with a quick top coat.</li>
            <li>Goes on badly but dries quickly and has an excellent end result.</li>
            <li>but once i received it, it was a little more orangey than i wanted it to be, its still a fun color</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves the Flip Flop Fantasy nail polish by China Glaze.</li>
            <li>The nail polish I got was not As pink as flip flop fantasy by China Glaze, it was more orangey.</li>
            <li>stays on for a whole week.</li>
            <li>I could tell it wasn&#x27;t real china glaze.</li>
            <li>dries fast ...</li>
            <li>I really like the color.  </li>
            <li>It dries really fast.</li>
            <li>It also dries fast.</li>
            <li>recommend the whole line.</li>
            <li>The seller sold the nail polish fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommed it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a real China glaze product.</li>
            <li>It is very streaky.</li>
            <li>For a nail polish lover, like myself, this polish really did the trick to brighten up my nail color choices in fall/winter months.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay on very well either.  </li>
            <li>but it kinda looks like peachy keen but more pink then peach&lt;</li>
            <li>It goes on very streaky and had no shine at all.</li>
            <li>The color is so much bolder and brighter than what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li>I love this color pink.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more orange toned than pink</li>
            <li>I was hoping it was going to be more pink when I ordered it, but</li>
            <li>Depending on how fast you apply it, you will need 1-2 coats for even coverage.</li>
            <li>but in person it looks more pink.  </li>
            <li>Shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m ready for summer.</li>
            <li>I only applied 2 coats to get a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I really like this nail polish, but I purchased it because my friend had this color</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad to have any color, but I gave 4 stars because it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected.</li>
            <li>The polish is opaque in two coats, the color pay-off is excellent, coming across in some lights as an orange-y-peach color and in others as a neon pink, and this polish, overall, was completely worth such a low price!</li>
            <li>This product came on time and was exactly the color it looks like in the picture and the bottle was brand new &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>The Flip Flop Fantasy I received was more orange, less pink, and more matte than the one you buy in store.</li>
            <li>Almost looks likes they glow in the dark, they light up when the sun sets!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s both pink and orange at the same time with kind of a neon quality.</li>
            <li>So, then I checked the colors myself and sure enough the bottle at Sally&#x27;s resembled the same color I got from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I have to use 3 coats to get adequate coverage.</li>
            <li>However, it may need some extra coats for it to be opaque, but overall I love it.</li>
            <li>but it might even be a little BETTER (</li>
            <li>The only thing i dont love about it is that it is very flat.</li>
            <li>Only 1 or 2 thin coats will result in a more orangy color, 2-3 thicker coats will make it look more coral.  </li>
            <li>but no matter how many coats I put on of it, it still has streaks and spreads unevenly.</li>
            <li>The first layer is very funky and streaky, and the second doesn&#x27;t reach perfection.</li>
            <li>I only paid about $4 for it, so it was worth adding to my China Glaze collection.</li>
            <li>The consistency is good but is a bit thin when you apply it to your nails.</li>
            <li>I did find that it was a little bit tricky to apply because it is more of a matte polish than most usual polishes.</li>
            <li>Their colors are always my first choice because by the time you finished the first coat and go to start the second, the first coat is already dry</li>
            <li>I always keep a new bottle on hand and buy for friends.  </li>
            <li>It went on very streaky and I needed at least three coats to try to even it out, and some nails required more.</li>
            <li>I shook it up really good, I used a base &amp; top coat.</li>
            <li>I ordered this color after getting a stellar pedicure at my local nail salon.</li>
            <li>When i first unscrewed the bottle i noticed drip stains around the rim and sides which only lets me assume that this bottle has already been used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased 2 different bottles from 2 different vendors and both are identical colors - the final color result will depend on how many coats you apply.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure China Glaze is one of the better polishes on my nails.  </li>
            <li>So first, I gave this only 2 or 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a coral color leaning towards orange and not pink.</li>
            <li>Try putting it over a white coat first.</li>
            <li>It even looks really funny when you first put it on because it looks like it&#x27;s glow in the dark.  </li>
            <li>what else can I say this pink is very pretty</li>
            <li>Looks a little coralish outside but really more orange.  </li>
            <li>was also surprised to see that without a topcoat, it had a matte finish.</li>
            <li>I just received this polish now, I was a but surprised on how orange</li>
            <li>It takes multiple thin coats to get good coverage on the nail.</li>
            <li>I had to put 3 thick coats for it to start looking ok .</li>
            <li>The color is exactly what I expected and it was a new bottle.</li>
            <li>My only vice with this product in particular was that it was sent to me goopy.</li>
            <li>Usually China glaze covers really well, but this particular polish didn&#x27;t cover that much.</li>
            <li>In some of the pictures of the bottle, it looks  pretty pink, but it is not.</li>
            <li>This nail polish was exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li>.... does not seem to be new , the color is not similiar at teh actual flip flop fantasy fro china glaze..</li>
            <li>rather its more towards orange (not pleasant orange) color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not much for wearing anything with so much brightness</li>
            <li>However when you apply it, it is a little thick you have to lay it right to get it to look smooth.</li>
            <li>She says that color appears to be a little different from her original one that she bought locally though.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use a base coat and top coat, however, it will chip easily.</li>
            <li>The color is FANTASTIC although after a few uses it got a little goopy...</li>

            <li> I love the formulation as well!</li>
            <li> The color was great, but it seems to chip off easily.</li>
            <li> The shipping was INCREDIBLY FAST!!!!!</li>
            <li> It looks amazing on toes or fingers, and like all china glaze polishes stays on for along time.</li>
            <li> Love the bright neon coral color of Flip Flop Fantasy.</li>
            <li> I have been looking all over for a nice coral color.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, it&#x27;s very neon and bright and perfect for the summer in Florida.</li>
            <li> I own over 70 bottles.</li>
            <li> Gold sparkles give it a nice look also.</li>
            <li> Super beautiful.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend both. :D</li>
            <li> it is my absolute favorite color and looks good with a tan!!</li>
            <li> I bought this polish and it chips very easily</li>
            <li> it chips very very very easily..</li>
            <li> Love this color bright and pretty definitely a good color for the collection if you love bright toes or fingers</li>
            <li> However, the color is still incredibly flattering, sexy, cute, and makes you look super tan.</li>
            <li> Other than that this is a great color and great buy just hope for a non-goopy product!</li>
            <li> and I matched up another China Glaze color that I liked more to go with the coral color</li>
            <li> This one I did get and love the color and the bling toe separator to go with it which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Most of the china glaze neon colors are amazing, but this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it dries to a matte finish, but put a glossy top coat on and it looks awesome if you&#x27;re not a fan of matte.</li>
            <li> I need that kind of color for the summer, for sure will order some more of it in future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a neon pastel orange, goes great with the hot melon color this Spring/Summer.</li>
            <li> this is such a beautiful neon color, I highly recomended, great for summer and great in combination with othe colors.</li>
            <li> It is very light.  </li>
            <li> I have never owned a china glaze nail polish before,so i decided to give it a try!This is a beautiful neon coral pink color and is GREAT if you are on the go because it dries</li>
            <li> A super bright orange.  </li>
            <li> Bright and pretty summer color on nails!</li>
            <li> and I also thought it&#x27;d be more of a coral color,</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more of a neon orange.</li>
            <li> Overall AWESOME product!</li>
            <li> From the swatches of this polish that I had seen, i fell in love</li>
            <li> I love the color.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> i love this neon coral shade.</li>
            <li> but i love the color!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even with a top coat, it chipped off within days.</li>
            <li> this nail polish is perfect especially because its a neon color.</li>
            <li> but i love the color</li>
            <li> I LOVE china glaze nail polishes</li>
            <li> I  love the color</li>
            <li> Love the neon color.</li>
            <li> The color paints more orange, but it look like the bottle (in my opinion), after hours of being wore.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li> I love this color.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I thought it was, but still love it.</li>
            <li> I Love the color.</li>
            <li> It is also matte so a shiny top coat is a must.</li>
            <li> I fix this by using a glossy top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But using a top coat fixes that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting more of a coral/pinkish color based on what some of the reviewer said on here and also the picture on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> She says you always have to use a top coat.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter since she is in love with neon</li>
            <li> Color really stands out and looks great with strappy sandals.</li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color for my toe nails in the summer..</li>
            <li> Get so many compliments on this color</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Plus it dries nicely and gives a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I always keep my toenails painted, especially in the summer, and this is a perfect summer color!  </li>
            <li> i love the color</li>
            <li> and i got more than what i was expecting.</li>
            <li> It seems to apply better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my most favorite nail polish color.</li>
            <li> In love :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color.</li>
            <li> Sure, it chips easier</li>
            <li> but most neons do.</li>
            <li> I love China Glaze nail polish.  </li>
            <li> and i thought it was a cute color....</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments on my nails (</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> this color always a spring and summer favorite for me</li>
            <li> It is a bit more of a neon orange to me.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> it looks better on yourself</li>
            <li> The package came in a timely manner, the color is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love this color it is poplular for the summer.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting it on my dogs toes :)  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more products from this company</li>
            <li> and they love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the color and the quality.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it for summer pedicures.</li>
            <li> I just love this color.</li>
            <li> After that, it chips very easily and can be picked off just as easy.</li>
            <li> It kind of dries matte, which I though was cool.</li>
            <li> have pretty good pictures to show the difference, hopefully they will appear on the page soon...</li>
            <li> but China Glaze is pretty good too.  </li>
            <li> China glaze is my fav brand of polish, it is pretty chip resistant and provides good coverage</li>
            <li> It was a much more peachy pink than I was expecting, but I&#x27;m very happy with it despite the fact. :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t easily chip once covered with a top coat.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase another bottle because my friends loved it so much they took mine.</li>
            <li> Very orange, but a good color.</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much I had to buy another; just in case China Glaze stopped making this color.</li>
            <li> It is super bright and fun.</li>
            <li> I thought from the picture this would be a darker pinkish orange color, but when I got it it&#x27;s more of a light orange which is just fine.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, a great polish!</li>
            <li> Just the other day someone came up to me and asked me what color nail polish my dog was wearing because she really liked the color!!!</li>
            <li> This color is so bright but worth it since it is a very unique pretty neon coral-pink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this shade, it is so bright and vibrant, looks great even without a white bottom coat.</li>
            <li> It chips easily.  </li>
            <li> I would have easily paid twice, maybe even three times, the price of what the seller is asking.</li>
            <li> The nail polish shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> it chips SO easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bright and vibrant</li>
            <li> it left me a beautiful shine... would not recomend flip flop fantasy.</li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments on this color &amp; its my new favorite! :)</li>
            <li> I put it on my toes and added some black and silver accents and am very happy with how it looks.</li>
            <li> I did apply lots of top coat to make it super shiny which is a must.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and you will FALL IN LOVE with this.</li>
            <li> i just love this nail polish , it does not chip for a couple days , and it stays pretty even threw dish washing !</li>
            <li> wife liked the color a lot, thanks</li>
            <li> Great color, I normally only buy OPI brand</li>
            <li> I love the neon pink/coral color of this polish, even though I bought it when fall is right around the corner.</li>
            <li> So pretty!!</li>
            <li> Pretty Color!!</li>
            <li> and when you put it on without a clear top coat, it chips very easily.</li>
            <li> and it dries super fast which i love!</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s lot more orange than it looks in the picture, to get an accurate idea of its shade, google flip flop fantasy china glaze and click on images, it&#x27;s the lightest/orangest picture you can find.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this specific one on my toes yet, but another China Glaze product (Bright Lights, which is a darker pink-coral) chips really easily.  </li>
            <li> This color really accents it nicely and makes me feel super girly.</li>
            <li> so I got excited.</li>
            <li> I am still pretty pleased because I&#x27;m a nail polish fiend</li>
            <li> I find myself reaching for it more and more frequently!</li>
            <li> The color is more of a bright orange than a pink.</li>
            <li> Loving this color, I like to add a white coat under just for better quality.</li>
            <li> I love the way the pink pops on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> It is such a beautiful neon coral and really makes a tan pop!</li>
            <li> so i would recommend using a clear coating on top of it!</li>
            <li> This is not a bad thing because it&#x27;s a unique shade of neon orange</li>
            <li> you will want a top coat the color is spectacular but not matte at all have run into a few polishes of this vibrancy that dont come out shiny like most polishes</li>
            <li> Lots of compliments on the color even though my boyfriend finds it too bright, I feel there is no such thing.</li>
            <li> so i war it very often and mmy clients love it too,</li>
            <li> Cool color, doesn&#x27;t chip  bd...</li>
            <li> BUT I love the color so much I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather neon in fact, BUT, I am still happy with the color because it&#x27;s a gorgeous orange with just enough coral in it (not much).</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t good the polish was chipping the next day.</li>
            <li> This color looked promising, but when I put it on it looks mostly orange.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a gorgeous color and as summertime is rolling around</li>
            <li> purchased a real china glaze at a beauty supply store and it&#x27;s more pinky which is true flip flop fantasy.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and didnt chip till the next day (which is really good for me because my hands are hardworking)</li>
            <li> The color is a pretty color but it chips easily and the chip pieces were everywhere from in my food to in my shower to on my floor.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a bright orange color and is flat (not shiny).</li>
            <li> I love the color, but it chips way too much,  too easily, and way too fast.</li>
            <li> Came in a quick time period too.</li>
            <li> This product is beyond extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I would have been ok with the color not looking like the bottle if it didn&#x27;t take 5 coats to make it look decent.</li>
            <li> you need to work quickly.</li>
            <li> The product came as described and it shipped out quick.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend purchasing a high shine topcoat to top off this polish</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous, but you need multiple coats to get it to the right color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After i used it for a couple of time i can tell you that you should paint your nail very fast!</li>
            <li> I decided to overlook this and try it out anyway since i love the color so much - with the first stroke</li>
            <li> the color is not like it seems, is much brighter and really strong, didt like it. . . . .</li>
            <li> I use this color more than any other color that I own, I&#x27;m even wearing it with Essie&#x27;s Penny Talk right now.</li>
            <li> Needs a top clear coat, but that&#x27;s always the case with nail polish if you want a super shiny finish that lasts.</li>
            <li> overall shipping was fast, i loved the color, and it didnt chip off quickly.</li>
            <li> amazing especially for the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an eye catcher, everyone loves it and the formula is just so amazing to work with.</li>
            <li> If you like a neon nail polish I would buy this bright pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like neon pink mixed with peach to create a perfect color for summer.</li>
            <li> Attempted to contact seller without success.  </li>
            <li> and they were kind enough to ship me another one.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty color, but its not opaque enough and chips easily, also it requires way too many coats.</li>
            <li> they look streaky if not done right.</li>
            <li> After a day it turns bright hot neon pink.</li>
            <li> You def need to put a clear top coat over it because it&#x27;s really matte when you first put it on, but the clear top coat def makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I liked this color so much that I accidently bought a second bottle after forgetting that I already had one at home!  </li>
            <li> The color is so vibrant!!</li>
            <li> The polish dries very fast because it is MATT.</li>
            <li> The problem of it being matte is easily overcome with one coat of clear polish, or can be left matte for a more alternative/youthful look.</li>
            <li> but it was still a pretty color.</li>
            <li> Since I love the color and get constant compliments about it, I will continue to use it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color,</li>
            <li> its so pretty and just feels like summer.</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li> It is a pretty color when you need that pop of color to wear.</li>
            <li> THIS COLOR IS PRETTY</li>
            <li> &quot; and sure enough, the both China Glaze colors (both are matte) get shiny after the topcoat goes on.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s such a cute summer color.  </li>
            <li> so try it out on your toes first before your hands.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who wants a fun color.</li>
            <li> and I think it is so pretty.</li>
            <li> At first I did not get it even though it said it was delivered.</li>
            <li> This is m first china glaze polish.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll most likely wear it to a summer party or something.</li>
            <li> I overall love this polish.</li>
            <li> Didnt think it was what I wanted at first.</li>
            <li> The color looks pretty when I applied it, though it takes up to three coats to get the look I wanted.</li>
            <li> this is my first china glaze nail polish</li>
            <li> This is an amazing shade of Pink!</li>
            <li> All their colors are fun and vibrant.</li>
            <li> It dries very hard, and very quickly, which is good, and has a slightly matte finish that is fixed easily with a top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is much more neon and light coral like than in the photo I currently see posted on here, I recently purchased this from sallys</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it chips too easy.</li>
            <li> Like most neon nail polishes it does dry matte so if you want a shiny finish, topcoat is a must.</li>
            <li> really fast!I think this nail polish is matte though,because it doesnt dry shiny,but that can be fixed with a quick top coat.</li>
            <li> Goes on badly but dries quickly and has an excellent end result.</li>
            <li> but once i received it, it was a little more orangey than i wanted it to be, its still a fun color</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves the Flip Flop Fantasy nail polish by China Glaze.</li>
            <li> The nail polish I got was not As pink as flip flop fantasy by China Glaze, it was more orangey.</li>
            <li> stays on for a whole week.</li>
            <li> I could tell it wasn&#x27;t real china glaze.</li>
            <li> dries fast ...</li>
            <li> I really like the color.  </li>
            <li> It dries really fast.</li>
            <li> It also dries fast.</li>
            <li> recommend the whole line.</li>
            <li> The seller sold the nail polish fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommed it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a real China glaze product.</li>
            <li> It is very streaky.</li>
            <li> For a nail polish lover, like myself, this polish really did the trick to brighten up my nail color choices in fall/winter months.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on very well either.  </li>
            <li> but it kinda looks like peachy keen but more pink then peach&lt;</li>
            <li> It goes on very streaky and had no shine at all.</li>
            <li> The color is so much bolder and brighter than what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li> I love this color pink.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more orange toned than pink</li>
            <li> I was hoping it was going to be more pink when I ordered it, but</li>
            <li> Depending on how fast you apply it, you will need 1-2 coats for even coverage.</li>
            <li> but in person it looks more pink.  </li>
            <li> Shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m ready for summer.</li>
            <li> I only applied 2 coats to get a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish, but I purchased it because my friend had this color</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad to have any color, but I gave 4 stars because it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> The polish is opaque in two coats, the color pay-off is excellent, coming across in some lights as an orange-y-peach color and in others as a neon pink, and this polish, overall, was completely worth such a low price!</li>
            <li> This product came on time and was exactly the color it looks like in the picture and the bottle was brand new &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> The Flip Flop Fantasy I received was more orange, less pink, and more matte than the one you buy in store.</li>
            <li> Almost looks likes they glow in the dark, they light up when the sun sets!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s both pink and orange at the same time with kind of a neon quality.</li>
            <li> So, then I checked the colors myself and sure enough the bottle at Sally&#x27;s resembled the same color I got from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I have to use 3 coats to get adequate coverage.</li>
            <li> However, it may need some extra coats for it to be opaque, but overall I love it.</li>
            <li> but it might even be a little BETTER (</li>
            <li> The only thing i dont love about it is that it is very flat.</li>
            <li> Only 1 or 2 thin coats will result in a more orangy color, 2-3 thicker coats will make it look more coral.  </li>
            <li> but no matter how many coats I put on of it, it still has streaks and spreads unevenly.</li>
            <li> The first layer is very funky and streaky, and the second doesn&#x27;t reach perfection.</li>
            <li> I only paid about $4 for it, so it was worth adding to my China Glaze collection.</li>
            <li> The consistency is good but is a bit thin when you apply it to your nails.</li>
            <li> I did find that it was a little bit tricky to apply because it is more of a matte polish than most usual polishes.</li>
            <li> Their colors are always my first choice because by the time you finished the first coat and go to start the second, the first coat is already dry</li>
            <li> I always keep a new bottle on hand and buy for friends.  </li>
            <li> It went on very streaky and I needed at least three coats to try to even it out, and some nails required more.</li>
            <li> I shook it up really good, I used a base &amp; top coat.</li>
            <li> I ordered this color after getting a stellar pedicure at my local nail salon.</li>
            <li> When i first unscrewed the bottle i noticed drip stains around the rim and sides which only lets me assume that this bottle has already been used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 2 different bottles from 2 different vendors and both are identical colors - the final color result will depend on how many coats you apply.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure China Glaze is one of the better polishes on my nails.  </li>
            <li> So first, I gave this only 2 or 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a coral color leaning towards orange and not pink.</li>
            <li> Try putting it over a white coat first.</li>
            <li> It even looks really funny when you first put it on because it looks like it&#x27;s glow in the dark.  </li>
            <li> what else can I say this pink is very pretty</li>
            <li> Looks a little coralish outside but really more orange.  </li>
            <li> was also surprised to see that without a topcoat, it had a matte finish.</li>
            <li> I just received this polish now, I was a but surprised on how orange</li>
            <li> It takes multiple thin coats to get good coverage on the nail.</li>
            <li> I had to put 3 thick coats for it to start looking ok .</li>
            <li> The color is exactly what I expected and it was a new bottle.</li>
            <li> My only vice with this product in particular was that it was sent to me goopy.</li>
            <li> Usually China glaze covers really well, but this particular polish didn&#x27;t cover that much.</li>
            <li> In some of the pictures of the bottle, it looks  pretty pink, but it is not.</li>
            <li> This nail polish was exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> .... does not seem to be new , the color is not similiar at teh actual flip flop fantasy fro china glaze..</li>
            <li> rather its more towards orange (not pleasant orange) color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much for wearing anything with so much brightness</li>
            <li> However when you apply it, it is a little thick you have to lay it right to get it to look smooth.</li>
            <li> She says that color appears to be a little different from her original one that she bought locally though.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use a base coat and top coat, however, it will chip easily.</li>
            <li> The color is FANTASTIC although after a few uses it got a little goopy...</li>
            <li> I really believe that the polish I received is not authentic.  </li>
            <li> I have never had such issues with any other polish that I got offline or with the brand china glaze in general.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know this color was like flat paint</li>
            <li> The color is indeed the same as in the salon, but this clearly is not china glaze enamel.</li>
            <li> Super thin and watery.</li>
            <li> The polish was streaky and was definitely not the same quality as my other china glaze nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Difficult to put on a smooth coat....</li>
            <li> but it definitely wasn&#x27;t what i expected.</li>
            <li> I will wear this polish all summer long.</li>
            <li> This China Glaze Nail Polish has a different consistency than any other polish I have ever used.</li>
            <li> and I find it applies better to natural nails without a base coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty thin polish, but I find that I prefer thinner.</li>
            <li> However I was deeply let down.</li>
            <li> I wore it for a week and a half before it began to chip and only did so because I was doing a lot outdoors.</li>
            <li> The few times I didn&#x27;t apply a topcoat, my tips were already chipping by the next day, both in big chips and in little ones that I find everywhere.  </li>
            <li> In darker lighting, it does look pink though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it looked instead of coral pink.</li>
            <li> It shipped faster than expected, too.</li>
            <li> Whatever, so I put it on anyway thinking that it would just be a corally pink.</li>
            <li> This is like a pastel neon pink.  </li>
            <li> This is a neon type pink.</li>
            <li> Not sure why yours was different from the one I have</li>
            <li> the color is not pretty as looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> Unlike other polishes, the nail polishy odor goes away within an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> unlike my other purchse of for audrey by china glaze</li>
            <li> Just like any other polish would.</li>
            <li> Hoping to receive a bright color for summer but instead this applied horribly.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to use base and a topcoat because it dries matte.</li>
            <li> With the base &amp; top coat, it lasted about a week before it chipped.</li>
            <li> It is an extremely matte polish!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this nail polish so bad , that even after my 2 first bad experiences I tried it on again.</li>
            <li> I love the color, especially for summer, but the formula is terrible.</li>
            <li> Even with Seche Vite topcoat, it was chipped in less than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a little brighter/neon  and opaque)...</li>
            <li> the polish had no shine whatsoever...looked as though it was dried up...</li>
            <li> If you are even slightly considering this nail polish, just do it!</li>
            <li> This is a pale pink-coral.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what is wrong with it since the other nail polish I ordered that is the same brand is nothing like this...</li>
            <li> It covers well and stays on with little wear at the end of a week!</li>
            <li> I usually put 2-3 coats with a topcoat and it lasts maybe about 3-4 days without chipping.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, its very chalky, so it requires several coats before you acheive a solid color, and it chips terribly!  </li>
            <li> Sorry, but it was the wrong type of polish - chalky neon instead of the soft coral I was looking for!</li>
            <li> so it looks dull.</li>
            <li> so I had to apply at least a few thin coats.</li>
            <li> It takes at least three coats to come out not streaky and then chips like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li> One thick coat is all you need.  </li>
            <li> As for the formula, it is a little bit thick and therefor can be difficult to apply so</li>
            <li> Seriously everyone should buy this</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and my skin is very pale!</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t mind a very thick, one coat application.  </li>
            <li> But oh my gosh this polish has the worse texture.</li>
            <li> You need to apply in thin even strokes because I have noticed with all of china glaze nail polish</li>
            <li> Someone said they were blinded by them (a bit dramatic but you get the point).</li>
            <li> not what i expected and the application was very poor and the end results of it drying were ugly...</li>
            <li> Little disappointed cause</li>
            <li> this is a fake china glaze polish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t not buy this polish expecting china glaze, instead you will get a fake.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, you can never go wrong with a nail polish by China Glaze.  </li>
            <li> It was very disappointing and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> It was very difficult to put on and was clumped up on the brush.</li>
            <li> BUT IT STRIKES REALLY BAD , SO YOU HAVE TO PUT 3 COATS ON.  </li>
            <li> but I was really disappointed by the consistency of the nail polish</li>
            <li> Just very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> i hate that about it</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t use base coat</li>
            <li> So I was very disappointed and was thinking of returning this because some reviewers acted as though the orange was a problem because of what this color looked like when they got their nails done at a nail salon.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this color.</li>
            <li> Now, on to the application: it was horrible.</li>
            <li> This polish is horrible!!!</li>
            <li> Obsessed!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The color is much more neon and light coral like than in the photo I currently see posted on here, I recently purchased this from sallys it truly is as good as color as it is hyped up to be, gorgeous</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves the Flip Flop Fantasy nail polish by China Glaze. She says that color appears to be a little different from her original one that she bought locally though.</li>
            <li> The nail polish I got was not As pink as flip flop fantasy by China Glaze, it was more orangey. Not sure why yours was different from the one I have but it was still a pretty color.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know this color was like flat paint and I also thought it&#x27;d be more of a coral color, but it&#x27;s more of a neon orange.</li>
            <li> I liked this color so much that I accidently bought a second bottle after forgetting that I already had one at home!  Unfortunately, its very chalky, so it requires several coats before you acheive a solid color, and it chips terribly!  The few times I didn&#x27;t apply a topcoat, my tips were already chipping by the next day, both in big chips and in little ones that I find everywhere.  Since I love the color and get constant compliments about it, I will continue to use it...but with a LOT of topcoat!</li>
            <li> I have never owned a china glaze nail polish before,so i decided to give it a try!This is a beautiful neon coral pink color and is GREAT if you are on the go because it dries really fast!I think this nail polish is matte though,because it doesnt dry shiny,but that can be fixed with a quick top coat.Overall AWESOME product!</li>
            <li> From the swatches of this polish that I had seen, i fell in love but once i received it, it was a little more orangey than i wanted it to be, its still a fun color but it definitely wasn&#x27;t what i expected.</li>
            <li> This China Glaze Nail Polish has a different consistency than any other polish I have ever used. I love the color. It&#x27;s both pink and orange at the same time with kind of a neon quality. I did find that it was a little bit tricky to apply because it is more of a matte polish than most usual polishes. But, the end result is gorgeous ... perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> This color is AWESOME!! It covers well and stays on with little wear at the end of a week! I will definitely purchase China Glaze again in the future</li>
            <li> This color looks nothing like the color online.  It is very light.  It&#x27;s a pretty color, just not what I thought it was</li>
            <li> awesome color. stays on for a whole week. can wear it with pinks or oranges. got lots of compliments on the color</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color EVER! I get so many compliments. I had to purchase another bottle because my friends loved it so much they took mine.</li>
            <li> Great color! Always receive a ton of compliments every time I wear it. Bright and pretty summer color on nails!</li>
            <li> i love this neon coral shade. its so pretty and just feels like summer. i had to add it permanently to my collection</li>
            <li> Sorry, but it was the wrong type of polish - chalky neon instead of the soft coral I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I ordered this color after getting a stellar pedicure at my local nail salon. The color is indeed the same as in the salon, but this clearly is not china glaze enamel. When i first unscrewed the bottle i noticed drip stains around the rim and sides which only lets me assume that this bottle has already been used. I decided to overlook this and try it out anyway since i love the color so much - with the first stroke I could tell it wasn&#x27;t real china glaze. Super thin and watery. Streaky. chipped within 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my favorite color - very nice coral summer color that makes you look so tan!  I&#x27;ve purchased 2 different bottles from 2 different vendors and both are identical colors - the final color result will depend on how many coats you apply.  Only 1 or 2 thin coats will result in a more orangy color, 2-3 thicker coats will make it look more coral.  Needs a top clear coat, but that&#x27;s always the case with nail polish if you want a super shiny finish that lasts.</li>
            <li> Difficult to put on a smooth coat....dries fast ...so leaves streaks....but i love the color!&lt;br /&gt;even when you put on a second coat it leaves streaks</li>
            <li> This is a pale pink-coral.  I really like the color.  I haven&#x27;t used this specific one on my toes yet, but another China Glaze product (Bright Lights, which is a darker pink-coral) chips really easily.  I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just that one color -- or that one batch.  Even with a top coat, it chipped off within days.</li>
            <li> I love the neon pink/coral color of this polish, even though I bought it when fall is right around the corner. This color looks great on toes!</li>
            <li> The color is exactly what I expected and it was a new bottle. Love this color a lot! Thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li> The color is more of a bright orange than a pink. In darker lighting, it does look pink though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty thin polish, but I find that I prefer thinner. It dries really fast.</li>
            <li> .... does not seem to be new , the color is not similiar at teh actual flip flop fantasy fro china glaze..</li>
            <li> this nail polish is perfect especially because its a neon color. I knew it would be this way because my friends had it and  i didnt want to spend $8 on something when i could buy it online. amazing especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I love the color, especially for summer, but the formula is terrible. It went on very streaky and I needed at least three coats to try to even it out, and some nails required more. Even with Seche Vite topcoat, it was chipped in less than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also surprised to see that without a topcoat, it had a matte finish.</li>
            <li> this is a fake china glaze polish.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a real china glaze at a beauty supply store and it&#x27;s more pinky which is true flip flop fantasy. This polish is more orangey, the bottle is lighter and the stickers in the bottom are fake. Don&#x27;t not buy this polish expecting china glaze, instead you will get a fake.</li>
            <li> I bought this polish and it chips very easily i hate that about it but i love the color so i war it very often and mmy clients love it too,thats the only problem!!</li>
            <li> Great product..loved it alot&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 5 pieces and all of them were great and the package was perfect :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE china glaze nail polishes and I decided to purchase this color.  I really believe that the polish I received is not authentic.  The polish was streaky and was definitely not the same quality as my other china glaze nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I love the color, but it chips way too much,  too easily, and way too fast. The color is beautiful though.</li>
            <li> the wait for this product took way longer than the time it said it would. I  love the color but I was really disappointed by the consistency of the nail polish and it chipped the next day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorites. It&#x27;s like neon pink mixed with peach to create a perfect color for summer. It looks amazing on toes or fingers, and like all china glaze polishes stays on for along time. It also dries fast. Seriously everyone should buy this</li>
            <li> Loving this color, I like to add a white coat under just for better quality. great color for the summer</li>
            <li> Love the neon color. Almost looks likes they glow in the dark, they light up when the sun sets! Cool color, doesn&#x27;t chip  bd...</li>
            <li> recommend the whole line. It is super bright and fun. it almost glows off of the toes. Got a ton of compliments.</li>
            <li> Love the bright neon coral color of Flip Flop Fantasy. I was surprised that it dries to a matte finish, but put a glossy top coat on and it looks awesome if you&#x27;re not a fan of matte.</li>
            <li> I think that this nail polish lives up to its hype. It is a pretty color when you need that pop of color to wear. The seller sold the nail polish fast. The color paints more orange, but it look like the bottle (in my opinion), after hours of being wore.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is a great color but no matter how many coats I put on of it, it still has streaks and spreads unevenly. Not sure what is wrong with it since the other nail polish I ordered that is the same brand is nothing like this...I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish. The color is so vibrant!! Perfect for summer time. I have been looking all over for a nice coral color.</li>
            <li> I love this color. Wasn&#x27;t the color I thought it was, but still love it. Looks nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> I Love the color. Would totally buy again and reccomend to a friend. Came in a quick time period too.</li>
            <li> Its a great summer color. I get lots of compliments! I highly recommed it! Only thing is that it chips too easy.</li>
            <li> I just received this polish now, I was a but surprised on how orange it looked instead of coral pink. This is not a bad thing because it&#x27;s a unique shade of neon orange I like it! Be sure to use base and a topcoat because it dries matte. Other than that, a great polish!</li>
            <li> China Glaze Nail Polish Poolside FLIP FLOP FANTASY Lacquer 80946 .5 oz&lt;br /&gt;my wife liked the color a lot, thanks</li>
            <li> It takes multiple thin coats to get good coverage on the nail. It is also matte so a shiny top coat is a must. Would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a real China glaze product. It is very streaky. The color is gorgeous, but you need multiple coats to get it to the right color.</li>
            <li> The color is almost neon orange.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that could improve it would be a Glossier, Shiny finish when it dries.  I fix this by using a glossy top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments on the color all the time.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> THIS COLOR IS PRETTY BUT IT STRIKES REALLY BAD , SO YOU HAVE TO PUT 3 COATS ON.  I WOULD TRY THIS ONE AGAIN</li>
            <li> the color is not pretty as looks in the picture. rather its more towards orange (not pleasant orange) color. Would not recommend this</li>
            <li> The color is quite different from the picture but it might even be a little BETTER (a little brighter/neon  and opaque)... It shipped faster than expected, too. It kind of dries matte, which I though was cool. But using a top coat fixes that. It dries quickly and didnt chip till the next day (which is really good for me because my hands are hardworking)</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I wear this color of polish.  I always keep a new bottle on hand and buy for friends.  I&#x27;m not sure China Glaze is one of the better polishes on my nails.  It chips easily.  BUT I love the color so much I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  Changed to 5 stars and this is why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting more of a coral/pinkish color based on what some of the reviewer said on here and also the picture on Amazon.  So I was very disappointed and was thinking of returning this because some reviewers acted as though the orange was a problem because of what this color looked like when they got their nails done at a nail salon.  So first, I gave this only 2 or 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth of the product I received.  This is definitely a bright orange color and is flat (not shiny). It even looks really funny when you first put it on because it looks like it&#x27;s glow in the dark.  So before returning it, I went to Sally&#x27;s.  The girl there had it on.  It was orangish like mine but hers was shiny.  She says you always have to use a top coat.  This also prevents chipping.  Goes for ALL nail polish.  So, then I checked the colors myself and sure enough the bottle at Sally&#x27;s resembled the same color I got from Amazon.  Looks a little coralish outside but really more orange.  And this definitely looks orangish on.  So I have a coral colored pocket book and I matched up another China Glaze color that I liked more to go with the coral color I was looking for.  It&#x27;s called \\&quot;POOL PARTY\\&quot;.  I also got a topcoat called \\&quot;Out the Door\\&quot; and sure enough, the both China Glaze colors (both are matte) get shiny after the topcoat goes on.  I like both colors but for now will use the \\&quot;Pool Party\\&quot; to match my pocket book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty good pictures to show the difference, hopefully they will appear on the page soon...I just posted them up.</li>
            <li> This product is beyond extraordinary. For a nail polish lover, like myself, this polish really did the trick to brighten up my nail color choices in fall/winter months. The polish is opaque in two coats, the color pay-off is excellent, coming across in some lights as an orange-y-peach color and in others as a neon pink, and this polish, overall, was completely worth such a low price! I would have easily paid twice, maybe even three times, the price of what the seller is asking. If you are even slightly considering this nail polish, just do it! You will NOT regret your purchase.</li>
            <li> The Flip Flop Fantasy I received was more orange, less pink, and more matte than the one you buy in store. However, the color is still incredibly flattering, sexy, cute, and makes you look super tan. The problem of it being matte is easily overcome with one coat of clear polish, or can be left matte for a more alternative/youthful look. It doesn&#x27;t easily chip once covered with a top coat. I wore it for a week and a half before it began to chip and only did so because I was doing a lot outdoors.</li>
            <li> Hoping to receive a bright color for summer but instead this applied horribly.  Went on in streaks as though item had a thinner added to it such as alcohol.  Attempted to contact seller without success.  Will not be buying from them again.</li>
            <li> Many nail polish fanatics love this color, but agree that it has a horrible formula. First, it&#x27;s lot more orange than it looks in the picture, to get an accurate idea of its shade, google flip flop fantasy china glaze and click on images, it&#x27;s the lightest/orangest picture you can find. It&#x27;s rather neon in fact, BUT, I am still happy with the color because it&#x27;s a gorgeous orange with just enough coral in it (not much). I put it on my toes and added some black and silver accents and am very happy with how it looks. Now, on to the application: it was horrible. The first layer is very funky and streaky, and the second doesn&#x27;t reach perfection. By the third coat it&#x27;s quite acceptable though, I added a fourth coat for my big toes so they&#x27;d look their best. It dries very hard, and very quickly, which is good, and has a slightly matte finish that is fixed easily with a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: Very orange, but a good color. Goes on badly but dries quickly and has an excellent end result.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter since she is in love with neon colors- and this product delivers! It&#x27;s gorgeous</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this nail polish so bad , that even after my 2 first bad experiences I tried it on again. I really love the color ! But oh my gosh this polish has the worse texture. Applying is a hassle . I had to put 3 thick coats for it to start looking ok . And it chipped off the very next day ! Argh... Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this polish after seeing it in my nail salon. I had already chosen another color to use that day, so I thought I would just order it online. It was on sale so I got excited. It chipped the next day after wearing it. It&#x27;s not a glossy finish so it looks dull.</li>
            <li> The color was great, but it seems to chip off easily. Great for toe nails. Color really stands out and looks great with strappy sandals.</li>
            <li> I love the color BUT it takes 3+ coats to just get the color to were you can&#x27;t see through it.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on very well either.  Little disappointed cause it&#x27;s such a cute summer color.  It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> This color is so bright but worth it since it is a very unique pretty neon coral-pink. I can see how this may be too bright for some people so try it out on your toes first before your hands. The formula was tricky to work with so I had to apply at least a few thin coats. I also didn&#x27;t use base coat and I find it applies better to natural nails without a base coat. I did apply lots of top coat to make it super shiny which is a must.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color for my toe nails in the summer.. You def need to put a clear top coat over it because it&#x27;s really matte when you first put it on, but the clear top coat def makes a difference. Get so many compliments on this color</li>
            <li> i will be ordering this nail polish every summer. it is my absolute favorite color and looks good with a tan!!</li>
            <li> i like this color but it kinda looks like peachy keen but more pink then peach&lt;br /&gt;still a very nice color .</li>
            <li> This polish is horrible!!! I would have been ok with the color not looking like the bottle if it didn&#x27;t take 5 coats to make it look decent. It goes on very streaky and had no shine at all. After only 1 day of shopping it began to chip. Purchase at you own risk, you have been warned!!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get this polish! The color is FANTASTIC although after a few uses it got a little goopy...overall shipping was fast, i loved the color, and it didnt chip off quickly. I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The nail polish shipped very quickly. The color is so much bolder and brighter than what you see in the picture. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this color! Its very bright and fun! I would recommend to anyone who wants a fun color. I love the way the pink pops on my fair skin. I am a redhead and my skin is very pale! This color really accents it nicely and makes me feel super girly. Plus it dries nicely and gives a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> People aren&#x27;t kidding when they say how stunning this shade is! It&#x27;s such an eye catcher, everyone loves it and the formula is just so amazing to work with.</li>
            <li> Coverage of the polish could be better, but the color is great. I love it. Usually China glaze covers really well, but this particular polish didn&#x27;t cover that much.</li>
            <li> I always keep my toenails painted, especially in the summer, and this is a perfect summer color!  It also goes on nicely and lasts!</li>
            <li> you will want a top coat the color is spectacular but not matte at all have run into a few polishes of this vibrancy that dont come out shiny like most polishes</li>
            <li> In my opinion, you can never go wrong with a nail polish by China Glaze.  Since I discovered them, I have not used another brand.  One thick coat is all you need.  Unlike other polishes, the nail polishy odor goes away within an hour or so.  And it doesn&#x27;t mind a very thick, one coat application.  All their colors are fun and vibrant.</li>
            <li> it was great!!! i love the color and i got more than what i was expecting. i will definitely but this product again</li>
            <li> This polish is so perfect for spring and summer! It&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I have to use 3 coats to get adequate coverage.</li>
            <li> The color is a pretty color but it chips easily and the chip pieces were everywhere from in my food to in my shower to on my floor. The quality isn&#x27;t good the polish was chipping the next day.</li>
            <li> I love this color pink.  I got a lot of compliments when I had it on.  I prefer OPI because of the applicator.  It seems to apply better but it is probably just my preference.  Otherwise the product is great!</li>
            <li> I love this shade of color! its excatly the color i was looking for! it goes well with any skin tone! it chips very very very easily.. so i would recommend using a clear coating on top of it! and it dries super fast which i love!</li>
            <li> Extremely bright; the photograph does not do it justice! If you don&#x27;t use a base coat and top coat, however, it will chip easily.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color! I bought one about a year ago and I loved it so much I had to buy another; just in case China Glaze stopped making this color. It&#x27;s BEAUTIFUL! It&#x27;s my most favorite nail polish color.</li>
            <li> This neon coral nail polish is perfect for summer! It&#x27;s more orange toned than pink but I still love it! However, it may need some extra coats for it to be opaque, but overall I love it. Oh!!!!!! I almost forgot! The shipping was INCREDIBLY FAST!!!!! Nail polish arrived in the mail just 3 days after ordering! In love :)</li>
            <li> The color is this beautiful bright coral. The only thing i dont love about it is that it is very flat. no shine at all. and when you put it on without a clear top coat, it chips very easily.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color. It is a gorgeous neon coral and I think it is so pretty. Sure, it chips easier but most neons do. This is going to be the perfect summer color!</li>
            <li> I love China Glaze nail polish.  It&#x27;s all I buy.  This color looked promising, but when I put it on it looks mostly orange.  A super bright orange.  I was hoping it was going to be more pink when I ordered it, but no.  It also needed four coats before it looks good and it chips SO easily.  Very disappointed in this color.</li>
            <li> At first I did not get it even though it said it was delivered. I let them know and they were kind enough to ship me another one. This one I did get and love the color and the bling toe separator to go with it which was a nice surprise. Good customer service. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color! Most of the china glaze neon colors are amazing, but this is one of my favorites. In some of the pictures of the bottle, it looks  pretty pink, but it is not. It&#x27;s really a coral color leaning towards orange and not pink. I&#x27;ve attached a picture for reference (in my nail design it&#x27;s the triangle shaped part of course). As for the formula, it is a little bit thick and therefor can be difficult to apply so you need to work quickly. It dries to a matte finish, but I always use the Seche Vite topcoat to give a glossy finish. Depending on how fast you apply it, you will need 1-2 coats for even coverage. Overall, this is one of my go-to colors!</li>
            <li> Its a pretty color, but its not opaque enough and chips easily, also it requires way too many coats. Try putting it over a white coat first.</li>
            <li> This is m first china glaze polish. I got because of the awesome sale. However I was deeply let down. The color online is not close to the actual color in the bottle. It takes at least three coats to come out not streaky and then chips like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I will never purchase china glaze and will stick with OPI</li>
            <li> i looked up the color of this nail polish before i bought it and i thought it was a cute color....until i got in the mail it was like a neon type peach color...not what i expected and the application was very poor and the end results of it drying were ugly...the polish had no shine whatsoever...looked as though it was dried up...unlike my other purchse of for audrey by china glaze it left me a beautiful shine... would not recomend flip flop fantasy.</li>
            <li> I wanted a coral nail polish and this polish looks like a coral in the photo but in person it looks more pink.  Whatever, so I put it on anyway thinking that it would just be a corally pink. No. After a day it turns bright hot neon pink. I got so many compliments on my nails (comments I should say) about how bright and summery my nails were. Someone said they were blinded by them (a bit dramatic but you get the point). I wanted to wear this on my wedding day but I&#x27;ll most likely wear it to a summer party or something.</li>
            <li> This is like a pastel neon pink.  Super beautiful.  I would definitely buy another bottle of this polish in the future.</li>
            <li> I have 3. Bottles of this in this color. I always get compliments. It is a very bright color. You need to apply in thin even strokes because I have noticed with all of china glaze nail polish they look streaky if not done right. Their colors are always my first choice because by the time you finished the first coat and go to start the second, the first coat is already dry</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. If you like a neon nail polish I would buy this bright pink. So pretty!!</li>
            <li> I overall love this polish. The consistency is good but is a bit thin when you apply it to your nails. I usually put 2-3 coats with a topcoat and it lasts maybe about 3-4 days without chipping. After that, it chips very easily and can be picked off just as easy. I only paid about $4 for it, so it was worth adding to my China Glaze collection. It was a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Flip flop fantasy is omg awesome. I&#x27;m in love. Shipped really fast. Looks best on tan skin so I&#x27;m ready for summer. Neon at its best.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this color always a spring and summer favorite for me looks awesome with a tan too  :)</li>
            <li> When I got this polish inexpected it to be a different color. It is a bit more of a neon orange to me. It is a great color for the summertime though.</li>
            <li> Great color, I normally only buy OPI brand but China Glaze is pretty good too.  This one is a great addition to my collection.</li>
            <li> I love this it looks better on yourself try it and this was a good price I will buy this again</li>
            <li> This is a neon pastel orange, goes great with the hot melon color this Spring/Summer. Didnt think it was what I wanted at first. I shook it up really good, I used a base &amp; top coat. Then took my time to apply. I only applied 2 coats to get a smooth finish. With the base &amp; top coat, it lasted about a week before it chipped. Just like any other polish would. I get tons of compliments on this color &amp; its my new favorite! :)</li>
            <li> The package came in a timely manner, the color is fantastic! I absolutely love it, it&#x27;s very neon and bright and perfect for the summer in Florida. Lots of compliments on the color even though my boyfriend finds it too bright, I feel there is no such thing. My only vice with this product in particular was that it was sent to me goopy. It was very difficult to put on and was clumped up on the brush. I have never had such issues with any other polish that I got offline or with the brand china glaze in general. It was very disappointing and hard to work with. I&#x27;ll have to try a nailpolish thinner I suppose. Just very inconvenient. Other than that this is a great color and great buy just hope for a non-goopy product!</li>
            <li> Love this color it is poplular for the summer.  it makes any skintone pop out!! It goes with almost any summer color that you may have.  However when you apply it, it is a little thick you have to lay it right to get it to look smooth.</li>
            <li> the color is not like it seems, is much brighter and really strong, didt like it. . . . .</li>
            <li> This is an amazing shade of Pink! I also bought it with For Audry and they go well together. China Glaze is my all time favorite nail polish!!! I own over 70 bottles. Obsessed!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish, but I purchased it because my friend had this color and I LOVED it! However, when it arrived, it was definitely not the same pigment. I had her polish on my fingernails but when I painted this on my toes it was totally different in a side by side comparison. I am still pretty pleased because I&#x27;m a nail polish fiend so I&#x27;m glad to have any color, but I gave 4 stars because it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> This color is awesome, bright and sooo much fun! I have gotten several compliments on it. It stays nice and bright. Gold sparkles give it a nice look also.</li>
            <li> The product came as described and it shipped out quick. The color looks pretty when I applied it, though it takes up to three coats to get the look I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love it what else can I say this pink is very pretty and I can&#x27;t wait to wear it this week!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a nice summer color, (and it is) but it is mega bright. It was a pleasant surprise! If you&#x27;re looking for an eye-catching color to wear, this is it.</li>
            <li> This nail polish was exactly what I wanted and expected. It is an absolutely gorgeous shade of neon coral. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love China Glaze and this color is perfect for me, I love the hot colors on my toes and this color will for make me toes happy!</li>
            <li> Pretty Color!! I will wear this polish all summer long. I will buy mored to stock up with. This is a neon type pink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much for wearing anything with so much brightness but it looks great on my toes.  It goes on very nicely.  this is my first china glaze nail polish and I like it.  Since the color is a bit too bright for me I&#x27;ve been putting it on my dogs toes :)  Just the other day someone came up to me and asked me what color nail polish my dog was wearing because she really liked the color!!!</li>
            <li> i just love this nail polish , it does not chip for a couple days , and it stays pretty even threw dish washing !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this shade, it is so bright and vibrant, looks great even without a white bottom coat. this is a MUST have color for summer!! The shipping was quick and you will FALL IN LOVE with this. China glaze is my fav brand of polish, it is pretty chip resistant and provides good coverage</li>
            <li> This product came on time and was exactly the color it looks like in the picture and the bottle was brand new &amp;#60;3 I will be ordering more products from this company no questions asked...</li>
            <li> I thought from the picture this would be a darker pinkish orange color, but when I got it it&#x27;s more of a light orange which is just fine.  I bought it for my girls and they love it.  Perfect for their toes this Summer!</li>
            <li> It was a much more peachy pink than I was expecting, but I&#x27;m very happy with it despite the fact. :)</li>
            <li> I love it! It is my favorite color! Perfect name for it too! It is bright and very beautiful. I recommend  it.</li>
            <li> Love this color bright and pretty definitely a good color for the collection if you love bright toes or fingers</li>
            <li> this is such a beautiful neon color, I highly recomended, great for summer and great in combination with othe colors. I just love it!</li>
            <li> I love the color and the quality. I need that kind of color for the summer, for sure will order some more of it in future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;After i used it for a couple of time i can tell you that you should paint your nail very fast! The polish dries very fast because it is MATT. I still like the color but i don&#x60;t like that the polish formula!</li>
            <li> The photos do not do this color justice, this is a BRIGHT neon nail polish that is an orangey-coral color. I absolutely love it for summer pedicures. Like most neon nail polishes it does dry matte so if you want a shiny finish, topcoat is a must.</li>
            <li> The photos don&#x27;t do Flip Flop Fantasy justice. It&#x27;s so bright and vibrant, it&#x27;s PERFECT for summer. I use this color more than any other color that I own, I&#x27;m even wearing it with Essie&#x27;s Penny Talk right now. It perks me up in the winter time and it&#x27;ll look so good on my toes at the beach this summer! I&#x27;ve found that it looks best with China Glaze Fairy Dust over it. It&#x27;s a holographic &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; without chunks of glitter to scrape off when it comes time to remove the polish. I highly recommend both. :D</li>
            <li> I wanna start out by saying this color is to die for! It is such a beautiful neon coral and really makes a tan pop! I love the formulation as well! It is very smooth, isn&#x27;t streaky, and reaches opacity in 1-2 coats! In my opinion the only downside is the finish. It is an extremely matte polish! I would reccomend purchasing a high shine topcoat to top off this polish and then you should be good to go! Overall this is a gorgeous color and as summertime is rolling around I find myself reaching for it more and more frequently!</li>
            <li> I just love this color. It&#x27;s perfect for summer I have had many compliment on it. Recommend it to a friend and she bought some too</li>
