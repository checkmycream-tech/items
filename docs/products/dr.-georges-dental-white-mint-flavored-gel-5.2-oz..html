            <li>Very easy!</li>
            <li>I loved this whitening gel.</li>

            <li>A beautiful smile is on the way!</li>
            <li>Works great and quickly!  </li>
            <li>I have whitened my teeth before with the Crest whitening strips and those were amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This gel is amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>I kept the gel on for about 30 minutes using teeth whitening trays that I molded myself and I can honestly say that I already see a difference.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely the best whitener on the market.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of addicting.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and a good size for the price.</li>
            <li>But when I lost those, I used Dr. George&#x27;s cheap trays which were not so good.</li>
            <li>I buy a lot of teeth whitening products but this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>By far, the BEST teeth whitening product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>By far the best teeth whitening ever.</li>
            <li>more than expected:D</li>
            <li>Was able to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>This does not produce the results most people want over night or over a couple days.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I can safely say this eliminated most of my coffee staining and just years of tooth age in about 2 weeks of nightly use.</li>
            <li>I have got SO many compliments on my teeth saying they are &amp;#34;so white!&amp;#34; Or &amp;#34;so pretty&amp;#34; since using this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be a customer for life :)</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve told many people about this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it many years now</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i love love it .</li>
            <li>I have not seen any aprowment  yet, but i will keep trying because i was recommended this product, so i hope that i just have to give it more time.</li>
            <li>I have also used trays with it a couple of times and I got even better results.</li>
            <li>but they are pretty good and a lot cheaper than the dentist.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sooooo excited to get my hands on it!</li>
            <li>&amp; I received it just 2 days after I should have received the original purchase!</li>
            <li>My teeth look professionally bright white and my dentist says the product is actually good for preventing my gums from receding.</li>
            <li>Worked great so far!</li>
            <li>My teeth stain easily as I am a tea drinker.</li>
            <li>Get it, use it and get the beautiful white teeth we all want for a bargain price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works super well!</li>
            <li>I use it every day on my toothbrush along with my toothpaste and also use it in trays to whiten more quickly.</li>
            <li>Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;You can notice a difference right away, leaves your teeth smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>Works fairly well, doesn&#x27;t make teeth sensitive!</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product while mixing it with my tooth paste.</li>
            <li>The flavor is nice and it works fast.</li>
            <li>I also bought a set of mouth trays to use and boiled them to fit my teeth.</li>
            <li>He said not only was it safe for teeth but actually good for the strength of them.</li>
            <li>So far this has been overall a great product for me and whitening is coming along quite nicely.</li>
            <li>Bought it per Jaclyn Hill&#x27;s recommendation and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Also, my original purchase of this got lost in the mail, so I emailed Amazon, who emailed Dr. George&#x27;s, and they emailed me letting me know they sent another one out</li>
            <li>SO worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, well worth the money</li>
            <li>The very first use, I noticed a huge difference, I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li>i read great reviews on this product, I&#x27;ve used it twice already and have not really seen any result.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li>second batch, worked so good before</li>
            <li>Your mouth stays minty fresh, you feel clean.</li>
            <li>came quickly.</li>
            <li>Will continue using, till it&#x27;s done, since i did pay a good buck (not a penny, since it was a few dollars more than i was expecting)</li>
            <li>It is not difficult to fit into your routine when you do it that way.</li>
            <li>This has really helped!!</li>
            <li>Enough shades that most everyone I know noticed!</li>
            <li>Works great after a few treatments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of obsessed with my teeth, and I just can&#x27;t stress how great this product is.</li>
            <li>taste is gross but it is effective.</li>
            <li>Jaclyn Hill recommended this product and wow I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>And worth every penny.</li>
            <li>not as good as expected.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Super fast and with no problems!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, all you have to do is place gel inside teeth tray and leave it on for 20 minutes and notice whiter teeth instantly!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, really whitens your teeth, I would recommend getting Dr George&#x27;s whitening trays as they are probably higher quality ones than I got, which are not comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 3 days and can tell a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Saw results in 3 days, I dont like using it with trays,  I would first brush my teeth then apply the whitening gel on my toothbrush and brush again for about 30sec, twice a day.</li>
            <li>When I first got the product, I used it in a tray for sometimes up to an hour while I did chores.</li>
            <li>The dots went away within a few hours and so did the bright whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is better to bleach your teeth before having crowns color matched prior to placement.  </li>
            <li>This purchase is a replacement for a kit that I purchesed here because my whole house uses it!</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I ordered this product two days ago and it was already delivered, and I just finished my first &#x27;session&#x27; with it.</li>
            <li>I watch  a lot of videos on YouTube people talking about this product first</li>
            <li>and I can most definitely see a difference in my teeth after the 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Saw instant results! :)</li>
            <li>It does work but you have to use it every day for a few weeks to get a good result.</li>
            <li>It works about as good as Rembrandt whitening toothpaste, so I still see some yellow in spots that just simply can&#x27;t be pulled without a stronger bleaching system.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are super sensitive to whitening gels/strips and this stuff does not hurt them at all!</li>
            <li>Of course, you don&#x27;t have to use the gel for an hour - I was a bit apprehensive at first to go longer than 15 minutes - but you will see results that much faster if you leave the gel on for a longer time.</li>
            <li>I leave the gel on for 45 minutes to an hour, whereas the strips came off in 30 minutes, but I really don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works much quicker than the dentist product.</li>
            <li>It really works wonders on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>It is also not irritating my gums.</li>
            <li>Really Whittens my teeth,</li>
            <li>Really like this product,  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>does really whiten teeth as much as prodcut claims to</li>
            <li>People also think you are younger when you have nice white teeth.</li>
            <li>After trying Dr. George&#x27;s, I can&#x27;t believe that I ever even spent all that money on Crest when this product does the exact same thing at a much better price!</li>
            <li>will say that this product does take a bit more time for each application compared to other whitening strips/kits.</li>
            <li>At an affordable price and with super fast results, Dr. George&#x27;s Dental White will forever be a staple for me!</li>
            <li>When I first started using this product, I already had professional trays from my dentist.</li>
            <li>I can prove it now easily as I lost my lower teeth fitted tray and only bleached the top for the past year</li>
            <li>It also gives my teeth a ton of little white spots, which to be fair it warns about in the directions.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend and will most definitively be buying this again in the future!</li>
            <li>, it keep my teeth SUPER white 😁</li>
            <li>my bottom teeth are now at least two shades darker than the top ones!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>This stuff works just as well as the high priced gel from the dentist.</li>
            <li>It gives you a great white smile but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other products I have used.</li>
            <li>So far it works very well.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who want white smile believe me it works.</li>
            <li>This product had definitely helped my teeth to go back to the nice brighter white they used to be.</li>
            <li>right now I want  white teeth but don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li>You will see dramatic change in just one hour, and greater glowing white with more time.</li>
            <li>Has become a new staple in my weekly beauty routine.</li>
            <li>(why I haven&#x27;t gotten a new tray, I can not say)</li>
            <li>I will definitely repurchase and recommend to anyone who wants whiter teeth for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive at all, which I normally have a problem with when I use crest white strips.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and it does not bother me at all!</li>
            <li>and they get pretty white after one use</li>
            <li>What a tremendous savings over the much smaller amounts for dental trays to whiten (Nite White).</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive, and I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>doesnt make my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>Also has all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>And the product makes my teeth extremely sensitive...</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen a difference at all.  </li>
            <li>First few uses I didn&#x27;t notice much</li>
            <li>It wa very gentle on my enamel and didn&#x27;t burn my gums like other whitening gels have.</li>
            <li>you see a major difference.</li>
            <li>Occasionally, it does irritate my gums, but the irritation goes down quickly after.</li>
            <li>The Nite White made my teeth sensitive using overnight, so I haven&#x27;t tried it with Dr George&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Ive tried crest white strips and my teeth were so sensitive afterward</li>
            <li>I could barely touch them with my tongue.</li>
            <li>The cheap chunky ones that Dr. George&#x27;s provides are not good.</li>
            <li>My teeth were just a little bit brighter after the first few uses, but, for a major/ really noticeable change, any user will need patience.</li>

            <li> I have also used trays with it a couple of times and I got even better results.</li>
            <li> but they are pretty good and a lot cheaper than the dentist.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sooooo excited to get my hands on it!</li>
            <li> &amp; I received it just 2 days after I should have received the original purchase!</li>
            <li> My teeth look professionally bright white and my dentist says the product is actually good for preventing my gums from receding.</li>
            <li> Worked great so far!</li>
            <li> My teeth stain easily as I am a tea drinker.</li>
            <li> Get it, use it and get the beautiful white teeth we all want for a bargain price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works super well!</li>
            <li> I use it every day on my toothbrush along with my toothpaste and also use it in trays to whiten more quickly.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;You can notice a difference right away, leaves your teeth smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> Works fairly well, doesn&#x27;t make teeth sensitive!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product while mixing it with my tooth paste.</li>
            <li> The flavor is nice and it works fast.</li>
            <li> I also bought a set of mouth trays to use and boiled them to fit my teeth.</li>
            <li> He said not only was it safe for teeth but actually good for the strength of them.</li>
            <li> So far this has been overall a great product for me and whitening is coming along quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Bought it per Jaclyn Hill&#x27;s recommendation and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also, my original purchase of this got lost in the mail, so I emailed Amazon, who emailed Dr. George&#x27;s, and they emailed me letting me know they sent another one out</li>
            <li> SO worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, well worth the money</li>
            <li> The very first use, I noticed a huge difference, I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> i read great reviews on this product, I&#x27;ve used it twice already and have not really seen any result.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li> second batch, worked so good before</li>
            <li> Your mouth stays minty fresh, you feel clean.</li>
            <li> came quickly.</li>
            <li> Will continue using, till it&#x27;s done, since i did pay a good buck (not a penny, since it was a few dollars more than i was expecting)</li>
            <li> It is not difficult to fit into your routine when you do it that way.</li>
            <li> This has really helped!!</li>
            <li> Enough shades that most everyone I know noticed!</li>
            <li> Works great after a few treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of obsessed with my teeth, and I just can&#x27;t stress how great this product is.</li>
            <li> taste is gross but it is effective.</li>
            <li> Jaclyn Hill recommended this product and wow I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> And worth every penny.</li>
            <li> not as good as expected.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Super fast and with no problems!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, all you have to do is place gel inside teeth tray and leave it on for 20 minutes and notice whiter teeth instantly!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, really whitens your teeth, I would recommend getting Dr George&#x27;s whitening trays as they are probably higher quality ones than I got, which are not comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 3 days and can tell a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Saw results in 3 days, I dont like using it with trays,  I would first brush my teeth then apply the whitening gel on my toothbrush and brush again for about 30sec, twice a day.</li>
            <li> When I first got the product, I used it in a tray for sometimes up to an hour while I did chores.</li>
            <li> The dots went away within a few hours and so did the bright whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is better to bleach your teeth before having crowns color matched prior to placement.  </li>
            <li> This purchase is a replacement for a kit that I purchesed here because my whole house uses it!</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product two days ago and it was already delivered, and I just finished my first &#x27;session&#x27; with it.</li>
            <li> I watch  a lot of videos on YouTube people talking about this product first</li>
            <li> and I can most definitely see a difference in my teeth after the 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Saw instant results! :)</li>
            <li> It does work but you have to use it every day for a few weeks to get a good result.</li>
            <li> It works about as good as Rembrandt whitening toothpaste, so I still see some yellow in spots that just simply can&#x27;t be pulled without a stronger bleaching system.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are super sensitive to whitening gels/strips and this stuff does not hurt them at all!</li>
            <li> Of course, you don&#x27;t have to use the gel for an hour - I was a bit apprehensive at first to go longer than 15 minutes - but you will see results that much faster if you leave the gel on for a longer time.</li>
            <li> I leave the gel on for 45 minutes to an hour, whereas the strips came off in 30 minutes, but I really don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works much quicker than the dentist product.</li>
            <li> It really works wonders on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> It is also not irritating my gums.</li>
            <li> Really Whittens my teeth,</li>
            <li> Really like this product,  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> does really whiten teeth as much as prodcut claims to</li>
            <li> People also think you are younger when you have nice white teeth.</li>
            <li> After trying Dr. George&#x27;s, I can&#x27;t believe that I ever even spent all that money on Crest when this product does the exact same thing at a much better price!</li>
            <li> will say that this product does take a bit more time for each application compared to other whitening strips/kits.</li>
            <li> At an affordable price and with super fast results, Dr. George&#x27;s Dental White will forever be a staple for me!</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, I already had professional trays from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I can prove it now easily as I lost my lower teeth fitted tray and only bleached the top for the past year</li>
            <li> It also gives my teeth a ton of little white spots, which to be fair it warns about in the directions.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend and will most definitively be buying this again in the future!</li>
            <li> , it keep my teeth SUPER white 😁</li>
            <li> my bottom teeth are now at least two shades darker than the top ones!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This stuff works just as well as the high priced gel from the dentist.</li>
            <li> It gives you a great white smile but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other products I have used.</li>
            <li> So far it works very well.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who want white smile believe me it works.</li>
            <li> This product had definitely helped my teeth to go back to the nice brighter white they used to be.</li>
            <li> right now I want  white teeth but don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> You will see dramatic change in just one hour, and greater glowing white with more time.</li>
            <li> Has become a new staple in my weekly beauty routine.</li>
            <li> (why I haven&#x27;t gotten a new tray, I can not say)</li>
            <li> I will definitely repurchase and recommend to anyone who wants whiter teeth for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive at all, which I normally have a problem with when I use crest white strips.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and it does not bother me at all!</li>
            <li> and they get pretty white after one use</li>
            <li> What a tremendous savings over the much smaller amounts for dental trays to whiten (Nite White).</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive, and I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> doesnt make my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> Also has all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> And the product makes my teeth extremely sensitive...</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen a difference at all.  </li>
            <li> First few uses I didn&#x27;t notice much</li>
            <li> It wa very gentle on my enamel and didn&#x27;t burn my gums like other whitening gels have.</li>
            <li> you see a major difference.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, it does irritate my gums, but the irritation goes down quickly after.</li>
            <li> The Nite White made my teeth sensitive using overnight, so I haven&#x27;t tried it with Dr George&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried crest white strips and my teeth were so sensitive afterward</li>
            <li> I could barely touch them with my tongue.</li>
            <li> The cheap chunky ones that Dr. George&#x27;s provides are not good.</li>
            <li> My teeth were just a little bit brighter after the first few uses, but, for a major/ really noticeable change, any user will need patience.</li>
            <li> I guess my only complaint is that it left white lines on my teeth where there was too much product applied.</li>
            <li> On the upside, it does last long.</li>
            <li> than that, I had no sensitivity problems or any other major problem when using this product.</li>
            <li> The only down side is if you have these in a tray, it kinda tastes bad after awhile but still good stuff.</li>
            <li> Dr George&#x27;s has the same active ingredient as Nite White sold at the dentist for hundreds of dollars.  </li>
            <li> Bottle is smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I started buying Dr. Georges at Walgreens a long time ago....</li>
            <li> Makes teeth sensitive :( expected better</li>
            <li> I had used Dr. George&#x27;s Dental White Mint Flavored Gel previous to my order.</li>
            <li> Now I apply the gel with a q tip on the surface of my teeth and then put in my trays, less drooling no white lines.</li>
            <li> Have tried almost everything else out there with minimal results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> Product was just like I expected.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy any other gel then this one works for me.</li>
            <li> so I buy other products</li>
            <li> My teeth might be glowing in the dark by the time i finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> and my teeth were not yellow or dirty, but I have had a yellow stain around the outside of my teeth for years.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m not even half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy coffee and tea drinker.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably try it again for a few days</li>
            <li> Works really well and doesn&#x27;t taste unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little nervous it will damage my enamel!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still not sure my teeth are getting whiter.  </li>
            <li> The spots go away, but I&#x27;ve never experienced it with any other whitening products.  </li>
            <li> The bad part is you need to get professional trays done.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using it at least once a week.</li>
            <li> You must leave on teeth at least one hour to penetrate the enamel on teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been subtle, granted, because I haven&#x27;t been using it in a tray</li>
            <li> Dramatic difference in 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not even that expensive!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste too bad and works well.</li>
            <li> They are usually shocked to hear I just use a product at home.  </li>
            <li> Although putting it in the mouth guard and letting it sit has an awful taste.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is great...more than expected:D</li>
            <li> Love this! Works wonders.</li>
            <li> Love it! Whites like a dream and you can&#x27;t beat the price. One tube goes a looong way!</li>
            <li> Does a nice job.  Using it only twice a week is all I need.</li>
            <li> Was able to notice a difference.  Also recently returned for my 6 mos dental check up and received a compliment  from hygienist on my whiteness.</li>
            <li> Works well!  My teeth are whiter and brighter.</li>
            <li> Great Value! Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Good service, I like the product, it works!</li>
            <li> Saw results in 3 days, I dont like using it with trays,  I would first brush my teeth then apply the whitening gel on my toothbrush and brush again for about 30sec, twice a day.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I have whitened my teeth before with the Crest whitening strips and those were amazing. After trying Dr. George&#x27;s, I can&#x27;t believe that I ever even spent all that money on Crest when this product does the exact same thing at a much better price! I use the gel with trays, for about an hour every time, and my teeth are amazingly white (just as white as when I had used Crest).&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this product does take a bit more time for each application compared to other whitening strips/kits. I leave the gel on for 45 minutes to an hour, whereas the strips came off in 30 minutes, but I really don&#x27;t mind. Of course, you don&#x27;t have to use the gel for an hour - I was a bit apprehensive at first to go longer than 15 minutes - but you will see results that much faster if you leave the gel on for a longer time. In addition, I saw results instantly. My teeth were just a little bit brighter after the first few uses, but, for a major/ really noticeable change, any user will need patience. This does not produce the results most people want over night or over a couple days. For me, I got to the shade I wanted in 2 weeks. It may take longer for some or a shorter period for others, but my advice would be to just have patience! It does work!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I had no sensitivity problems or any other major problem when using this product. I would definitely recommend and will most definitively be buying this again in the future!</li>
            <li> Works great and quickly!  Stays white for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it w/ trays my dentist made for me back when I bought his product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works much quicker than the dentist product.</li>
            <li> I use this with my toothpaste every morning and night and it has definitely helped maintain the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I received this product a month ago and have used it daily, both with a tray and in my toothpaste. When I first got the product, I used it in a tray for sometimes up to an hour while I did chores. It didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive, and I have sensitive teeth. It did whiten them by a couple shades, but also left white dots on my teeth. The dots went away within a few hours and so did the bright whiteness of my teeth. Permanently, they are not whitened. Now, I HAVE to use this product twice daily to maintain sub-par results. It works about as good as Rembrandt whitening toothpaste, so I still see some yellow in spots that just simply can&#x27;t be pulled without a stronger bleaching system.  On the upside, it does last long.</li>
            <li> Great product  Great price</li>
            <li> I have only used this product twice but I have notice a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It really works wonders on my teeth. Literally paper white. The only down side is if you have these in a tray, it kinda tastes bad after awhile but still good stuff. Also you can&#x27;t taste it if you mix it 50/50 with your tooth paste.</li>
            <li> Really great product! Works super well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several whitening product just to discontinue use do to sensitivity. So far this has been overall a great product for me and whitening is coming along quite nicely.</li>
            <li> This has really helped!! I&#x27;m gonna need another bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Dr George&#x27;s has the same active ingredient as Nite White sold at the dentist for hundreds of dollars.  I have used it for 10 years.  It does not burn your mouth as some of the store bought products do.  Dramatic difference in 30 minutes.  Yes, 30 minutes.  I do not use it overnight.  The Nite White made my teeth sensitive using overnight, so I haven&#x27;t tried it with Dr George&#x27;s.  This product does not work on crowns.  It is better to bleach your teeth before having crowns color matched prior to placement.  This product is a mainstay in our home.</li>
            <li> perfect! came quickly. i use it about twice a week. doesnt make my teeth sensitive. great results!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I had to use it three days in a row to achieve the whiteness that I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great!!  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it in addition to my toothpaste and I&#x27;m noticing results. It is also not irritating my gums.</li>
            <li> In love with this whitener! I have sensitive teeth and it does not bother me at all!</li>
            <li> Great product you can see the difference in a week of used. I am using it with my invisalign trays. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Works fairly well, doesn&#x27;t make teeth sensitive!</li>
            <li> I mix this with my toothpaste for whiter teeth.  What a tremendous savings over the much smaller amounts for dental trays to whiten (Nite White).</li>
            <li> Ive been wanting to get this ever since Jaclyn Hill mentioned about it and I&#x27;m sooooo excited to get my hands on it! Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Works great with no burning!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;You can notice a difference right away, leaves your teeth smooth and clean.  You don&#x27;t even have to put it on a tray, just add it to your toothbrush/toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I loved this whitening gel. It wa very gentle on my enamel and didn&#x27;t burn my gums like other whitening gels have. It is very easy to use, all you have to do is place gel inside teeth tray and leave it on for 20 minutes and notice whiter teeth instantly! I will definitely repurchase and recommend to anyone who wants whiter teeth for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Bought it per Jaclyn Hill&#x27;s recommendation and was not disappointed. Has become a new staple in my weekly beauty routine.</li>
            <li> This is the best whitener for the money. I get it all the time and I love it. I&#x27;m kind of obsessed with my teeth, and I just can&#x27;t stress how great this product is.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product while mixing it with my tooth paste. Although putting it in the mouth guard and letting it sit has an awful taste. Easy to use, well worth the money</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! This purchase is a replacement for a kit that I purchesed here because my whole house uses it!</li>
            <li> I had used Dr. George&#x27;s Dental White Mint Flavored Gel previous to my order. It is a great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 years. I&#x27;m a heavy coffee and tea drinker.  Use the trays whenever I shower. My teeth look professionally bright white and my dentist says the product is actually good for preventing my gums from receding. I look great and my teeth are healthier than ever.  Same product at your dentist&#x27;s office will cost hundreds.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things. The bad part is you need to get professional trays done. The cheap chunky ones that Dr. George&#x27;s provides are not good. When I first started using this product, I already had professional trays from my dentist. Those were the best. But when I lost those, I used Dr. George&#x27;s cheap trays which were not so good. Then I had a set of more expensive trays made through Dr. George&#x27;s (the ones where you make a mold and send them back to the lab). These trays were not as good as the ones from my dentist but they are pretty good and a lot cheaper than the dentist. Dr. George&#x27;s trays have lasted well for 2 years now.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a noticeable difference and I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> First few uses I didn&#x27;t notice much but after a week my &#x27;whiteness&#x27; seemed to start building up and getting whiter daily. I can safely say this eliminated most of my coffee staining and just years of tooth age in about 2 weeks of nightly use. Enough shades that most everyone I know noticed!</li>
            <li> I can already tell a big difference. Bottle is smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> Worked great so far! I brush with it and I&#x27;ll put them on my teeth for about 20 min and they get pretty white after one use</li>
            <li> I have got SO many compliments on my teeth saying they are &amp;#34;so white!&amp;#34; Or &amp;#34;so pretty&amp;#34; since using this product. I always recommend this product when some one is wanting to whiten at home. Occasionally, it does irritate my gums, but the irritation goes down quickly after. I put the gel into my retainers and Pop them in. I definitely notice a difference when I go without whitening for a while. I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I saw where Jaclyn Hill uses this, and since I have a girl crush on her, I thought I&#x27;d try it.  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> What can I say? It works.</li>
            <li> Only thing that has whitened my teeth and i&#x27;m not even half way through the bottle.My teeth might be glowing in the dark by the time i finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! Have tried almost everything else out there with minimal results. This works and works well within 2-3 times you see a major difference. I didn&#x27;t get the sensitivity and gum irritation either. Great product and I&#x27;ll be a customer for life :)</li>
            <li> second batch, worked so good before</li>
            <li> I am sooooo glad to have found this product again! I used this for years with wonderful results! A beautiful smile is on the way!</li>
            <li> taste is gross but it is effective.</li>
            <li> It gives you a great white smile but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other products I have used. I would recommend using it at least once a week.</li>
            <li> People always comment on my white teeth and ask what I do.  They are usually shocked to hear I just use a product at home.  I started buying Dr. Georges at Walgreens a long time ago....if you are faithful and use it as directed you will get very white teeth!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can prove it now easily as I lost my lower teeth fitted tray and only bleached the top for the past year (why I haven&#x27;t gotten a new tray, I can not say) my bottom teeth are now at least two shades darker than the top ones!  Get it, use it and get the beautiful white teeth we all want for a bargain price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS..my dentist asked what I used at one point and then sent for samples to set out on his front desk.  He said not only was it safe for teeth but actually good for the strength of them. Win/win!</li>
            <li> Works really well and doesn&#x27;t taste unpleasant. Also has all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I ordered this product two days ago and it was already delivered, and I just finished my first &#x27;session&#x27; with it. I kept the gel on for about 30 minutes using teeth whitening trays that I molded myself and I can honestly say that I already see a difference. I already have excellent dental hygiene to begin with and my teeth were not yellow or dirty, but I have had a yellow stain around the outside of my teeth for years. After these 30 minutes I can legitimately say the stain is already being lifted AND whitened. This gel is amazing and I can&#x27;t wait to continue my use with it.</li>
            <li> It does work but you have to use it every day for a few weeks to get a good result.</li>
            <li> The Best Ever &amp; I&#x27;ve told many people about this. Love it! I&#x27;ve used it many years now , it keep my teeth SUPER white 😁</li>
            <li> It is absolutely the best whitener on the market.  You must leave on teeth at least one hour to penetrate the enamel on teeth.  If you do not have a tray you can fold tin foil and fill it with gel and then mold the folds of tin foil to teeth.  Do not swallow any leakage.  It is best to watch your favorite one hour tv program while whitening teeth and sit with a spit cup if any leaks.  You will see dramatic change in just one hour, and greater glowing white with more time.</li>
            <li> Great product! I like it because it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth hurt afterwards. The white strips would always hurt for hours after.</li>
            <li> Love using this! Really Whittens my teeth, no sensitivity effects</li>
            <li> I love it. No Complants.</li>
            <li> This stuff works just as well as the high priced gel from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of teeth whitening products but this one is the best so far.I will never buy any other gel then this one works for me. I watch  a lot of videos on YouTube people talking about this product first I don&#x27;t believe them so I buy other products but my mind was on this Dr George&#x27;s dental white finally I buy it i love love it . I&#x27;m so into teeth whitening right now I want  white teeth but don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. I recommend this product to anyone who want white smile believe me it works.</li>
            <li> Very good - the best!</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today &amp; used it once for about 10 minutes in some mouth trays. Amazing!! My teeth are noticeably whiter! Also, my original purchase of this got lost in the mail, so I emailed Amazon, who emailed Dr. George&#x27;s, and they emailed me letting me know they sent another one out &amp; I received it just 2 days after I should have received the original purchase! Great customer service &amp; great product. Will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for teeth whitening! I have used Dr. George&#x27;s for years and I always will. I get compliments all the time and cannot believe something so simple to use does the trick. My teeth stain easily as I am a tea drinker. I rely on Dr. George&#x27;s. The flavor is nice and it works fast. I use it while I am in the shower and then brush my teeth afterwards. It is not difficult to fit into your routine when you do it that way. People also think you are younger when you have nice white teeth. An added plus!</li>
            <li> So far it works very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, really whitens your teeth, I would recommend getting Dr George&#x27;s whitening trays as they are probably higher quality ones than I got, which are not comfortable. I guess my only complaint is that it left white lines on my teeth where there was too much product applied. Now I apply the gel with a q tip on the surface of my teeth and then put in my trays, less drooling no white lines.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  It works!</li>
            <li> I have not seen any aprowment  yet, but i will keep trying because i was recommended this product, so i hope that i just have to give it more time. But the shipping was perfect. Super fast and with no problems!</li>
            <li> I like this product already. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and I already see a difference. Your mouth stays minty fresh, you feel clean. Jaclyn Hill recommended this product and wow I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> SEEN RESULTS AFTER 3 DAYS!!! This stuff is amazing. My teeth are so white. Thank you Dr. George!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks just with my toothpaste morning and night and I can most definitely see a difference in my teeth after the 2 weeks of use. It&#x27;s been subtle, granted, because I haven&#x27;t been using it in a tray but the results are still noticeable. I am a big tea drinker and my teeth were starting to yellow despite my constant brushing. This product had definitely helped my teeth to go back to the nice brighter white they used to be.</li>
            <li> Really like this product,  it&#x27;s easy to use and a good size for the price. I also bought a set of mouth trays to use and boiled them to fit my teeth. Very easy!</li>
            <li> My teeth are super sensitive to whitening gels/strips and this stuff does not hurt them at all! Ive tried crest white strips and my teeth were so sensitive afterward I could barely touch them with my tongue. I use a bit of this with my toothpaste morning and night and after only a week I&#x27;ve noticed a difference.  I have also used trays with it a couple of times and I got even better results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile and I&#x27;m still not sure my teeth are getting whiter.  My daughter swears by this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see a big difference. And the product makes my teeth extremely sensitive...</li>
            <li> I have tried many teeth whitening products and this one has worked the best. Would definitely use again and recommend it.</li>
            <li> By far, the BEST teeth whitening product I have ever used. At an affordable price and with super fast results, Dr. George&#x27;s Dental White will forever be a staple for me! I&#x27;m recommending it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 3 days and can tell a HUGE difference! SO worth every penny! It&#x27;s Liquid gold in my household!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth and this did not make them hurt.</li>
            <li> Loveee this product! The very first use, I noticed a huge difference, I&#x27;ve gotten. My teeth as white as I&#x27;ve wanted, it&#x27;s kind of addicting. Because you can notice the difference, so you want to keep on using it!  By far the best teeth whitening ever. And worth every penny. And it&#x27;s not even that expensive! Thank you Jaclyn Hill!</li>
            <li> Product was just like I expected.  Great experience! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff....works as advertised!</li>
            <li> Works awesome w molding trays</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a month and I really like it. It&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive at all, which I normally have a problem with when I use crest white strips. I can definitely see a difference. I just mix it with my tooth paste every time I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen a difference at all.  It also gives my teeth a ton of little white spots, which to be fair it warns about in the directions.  The spots go away, but I&#x27;ve never experienced it with any other whitening products.  I&#x27;ll probably try it again for a few days but if I don&#x27;t see a difference I&#x27;ll probably toss it.  I&#x27;m a little nervous it will damage my enamel!</li>
            <li> Makes teeth sensitive :( expected better</li>
            <li> i read great reviews on this product, I&#x27;ve used it twice already and have not really seen any result. Will continue using, till it&#x27;s done, since i did pay a good buck (not a penny, since it was a few dollars more than i was expecting)</li>
            <li> Works great after a few treatments.</li>
            <li> not as good as expected.  does really whiten teeth as much as prodcut claims to</li>
            <li> Loved this! Worth every penny! Saw instant results! :)</li>
            <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week today and can already see improvement! I will definitely buy again, that&#x27;s if that bottle ever runs out!</li>
            <li> Works great! I use it every day on my toothbrush along with my toothpaste and also use it in trays to whiten more quickly. Doesn&#x27;t taste too bad and works well.</li>
