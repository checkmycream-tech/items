            <li> UNUSUAL SMELL, PRETTY</li>
            <li> I purchased this on september 2014. When used, i was badly surprised to notice that there was no scent at all. It was like water. I wrote the seller in order to get a refund until now No Answer. I want my cash back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this scent, I would buy this again and again. On my second bottle. (:</li>
            <li> This is Christy Turlington&#x27;s fragrance for Avon and it&#x27;s a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is good, not too overwhelming, not too sugary, a bit spicy with a touch of sweetness, delicate sweetness, if I get it.&lt;br /&gt;right ( I&#x27;m not an expert).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a scent that lasts all day on your skin and clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely one of my favorites from Avon and one that I&#x27;ll buy again and again because it&#x27;s a good quality perfume.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff,,, not to strong, not to light just right// I encourage you to get this,, i got it on time  and it was wrapped secure...</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and love this scent! I was so upset when Avon stopped selling it, but I am so happy I found it in Amazon!</li>
            <li> i love this perfume its the best</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife wanted! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! Hubby&#x27;s all over me &amp; I feel immediate pick me up nice floral scent! Hate the name though. No class! I think the name should be light. &amp; flowery</li>
            <li> This is the perfume i used to order from Avon all the time, until they stopped selling it out of their magizines. When isaw that Amazon had it i got excited. I love the scent:D</li>
            <li> i love it ... it&#x27;s my Favorite perfume..I hope you got us with more deals and cheap prices like this one</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so sorry Avon doesn&#x27;t have it anymore, hope it will come back again. Great smell, not over powering</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. What I like it best is the mild and sext.  It will incredibly satisfied me if it last a little longer.</li>
            <li> Tantalizing. Hard to believe it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume!</li>
            <li> Last bottle in existence!! My mother was so happy for Christmas. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this soooo much. I&#x27;m a BIG Avon person and sometimes I like to get the stuff for better price. Compliments is all you&#x27;ll receive with this perfume!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and the price is nice.</li>
            <li> I RECIEVED THIS PERFUME TODAY AND THE BOTTLE LOOKS VERY PRETTY BUT THE SCENT JUST DOES&#x27;NT LAST. YOU HAVE TO KEEP RE-APPLY IT EVER HOUR IF YOU WANT TO SMELL IT. I SEE WHY IT DID&#x27;NT COST MUCH.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the seller&#x27;s fault, but this perfume is horrid. The smell is too heavy and gives me headache. I normally like Avon perfumes, but this one is absolutely yucky. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1, is it came swiftly. And I didn&#x27;t return it because I was able to dump it on someone who was quite willing to take it.</li>
            <li> The box that it came in was pretty much crushed and the bottle was not filled to the top. I kept it because it was mostly full and not much perfume was missing but I bought it to give as a gift and was unable to do so  because of the box and the fact that it was somewhat used. Not worth the hassle of returning it.</li>
