            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>This protection styling spray shoots a fine mist and does a great job at defending the hair against heat damage.</li>
            <li>They both require some adjustment to figure out how much to apply, but the results are the best I have ever had.</li>
            <li>The best heat spray there is Iin the whole world</li>
            <li>I use this before a blow out, and it leaves my hair nice a shiny.</li>
            <li>Good product and has helped to better control hair breakage.</li>
            <li>and it is the most effective \\&quot;serum\\</li>
            <li>and plus it kept my hair softer and more manageable being</li>
            <li>I already use Nexxus shampoo lines, I tried the emergencee shampoo &amp; conditioner Love it, and i tried the Oil infinite shampoo &amp; conditioner, Loveeeee this one</li>

            <li>I have more split ends than ever before.</li>
            <li>love it soo worth it!!</li>
            <li>This is just one more of a long line of wonderful Nexxus products.</li>
            <li>and it is the best i can find to blow dry my hair without damagge</li>
            <li>I have been using this off and on for several years and it is a very good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky, smooth, easy to style, dries faster, and my ends feel hydrated and the splits are temporarily sealed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light spray and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling or residue.</li>
            <li>first of all this product is amazing not only it smells sooo good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using KerapHix, which always helps, but after remembering how much I liked this product the first time (way back when my hair was healthy!)</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using the Nexxus Pro-Mend line, my hair is silky, shiny all the way to the ends, and full of life.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this</li>
            <li>because 90% of the time it&#x27;s incredible and leave my hair feeling soft and shiny, however, 10% of the time it makes my hair feel dry and</li>
            <li>Through all the color I went through that week, my hair only stayed in tact because it was very strong to begin with.</li>
            <li>I saw a 100% improvement in my hair after the first use, I&#x27;m not exaggerating.</li>
            <li>After my most recent visit to the salon I faced what can be coined as an apocalyptic color trauma.</li>
            <li>and I take very good care to make sure my ends don&#x27;t get scraggly and long unhealthy.</li>
            <li>Will never use any other kind of heat spray.</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair daily, Love this leave in heat protectant, it kept my hair airy light,</li>
            <li>spray with Nexxus Heat Protex Heat Protection Styling Spray ( also helps to soften hair better than any other heat protective styling spray), and put it up in jumbo hot rollers.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to meet the world.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, the only products that have successfully brought me back to my hair&#x27;s natural texture and sheen are from Nexxus.</li>
            <li>I doubt kerapHix or this spray will transform your hair if it&#x27;s been so permed or bleached that it&#x27;s just breaking off, this nor is any other product going to be able to \\&quot;heal\\&quot; your hair, but if you&#x27;ve got some dryness and split ends</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being that I probably have a bit of OCD with my hair, I&#x27;ve always taken the extra time to give it some extra love.</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine, blonde frizzy hair and Marrakesh Oil Hair Styling Elixir really does soften and reduces frizzies, and I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, it&#x27;s probably something I do wrong, but for the price this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this to use before the steam curlers to protect my hair, but then just started getting in the habit of spritzing this on the ends of my hair&#x27;s last couple of inches daily, and sometimes twice a day, because it really seems to make it soft and shiney and it kills the frizz.  </li>
            <li>I use a curling iron and it protects my hair from the intense heat and prevents damage and yellow discoloring.</li>
            <li>The result is big, soft, wavy curls, lots of shine and no frizzy hair even in high humidity or rain.</li>
            <li>I am in the middle of my second bottle of this product, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t use a lot of heat on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I try every new product and really like the softening and frizz control, and combine them in my hands to apply as the Sabino is verrry thick and sticky.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser uses this herself and it works very well , but she has thinner, only slightly frizzy hair.</li>

            <li> My hairdresser uses this herself and it works very well , but she has thinner, only slightly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My long hair was to say the least, crispy, after having been over saturated with color and receiving 3 bleach baths plus 2 more dye jobs and a half head of highlights to try to correct the color.</li>
            <li> Since my hair does tend to be dry, I try to go 3 days between shampoos, but my hair always looks really poofy, and less shiney on the ends on the days following shampooing, so</li>
            <li> I have very fine-shafted, salon color-treated, slightly curly, somewhat dry hair</li>
            <li> There is no product on earth that is going to truly protect your hair from damage due to the direct heat of a blow dryer, curling or straightening iron.  </li>
            <li> not oily, no crunchiness to my hair, kept it soft and air dry, i even use it thruout the day as a touch up..love it!!!!</li>
            <li> helps with the healing and preventing damage to long hair.</li>
            <li> My naturally curly hair needs protection with something to tame the fuzz and curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very long</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that I could put on dry hair, on the ends to cut the frizz.</li>
            <li> In the morning my hair is dry, I sometimes add a little extra Sabino to the ends as I section my hair for each roller,</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t compete with any other products used.</li>
            <li> This product does, however, certainly slow the damage down and leaves my hair feeling soft and a bit less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I just run my fingers through the ends after spritzing to separate it a little</li>
            <li> You will notice the repair effects after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and I was planning to return it if I was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Over the past couple of weeks I&#x27;ve been applying protein treatments, moisture masks, tonics, leave-ins, avoiding washing my hair, coconut oil, jojoba, almond, etc...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complaint since hair types differ and not everything works for everyone.</li>
            <li> I combine the Marrakesh Oil with Sabino Moisture Block, as my hair requires serious frizz control.</li>
            <li> and she did not even use the product like seriously dont make a review if you didnt try the product yourself!</li>
            <li> , that is just past my shoulders, and tends to frizz badly at the ends on the days after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s something I do wrong...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this spray for a mere 3 days, and my hair has been transformed.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>

            <li> first of all this product is amazing not only it smells sooo good but it does a great job, this product would have a 5 stars but there&#x27;s a review that gave it one star and she did not even use the product like seriously dont make a review if you didnt try the product yourself! anyways my hair looks so shiny and healthy afters straightening my hair. love it soo worth it!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine, blonde frizzy hair and Marrakesh Oil Hair Styling Elixir really does soften and reduces frizzies, and I love the fragrance. My hairdresser uses this herself and it works very well , but she has thinner, only slightly frizzy hair. I combine the Marrakesh Oil with Sabino Moisture Block, as my hair requires serious frizz control. There are only two Ingredients: Dimethicone and Cyclomethicone in Sabino Moisture Block and it is the most effective \\&quot;serum\\&quot; I have ever used.   I try every new product and really like the softening and frizz control, and combine them in my hands to apply as the Sabino is verrry thick and sticky. They both require some adjustment to figure out how much to apply, but the results are the best I have ever had. I wash my hair at night, apply the products and go to bed (NO BLOW DRYING). In the morning my hair is dry, I sometimes add a little extra Sabino to the ends as I section my hair for each roller, spray with Nexxus Heat Protex Heat Protection Styling Spray ( also helps to soften hair better than any other heat protective styling spray), and put it up in jumbo hot rollers. The result is big, soft, wavy curls, lots of shine and no frizzy hair even in high humidity or rain.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s something I do wrong... because 90% of the time it&#x27;s incredible and leave my hair feeling soft and shiny, however, 10% of the time it makes my hair feel dry and coarse.&lt;br /&gt;Again, it&#x27;s probably something I do wrong, but for the price this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> There is no product on earth that is going to truly protect your hair from damage due to the direct heat of a blow dryer, curling or straightening iron.  That&#x27;s a fact. This product does, however, certainly slow the damage down and leaves my hair feeling soft and a bit less frizzy.  It&#x27;s a light spray and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling or residue. Of all the products of this type that I have tried (and they are many), this is the one I like best. Doesn&#x27;t compete with any other products used.</li>
            <li> I am in the middle of my second bottle of this product, and I really like it.  I have very fine-shafted, salon color-treated, slightly curly, somewhat dry hair, that is just past my shoulders, and tends to frizz badly at the ends on the days after shampooing.  Since my hair does tend to be dry, I try to go 3 days between shampoos, but my hair always looks really poofy, and less shiney on the ends on the days following shampooing, so I was looking for something that I could put on dry hair, on the ends to cut the frizz. I generally don&#x27;t use a lot of heat on my hair.  I air-dry it and then will use steam-type curlers a couple times a week. I originally bought this to use before the steam curlers to protect my hair, but then just started getting in the habit of spritzing this on the ends of my hair&#x27;s last couple of inches daily, and sometimes twice a day, because it really seems to make it soft and shiney and it kills the frizz.  I just run my fingers through the ends after spritzing to separate it a little and it&#x27;s ready to meet the world.  I know this isn&#x27;t the intended use of the product, but it works for me.</li>
            <li> i used this product about 2 yera ago and it is the best i can find to blow dry my hair without damagge</li>
            <li> i love it, everything about it, the size of the bottle to how it has helped my hair, and i will keep using it forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this off and on for several years and it is a very good conditioner.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Product works great.........helps with the healing and preventing damage to long hair.</li>
            <li> I use a curling iron and it protects my hair from the intense heat and prevents damage and yellow discoloring.</li>
            <li> The best heat spray there is Iin the whole world and it smells amazing! Will never use any other kind of heat spray.</li>
            <li> This is just one more of a long line of wonderful Nexxus products. Ever since I started using the Nexxus Pro-Mend line, my hair is silky, shiny all the way to the ends, and full of life. I do use the Ultimate Moisture shampoo by Nexxus, but everything else is Pro-Mend. I saw a 100% improvement in my hair after the first use, I&#x27;m not exaggerating.</li>
            <li> I use this before a blow out, and it leaves my hair nice a shiny. Plus it truly does protect me hair. I just love it!</li>
            <li> My naturally curly hair needs protection with something to tame the fuzz and curls.</li>
            <li> Immediatley it protects the hair from heat. You will notice the repair effects after a few weeks.  I am so happy i tried this product and I was planning to return it if I was not satisfied. I tell everyone I know to get this product.  I think NEXXUS is the best line of hair products and have been using for them for 22 years.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. Can&#x27;t complaint since hair types differ and not everything works for everyone. Returned it immediately?</li>
            <li> After my most recent visit to the salon I faced what can be coined as an apocalyptic color trauma. My long hair was to say the least, crispy, after having been over saturated with color and receiving 3 bleach baths plus 2 more dye jobs and a half head of highlights to try to correct the color. Over the past couple of weeks I&#x27;ve been applying protein treatments, moisture masks, tonics, leave-ins, avoiding washing my hair, coconut oil, jojoba, almond, etc...&lt;br /&gt;So far, the only products that have successfully brought me back to my hair&#x27;s natural texture and sheen are from Nexxus. I&#x27;ve been using KerapHix, which always helps, but after remembering how much I liked this product the first time (way back when my hair was healthy!) I decided to give it a go again.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this spray for a mere 3 days, and my hair has been transformed. It&#x27;s silky, smooth, easy to style, dries faster, and my ends feel hydrated and the splits are temporarily sealed. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that I probably have a bit of OCD with my hair, I&#x27;ve always taken the extra time to give it some extra love. It&#x27;s very long and I take very good care to make sure my ends don&#x27;t get scraggly and long unhealthy. Through all the color I went through that week, my hair only stayed in tact because it was very strong to begin with. I doubt kerapHix or this spray will transform your hair if it&#x27;s been so permed or bleached that it&#x27;s just breaking off, this nor is any other product going to be able to \\&quot;heal\\&quot; your hair, but if you&#x27;ve got some dryness and split ends and you heat style your hair, I fully recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> Good product and has helped to better control hair breakage.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. It did not work at all. I have more split ends than ever before. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This protection styling spray shoots a fine mist and does a great job at defending the hair against heat damage. It smells great, and WORKS great.</li>
