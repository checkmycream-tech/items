            <li>Beautiful.</li>
            <li>but the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li>And I just had to add this color to my collection, it is a beautiful brownish purplish color.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful fall color...</li>
            <li>I am EXTREMELY impressed with this polish and will order more for sure!!!!!!!</li>

            <li>- IT&#x27;S WORTH THIS PRICE!!!!</li>
            <li>the color is beautiful and the magnet makes a nice design on my nails.</li>
            <li>When I applied it, it looked good, but smudged when it was under UV lamp.</li>

            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I will deffinately be trying more colors in this!</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish!</li>
            <li>My magnet doesn&#x27;t make as nice a design</li>
            <li>I love the colors.  </li>
            <li>Color is more like a brown/purple.</li>
            <li>recieved my gelish polish and i love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>If you have to apply 2 coats of the color, do you use the magnet on both coats or just the top one????</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get lots of comments.</li>
            <li>This is much more of a dark purple with the magnetic stripes being a beautiful silver pinkish!</li>
            <li>So cool!</li>
            <li>and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>When you use the magnet it looks accurate to the photo.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use and looks</li>
            <li>When I learned of these magnetic polishes I wanted to experiment with them, but they all looked so cool</li>
            <li>The magnet design is so cool</li>
            <li>It is sort of a deep purple/shimmery cocoa that looks amazing in the fall and winter months.</li>
            <li>mag nails are so fun</li>
            <li>ARE NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, COLOR WISE... AND TRANSPARENCY.</li>
            <li>it is my favorite so far of the magnetic polishes....  </li>
            <li>It is nice to have if you do need a touch up before re-doing your nails as it is just a regular nail polish, but the only part besides the gelish polish that you really need is the magnet top that comes on the lacquer bottle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>This is such a cool color!</li>
            <li>I guess it would work better if I had let it dry longer.</li>
            <li>The non-gel stuff really doesn&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li>But for the price of it, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  </li>
            <li>the lines show up very well in this color...</li>
            <li>HIGHLY SUGGEST</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this color</li>
            <li>This was WELL worth my money for both products and again if you have all the right other things needed for a gel mani</li>
            <li>Gel nails and their rapid hardening just spoils you so much that you forget the way it used to be when you did your nails the old fashioned/pioneer way.  </li>
            <li>so I just use that as normal un mag nail polish.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and cost so much less on your site</li>
            <li>The Drawn Together color is a pretty sparkly deep purple.</li>
            <li>and I have to agree completely.  </li>
            <li>This polish was the exact color that I expected.</li>
            <li>I was thankful to the previous reviewer who mentioned that this polish is actually more of a dark purple with a pinkish stripe.  </li>
            <li>The color is a little deceiving but that is another positive!</li>

            <li> Also, to anyone like me who was confused about what the lacquer was for - you don&#x27;t need it to do the gelish polish.  </li>

            <li> I was thankful to the previous reviewer who mentioned that this polish is actually more of a dark purple with a pinkish stripe.  That sold me on trying it and I have to agree completely.  I love the colors.  Also, to anyone like me who was confused about what the lacquer was for - you don&#x27;t need it to do the gelish polish.  It is nice to have if you do need a touch up before re-doing your nails as it is just a regular nail polish, but the only part besides the gelish polish that you really need is the magnet top that comes on the lacquer bottle.</li>
            <li> This polish is even better than I could have ever imagined!!!! The color is a little deceiving but that is another positive! This is much more of a dark purple with the magnetic stripes being a beautiful silver pinkish! I am EXTREMELY impressed with this polish and will order more for sure!!!!!!! HIGHLY SUGGEST - IT&#x27;S WORTH THIS PRICE!!!!</li>
            <li> In.Love.&lt;br /&gt;These mag nails are so fun and it is incredible how they form. The non-gel stuff really doesn&#x27;t work as well so I just use that as normal un mag nail polish. But for the price of it, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  I guess it would work better if I had let it dry longer. Gel nails and their rapid hardening just spoils you so much that you forget the way it used to be when you did your nails the old fashioned/pioneer way.  This product is th&#x27; bomb babies!</li>
            <li> This polish was the exact color that I expected. Beautiful. The magnet came with the polish and it works!!!! I played around with it just to get the hang of it. You can&#x27;t beat This price anywhere. Two bottles for the price of one!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this! Can be worn just as is or use the magnet for design. Color is more like a brown/purple. When you use the magnet it looks accurate to the photo.</li>
            <li> So cool! Looks like I had a pro do my nails!</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE RED BUT IT IS A DARK BROWN. I WISH INSTEAD OF NAMES JUST WRITE ON THE LABEL WHAT COLOR IT IS.  I BUY LOTS OF GEL POLISH (both kinds)BUT NOW I AM HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS.  QUITE A FEW GELS I HAVE PURCHASED ARE NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, COLOR WISE... AND TRANSPARENCY.</li>
            <li> This is such a cool color! The magneto line is superb and this color is great. It is like a deep mauve-purple-ish color. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is a very lovely color and I do like it. However, I have yet to duplicate the design featured in the advertisements for it!</li>
            <li> My magnet doesn&#x27;t make as nice a design but the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> recieved my gelish polish and i love it the color is beautiful and the magnet makes a nice design on my nails. Thank you</li>
            <li> the item came very quickly!!  I will order from this supplier again!!!!  And the color is amazing!!!  it is my favorite so far of the magnetic polishes....  the lines show up very well in this color... but i do hold the magnet over the nail for 15 seconds...</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this color. However I am not a fan of the \\&quot;magnet\\&quot; design. I had my manicurist experiment with it the last time she did my nails - maybe she just didn&#x27;t know how to get the designs to work. But this color does not need a fancy design on the nail. It is sort of a deep purple/shimmery cocoa that looks amazing in the fall and winter months. It is a darker color, but not so dark it looks witchy or goth. Such a classy color and yet so hard to come by! I buy mine off Amazon and horde it for when I go to the salon.</li>
            <li> I had this color done on my second gel mani at the salon.  And I just had to add this color to my collection, it is a beautiful brownish purplish color.  Can use with or without the design.  A must have.  Highly recommend this color</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I bought this, but became disappointed very fast. When I applied it, it looked good, but smudged when it was under UV lamp. I tried it several times and in different ways. Unsure if I was doing it wrong, but I was not happy</li>
            <li> I love this!!  It is super easy to use and looks just like i left the salon!  I will deffinately be trying more colors in this!</li>
            <li> If you have to apply 2 coats of the color, do you use the magnet on both coats or just the top one????</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish! I get the wave look every time and it is so easy to use. Beautiful fall color...somewhere between a brown and purple.</li>
            <li> When I learned of these magnetic polishes I wanted to experiment with them, but they all looked so cool - I couldn&#x27;t decide witch one to buy!! The Drawn Together color is a pretty sparkly deep purple. This color did do well with the magnet. The magnet design is so cool and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get lots of comments. Love it!! This color did need 2 coats to cover to opaque. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This product is great. Easy to use and cost so much less on your site then anywhere I have found.</li>
            <li> This was WELL worth my money for both products and again if you have all the right other things needed for a gel mani it will out just perfectly.  This seems to be a thicker gel polish so I can wear longer than other gel polishes.  I am very hard on my hands, I work all day, ride my bike, wash dishes, wash my hands tons of times and use my nails for a lot of things.  This is one tough polish and I would recommend it!</li>
