            <li>Good polish.</li>
            <li>I got my bottle for about $12, which I think is a good price.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>The color is amazing.</li>
            <li>This  whole collection from Orly was nearly perfect</li>
            <li>Of the polishes I own (about 140), Space Cadet is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>The light shimmer is so gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good as a pretty iridescent top coat, though, and the formula is as good as you expect from Orly.</li>
            <li>I will for sure start getting more nail polish along the lines of this color.</li>
            <li>Holographic polishes are on the top of my list when it comes to doing my nails and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>This color is POW in your face, you are sure to get compliments wearing it.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my nails with this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the color of the nail polish.  </li>
            <li>This color I get so many compliments on..</li>
            <li>This girl is just stunning.  </li>
            <li>Formula just couldn&#x27;t be better.  </li>
            <li>I have a holographic top coat and after a couple of days I decided to see what it looked like holo-fied and boy</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li>I love the effect this product has, but this nail polish is not opaque like the picture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this polish.</li>
            <li>Will buy this brand again for sure.</li>
            <li>wore this color for 6 days with no chips using Orly Top 2 Bottom as the top coat.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the most beautiful colors in my collection.</li>
            <li>The formula is exactly what you&#x27;d expect of Orly polish, very easy to work with!</li>
            <li>Really cool stuff!</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful multichromatic nail polish.  </li>
            <li>The duochrome effect isn&#x27;t as strong as I hoped it was, but still a fantastic color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really long-lasting and the color was so interesting!</li>
            <li>When finished polishing my nails , I saw such great colors in the light.</li>
            <li>Went on smooth and covered well in two coats</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and evenly and took a while to chip.</li>
            <li>It goes with everything and its fun!</li>
            <li>I will be buying another of these since I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Cool polish.</li>
            <li>The top coat picked up on the latent blue and just brought it out even more.  </li>
            <li>On it&#x27;s own, it&#x27;s rather sheer, but the color it builds up to is so worth it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the $10 I paid.</li>
            <li>first, I only used the color alone, applying two coats for amazing results.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped exceptionally quick and was packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>It dries very fast too.</li>
            <li>It sparks, its very shiny, and the color goes great with pale skin!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop staring at my nails :) the only problem I had was that the color was a little more transparent than I thought it would be, so it took 3 coats to get that true bottle color.</li>
            <li>The color play in this polish is just amazing, shifting from a golden bronze, to a rather green shade, back to a purple, depending on the light.</li>
            <li>The shipping was soooooooo fast</li>
            <li>It seems to change colors in different light.  </li>
            <li>It is completely different depending on light and angle.</li>
            <li>not so sure I&#x27;m going to buy the other nailpolishes of this collection,</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on this polish than any other!</li>
            <li>But layering this over ANY color allows this polish to take on a whole new attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You might still find it at your local Ulta for $10 if you are lucky.</li>
            <li>Sheer but very pretty.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to get off</li>
            <li>I bought this color on sale at a local beauty sale and it is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even seen flashes of blue every now and then with the right angle.  </li>
            <li>When layered over warm colors like red and pink, it shows up as a pink or purple glass fleck, and when layered over cooler colors, more of the green shows up.  </li>
            <li>It does take a couple coats to get the dark color but its absolutley worth it!</li>
            <li>, was that an unexpected surprise.  </li>
            <li>I still had all the other colors shifts but after the top coat, the base of bronze became a lovely blurple.  </li>

            <li> It looks like a deep purple color, but is a horrid hot pink with green mixed into it.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly, and with a base and top coat can last over a week with minimal chipping.</li>
            <li> so you need three thin coats for full opacity.</li>
            <li> and I have my nail polish, i  a box wrap in bubble paper, in a bag and other goodies.</li>
            <li> I had to have it sent to my other friends house</li>
            <li> only complaint is the presence of what appears to be glitter (which seems to be the cause  of the duochrome).</li>
            <li> I hate it all the more, but that is just me.  </li>
            <li> It is a sheer teal base with a strong purple/olive green duochrome with a foil finish!</li>
            <li> Lots of color shift - from gold to green to bronze to magenta.  </li>
            <li> Formula is a little runny at times but not that bad.</li>
            <li> Bad decision.  </li>
            <li> Hate it.  </li>

            <li> Such a beautiful multichromatic nail polish.  When layered over warm colors like red and pink, it shows up as a pink or purple glass fleck, and when layered over cooler colors, more of the green shows up.  On it&#x27;s own, it&#x27;s rather sheer, but the color it builds up to is so worth it! This  whole collection from Orly was nearly perfect</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the most beautiful colors in my collection. So different than anything in my collection of nail polishes it&#x27;s worth the $10 I paid. The seller Beauty.com was great! The shipping was soooooooo fast I ordered Dec 28th, it the 30th now and I have my nail polish, i  a box wrap in bubble paper, in a bag and other goodies. Definitely  recommend.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is absolutley beautiful. It sparks, its very shiny, and the color goes great with pale skin! I will for sure start getting more nail polish along the lines of this color. It does take a couple coats to get the dark color but its absolutley worth it! It dries very fast too.</li>
            <li> Holographic polishes are on the top of my list when it comes to doing my nails and this is no exception. Sheer but very pretty. Just do two or three layers. Orlys FX line has some gorgeous shades.</li>
            <li> Good polish. Great size. Formula is a little runny at times but not that bad.</li>
            <li> Of the polishes I own (about 140), Space Cadet is definitely my favorite. It is a sheer teal base with a strong purple/olive green duochrome with a foil finish! Its freaking ace, bro. But it is sheer so you need three thin coats for full opacity. It dries quickly, and with a base and top coat can last over a week with minimal chipping. This color is POW in your face, you are sure to get compliments wearing it. I got my bottle for about $12, which I think is a good price. You might still find it at your local Ulta for $10 if you are lucky.</li>
            <li> The color is amazing. The duochrome effect isn&#x27;t as strong as I hoped it was, but still a fantastic color.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the presence of what appears to be glitter (which seems to be the cause  of the duochrome).</li>

            <li> Really long-lasting and the color was so interesting! I couldn&#x27;t stop staring at my nails :) the only problem I had was that the color was a little more transparent than I thought it would be, so it took 3 coats to get that true bottle color.</li>
            <li> I have used this color over and over again. It has a shimmer and in different lights it changes color, I &#x27;m not so sure I&#x27;m going to buy the other nailpolishes of this collection, but I definitely adore this one!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the color of the nail polish.  It was shipped exceptionally quick and was packaged very well.  Will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This color I get so many compliments on..It goes with everything and its fun! It lasts awhile too! Kind of hard to get off</li>
            <li> It looks like a deep purple color, but is a horrid hot pink with green mixed into it.  Hate it.  I tried to make myself like it.  Bad decision.  I hate it all the more, but that is just me.  Everyone is different.</li>
            <li> Oh, my goodness.  Where to begin.  This girl is just stunning.  Lots of color shift - from gold to green to bronze to magenta.  I&#x27;ve even seen flashes of blue every now and then with the right angle.  Formula just couldn&#x27;t be better.  Went on smooth and covered well in two coats but I did a third, just because.  I have a holographic top coat and after a couple of days I decided to see what it looked like holo-fied and boy, was that an unexpected surprise.  The top coat picked up on the latent blue and just brought it out even more.  I still had all the other colors shifts but after the top coat, the base of bronze became a lovely blurple.  Glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I love the effect this product has, but this nail polish is not opaque like the picture. It&#x27;s good as a pretty iridescent top coat, though, and the formula is as good as you expect from Orly.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy this for a friend and they won&#x27;t deliver to hawaii and they don&#x27;t deliver to po boxes. I had to have it sent to my other friends house so I could grab it and mail it to my friend.</li>
            <li> When finished polishing my nails , I saw such great colors in the light. It&#x27;s name &amp;#34;Space Cadet&amp;#34; fits. You see all of the colors of the planets within this polish., Greens , purples, blues. Just amazing! I will be buying another of these since I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this polish. I had to see what all the hype was about. The color play in this polish is just amazing, shifting from a golden bronze, to a rather green shade, back to a purple, depending on the light. The light shimmer is so gorgeous. I don&#x27;t have anything quite like this, nor have I seen anything like this. The formula is exactly what you&#x27;d expect of Orly polish, very easy to work with!</li>
            <li> Cool polish. Goes on smoothly and evenly and took a while to chip. Will buy this brand again for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this color on sale at a local beauty sale and it is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I only used the color alone, applying two coats for amazing results.  But layering this over ANY color allows this polish to take on a whole new attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this color for 6 days with no chips using Orly Top 2 Bottom as the top coat.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on this polish than any other! It is amazing!!! It is completely different depending on light and angle. sometimes its purple, sometimes copper, somtimes almost grey/green. Really amazing effect!</li>
