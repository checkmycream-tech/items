            <li>My curls are not out of control anymore :)</li>
            <li>I love WEN and this package was just what I needed in the way of the types of items</li>
            <li>This is the latest version</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo for my waist length hair.</li>
            <li>But seller is great and fast</li>
            <li>After, discovering Wen, I am happy to find a cleanser that helps me maintain my natural curly</li>
            <li>I also feel as if my hair feels more damaged than it was originally.  </li>
            <li>Finally a product that is as good as it claims to be!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that I highlight.</li>
            <li>but by far Sweet Almond mint is my favorite because I notice better results from it and my hair and volume is just gorgeous with Sweet Almond mint.</li>
            <li>this shampoo is the best it makes my naturally curly hair soft without tangling or drying it</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Found that the water temperature and the amount of time that I leave the product in my hair makes a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I have never had frizzy hair; it is very fine and straight.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the WEN Sweet Almond Mint kits for years.</li>
            <li>Just bought my second bottle and still loving it.</li>
            <li>You do need to use a lot of this product, but it is worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love how it has my hair feeling soft after</li>
            <li>to say I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try the other products for this package deal however I&#x27;m sure I will love it.</li>
            <li>and I like when I first use it</li>
            <li>I used Wen for 2 years and although it left my hair in better shape than with shampoo - it felt &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>my hair stop shedding with the first use.</li>
            <li>well the first two weeks-</li>
            <li>now hair falling out in large amounts.</li>
            <li>I feel like my hair is so much thicker and shinny.</li>
            <li>but it really works</li>
            <li>Tried the frizz control, it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad</li>
            <li>do continue to straighten my hair but not as much.</li>
            <li>I have hopelessly greasy straight hair.</li>
            <li>Actually, with Wen, I am able to wash and go without being embarrassed about my natural hair looking like a Chia Pet.</li>
            <li>made my hair soft and easy to detangle but left my scalp super dry</li>
            <li>highly recommended for all natural hair types!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using just regular ( much cheaper) conditioners for over a year (no shampoo) and have been so much happier with results.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and it get big.</li>
            <li>I do have less static, and today I am seeing how long I can go without washing my hair before it turns to a grease ball.</li>
            <li>I have bleached blonde, very thin, baby fine hair that breaks easily.</li>
            <li>which I never do with body/bath type of products but with such a high cost, I did.</li>
            <li>but once it starts drying no matter how much moisturizer you use its still dry might use it again</li>
            <li>I think it should be clear during Advertisement that you need to use SO MUCH product for such minimal results.</li>
            <li>My natural hair is similar to songstress, Kelis or actress, Cree Summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have experimented with various shampoos and conditioners but they normally left my natural hair, puffy, dry, and wild looking.</li>
            <li>Knocked the frizz right out of my hair and left me with big and little spiral curls.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, no split or dry ends.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is pleasing, it provides a soft thick look to your hair (and I am pretty</li>

            <li> I bought this because someone gave me a gift card --- I didn&#x27;t want to chance buying this with my own money and being disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My hair is never felt do dry!</li>
            <li> Not sure on the policy either, sent them all back partially used.</li>
            <li> and I have tried other Wen products</li>
            <li> The styling products made it feel even worse, I actually sent it back</li>
            <li> Because of this I hated my natural hair and would often get my hair straighten with flat iron or hot comb.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly, thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> My curly hair types are 3B/3C with a little 4a.</li>
            <li> My hair was limp and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> Was missing a couple items....</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, though, my hair seemed to be dryer than ever and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> So bottom line - just use regular conditioner instead of wasting your money on expensive stuff</li>
            <li> but they all have dry curly hair, so I decided to bite the expensive bullet.</li>
            <li> but I notice it makes my hair hard.</li>
            <li> The directions were confusing.</li>
            <li> What does this mean?</li>
            <li> I am not saying it&#x27;s not a good product it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Not a good choice for me as I had an allergic reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> Be careful, folks. :(</li>
            <li> I found this product too expensive.</li>
            <li> too expensive for the results it gives.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair tangle and break really bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the way that Wen makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li> Great pack to start with</li>
            <li> Wen is the best. I love the fragrance as well as the products.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product once again and I like when I first use it but I notice it makes my hair hard. Once I am done with the product I am not going to purchase it again. I am not saying it&#x27;s not a good product it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have bleached blonde, very thin, baby fine hair that breaks easily. I used Wen for 2 years and although it left my hair in better shape than with shampoo - it felt &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;.  My hair was limp and lifeless.  By accident I used my husband&#x27;s conditioner instead of WEN and found that I prefer the results.  I&#x27;ve been using just regular ( much cheaper) conditioners for over a year (no shampoo) and have been so much happier with results.  (and the savings as well) So bottom line - just use regular conditioner instead of wasting your money on expensive stuff</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that I highlight. I feel like my hair is so much thicker and shinny. I would totally recommend. Just bought my second bottle and still loving it. I look forward to washing my hair as it feels like I am adding nourishment not just cleaning.</li>
            <li> my hair stop shedding with the first use. it is a little pricey but it really works</li>
            <li> Was missing a couple items....</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks and I haven&#x27;t goten the results they say! I have used better hair products for much more les money and love the way my hair feels and looks!</li>
            <li> made my hair soft and easy to detangle but left my scalp super dry</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd year uaing Wen and I have tried other Wen products but by far Sweet Almond mint is my favorite because I notice better results from it and my hair and volume is just gorgeous with Sweet Almond mint.</li>
            <li> I bought this because someone gave me a gift card --- I didn&#x27;t want to chance buying this with my own money and being disappointed.  I found that initially it lived up to the promises of the infomercial.  After a few weeks, though, my hair seemed to be dryer than ever and frizzy.  I have never had frizzy hair; it is very fine and straight.  I also feel as if my hair feels more damaged than it was originally.  I&#x27;m no expert, but my suggestion is save your money -- Suave or Dove works just as well.</li>
            <li> Product came as described and came on time! Very happy with my purchase and I love the product. My curls are not out of control anymore :)</li>
            <li> Great price for Wen, love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair and no soap!</li>
            <li> Shampoo is great, probably did no need the styling aidsbut they will last me a long time. Will order just shampoo in future. Nice to not have to do the auto ship.</li>
            <li> I love WEN and this package was just what I needed in the way of the types of items included.&lt;br /&gt;As always, I&#x27;m looking for the best bang for the buck and this was it!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the WEN Sweet Almond Mint kits for years. This is the latest version and I LOVE IT!!! It&#x27;s like every day is Christmas</li>
            <li> Makes my hair tangle and break really bad.</li>
            <li> Thought this was working well the first two weeks- now hair falling out in large amounts. Clogging drain. Amazon won&#x27;t allow a return or refund money (and I&#x27;m still losing hair after stopping use). Loved Amazin Prime, but canceling. Hairdresser stated that many are losing their hair from Wen?! Be careful, folks. :(</li>
            <li> Love the product.  My hair is soft, no split or dry ends. Found that the water temperature and the amount of time that I leave the product in my hair makes a significant difference.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> You do need to use a lot of this product, but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasing, it provides a soft thick look to your hair (and I am pretty picky).&lt;br /&gt;Worth the buy for me.</li>
            <li> Great product! I am SOLD! Never using anything that lathers again.....highly recommended for all natural hair types!</li>
            <li> It almost came with everything</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved this as a gift</li>
            <li> Not a good choice for me as I had an allergic reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo for my waist length hair. Tried the frizz control, it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad to say I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try the other products for this package deal however I&#x27;m sure I will love it.</li>
            <li> I love it!! works vary well</li>
            <li> Finally a product that is as good as it claims to be! Good value for the dollar. The directions were confusing.</li>
            <li> My curly hair types are 3B/3C with a little 4a. What does this mean? My hair is very curly and it get big. My natural hair is similar to songstress, Kelis or actress, Cree Summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experimented with various shampoos and conditioners but they normally left my natural hair, puffy, dry, and wild looking.

Actually, with Wen, I am able to wash and go without being embarrassed about my natural hair looking like a Chia Pet.</li>
            <li> No major improvement.</li>
            <li> I found this product too expensive. It did not do what it claimed to do. I think it should be clear during Advertisement that you need to use SO MUCH product for such minimal results.</li>
            <li> This kit was $85. My hair is never felt do dry! The styling products made it feel even worse, I actually sent it back which I never do with body/bath type of products but with such a high cost, I did. Not sure on the policy either, sent them all back partially used.</li>
            <li> Bought this kit for my wife at Christmas. She hasn&#x27;t stopped thanking me</li>
            <li> too expensive for the results it gives. Not worth the money. But seller is great and fast</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly, thick, long hair. I didn&#x27;t believe it would work. Love it!!! Knocked the frizz right out of my hair and left me with big and little spiral curls. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything when its dry.. whlie washing it feels great but once it starts drying no matter how much moisturizer you use its still dry might use it again but idk yet...</li>
            <li> Love how it has my hair feeling soft after</li>
            <li> this shampoo is the best it makes my naturally curly hair soft without tangling or drying it</li>
            <li> I have hopelessly greasy straight hair. I cannot go beyond 24 hours between washes. I am currently trying to grow out my hair and admit that I use temporary non peroxide hair coloring on it. I had wanted my sisters to try this product out for me but they all have dry curly hair, so I decided to bite the expensive bullet. So far so good. My hair is still just as shiny. I do have less static, and today I am seeing how long I can go without washing my hair before it turns to a grease ball. I am on 29 hours and still going good. I have only been using this product for four days and am not ready to give it five stars, yet. But if my hair grows out nice and healthy I will update WEN to five stars.</li>
