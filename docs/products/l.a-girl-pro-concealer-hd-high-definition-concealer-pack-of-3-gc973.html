            <li>Overall Love it and will buy again!</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>but I ended up getting 3 of the same shade which ended up being too light for me.</li>
            <li>and I really have to squeeze that product out.</li>
            <li>But other than the packaging I love it</li>

            <li> The picture is extremely deceiving. It looked like I was going to be getting 3 different shades which was great because I didn&#x27;t know which would work for me but I ended up getting 3 of the same shade which ended up being too light for me. Terrible and I can&#x27;t return it. Wont be purchasing from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Product image led me to believe the set would include 3 different shades.  Now I have 3 tubes of the shade &amp;#34;Creamy Beige&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It truly is like the Mac concealer if not better and the price is amazing!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this concealer. I saw it in a YouTube video, got three at a great price here, and LOVE the coverage. Another thing that is great is that it does not cake or dry out your under eyes. Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> it is ok, i still love my maybelline fit me over this one, but it covers and it blends nicely...</li>
            <li> This concealer feels a little thick but thats good! Its full coverage and it lasts all day! It doesn&#x27;t crease on me when i set it with a powder.&lt;br /&gt;3 for $8 ? Now thats a steal ! Specially for such a great product. Unfortunately the packaging sucks and I really have to squeeze that product out. But other than the packaging I love it</li>
            <li> Came darker than I expected but really great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer. It works really well under eyes with a powder on top.</li>
            <li> I did not realize they were going to be all the same color.  Photo is deceiving but then again I need to read the details I guess</li>
            <li> DO NOT BY THEM! I returned the order and they did not refund me anything! Despite they said they would do. They totally sucks!</li>
            <li> LA Girl concealer works well as a highlighter.  I love it&#x27;s consistency and how it works well with my banana powder.</li>
            <li> Picture shows three different types of concealer shades, however it does just send ONE shade. So this package I got three creamy beige tubes. It works wonders! Quick and Easy! Picture I posted is compared to a regular sized lipstick. Hope this helps your shopping! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the big deal is about this concealer. It gets really good reviews on Makeupalley, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Cheap enough to try without feeling bad for hating it. I&#x27;ll stick to Hard Candy Glamoflague concealer. This is OK.</li>
            <li> Great concealer! My complexion is medium and the color I purchased &amp;#34;creamy beige&amp;#34; is perfect for brightening my under eyes. It has the slightest tint of peach which is great for concealing my dark circles. I love the 3 pack. I have one in my purse, one on my makeup vanity and one on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Good deal, color matches perfect</li>
            <li> Awesome Deal! I usually buy my L.A Girl products at the swapmeet or at discount stores but at this price it was a steal! Consistency is creamy and easy to apply! Overall Love it and will buy again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these !!!! I would go to a local swap meet they sell them for like 1.99 !!</li>
            <li> Not what I thought. I  heard a lot of good reviews on this and just wasnt impressed. I got a pack of 3 colors and it was one color, which was too light.</li>
