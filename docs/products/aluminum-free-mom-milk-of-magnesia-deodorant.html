    <ol>
            <li>I have reviewed this before and continue to use this great deodorant!</li>
            <li>The best deodorant even</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been alerted that some ingredients there aren&#x27;t the best for you.</li>
            <li>AWESOME.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found the perfect deodorant until &amp;#34;now&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>Very good product.  </li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>This is a truly great find.</li>
            <li>The product ois great.</li>
            <li>Wish it were even more transparent, but all in all, a wonderful option for those who don&#x27;t want to use chemicals.</li>
            <li>The smell of MOM is not the best but better than body odor.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love this deoderant!</li>
            <li>A great, nontoxic deodorant - fragrance free too.</li>
            <li>This works really, really good and give me peace of mind being aluminum free.</li>
            <li>If it is super hot out I may have to reapply midday, but my armpits are happy &amp; rash-free!</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s over priced and has too many additives.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s allergic is many types do deodorants.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>But I thought i&#x27;d receive more than one.</li>
            <li>I love MOM because it keep my arm pits from stinking.</li>
            <li>Great product that really works.</li>
            <li>My favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I actually love this product.</li>
            <li>The rollerball makes this easy to apply</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different natural deodorants from health food stores, but this is the best I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li>This product effectively works as a daily deodorant while being better for my health since it&#x27;s aluminum free.</li>
            <li>This is a good product especially for people like me</li>
            <li>They claim their product is better because it doesn&#x27;t contain bleach (like Phillips and other name brand MoM products), but their product contains even more preservatives and junk.  </li>
            <li>This one is totally non-toxic and it is actually way more effective.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>I had to reapply twice during the day after the first application in the morning.</li>
            <li>I like it better than using the regular MOM</li>
            <li>I have hot flashes &amp; this doesn&#x27;t stop me from sweating but it does help with the odor.</li>
            <li>All natural and leaves my pits smell free.</li>
            <li>If you are using this product to get away from aluminum and other chemicals or because you are trying to live a more natural lifestyle, just go to the dollar store and buy some good old fashioned, inexpensive Milk of Magnesia.  </li>
            <li>I was shocked at how effective it works, even better than antiperspirants that I used to use many years ago.</li>
            <li>It prevents odor and is not irritating.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY chemical- free deodorant that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>I had tried everything, but this product, it really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve changed brands so many times over the several years, never finding one that worked good and didn&#x27;t leave behind a sticky like residue on my skin.</li>
            <li>It seems to work well, but it does leave white residue on my top if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>On top of that, many other generic brand MoM products have only Milk of Magnesia and water.  </li>
            <li>Helps keep us dry and odor free without the chemicals</li>
            <li>My 3 kids use it everyday and it keeps them smell free even after a day playing in the hot sun.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that unlike the aluminum in other deodorants, the magnesium in this one is a mineral actually used by the body so that I feel comfortable about it being absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li>First of all, I thought I was getting two, but only received one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works for me but not all day or even very long on hot days!</li>
            <li>Still trying to determine but so far no not working</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural option that did not contain any sort of allum__.  </li>
            <li>It far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural deodorant for a while and stumbled upon this.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it leaves white residue even when dried which means I will not be able to wear sleeveless.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical, but hopeful, and I absolutely love this deodorant!</li>
            <li>You can go to Dollar General or Groger and buy 12 oz.</li>
            <li>My review is just generally for Milk of Magnesia as a deodorant</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant I have ever used that worked well.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly effective, but a bit too expensive considering what it is.</li>
            <li>Does take awhile to dry but it works and it is the only natural like deodorant that I I found that works.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s the only deodorant I have found that works and stays dry all day.</li>
            <li> I was using Tom&#x27;s of Maine for a long time</li>
            <li> of regular old generic Milk of Magnesia for half the price (or less!)</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t keep you dry</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry too.</li>
            <li> I see some have complained that it is wet and leaves a white film on clothes (it does wash off), but if you have the time, use a hair dryer and dry your underarm, hey it works!</li>
            <li> This works extremely well for me, although my wife says it doesn&#x27;t work for her.  </li>
            <li> If I use any other deodorants (I&#x27;ve tried it all)</li>
            <li> You do still have a wet sweat underneath your arms!</li>
            <li> and this never lets me down.</li>
            <li> it saves the mess and does help with any odor you may have.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> I work hard and get sweaty in the heat of summer even inside in AC</li>
            <li> unfortunately, I get stinky pit smell immediately with this, worse than with nothing!  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> SO disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does it work? If Milk of Magnesia works for you (as it does for me), yes of course MoM works.  However, it&#x27;s over priced and has too many additives.  You can go to Dollar General or Groger and buy 12 oz. of regular old generic Milk of Magnesia for half the price (or less!) of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See my question/response to the seller about the price. They claim their product is better because it doesn&#x27;t contain bleach (like Phillips and other name brand MoM products), but their product contains even more preservatives and junk.  On top of that, many other generic brand MoM products have only Milk of Magnesia and water.  Nothing else.  Yes, they work just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a case of a pharmaceutical company taking advantage of consumer ignorance and apathy.  If you are using this product to get away from aluminum and other chemicals or because you are trying to live a more natural lifestyle, just go to the dollar store and buy some good old fashioned, inexpensive Milk of Magnesia.  If you want an applicator, Amazon sells roll-on bottles.</li>
            <li> I have reviewed this before and continue to use this great deodorant! I had an underarm rash that just wouldn&#x27;t go away, but after using this for a couple of weeks, the rash was gone and has never come back! I see some have complained that it is wet and leaves a white film on clothes (it does wash off), but if you have the time, use a hair dryer and dry your underarm, hey it works!</li>
            <li> It grabs the hair. Not going to buy again.</li>
            <li> The best deodorant even</li>
            <li> Still trying to determine but so far no not working</li>
            <li> Works great.  My 3 kids use it everyday and it keeps them smell free even after a day playing in the hot sun.  White residue is the only setback.</li>
            <li> My review is just generally for Milk of Magnesia as a deodorant and I imagine using a roll-on would be practical. I think it&#x27;s a bit expensive here, but again, surely practical.</li>
            <li> will try to use it instead of DeodoMom. Don&#x27;t know yet</li>
            <li> This is a good product especially for people like me that&#x27;s allergic is many types do deodorants.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works very well!</li>
            <li> Irritated my armpits.</li>
            <li> It works for me but not all day or even very long on hot days!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural option that did not contain any sort of allum__.  I was a bit skeptical, but hopeful, and I absolutely love this deodorant! It far exceeded my expectations.  Lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li> Love this! Wish it were even more transparent, but all in all, a wonderful option for those who don&#x27;t want to use chemicals. Truly works.</li>
            <li> Had to be reapplied 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and lasts all day. I work hard and get sweaty in the heat of summer even inside in AC and this never lets me down. I have bought my second already as I apply it liberally.</li>
            <li> I had to reapply twice during the day after the first application in the morning. I felt like I was just a teeny bit funky by the end of the day. Now I only use it during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Does take awhile to dry but it works and it is the only natural like deodorant that I I found that works.</li>
            <li> This works extremely well for me, although my wife says it doesn&#x27;t work for her.  I follow a relatively low protein diet and thus am often low on iron, but those two factors tend to reduce my under-arm odor.  Anyway, a shower in the morning followed by a generous application of this deodorant gives me confidence for the sweatiest of tasks.  I&#x27;m about to place my 3rd order.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant I have ever used that worked well. It prevents odor and is not irritating. I like the fact that unlike the aluminum in other deodorants, the magnesium in this one is a mineral actually used by the body so that I feel comfortable about it being absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY chemical- free deodorant that has worked for me. I&#x27;ve been to several natural/health food stores and tried them all. It lasts up until I wake up the next morning. This is a truly great find.</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s the only deodorant I have found that works and stays dry all day.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant. I was using Tom&#x27;s of Maine for a long time but I&#x27;ve been alerted that some ingredients there aren&#x27;t the best for you. This one is totally non-toxic and it is actually way more effective. I was shocked at how effective it works, even better than antiperspirants that I used to use many years ago. Try it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The product ois great. But I thought i&#x27;d receive more than one. Felt deceived!!</li>
            <li> It seems to work well, but it does leave white residue on my top if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly effective, but a bit too expensive considering what it is.</li>
            <li> I love MOM because it keep my arm pits from stinking. It won&#x27;t keep you dry but that&#x27;s a small price to pay. If I use any other deodorants (I&#x27;ve tried it all) I get a severe rash but not with MOM.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural deodorant for a while and stumbled upon this. Great product that really works. I&#x27;ve had no skin irritation to it and it&#x27;s got no smell.</li>
            <li> AWESOME.  It keeps me dry too.</li>
            <li> The rollerball makes this easy to apply</li>
            <li> My favorite.  I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.  Keeps smell away and my holistic doctor approved!</li>
            <li> Does not have aluminum and you have now smell!!!  You do still have a wet sweat underneath your arms!</li>
            <li> This product effectively works as a daily deodorant while being better for my health since it&#x27;s aluminum free.</li>
            <li> First of all, I thought I was getting two, but only received one.&lt;br /&gt;And unfortunately, I get stinky pit smell immediately with this, worse than with nothing!  SO disappointed!</li>
            <li> A great, nontoxic deodorant - fragrance free too.</li>
            <li> I like it better than using the regular MOM it saves the mess and does help with any odor you may have. The smell of MOM is not the best but better than body odor.</li>
            <li> I continuously recommended this product to any one who has problems with body odor. I had tried everything, but this product, it really works. I have purchased for family members that are having problems with underarm odor. Now this is the only underarm product.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Helps keep us dry and odor free without the chemicals</li>
            <li> Love this deoderant! After trying multiple &#x27;natural&#x27; products that all led to angry rashes &amp; itching, this is a breath of fresh air. I have hot flashes &amp; this doesn&#x27;t stop me from sweating but it does help with the odor. If it is super hot out I may have to reapply midday, but my armpits are happy &amp; rash-free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found the perfect deodorant until &amp;#34;now&amp;#34;! I&#x27;ve changed brands so many times over the several years, never finding one that worked good and didn&#x27;t leave behind a sticky like residue on my skin. This works really, really good and give me peace of mind being aluminum free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different natural deodorants from health food stores, but this is the best I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li> I actually love this product. All natural and leaves my pits smell free. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it leaves white residue even when dried which means I will not be able to wear sleeveless. Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
