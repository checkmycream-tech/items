            <li>I would hv loved to return it</li>
            <li>This powder was described as a translucent powder in another review, so I figured it would be good to set my BB cream and eliminate the shine.</li>

            <li>Gotta love maybelline!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>Love the Maybelline Dream Matte Powder!</li>
            <li>I love this matte powder it works wonders!</li>
            <li>this will work pretty well for you, however you do have to touch up once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder puff that comes with this isn&#x27;t very good</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good packaging and great price.</li>
            <li>Its very light going on and maybe that&#x27;s why.</li>
            <li>Also I love the case and</li>
            <li>Not my favorite</li>
            <li>but you can do better for a better price.</li>
            <li>Always love maybelline.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite drugstore powder for quite a while, however it has been discontinued</li>
            <li>so I ordered it online and got just what I wanted :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>i have been using this product for more than a year now and it has not caused skin irritation.</li>
            <li>free to ask any questions regarding the product or my review and leave me feedback !&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>The color looked okay</li>
            <li>Favorite powder.</li>
            <li>It is high quality product, and the price and quality ratio contained in the product is great.</li>
            <li>this is a great powder, I wear it with the dream matte mouse, in the same shade, and it covers very well, looks very good</li>
            <li>I have  used this shade for a long time and have been very happy with the color that I chose.</li>
            <li>The powder feels like it just sits on top of skin, you can clearly make out that you&#x27;re wearing foundation but not in good way.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute FAVORITE powder!</li>
            <li>Very good powder that keeps my face feeling fresh and lookinh nice even when it is too hot outside.</li>
            <li>I like how it glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t look cakey at all.</li>
            <li>It also rubs off on your light colored clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Feel</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth and oil free and still feels lightweight.</li>
            <li>Good price, I was surprised I received two</li>
            <li>Medium coverage, doesn&#x27;t make your face look cakey, stays on for most of the day, overall a better product than its high-end counterparts!</li>
            <li>I was looking for foundation, not powder and this ad originally had a photo of &#x27;foundation&#x27; which is what I ordered.</li>
            <li>, feels great on my skin, Is not cakey, does not break out my sensitive skin, and stays on all day, I do touch up some but not often, and I don&#x27;t have to add much unless ive worn it all day</li>
            <li>but when I do use it,on nights out or special occasions it does not cake or</li>
            <li>It looks natural and has a nice finish to it.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this if you are looking for a full coverage makeup.</li>
            <li>Its a good local store brand.</li>
            <li>And the Dream Wonder does not do a good job of soaking up facial oil.</li>
            <li>VERY fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Never a disappointment when I buy Maybelline.</li>
            <li>Have searched high and low for a good matte-ifying powder, as I have combination/oily skin, and this one takes the cake.</li>
            <li>Stick with the Milani multitask face powder, it&#x27;s great and way better quality for similar or less price.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that this product performs pretty well in comparison in terms of the product&#x27;s smoothness and overall function.</li>
            <li>and she really likes this one for great covering up her little bumps</li>
            <li>Other than it being abit too light for me, it does indeed go on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>and I plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I actually bought too light a color, but CVS took it as an exchange, no problem!</li>
            <li>At first i thought it was bc</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and I love using it and seeing instant results.</li>
            <li>Really good for my sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend giving it a try to set foundation or alone to eliminate shine for people with more oily skin (mine is dry, but the BB cream makes it shiny). :)</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Leaves your face cakey, and although it says it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, it certainly felt like it.</li>
            <li>A bit more expensive but way better quality!</li>
            <li>My rate is a one star simply because I did not feel comfortable with it</li>
            <li>so the color choice didn&#x27;t really matter for me.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>First of all, I could not find an exact match for the Medium Beige I used in the Dream Matte powder, so I tried the Natural Beige.</li>
            <li>I have dry, fair skin, but needed a powder to eliminate the shine from a new BB cream I recently started using.</li>
            <li>It works better than the other face powders I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>so I usually just throw it away and use this product with a kabuki brush to get a nice finish.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and ever since I&#x27;ve been using this, my face remains less oily for most of the day.</li>
            <li>So sad its discontinued but happy</li>
            <li>I took away one star, because if I use the puff to apply it, it would likely be too chalky or talc-ish on my skin, but I have solved that problem by swirling it in sparingly on a large powder brush then just dabbing it gently on my face (rather than swiping or using a buffing motion).</li>
            <li>it was new but</li>
            <li>I sent an inquiry and they re-ordered the exact same powder and not foundation.</li>
            <li>but Im glad I at least gave it a try.</li>
            <li>My skin gets oily throughout the day and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that really does provide a matte finish.</li>
            <li>But unfortunately this one from this seller isnt as good as the ones i have been buying from CVS.This</li>
            <li>It lasts long and controls my shine since I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>This serves that purpose well for me, and it is very reasonably priced in comparison to other drug store brands.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I have used powders from higher end makeup companies such as Merle Norman, Lancome,and a few others-</li>

            <li> I ordered 3 of the Dream Matte powder, and hopefully it will last me long enough for Maybelline to come to their senses and bring it back into production.</li>
            <li> The color was a little too dark but that is my fault for not picking the right color.</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup as a trial, but the super light creamy base that feels like powder going on but covers with a powder finish.</li>
            <li> Ive been a long time covergirl product girl but decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I like the coverage it provides and it stays on for a long time  </li>
            <li> performs way better than the very expensive Makeup Forever matte powder</li>
            <li> , It isn&#x27;t bad, I have olive skin and oily, its ok</li>
            <li> It keeps my face matte a lot longer compared to other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have jet to use my other ones.</li>
            <li> I do have to blot on occasion, but a lot less compared to when I was using Neutragena, Almay, or L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second container of this so needless to say the product does the job.</li>
            <li> Then I worked really hard, for 18 months, and lost 130 lbs.</li>
            <li> It covers very nicely , is not  greasy on my face.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 7 and one of them was cracked and broken.  </li>
            <li> I tried their new Dream Wonder powder and I hated it!</li>
            <li> Generally,i have been using this for 5years now as a casual powder for here and there.</li>
            <li> I have never been a makeup type of woman; as an obese, unhappy 30 something, I didn&#x27;t see how a bit of war paint could help.</li>
            <li> Made me look fake in the face, I don&#x27;t like the texture and the smell is awful, yuk!</li>
            <li> If you have bad acne, this is no BUENO!</li>
            <li> Awful color and application</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product was recommended to me by my daughter-in-law.  It covers very nicely , is not  greasy on my face.  It looks natural and has a nice finish to it.  I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite drugstore powder for quite a while, however it has been discontinued where I currently live.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to search for another dupe for this so I ordered it online and got just what I wanted :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really great for just matifying and setting your makeup. I wouldn&#x27;t use this if you are looking for a full coverage makeup. The color coverage is really sheer so the color choice didn&#x27;t really matter for me. Again, the purpose of this powder is just to set and control your oil. If you have combination or oily skin this will work pretty well for you, however you do have to touch up once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder puff that comes with this isn&#x27;t very good so I usually just throw it away and use this product with a kabuki brush to get a nice finish.</li>
            <li> Awful color and application</li>
            <li> I have never been a makeup type of woman; as an obese, unhappy 30 something, I didn&#x27;t see how a bit of war paint could help. Then I worked really hard, for 18 months, and lost 130 lbs. I bought this makeup as a trial, but the super light creamy base that feels like powder going on but covers with a powder finish. I actually bought too light a color, but CVS took it as an exchange, no problem! Now it&#x27;s my favorite!!</li>
            <li> Love the Maybelline Dream Matte Powder! Have searched high and low for a good matte-ifying powder, as I have combination/oily skin, and this one takes the cake. Medium coverage, doesn&#x27;t make your face look cakey, stays on for most of the day, overall a better product than its high-end counterparts!</li>
            <li> This makeup is so creamy and the shade matches perfectly. It lasts all day and smooths the color and texture of my face beautifully</li>
            <li> Like the product. Really good for my sensitive and dry skin. Good color and coverage for my complexion. Will buy from with confidence.</li>
            <li> stocking stuffer for my daughter she&#x27;s experimenting with make up and she really likes this one for great covering up her little bumps</li>
            <li> Love it. I feel like it gives a finished blended look to my make up application.  Good price, I was surprised I received two, I thought that was the price for one.</li>
            <li> Just got my order came within 4 days !!! Thanks so much! Love it</li>
            <li> Omg I&#x27;m so happy amazon has this online ...I was heartbroken when I went in to my local walmart,and walgreens, and ect. To find that it was discontinued..but now I can have it once again..yay!....my hg powder!</li>
            <li> I was looking for foundation, not powder and this ad originally had a photo of &#x27;foundation&#x27; which is what I ordered. When I received it, it was powder. I sent an inquiry and they re-ordered the exact same powder and not foundation. They have finally corrected the photo and it&#x27;s now powder. It was just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Generally,i have been using this for 5years now as a casual powder for here and there.Its a good local store brand. But unfortunately this one from this seller isnt as good as the ones i have been buying from CVS.This dosent go well and feels like chalk on my face also its not the same color as the one from CVS.This one is lighter even though its exactly same color code.At first i thought it was bc it was new but with time i still had same complains.I would hv loved to return it but i guess the return period is over.I will not buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> performs way better than the very expensive Makeup Forever matte powder</li>
            <li> This is my absolute FAVORITE powder! It lasts long and controls my shine since I have very oily skin. I will contiue to buy from this seller. VERY fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and this product works wonders! I get compliments from my friends a lot saying how I&#x27;m not as shiny as I use to be. I use Skin79 BB creme and the Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse as my foundation and use this powder to set it. It keeps my face matte a lot longer compared to other products I&#x27;ve used. I do have to blot on occasion, but a lot less compared to when I was using Neutragena, Almay, or L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> Ive been a long time covergirl product girl but decided to give this a try. I dont feel as if it gives enough coverage. Its very light going on and maybe that&#x27;s why. It just doesnt feel like I have any powder on. I wont be buying this again but Im glad I at least gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. I have oily skin and ever since I&#x27;ve been using this, my face remains less oily for most of the day. i have been using this product for more than a year now and it has not caused skin irritation. Great product!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this product. I tried it to just mattify my skin when it gets oily. The powder feels like it just sits on top of skin, you can clearly make out that you&#x27;re wearing foundation but not in good way. It also rubs off on your light colored clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask any questions regarding the product or my review and leave me feedback !&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchase. Fast shipping, good packaging and great price. I love it I also recommend that if your looking for this type of item, buy it with confidence. Thank you</li>
            <li> I love this matte powder it works wonders!</li>
            <li> I have been using this powder for years. I am upset with Maybelline for discontinuing it. I tried their new Dream Wonder powder and I hated it! First of all, I could not find an exact match for the Medium Beige I used in the Dream Matte powder, so I tried the Natural Beige. The color looked okay but when I went to reapply it, it looked like I had taken dirt powder and rubbed it on my face! Yikes! And the Dream Wonder does not do a good job of soaking up facial oil. I ordered 3 of the Dream Matte powder, and hopefully it will last me long enough for Maybelline to come to their senses and bring it back into production.</li>
            <li> My skin gets oily throughout the day and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that really does provide a matte finish. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years and I love using it and seeing instant results. My skin looks smooth and oil free and still feels lightweight. Item arrived on time, powder intact/unbroken and sealed in manufacturer&#x27;s packaging. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I ordered 7 and one of them was cracked and broken.  The package looked like was opened and retaped.  I have jet to use my other ones.</li>
            <li> I have  used this shade for a long time and have been very happy with the color that I chose.</li>
            <li> Other than it being abit too light for me, it does indeed go on very smoothly. Will get a darker shade next time.</li>
            <li> I like the coverage it provides and it stays on for a long time  It works better than the other face powders I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> this is a great powder, I wear it with the dream matte mouse, in the same shade, and it covers very well, looks very good, feels great on my skin, Is not cakey, does not break out my sensitive skin, and stays on all day, I do touch up some but not often, and I don&#x27;t have to add much unless ive worn it all day and im also going out at night as well, but just a touch up and it last all night as well! I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Favorite powder. So sad its discontinued but happy I found it here!</li>
            <li> My favorite powder!!  Helps with the oil and shine..</li>
            <li> I have dry, fair skin, but needed a powder to eliminate the shine from a new BB cream I recently started using. I bought this powder because I had tried the maybelline dream matte foundation years ago and remember liking that product. This powder was described as a translucent powder in another review, so I figured it would be good to set my BB cream and eliminate the shine. This serves that purpose well for me, and it is very reasonably priced in comparison to other drug store brands. Additionally, I have used powders from higher end makeup companies such as Merle Norman, Lancome,and a few others- and I can honestly say that this product performs pretty well in comparison in terms of the product&#x27;s smoothness and overall function. I will likely continue to purchase this to set my BB cream in the future. I took away one star, because if I use the puff to apply it, it would likely be too chalky or talc-ish on my skin, but I have solved that problem by swirling it in sparingly on a large powder brush then just dabbing it gently on my face (rather than swiping or using a buffing motion). I would definitely recommend giving it a try to set foundation or alone to eliminate shine for people with more oily skin (mine is dry, but the BB cream makes it shiny). :)</li>
            <li> I like this company&#x27;s product. It is high quality product, and the price and quality ratio contained in the product is great. I like it</li>
