            <li>Good Items to be used for many cleaning uses.  </li>
            <li>The swabs do come in 2 separate packages which makes it nice for storing away.</li>
            <li>Nice kit.</li>
            <li>It was a good Idea to give more length to a Q Tip.  </li>
            <li>These are good, cheap swabs.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit exactly as described a plus by me thank you</li>
            <li>this item is a good choice for cleanings guns part, specially inside the pistol for example, and can use for lubricant</li>
            <li>Better offer( more q-tips + brush), than most retail stores even w/ s &amp; h fee.</li>
            <li>More, variety in firearm cleaning kits/ supplies &amp; prices @</li>
            <li>And, I am sure that eventually I&#x27;ll have occasion to use the brass bush for something.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many swabs are included in this kit</li>
            <li>This swabs are ok for there purpose</li>
            <li>If you really want to get into corners, perhaps they are not the best, but they are good enough for my use.</li>
            <li>I use them to clean the heads on cd players, but can be use to clean or apply solutions to many things.</li>
            <li>Perfect for cleaning those hard to get at places on those precious pieces in your gun cabnet.  </li>
            <li>The price is cheap and so is the product.</li>
            <li>great buy just what i was looking for looking forward to buying more down the road</li>
            <li>It gave me all of what I was looking for to clean my pistols.</li>
            <li>These swabs are nothing special.</li>
            <li>Good value but too short for our intended use.</li>
            <li>But I guess for the price, it&#x27;s not a bad investment.</li>
            <li>Not the easiest to find locally,  Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I bought them to clean guns, but they break right away.</li>
            <li>The dual head brush could come in handy if you had the proper application for it.</li>
            <li>This pack was just right.</li>
            <li>They also have a nice, long reach</li>
            <li>They have a good reach and the cotton on the head of the swab is wound tightly.  </li>
            <li>Good tools for getting in those tight places cleaning your firearms</li>
            <li>Item came very, fast; &amp;#34;is</li>
            <li>Worked great in reaching those hard to reach spots in my firearms.  </li>
            <li>The swabs sure beat using regular Q-tips, which leave fuzz all over the place!  </li>
            <li>She has very large ears that are like antenna in that they stand straight up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m restoring vintage audio equipment and these items complete my requirements for having the right tools to do the right job.  </li>
            <li>The  extra long cotton swabs are excellent for getting solvent into the nooks and crannies of an automatic, the combination  brush gives the option for a tough residue with the brass, or a more gentle with the nyon bristles.</li>
            <li>It is  good for getting the hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>Though I might not be inclined to use the brass bristled bush on my blued firearms, the nylon bristle side of the brush works very well.  </li>
            <li>Cant apply much pressure.</li>
            <li>I like the hardness of the wood on the swabs, really comes in handy on those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>the brush is a little cheap but for the price I can&#x27;t complain, thanks!</li>
            <li>These are really nice for getting into hard to reach placing for cleaning and lubrication.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a must when cleaning your weapons the right way.</li>
            <li>Glad I found the same cotton swabs I used in the military.</li>
            <li>The swabs seemed to break easily after a few minutes of use.  </li>
            <li>the dual head Nylon/ Brass is not very good quatily , but for the price its Ok to me.</li>
            <li>Reasonable quality, get the job done, the cotton ball doesn&#x27;t come loose, would buy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other wooden swabs from Amazon that were much stronger.  </li>
            <li>I like that they are wooden too so that I can whittle down the end without the swab to make a sharp pick to clean crud out of crevices.</li>
            <li>so it makes it much easier to clean out my rifle bolts and other hard to reach places!</li>
            <li>I used q-tips, but felt that they were not long enough and wanted to use something similar rather than a rod with something attached to it.</li>

            <li> the only complaint is that they seem to break more then other swabs that i have used in the past.</li>

            <li> I should have gone to Walmart instead and gotten twice the amount for less.</li>
            <li> Use these long, cotton swabs when cleaning gun barrels, but could be used for anything that needs the longer swabs to get into hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t little particles being left behind to attract oil and dirt in my pistols.  </li>
            <li> I am heavy handed</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than elsewhere, but work just as well.</li>
            <li> Big open ears plus a dog loves to roll around in the grass and dirt equals very disgusting ears.</li>
            <li> That is useless also.  </li>
            <li> These are almost impossible to find and I could not find them at Walmart, Target, Krogers, or CVS pharmacy.</li>

            <li> Use these long, cotton swabs when cleaning gun barrels, but could be used for anything that needs the longer swabs to get into hard to reach places.  Much less expensive than elsewhere, but work just as well. (including delivery). Not the easiest to find locally,  Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I like these swabs.  They have a good reach and the cotton on the head of the swab is wound tightly.  There aren&#x27;t little particles being left behind to attract oil and dirt in my pistols.  The sticks aren&#x27;t unbreakable, but they are sturdy enough for cleaning.  If you really want to get into corners, perhaps they are not the best, but they are good enough for my use.</li>
            <li> These are good, cheap swabs. The only thing I would like better, for cleaning a variety of complex  parts, is if they were on stiff paper sticks, or something else a little bit flexible. The brush is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> These swabs are only six inches in length...not 7.8 as listed.  Good value but too short for our intended use.</li>
            <li> Good tools for getting in those tight places cleaning your firearms</li>
            <li> These are really nice for getting into hard to reach placing for cleaning and lubrication.  I like that they are wooden too so that I can whittle down the end without the swab to make a sharp pick to clean crud out of crevices.</li>
            <li> Got the product. All the items are there and as described. I used q-tips, but felt that they were not long enough and wanted to use something similar rather than a rod with something attached to it. This is great and the brush is a perfect addition.</li>
            <li> I am not really sure that I can come up with a lot of praise for Q-tips on a longer wooden stick.  But, I will try.</li>
            <li> do the job but will not last long! the dual head Nylon/ Brass is not very good quatily , but for the price its Ok to me.</li>

            <li> Good price, just what I needed. Better offer( more q-tips + brush), than most retail stores even w/ s &amp; h fee. More, variety in firearm cleaning kits/ supplies &amp; prices @ Amazon(done my homework). Item came very, fast; &amp;#34;is what it is.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great combination of tools for firearms.  The swabs are extremely handy in my experience in using them.  Though I might not be inclined to use the brass bristled bush on my blued firearms, the nylon bristle side of the brush works very well.  And, I am sure that eventually I&#x27;ll have occasion to use the brass bush for something.</li>
            <li> Good Items to be used for many cleaning uses.  I use them to clean the heads on cd players, but can be use to clean or apply solutions to many things.</li>
            <li> Good item.  Would recommend for ammo storage.  Very good cans.  Will buy again. I will tell others about it.  Good</li>
            <li> Worked great in reaching those hard to reach spots in my firearms.  The swabs seemed to break easily after a few minutes of use.  I am heavy handed so I don&#x27;t know if it was because of me or that the swab stems were on the brittle side.  The brush worked ad one would expect.</li>
            <li> this item is a good choice for cleanings guns part, specially inside the pistol for example, and can use for lubricant</li>
            <li> Great price, good sturdy cotton swabs.  Works great for cleaning my firearms.  Brush was a great addition.  Will order again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy but I really bought the cleaning set just for the long cotton swabs! My Vet uses this type of swab to clean around all the little grooves &amp; dirt hiding spots in my little Toy Fox Terrier&#x27;s ears! She has very large ears that are like antenna in that they stand straight up and she listens and turns them towards the noise. Big open ears plus a dog loves to roll around in the grass and dirt equals very disgusting ears. Yucko! I&#x27;ve searched all over including Medical Supply stores &amp; can&#x27;t find them! I don&#x27;t know how many swabs are included in this kit but it&#x27;s a lot and they work great!!</li>
            <li> This swabs are ok for there purpose the brush is a little cheap but for the price I can&#x27;t complain, thanks!</li>
            <li> These swabs are nothing special. Just swabs. I should have gone to Walmart instead and gotten twice the amount for less. The included brush is also so-so. The nylon side is ok, but the brass brush is very weak with thin bristles. But I guess for the price, it&#x27;s not a bad investment.</li>
            <li> I bought them to clean guns, but they break right away. Cant apply much pressure. The price is cheap and so is the product.</li>
            <li> not too fragile - been using them for cleaning weapons / applying grease. not &#x27;fuzzy&#x27; and do not leave fibers everywhere. good choice.</li>
            <li> This pack was just right. It gave me all of what I was looking for to clean my pistols. It is a must have for cleaning pistols.</li>
            <li> great buy just what i was looking for looking forward to buying more down the road thank you&lt;br /&gt;ricky smith</li>
            <li> I like the hardness of the wood on the swabs, really comes in handy on those hard to reach places. The dual head brush could come in handy if you had the proper application for it. The swabs do come in 2 separate packages which makes it nice for storing away. I have went through one pack and will soon be ordering this again and giving the extra brush away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other wooden swabs from Amazon that were much stronger.  These break like tooth picks.  I will use them up but won&#x27;t purchase it again.  The brush is what hooked me into this purchase.  That is useless also.  The double sided head is too big to get into areas on an AR that you would need a wire brush.</li>
            <li> The  extra long cotton swabs are excellent for getting solvent into the nooks and crannies of an automatic, the combination  brush gives the option for a tough residue with the brass, or a more gentle with the nyon bristles. A good value and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit exactly as described a plus by me thank you</li>
            <li> Just as written up.  Nice kit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cotton on a stick ... come on ... does realy need a review? and I have to write six more words for this review!</li>
            <li> It is  good for getting the hard to reach areas.  It was a good Idea to give more length to a Q Tip.  Form fits Function quite well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for cleaning those hard to get at places on those precious pieces in your gun cabnet.  Keep a supply on hand.</li>
            <li> ... so they work as cotton swabs. Reasonable quality, get the job done, the cotton ball doesn&#x27;t come loose, would buy again.</li>
            <li> good for using on weapons cleaning.  I use these to help with cleaning my weapons.  a good buy and a good product.</li>
            <li> these swabs are good and get the job done.  the only complaint is that they seem to break more then other swabs that i have used in the past. but otherwise good product. i would buy again.</li>
