            <li> I have fine, thin hair, and it spikes my hair, or just gives it volume</li>
            <li> So many do nothing or are too thick and make your hair too stiff.</li>
            <li> I have used this producdt for a long time.  </li>
            <li> And this doesnt dry out your hair..</li>
            <li> Down to the product packaging was not the same.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product used to be very firm and my hair tends to crimp for a long time but with this one nah.</li>
            <li> Been using t for a few years now...</li>
            <li> The Gel was too thin , I have short spiky hair</li>
            <li> Gives my hair body, but doesn&#x27;t make it stiff.  </li>
            <li> Very stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little less expensive on Amazon; therefore, I purchased it for him</li>
            <li> Vavoom holds my hair without sticky or dull effects.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> Wish they still sold the liter bottle, but at least they didn&#x27;t discontinue the product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with thick partly curly hair for softness and smoothness&lt;</li>
            <li> Not too heavy and holds well!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and home Amazon takes the necessary steps to assure customers receive products as advertised.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product once it arrived at home.  </li>

            <li> Very disappointed with this product once it arrived at home.  I have been searching for this product as Matrix stopped producing it.  I still have some of the original product but i was hoping to store-up with a few more bottles.  Once the product arrived it was very clear and evident this was not the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; product.  The consistency, smell and performance of the gel was not the same.  Down to the product packaging was not the same.  Very disappointed and home Amazon takes the necessary steps to assure customers receive products as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love this gel. I&#x27;ve used it for years. When I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the beauty supply stores, I searched the web and found it.</li>
            <li> Great price and works great!</li>

            <li> I had a small amount of the original product left. This stuff smells quite different. The smell is enough to keep me from buying it again.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  I have fine, thin hair, and it spikes my hair, or just gives it volume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many gels and this works best on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, works okay, but don&#x27;t get too attached: it&#x27;s discontinued! :(</li>

            <li> I have used this for years and now can only find it on Amazon.  Holds hair, but when you touch it, or brush it the softness is very nice.</li>
            <li> This product adds body to your hair without stiffness.  It is easy to apply, and you only use a small amount (about the size of a quarter).  Also it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a drying effect on your hair.  Works very well on fine hair.</li>
