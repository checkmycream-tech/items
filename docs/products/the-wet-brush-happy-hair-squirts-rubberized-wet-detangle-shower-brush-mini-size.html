            <li>Pattern is really cute</li>
            <li>and I like more defined curls,</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than ripping through hair with another brush.  </li>
            <li>Gets right through the tangles without damage - love it!</li>
            <li>I bought the larger one and loved it, so I bought this smaller one, and it&#x27;s just as great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best when hair is wet because, in my opinion, it gives curls more of a puffy finish (at first)</li>

            <li>Easy to comb out wet hair - this is by far the best brush I use in the shower to brush the conditioner through my hair.  </li>
            <li>Wet Brush are great.</li>
            <li>Great for wet tangly hair.</li>
            <li>We have the full size and travel size.  </li>
            <li>I love the wet brush - I now own three.</li>
            <li>Overall a great brush, and if you deal with tears during hair brushing with kids, I would highly recommend trying it.  </li>
            <li>What IS nice about it is that I can use it at night during bath and the next morning</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s still nice the next morning so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size and does what the main wet brush does - detangle my hair without breaking the strands or causing pain.</li>
            <li>This product did not work,there r several cheaper versions that work better also</li>
            <li>This brush has helped so much!</li>
            <li>SO MUCH EASIER!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been using the large one for myself.</li>
            <li>The girls really like it</li>
            <li>They comb through long hair so easily.</li>
            <li>If you have a little one with long hair, this is a good brush for after bath time.</li>
            <li>Bristles are a bit soft and take a little more time to brush the hair and remove knots.</li>
            <li>Was hoping to get a smaller one to keep in my curly headed daughters diaper back for quick fixes out of the carseat.</li>
            <li>This is the only brush that gets through the snarls without too much work.  </li>
            <li>the seller sent me an old piece.</li>
            <li>I love my old bigger wet brush and decided to buy a smaller one that fits in my purse.  </li>
            <li>Works wonders on my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I heard about this brush from my sister in law after stating how my two year old fought me tooth and nail when it was time to brush her hair.</li>
            <li>just hand-pick/hand-brush my childs hair because it makes it so soft and untangled</li>
            <li>She still doesn&#x27;t like to sit still to brush her hair, but that&#x27;s only because she is a busy body!</li>
            <li>Tried one of the imitation combs but it was junk, so I decided to get the real thing.</li>
            <li>Makes brushing through her wet or dry hair so much easier and leaves it feeling softer.</li>
            <li>She has thick wavy hair and this brush makes brushing her hair so easy and painless; wet or dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I removed 1 star since the colors of the brush are actually quite dull, giving it the look of a dirty or really old brush, and I thought they would be brighter and more fun.</li>

            <li> Such a fan of the wet brush.</li>
            <li> I only wish it was a little bigger head.  </li>
            <li> when using on dry hair</li>
            <li> not vibrant color was what it is in the picture.</li>
            <li> it has gotten better and didn&#x27;t cause any issues other than being slightly unpleasant when I opened the box.  </li>

            <li> My daughter hated her hair brushed before.  </li>
            <li> but brush is awkward to hold because of the shape and size.</li>
            <li> but it still looks dirty</li>
            <li> even if you had to use another brush, it isn&#x27;t quite so bad because this one sort of preps the hair.  </li>

            <li> Works so well with my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> The kids took my other brush so I got them this one.  They love this one a lot. I only wish it was a little bigger head.  It feels like a My Little Pony sized brush.  The girls really like it so it stays</li>
            <li> Wet Brush are great. You must try.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, fine hair that tangles if you look at it the wrong way.  This is the only brush that gets through the snarls without too much work.  The small size is perfect for her school backpack.</li>
            <li> I never received the child size one so I&#x27;ve been using the large one for myself. I ended up buying one for my daughter elsewhere. I&#x27;ve liked it for myself</li>
            <li> The girl would like it.</li>
            <li> Reeks of chemical smell unlike my Wet Brush purchased at a store. IT could be the coating but I am not sure. Returned.</li>
            <li> Best thing since sliced bread!!! I have tried detangling sprays and creams, still pulled out my hair (literally). This brush glides thru my wet hair. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This product did not work,there r several cheaper versions that work better also the seller sent me an old piece.</li>
            <li> Love it. Small, travel version of the bigger one. Very pleased. Works well!</li>
            <li> Great for wet tangly hair. If you have a little one with long hair, this is a good brush for after bath time. Doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt as much as other brushes.</li>
            <li> Best investment for my kiddo I have made in a while. I didn&#x27;t realize how well this brush worked at detangling until I tried to use a different brush. I even bought a larger paddle Wet Brush for myself. She and I love this brush and it saves us so many tears in the morning when I try to do her hair.</li>
            <li> Pattern is really cute but brush is awkward to hold because of the shape and size.</li>
            <li> Im in love with this!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for adults and children in painlessly removing tangles.  I have one for home, one for my travel bag, and this colorful one for my granddaughter who has long beautiful hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to ever have to do without this brush!</li>
            <li> Easy to comb out wet hair - this is by far the best brush I use in the shower to brush the conditioner through my hair.  Minimal breakage and also bought another one to use just to brush out wet hair.  Gets right through the tangles without damage - love it!</li>

            <li> I love my old bigger wet brush and decided to buy a smaller one that fits in my purse.  When i opened the packaging I was surprised when the design on the brush looks so dirty.  I was thinking of returning it, but decided not to.  I tried to brush it made it&#x27;s just dirt from storage but it still looks dirty not vibrant color was what it is in the picture.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair. Makes brushing through her wet or dry hair so much easier and leaves it feeling softer.</li>
            <li> Such a fan of the wet brush. I have 4 stars only because I thought this was a mini brush when I purchased. Was hoping to get a smaller one to keep in my curly headed daughters diaper back for quick fixes out of the carseat.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful! My 3 year old hates having her hair brushed because she says it is too painful. She has thick wavy hair and this brush makes brushing her hair so easy and painless; wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for inventing it!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush ever.  My daughter hated her hair brushed before.  No more tears after using this brush.  Now my sons are using it.  We have several in of these.  We keep this one in the car.</li>
            <li> My two year old daughter has naturally curly hair and hated getting her hair brushed because it tangled easily! I heard about this brush from my sister in law after stating how my two year old fought me tooth and nail when it was time to brush her hair. This brush has helped so much! She still doesn&#x27;t like to sit still to brush her hair, but that&#x27;s only because she is a busy body! I have and will recommend this brush to friends and family! We love it!</li>
            <li> The wet brush has changed toddler hair brushing in our house!  There are ZERO tears when brushing at bath time.  It&#x27;s best when hair is wet because, in my opinion, it gives curls more of a puffy finish (at first) when using on dry hair and I like more defined curls, but it&#x27;s better than ripping through hair with another brush.  What IS nice about it is that I can use it at night during bath and the next morning just hand-pick/hand-brush my childs hair because it makes it so soft and untangled, it&#x27;s still nice the next morning so even if you had to use another brush, it isn&#x27;t quite so bad because this one sort of preps the hair.  The daisy one I got had a super strong odor to it because of the &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; brush but it has gotten better and didn&#x27;t cause any issues other than being slightly unpleasant when I opened the box.  Overall a great brush, and if you deal with tears during hair brushing with kids, I would highly recommend trying it.  We have the full size and travel size.  The travel size is perfect for toddlers but I use both on my child.  Great for use as a pool bag brush too.  Babies R Us now carries them in the infant hair/teeth care isle for about $6-$7.</li>
            <li> Bristles go every which way.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 3 year old daughter. She no longer complains when I brush her hair. This brush is great on tangles.</li>
            <li> I bought the larger one and loved it, so I bought this smaller one, and it&#x27;s just as great! Tried one of the imitation combs but it was junk, so I decided to get the real thing. This brush makes de-tangling hair SO MUCH EASIER!</li>
            <li> I love the wet brush - I now own three. I have the paddle brush for home, the oval one for my gym bag, and this mini one for my purse. This is a GREAT brush. It&#x27;s a good size and does what the main wet brush does - detangle my hair without breaking the strands or causing pain. I removed 1 star since the colors of the brush are actually quite dull, giving it the look of a dirty or really old brush, and I thought they would be brighter and more fun. In terms of functionality, this brush is top notch!</li>
