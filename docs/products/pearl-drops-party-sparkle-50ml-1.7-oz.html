            <li>Love using this polish.</li>
            <li>and I prefer them to some of the currently available whitening toothpastes available to me.  </li>
            <li>The taste is great and make&#x27;s you teeth white.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I can still buy Pearl Drops tooth polish - it really works!</li>
            <li>MEH.....NOT LIKE THE ORIGINAL PEARL DROPS</li>
            <li>My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean after using this</li>
            <li>Works well to clean teeth and leave breath fresh.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and right on time.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
            <li>TOOTPASTE FIRST</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same product as ever and the price is fine.  </li>
            <li>Pearl Drops gently polish your teeth</li>
            <li>They work really well and don&#x27;t cause any negatives..</li>
            <li>They really do the job.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>I buy maybe 5 at a time so that shipping isn&#x27;t too high.</li>
            <li>Pearl Drops Sparkle is a blue gel that doesn&#x27;t taste like the original but is much cheaper and does the same job.</li>
            <li>No polishing action with this.  </li>
            <li>THIS REALLY MAKES THE TEETH WHITE,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so disappointed that Pearl Drops are no longer available in the US, since I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it!  </li>

            <li> Amazing product results. Amazing service.</li>

Pearl Drops gently polish your teeth and I prefer them to some of the currently available whitening toothpastes available to me.

            <li> Pearl Drops Sparkle is a blue gel that doesn&#x27;t taste like the original but is much cheaper and does the same job.</li>
            <li> This works okay but not the same Pearl Drops I remember.  No polishing action with this.  Just like regular tooth paste.</li>
            <li> Tried this on a whim...was reminiscing about products of yesteryear...this used to be sold in retail stores in the US...but apparently no longer.  Works well to clean teeth and leave breath fresh.  I like the container.  Not an ugly tube that gets all bent up and ickey looking!</li>
            <li> I bought the Pearl Drops party Sparkle to see if this toothpaste is still as good as ever. It was I don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find I really like the way my teeth look and feel after I use it and I am a coffee drinker and yes this toothpaste does keep my teeth looking white.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and am going to get more</li>
            <li> I got hooked on Pearl Drops toothpaste a long time ago.  For some reason, they stopped selling it in stores in the US.  So, whenever I need it, I buy maybe 5 of them on E-Bay.  They still sell it in England and maybe other places.  It&#x27;s the same product as ever and the price is fine.  I buy maybe 5 at a time so that shipping isn&#x27;t too high.</li>
            <li> I always used pearl drops toothpolish in the past, then they came out with all these expensive whitening toothpastes or treatments so I went back to pearldrops and it works beautifully as it always has. Party sparkle by pearldrops works without the heafty price. Tastes good too.</li>
            <li> Like always thank you</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED PEARL DROPS, WHEN I COULD FIND IT FOR 45 YEARS.  THIS REALLY MAKES THE TEETH WHITE,  USE MY FLOURIDE TOOTPASTE FIRST THEN FINISH OFF WITH THIS.  THIS VENDOR IS FROM OVERSEAS I THINK, BUT A FAIR PRICE.  .  WATCH OUT FOR PRICING,  SOME ARE 7.00 ON AMAZON, THIS WAS UNDER 4.00.  WHEN  I BOUGHT IT 8 YEARS AGO, AT THE GROCERY STORE, IT WAS UNDER 3.00.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I can still buy Pearl Drops tooth polish - it really works!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it very much. Didn&#x27;t realize it was a gel and the gel is horrible. My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean after using this</li>
            <li> They really do the job.</li>
            <li> Not the same as in the States.</li>
            <li> MEH.....NOT LIKE THE ORIGINAL PEARL DROPS</li>
            <li> Love using this polish. The taste is great and make&#x27;s you teeth white. Arrived fast. Have already purchased two. Recomend buying from this seller.</li>
