            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s how long it took.</li>
            <li> No soft feet.</li>
            <li> Seriously, my feet were absolutely transformed.   </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews that told me to beware, but I was hoping they were wrong since it&#x27;s hard to find these online at all any more.</li>
            <li> im not happy With that product i open the box and the blades it look like there old and is not working</li>
            <li> The blades were sharp.</li>
            <li> The replacement unit does not fit tightly, or snap in correctly.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely no better.</li>
            <li> so disappointed- these replacement blades are so dull, almost same as the ones I was trying to replace.</li>
            <li> Besides getting dull blades, why are these sellers even advertising on Amazon with all the bad reviews, plus this one.</li>
            <li> The blades are too dull to even pretend to use, which is too bad.</li>
            <li> This means I had badly cracked heels since I was a child.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> These blades looks like after reading the reviews that you don&#x27;t know what you will get in the mail. Besides getting dull blades, why are these sellers even advertising on Amazon with all the bad reviews, plus this one.</li>
            <li> The blades are too dull to even pretend to use, which is too bad. I ended up buying a whole new pediegg at the drug store.</li>
            <li> delivered on time,  item  was as described</li>
            <li> I am a California girl- I wear slippers all summer and go barefoot at home. This means I had badly cracked heels since I was a child. No amount of pumice-ing helped- AT ALL. Then I saw the PedEgg on an infomercial and HAD to try it. This was 4 years ago. The first time I used it, I PediEgg&#x27;ed for more than an hour. Yes, that&#x27;s how long it took. I had baby soft feet for the first time since I was a little girl. It was the BEST feeling EVER. Seriously, my feet were absolutely transformed.   Then, last month I decided to try a pumice stone again instead of getting replacement PedEggs. No soft feet. If I sound like a commercial, it&#x27;s because I absolutely love this product, and I am so glad it was invented. It&#x27;s easy to use, has an emery board on one side to soften away the remaining rough skin, and WALLAH!!  You will have beautiful, baby soft skin on your heels once again!!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews that told me to beware, but I was hoping they were wrong since it&#x27;s hard to find these online at all any more. I should have listened. They suck. I may as well have kept the old, worn-out blade in there. This is absolutely no better.</li>
            <li> Hi i order  a  rusingacement blades im not happy With that product i open the box and the blades it look like there old and is not working i Know these product these is not the first Time that im using i didnt expect that product like that i Would like Who is the contact so i tell him how can i return those blades thanks .</li>
            <li> These blades were not as sharp as the original blade that i had..and it is 3 yrs old..don&#x27;t buy these</li>
            <li> I find this to be a great tool at removing dead skin from the foot and your toes.  I have the larva rock as well and between the two of them they keep my foot looking great and feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Not as described.  States it is the replacement blades, but they sent me the set instead of just the replacement blades as advertised.  Very disappointed.  Kept it because it just wasn&#x27;t worth sending back. Will not order from them again.</li>
            <li> these work- I love them, they are small easy to take with you on a trip, and they do the job it says it does,</li>
            <li> I bought my Ped egg 4 years ago and of course it stopped working. I was going to buy a new one but at the same time I found Replacement Blades. I got them in time. They are really good.</li>
            <li> Blades are not of very good quality.</li>
            <li> Top and bottom part not properly close. So it&#x27;s not&lt;br /&gt;convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this item at my friend house and that much better than what i receive.</li>
            <li> I ordered and paid for three packages of these these replacement blades (nine blades in all) but was sent, instead, three ped-eggs. When I notified the seller she said it would cost to much to send them back and told me they were out of the product I ordered. If they were out of the product they should have refunded my money and not sent me something I never ordered.</li>
            <li> so disappointed- these replacement blades are so dull, almost same as the ones I was trying to replace. I have ordered other replacement blades from other vendors and they were far better.</li>
            <li> This things work great for taking down the calluses on my feet.  Everyone in the family uses them.  They are cheap and reliable.</li>
            <li> These work great, they dull quickly, but no more quickly that the ones sold locally in my store. They cut away dead skin and callouses easily and leave smooth skin underneith.</li>
            <li> This is great to have on had to do your own pedicure or to get you through until you next one. Love it and it&#x27;s simple to use.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades are so &amp;#34;made in China.&amp;#34;  They couldn&#x27;t pierce a potato skin.  I was told no refunds.</li>
            <li> This product works great to remove calloused skin from your heels. It works great with the handled PediEgg product. The blades were sharp.</li>
            <li> Very useful in between pedicures. Highly recommend but use carefully without a lot of pressure.  Well worth the price and wait.</li>
            <li> The replacement unit does not fit tightly, or snap in correctly. Had to try taping it in to make it fit!!</li>
            <li> Works wonderful on your feet, I would recommend it. Was what I thought it would be.  So I give it a high score.</li>
