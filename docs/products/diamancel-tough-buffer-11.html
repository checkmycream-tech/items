            <li>This is a great item and</li>
            <li>I have never been so happy with a product.  </li>
            <li>Great deal</li>
            <li>I thought the product was not as impressive as all the reviews and would rate it as just okay in terms of effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I follow the buffing with a good moisturizer and tuck my tootsies in socks.</li>
            <li>The foot file does a really good job</li>
            <li>Mostly I was greatly dissapointed when a request from the Royal Mail arrived in place of my package for a fee of Â£12.</li>
            <li>Love this buffer!</li>
            <li>all love it!</li>
            <li>#34;Well, this one was amazing.  </li>
            <li>This smoothes your feet quite nicely.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll understand why I make my own)  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice and sturdy and is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The file rinses very easily</li>
            <li>I had never heard of this product before I came across some reviews of top beauty products on makeupalley.com.</li>
            <li>And I am so glad</li>
            <li>/&gt;The #11 buffer is an outstanding tool.</li>
            <li>If you have a ball of the foot callus, you might want to read on below for more thoughts, but if you just want to know if this buffer will work on a terminal stage callus, the answer is heck</li>
            <li>Most of the stuff files your skin, or acts like a cheese shredder.  </li>
            <li>A great product that really works.  </li>
            <li>I just used two fingers to brace the back of buffer and it does a WONDERFUL job.</li>
            <li>I use mine in the shower &amp; it is so much better than pumice</li>
            <li>I love using this thing.  </li>
            <li>It is so satisfying to see your skin &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; off in a painless way.  </li>
            <li>this tool was fantastic!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve heard the advice &amp;#34;wear a sexy piece of lingerie&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>took one star off because as another reviewer noted, there is more \\&quot;give\\&quot; in the handle than I would like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the nail file for over 7 years and it still works great, like new.</li>
            <li>This is honestly the best foot file I&#x27;ve ever used and the idea of using diamonds in a file adds an entire new dimension of luxury to this item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and maybe it wouldn&#x27;t break as easily as cheaper plastic files.</li>
            <li>So easy.</li>
            <li>durable, easy to clean and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>&quot; They are as smooth as satin sheets,</li>
            <li>think I need something more powerful than something that makes one&#x27;s heels smooth.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>Feet smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this had such good reviews.  </li>
            <li>My husband thanks you as well :-)  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I have an arsenal of products that I&#x27;ve purchased for callus removal (Ped Egg and some grater like implements) but this Diamancel Buffer is by far the best.</li>
            <li>After the first use my heels felt as smooth as a babies bottom.  </li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the most effective file/buffer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Left to its own devices, that callus would allow me to tap dance</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>it is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Then that part of your foot hits the ground before the ball and takes the pressure in the right path.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean and really does a fantastic job on rough and calloused skin.</li>
            <li>The results are smooth, soft pampered feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product, but I am already on my third one.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just that it won&#x27;t work as well as it does when you first purchase it.  </li>
            <li>My feet are smooth and soft again which I can now maintain and don&#x27;t have to be enbarassed anymore.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what the description claims it does.</li>
            <li>It worked so well, that now I&#x27;m completely obsessed with making perfect smoothed feets every day.  </li>
            <li>Pricy at first</li>
            <li>then I realize it is a quality tool that will last foreever and I paid $28 on amazon instead of $50 at most places,</li>
            <li>This is the first tool that has my feel feeling smooth and supple and with continued use has diminished the heel cracks to nearly non-existent.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it work an dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use on dry skin.</li>
            <li>You will also save money by creating your own little spa at home.</li>
            <li>None of the reviews here at the time of my purchase really answered what I wanted to know.  </li>
            <li>if it didn&#x27;t hurt so much.  </li>
            <li>Leave a much smoother skin.  </li>
            <li>This buffer #11 REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li>I had tried the pedi egg before (was like grating your foot and left rough areas) and pumice stones (worked ok, but not nearly as fast and good as this product).</li>
            <li>It absolutely lives up to its reputation.</li>
            <li>I am a nut about keeping my feet nice and wasted lots of money on files that did not get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Dry skin quickly sheds off leaving a soft smooth surface.</li>
            <li>The price is negligible when you consider all you&#x27;d spend replacing other buffers that don&#x27;t work as well, as opposed to having this for many years to come.</li>
            <li>I think the answer for me might be to get a full foot length insole and cut away most of the toe area, leaving just the big toe area down to aside of the ball, and shift it from shoe to shoe.  </li>
            <li>(look it up and make sure you&#x27;re sitting down when you see the price...</li>
            <li>The Diamancel buffer is far superior to any other similar product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This version with the black handle (which cost more) is easier on your hands than the one with the metal handle.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Diamancel...</li>
            <li>The #20 removes more dead skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing that actually works and easy to use/clean.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this buffer.</li>
            <li>I became interested in this foot buffer after having read about it on several beauty blogs.</li>
            <li>Honestly, 5 minutes later and both calluses (the other on the outside of the foot, below the pinkie toe) were about halfway gone.  </li>
            <li>The buffer rinses off easily with plain water.</li>
            <li>For those who want to cut to the chase, yes, this baby was able to work on a serious callus in pretty short order.  </li>
            <li>price may seem high at first, but a pittance when you think of all the money you would have spent on pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are a Spa Girl at heart, this product will completely impress you.</li>
            <li>My feet have completely turned around.</li>
            <li>Callouses on my heels and balls of feet get smoothed away completely.</li>
            <li>My feet feel so soft.</li>
            <li>My heels were incredibly soft just by buffing.</li>
            <li>The problem with those is that they do not last for more than a few months.  </li>
            <li>I spent far more than that in creams and other products that just did not work.  </li>
            <li>The ball of my foot has a major callus that I&#x27;ve tussled with all my adult life.  </li>
            <li>it really got rid of my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It works fantastically well, for about 9 months, and I can drag it out for a few more months, but that is it before I feel I have to replace it.  </li>
            <li>The UPS truck dropped it off and I literally sat right down and got to work with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The tool is designed to last for years and after use a quick wash with a small soft toothbrush and soap will have it ready for the next use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am now unable to part with these Diamancel products, which I guess is kind of gross if you think about it.  </li>
            <li>I am the sort of person who lives in bare feet if at all possible.</li>
            <li>The thing is, it&#x27;s easy to get lazy about doing this, as the moleskin gets wet with daily showering, doesn&#x27;t stick properly, and is unsightly.  </li>
            <li>I can plainly see this works very quickly and will have these painful thick spots gone with a little more work, and leave my skin in much better shape.  </li>
            <li>I believe that for really tough calluses the #20 is the one you want but for regular maintenance and keeping your feel smooth this tool is a winner.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this buffer. My feet looks and feel great.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this product before I came across some reviews of top beauty products on makeupalley.com. Folks raved about the power of this little tool. At $47 I was hesitant but decided to ante up. And I am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The #11 buffer is an outstanding tool. Used dry, you simple rub it across your feet. Dry skin quickly sheds off leaving a soft smooth surface. I follow the buffing with a good moisturizer and tuck my tootsies in socks. The results are smooth, soft pampered feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price may seem high at first, but a pittance when you think of all the money you would have spent on pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool is designed to last for years and after use a quick wash with a small soft toothbrush and soap will have it ready for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent value!</li>
            <li> I thought the product was not as impressive as all the reviews and would rate it as just okay in terms of effectiveness. Mostly I was greatly dissapointed when a request from the Royal Mail arrived in place of my package for a fee of Â£12. 50. I had already paid a $17.00 shipping fee . When I complained to Diamencel they said said it was not their responsibility!! I was not impressed and would definately not recommend this product to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> Since my husband promptly stole my last foot file, I had to order myself another one and decided to try this brand. This is honestly the best foot file I&#x27;ve ever used and the idea of using diamonds in a file adds an entire new dimension of luxury to this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price seemed somewhat steep in comparison to other items, but then I figured maybe it would last longer than files that needed replacement files and maybe it wouldn&#x27;t break as easily as cheaper plastic files. So, the advantages are a longer lasting item that works at least twice as well and the results are very apparent within five minutes of using this product. My heels could now be described as \\&quot;silky.\\&quot; They are as smooth as satin sheets, almost unbelievably smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a Spa Girl at heart, this product will completely impress you. You will also save money by creating your own little spa at home. This doesn&#x27;t just remove dry skin it polishes your feet. The file rinses very easily, it&#x27;s nice and sturdy and is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be a 100 star product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I am already on my third one.  It works fantastically well, for about 9 months, and I can drag it out for a few more months, but that is it before I feel I have to replace it.  It is&#x27;nt that it won&#x27;t work longer, it&#x27;s just that it won&#x27;t work as well as it does when you first purchase it.  Because I wear sandals year round, $50 a year is not a bad investment--it costs less than a dollar a week to use.</li>
            <li> None of the reviews here at the time of my purchase really answered what I wanted to know.  I&#x27;m reading about \\&quot;rough heels\\&quot; and thinking \\&quot;I think I need something more powerful than something that makes one&#x27;s heels smooth.\\&quot;    Still, I was torn between this, the Diamancel #11 and the #20 callus device.  The ball of my foot has a major callus that I&#x27;ve tussled with all my adult life.  The #20 looked like it might be akin to a cheese shredder and I already have devices like that- they do work, but leave your skins ripply and ripped up looking.  Maybe #20 was not as unkind as that, but maybe the #11 would be quite enough.  For those who want to cut to the chase, yes, this baby was able to work on a serious callus in pretty short order.  The UPS truck dropped it off and I literally sat right down and got to work with it.  Honestly, 5 minutes later and both calluses (the other on the outside of the foot, below the pinkie toe) were about halfway gone.  I can plainly see this works very quickly and will have these painful thick spots gone with a little more work, and leave my skin in much better shape.  If you have a ball of the foot callus, you might want to read on below for more thoughts, but if you just want to know if this buffer will work on a terminal stage callus, the answer is heck yeah.  - - - - - - - - - -   The recurrent callus on the ball of my one foot is the result of a Morton&#x27;s toe.  Not to bore you, but when you walk, the pressure gets transferred forward from your heel up to your big toe.  If that transfer doesn&#x27;t happen correctly, you end up moving the pressure to the ball of the foot.  The foot then responds by building up dead skin, and mine gets thick quickly.  Left to its own devices, that callus would allow me to tap dance barefoot if it didn&#x27;t hurt so much.  Since the transfer is sending pressure away from the big toe and outwards, I&#x27;ve also developed a callus on the outside of the foot below the little toe, like a little tripod balance.  Isn&#x27;t nature wonderful?   I have a freaking collection of files, rollers with blades, a flatter thing with a Solingen steel blade in it, a PediEgg, a knockoff of a PediEgg, acid laced callus discs and so on.  All have their merits and failings.  Most of the stuff files your skin, or acts like a cheese shredder.  For efficiency, the bladed items couldn&#x27;t be beat.  Yes, the blades have cut me a few times, but they have been the go-to tool to cut off thick skin quickly.  Unfortunately the ball spot had gotten to the point where the skin was so smooth and hard that even the blades couldn&#x27;t get ahold of anything, and slid right off.  That&#x27;s why I turned to this \\&quot;buffer\\&quot; - which is an innocuous name for a file that works seriously well.   If you get calluses on the ball of your foot, you might have a Morton&#x27;s toe too.  A lot of places incorrectly say it&#x27;s when your second toe (next to the big one) is longer than the big one, but this is wrong.  It&#x27;s an internal thing that has to do with bone lengths and is not always visble.  The ball of your foot hurts, so your instinct is to put padding where it hurts, as I did for a long time myself.  The answer actually is to put the padding NEXT to the callous - along the big toe down to the side of the ball of the foot.  Then that part of your foot hits the ground before the ball and takes the pressure in the right path.  I did this with thick moleskin and couldn&#x27;t believe what a difference it made.  The thing is, it&#x27;s easy to get lazy about doing this, as the moleskin gets wet with daily showering, doesn&#x27;t stick properly, and is unsightly.  It&#x27;s also expensive enough that you may not want to replace it daily.  I think the answer for me might be to get a full foot length insole and cut away most of the toe area, leaving just the big toe area down to aside of the ball, and shift it from shoe to shoe.  Anyway, if that doesn&#x27;t work well, no biggie, because this buffer is going to do a terrific job keeping the ball callus away.  Best wishes to fellow sufferers!  [If any issues arise regarding the longevity of the buffer, I&#x27;ll come back and edit.]</li>
            <li> A great product that really works.  I have a heel that cracks and has thickening skin.  I love the fact that it work an dry skin.  Leave a much smoother skin.  Pricey, but should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> This smoothes your feet quite nicely. The handle bends just a little and it does feels like the handle will break but the handle does not break. I just used two fingers to brace the back of buffer and it does a WONDERFUL job. Feet smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. This buffer #11 REALLY WORKS; I do not understand the negative reviews I saw.</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the most effective file/buffer I&#x27;ve ever used. I am the sort of person who lives in bare feet if at all possible. Sandals in the summer and socks come off in the winter as soon as I get home. Being barefoot so often takes a toll on my feet. I have a serious problem with calluses. And my heels tend to get thickened to the point where they crack. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, but it&#x27;s not attractive either. I&#x27;ve used the plastic files with sandpaper on them and of course I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of pumice stones. None worked as well as this file. It&#x27;s expensive, but worth the money. My feet have completely turned around. I use it a few times a week in the summer and maybe once a week in the winter. Along with using the Diamancel buffer, I slather my feet with Vaseline and wrap them with saran wrap for an hour. The combination works wonders.</li>
            <li> I was getting desperate. Tried this based on online recommendations, and it totally worked. Callouses on my heels and balls of feet get smoothed away completely. So easy. I had tried the pedi egg before (was like grating your foot and left rough areas) and pumice stones (worked ok, but not nearly as fast and good as this product). Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Poor product and and even poorer customer service. AVOID.</li>
            <li> This is the third product I have purchased from Diamancel. I&#x27;ve had the nail file for over 7 years and it still works great, like new. I lost the two sided buffer in a move &amp; purchased this one sided instead to replace it. I use mine in the shower &amp; it is so much better than pumice I couldn&#x27;t stand when I had to resort back to that while looking for another Diamancel. This product speaks for itself when you use it, I am a customer for life of their buffers &amp; files. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone regretting this purchase. The price is negligible when you consider all you&#x27;d spend replacing other buffers that don&#x27;t work as well, as opposed to having this for many years to come.</li>
            <li> The Diamancel is costly, however,I believe you won&#x27;t regret purchasing it.  If you have a problem with dry cracked soles it will do wonders.  I spent far more than that in creams and other products that just did not work.  My feet are smooth and soft again which I can now maintain and don&#x27;t have to be enbarassed anymore. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The foot file does a really good job but it&#x27;s definitely over-priced.  I am a nut about keeping my feet nice and wasted lots of money on files that did not get the job done.  However, I have found files on the market for $5-$10 that do just as well as this one.  The problem with those is that they do not last for more than a few months.  So, I won&#x27;t feel too bad about buying this one as long as it lasts the rest of my life.  We shall see...</li>
            <li> It works. It does exactly what the description claims it does. The Diamancel buffer is far superior to any other similar product I&#x27;ve used. I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to say how long it lasts, but I&#x27;m amazed by how well it works. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t used to using a tool with dry feet, however some skin comes off when you are using it.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a lot of callus, this tool is not strong enough.</li>
            <li> I love using this thing.  It is so satisfying to see your skin &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; off in a painless way.  My feet feel like baby&#x27;s feet after using this, and there is literally no point to pay for a spa pedicure where they scrub your feet, only for you to feel the dead skin by the time you get home.  I recommend using this over a bathroom trash can.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool! When nothing else worked, this smoothed my feet. Noticed immediate resultsccccffheels in just a few days to almost make them feel the way they did when I was 18.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this had such good reviews.  For the price, it didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would.  I should have just saved the money and bought the one from Ulta that I&#x27;ve been using for years that&#x27;s only $4.99.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the cost! It does as promised.I purchased a second one for myself just in case they might be unavailable at some point and another as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have the driest feet. I have tried every tool and lotion every created. this tool was fantastic! it really got rid of my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great buffer for your feet.  This version with the black handle (which cost more) is easier on your hands than the one with the metal handle.  The #20 removes more dead skin. The #11 smooths the skin after you have used the #20.</li>
            <li> This is a great item and my go to for foot care. durable, easy to clean and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I am now unable to part with these Diamancel products, which I guess is kind of gross if you think about it.  I bought this #11 because I had dry skin and I wanted to exfoliate my feets.  It worked so well, that now I&#x27;m completely obsessed with making perfect smoothed feets every day.  I bought another version because I felt like, &amp;#34;Well, this one was amazing.  I bet the other one will be AMAZINGIER and my feets will be like babby unicorns.&amp;#34;  And it was so!  It is like I HAVE NEVER TROD A DAY ON THIS EARTH.  Though now I have a bad habit of like exfoliating my feets and making them perfect when I&#x27;m bored.</li>
            <li> After vacillating back and forth between ordering the #11 and the #20, I decided to order both.  I believe that for really tough calluses the #20 is the one you want but for regular maintenance and keeping your feel smooth this tool is a winner.  Like other reviewers, I have an arsenal of products that I&#x27;ve purchased for callus removal (Ped Egg and some grater like implements) but this Diamancel Buffer is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Love this buffer! Best buffer I have bought for my feet. My feet feel so soft. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> After reading everyone&#x27;s reviews I decided to take a leap of faith and order this product.  I&#x27;ve been a long time sufferer of cracked / dry heels.  I guess it is all the sandals and flip flops I wear.  After the first use my heels felt as smooth as a babies bottom.  Worth every penny in my opinion.  I have never been so happy with a product.  Truly a miracle.  My husband thanks you as well :-)  I also used Burts Bees Coconut Foot Creme, but didn&#x27;t have to.  My heels were incredibly soft just by buffing.</li>
            <li> Best foot buffer I ever used and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Pricy at first then I realize it is a quality tool that will last foreever and I paid $28 on amazon instead of $50 at most places, Great deal</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve heard the advice &amp;#34;wear a sexy piece of lingerie&amp;#34;...even if nobody else sees  it is empowering.  Forget the camisole...I bought this. Even though It&#x27;s winter and nobody sees my feet but my it makes me feel good!&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews and the opinions that less expensive files do the same job kept me on the fence about purchasing because this it isn&#x27;t cheap.  Well,  I&#x27;ve used cheap...and pumice stones...and the ped-egg,,,even an electric sander.  This is the first tool that has my feel feeling smooth and supple and with continued use has diminished the heel cracks to nearly non-existent.  I use it every evening before bed and then slather on my home-made version of &amp;#34;Olio Lusso&amp;#34; (look it up and make sure you&#x27;re sitting down when you see the price...you&#x27;ll understand why I make my own)  I highly recommend the Diamancel...it is worth the price.  My feet never felt this way after one $50 pedicure.  I can&#x27;t wait for sandal weather!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Was recommended by my manicurist. Easy to use and clean and really does a fantastic job on rough and calloused skin. Make sure to use on dry skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing that actually works and easy to use/clean.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for years.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my sister and my mom.&lt;br /&gt;We all love it!</li>
            <li> I became interested in this foot buffer after having read about it on several beauty blogs. It absolutely lives up to its reputation. I&#x27;ve used it as suggested: on dry feet. The result is instantaneous. The buffer rinses off easily with plain water. Though expensive, I feel the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I have had my diamancel #11 for over ten years now and I&#x27;m still using it. (Ditto for a Diamancel nail file I bought at the same time.) Looking back, I can&#x27;t believe I spent $40 on a foot file of all things, at a time when I was jobless. I guess I fell for the hype. But I have never regretted this purchase, and given how long it has lasted the price is equivalent to what I would have spent on pumice stones and other types of files over the years. If anything ever happens to mine, I will definitely repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star off because as another reviewer noted, there is more \\&quot;give\\&quot; in the handle than I would like. It&#x27;s not fragile, but if you&#x27;re doing a serious buffing, it does seem like the handle could snap if you aren&#x27;t careful. The other reason I took a star off is because of the price. At the time I purchased it, I had no idea it would last so long. Mine has paid for itself, but $40 for a foot file does seem crazy.</li>
