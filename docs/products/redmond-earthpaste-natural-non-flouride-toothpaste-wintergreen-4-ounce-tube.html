            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Flavor is really great and the non-foaming formula sets it apart.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great to brush our teeth without all the &amp;#34;junk.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Did I mention, tastes great?</li>
            <li>It creates a lovely tingle on the tongue!!</li>
            <li>It has a very nice wintergreen flavor and I feel like my teeth are staying cleaner for a longer amount of time.</li>
            <li>Very nice toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Taste and texture is pleasant, not like using baking soda or salt.</li>
            <li>It is pleasantly abrasive (so you still get squeaky-clean).</li>
            <li>I get the sense that it&#x27;s easy on the enamel, and my teeth feel perfectly clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste - I love it!</li>
            <li>I like this better than making my own paste from coconut oil and baking soda, which I used to think was the best option.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly good toothpaste, and</li>
            <li>The paste even tasted good.  </li>
            <li>Also cleans well and tasts good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not about to make my own toothpaste, so this has been great.</li>
            <li>This item is just as pictured.arrived promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>I really loved the Jason&#x27;s toothpaste</li>
            <li>The flavor of the Wintergreen is really good.</li>
            <li>for a chemical free paste..I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the brown color scare you, this is a good toothpaste alternative.  </li>
            <li>Good wintergreen flavor.  </li>
            <li>but this flavor was really good.</li>
            <li>How is this good for you?</li>
            <li>It taste good.</li>
            <li>Good price too.</li>
            <li>taste is good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not all bubbly like the known toothpastes, but it cleans well and has a good taste.  </li>
            <li>I know that Earthpaste  is good for our teeth and if you swallow it is good for you body too</li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>It tastes great, feels good in the mouth, and my teeth are very clean!</li>
            <li>And the best part my teeth haven&#x27;t ever felt this clean without being at the hygienist office.</li>
            <li>Clean and refreshing, no chemicals!!!  </li>
            <li>Great taste, fast shipping, awesome product.</li>

            <li>Your teeth feel amazing after a good brush...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great healthy toothpaste</li>
            <li>The best part about this is it can be swallowed and is not dangerous.</li>
            <li>Incredible ingredients + mouth feels clean w/o any chemical aftertaste.</li>
            <li>I just love Earthpaste!</li>
            <li>Favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Plus my toddler likes it and asks for more!</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>My kids and I love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>LOVE this!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Seriously love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love it and recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>My all time favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love that the box I got from Amazon came with a warning label that it may contain lead!</li>
            <li>LOVE this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>My favorite!</li>
            <li>Once you get used to the lack of foam when brushing, this flavor makes that routine more pleasant.</li>
            <li>Much more pleasant than the homemade version i was using.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is AMAZING for your enamel</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant, but it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>We have used Claybrite for some time with amazing results, cleaner teeth, healthier gums.</li>
            <li>I liked the tooth paste</li>
            <li>The best part is the great list of ingredients with no extra chemicals or stuff you don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li>We found, while the cinnamon &amp; lemon have nice scents, they lack flavor.</li>
            <li>The taste is really nice too.</li>
            <li>Ordered this Earthpaste in Wintergreen since I have read so many good things about bentonite clay (and have used it for cleansing, masks, etc.)</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t begin making my own tooth powder I&#x27;ll continue to buy this.</li>
            <li>I make our own tooth powder but wanted to try this earthpaste as I saw a blog on how to make your own.  </li>
            <li>many studies, including in the book, \\&quot;Good Teeth, Birth to Death\\&quot; by Dr. Judd, the author explains that when we brush our teeth with a paste that has glycerin in it, the glycerin coats our teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for toothpastes that don&#x27;t have all the popular name brand harmful ingredients in them, so when I came across Earth Paste and saw that it contains no fluoride, SLS, etc.</li>
            <li>Thrilled with the ingredients list (you could eat this stuff if you so desired).</li>
            <li>You always feel as though you need more in your mouth to do a good job.</li>
            <li>Nice flavor though.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your breath very fresh and the taste is great.</li>
            <li>Tastes great, and leaves my teeth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>Best natural toothpaste!!  </li>
            <li>If you want a good FLURIODE-FREE TOOTHPASTE go with Tom&#x27;s of Maine they are the best and it feels like &#x27;&#x27;regular&#x27;&#x27; toothpaste too...</li>
            <li>Pleasant, mild wintergreen taste (I wouldn&#x27;t mind a bit more wintergreen oil in it) and good polishing with NO foaming agents.</li>
            <li>The flavor is good not too strong.</li>
            <li>My gums feel so much better and look better too!</li>
            <li>It works very good, shows all natural ingredients and has a pleasant taste as well as makes your teeth very clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is an excellent natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I have more fillings and crowns then my own teeth.</li>
            <li>Best natural toothpaste on the market.</li>
            <li>I think it would make an excellent gift if you had someone who was into natural things</li>
            <li>I think the best thing to do at this point for natural toothpaste is making bakingsoda paste....which would save my wallet as well.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will be effective, but we won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li>Best natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve found, and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to switch it up every once in a while, and I&#x27;m sure I will probably buy it again eventually, but it won&#x27;t be a staple for me</li>
            <li>The smell is STRONG!</li>
            <li>Love love love being a MUD MOUTH!</li>
            <li>and they are pretty awesome about using our all natural/homemade hygiene products so they&#x27;ll enjoy this a bit more than the tooth powder.  </li>
            <li>Love using this with my children, as we are working on remineralizing and have been having great success with clay.</li>
            <li>Gets teeth clean and tastes good.</li>
            <li>but it tastes good, rinses clean and leaves my mouth healthier and cleaner feeling than before I used this product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great fluoride free, chemical free toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price though, thanks!</li>
            <li>It does have a very light hint of wintergreen.</li>
            <li>AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth, if you&#x27;re worried about it being gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice flavor, works with my electric toothbrush just fine from all I can tell.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve really enjoyed the Earthpaste toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>I have exceptionally good gum health and rarely do I ever encounter any sores or pain.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>No xanthan gum which is in most toothpaste and which</li>
            <li>I just took a flip top off something else and put it on this,</li>
            <li>Vegetables are exempt from prop 65 warning, but a handful of organic spinach probably contains more lead than Earthpaste.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>and he said it was safe for the enamel on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit to get used to the idea of brushing your teeth with toothpaste that is not white, but aside from that, this is the best toothpaste out there.</li>
            <li>Of all the Earthpaste, I think this is our favorite flavor.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste because I know every ingredient that is listed in it and</li>
            <li>The wintergreen is my favorite because it has the most minty flavor out of all the others.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>They and more sources recommend not to.</li>
            <li>Wintergreen flavoring is okay to swallow.</li>
            <li>topical and aroma are still the best methods of application.</li>
            <li>it is :)</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love how there is no glycerin.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>even swallow it as everything is safe and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better organic toothpastes.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>The wintergreen is legitimately my favorite.</li>
            <li>Although it tastes okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I would put some on my toothbrush, start brushing my teeth and it felt like I was just scrubbing my teeth with just my tooth brush, so I would put some more on my toothbrush</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It is more like a hair gel or sunscreen tube which allow air in.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I like brushing my teeth so much more now.</li>
            <li>And you have to put some on the brush for the top teeth and another glob on the brush for the bottom teeth because it doesn&#x27;t foam.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like its working much better.  </li>
            <li>I love reading the ingredients lists and not seeing anything I don&#x27;t recognize.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>i wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>It leaves cleaner teeth, the mineral clay pulls impurities from teeth and does a better job fighting our many cavities than fluoride pastes ever did.  </li>
            <li>The lemon is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>a mom who is conscientious about trying to use healthcare items with safe ingredients and avoid products laden with harmful chemicals, I LOVE this toothpaste and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I switched from Crest/Colgate toothpastes to Jason Healthy Mouth Gel, Teatree Oil &amp; Cinnamon with Flouride</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Mostly our grandchildren visit</li>
            <li>and my issues didn&#x27;t get any better, I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite flavor too as it is the most &#x27;minty&#x27;.</li>
            <li>(cinnamon is more like a clove flavor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 3yo uses this because I know she&#x27;ll be ok if she swallows it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I prefer something more minty.</li>
            <li>I love Earthpaste,  </li>
            <li>But, that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this product.</li>
            <li>Winter mint is our favorite flavor.</li>
            <li>Though I do have friends that use it and love it.</li>
            <li>This is okay.</li>
            <li>and I love it for that.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to love it</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>The company opted for the warning even though they could have been exempt from it to be safe.</li>
            <li>Earthpaste does leave my teeth feeling clean, and the wintergreen is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Your teeth just feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean, stronger and the taste is nice.</li>
            <li>and it makes my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>I like all the minty flavors and my mouth feels very clean.</li>
            <li>I have been using Earthpaste now for months and my hygienist said my teeth are very clean.</li>
            <li>Pretty good toothpaste.</li>
            <li>First impression is a good one.</li>
            <li>what a unique gift that would be!</li>
            <li>Tastes great, safe for toddler, all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Ok, it does take a bit of getting used to after using the popular foamy toothpastes...but the feeling you get on your teeth is worth trying to get out of your comfort zone.</li>
            <li>taste was very mild and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love that this toothpaste is so safe, that it&#x27;s free of fluoride and that I understand what all the ingredients are.</li>
            <li>The taste is not all that great and the product &amp;#34;thins out&amp;#34; pretty quickly in my mouth.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean in the morning before I brush my teeth!</li>
            <li>it costs more than other non-fluoride/natural brands (like Grants of Australia toothpaste, which I find to be an excellent brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is so nice to feel the smooth clean teeth feeling after every use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used peppermint, but I enjoy this one more.</li>
            <li>My son who calls my natural choices &amp;#34;witchcraft&amp;#34; (LOL) even loves this.</li>
            <li>Keep your brain healthy by being fluoride free.</li>
            <li>I proved it to my friends that fluoride free, titanium dioxide free, will (those two alone) change your life!</li>
            <li>I am convinced that these two products together is the most effective  system for cleaning, whitening and providing good overall health for my teeth.</li>
            <li>I think the flavor is really nice and fresh too</li>
            <li>Hubby likes mint while I like cinnamon but other than that we both agree that Earth Paste is the best!</li>
            <li>Refreshing and clean feeling without all those harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>but it goes very quickly.</li>
            <li>But it is safe to eat, goes on smoth, tastes like mint, and leaves your teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling as though I need to clean it more.</li>
            <li>The clean feeling lasts most of the day, until it&#x27;s time to brush again.</li>
            <li>Like.....bengay menthol smell strong.</li>
            <li>Cinnamon is my favorite so far, but the Wintergreen is good too.  </li>
            <li>and it does a good job removing normal plaque.</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s the Xylitol (which contrary to popular belief, is not all that great and can actually be considered toxic in certain aspects), or the salt, I feel that this product is much more detrimental than it is beneficial to my health.</li>
            <li>We both love it, teeth feel smooth and clean in the morning.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fine now, but you&#x27;d think for the price they&#x27;d have one.  </li>
            <li>Tasted fine for what it was.</li>
            <li>This has zero foam and the taste is very mild - lightly minty and earthy.  </li>
            <li>The taste is fine, no issues.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not unpleasant or overwhelming and NO FOAM, so no gagging.</li>
            <li>After using Colgate all my life, it was a huge change using this product.</li>
            <li>I wish they had a neem formula, but overall this is great</li>
            <li>The list of ingredients (even in kids fluoride free) toothpaste is horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Also, the top would be a lot more convenient if it were a flip top instead of having to unscrew it off completely.</li>
            <li>As a health coach I know how important it is to watch what you are cleaning your teeth and body with.</li>
            <li>enjoy</li>
            <li>Well worth the price :)</li>
            <li>I figured he would throw a fit when he read the ingredients</li>
            <li>I think I will go back to Grant&#x27;s toothpaste, as it tastes great</li>
            <li>It was smooth despite the clay in it.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothpaste, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I did and in a matter of days I was free of the sensitivity again.</li>
            <li>So, since hearing good things about how natural and cleansing earthpaste is, I decided to order some.</li>
            <li>The good news is that I don&#x27;t have the reaction that I have to so many traditional toothpastes, including Tom&#x27;s \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; one, when I use it.</li>
            <li>It taste good too and it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>no crappy ingredients and makes my teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li>This product has a pleasant MILD wintergreen flavor, especially compared to the peppermint (peppermint has more of that \\&quot;mint bite.)</li>
            <li>Yes, it costs more than drug store toothpaste but it does not leave grit in my mouth after I rinse, the flavor is  fresh but not obtrusive, and it gets my teeth silky clean.</li>
            <li>Strong, bold flavor.</li>
            <li>Most importantly,  it just feels better to cut out so many chemicals out of your daily hygiene</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m a convert for life.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny for the peace of mind!</li>
            <li>Once you get past the color this stuff is AWESOME.</li>
            <li>No cavities or plaque build up at the dentist this year proves my point!</li>
            <li>It does take some getting used to, being that it&#x27;s non-foaming and its texture and taste is so unique.</li>
            <li>that squeaky clean, shiny feel.  </li>
            <li>it does not leave my teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Also, the product makes my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt clean, but my mouth did not</li>
            <li>It does work and makes teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>my teeth just never felt clean.</li>
            <li>and it makes my teeth and mouth feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>, is fluoride and junk-free, AND leaves my teeth feeling clean and my mouth refreshed.</li>
            <li>This one leaves my teeth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Tastes great, its all natural, and you can really feel a difference in the cleanliness of your mouth and teeth.</li>
            <li>I like it but do not feel as though they clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>Leaves my teeth and gums feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth were completely clean.</li>
            <li>It tastes good, it leaves my teeth feeling great, and it just feels nice using a toothpaste that isn&#x27;t full of questionable chemicals!</li>
            <li>I always appreciate when company makes natural production with 100% natural ingredients, so smell and taste also is good, that&#x27;s why natural + normal smell &amp; taste &#x3D; best choice for the health</li>
            <li>It makes me feel good that I can keep my teeth clean without all the extra chemicals entering my body.</li>
            <li>It is thinner than regular toothpaste and its easy to use more and pours out more quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on great reviews and without carefully reading the box it comes in.</li>
            <li>is kind of a gray color (hence the natural clay ingredients)  and doesn&#x27;t bubble like &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This is a true wintergreen oil flavor.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, but it&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>So we have moved on, and just discovered straight birch Xylitol, which seems to do much better for all of us.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride, foaming agents or chemicals to make it white, all of which aren&#x27;t good for and can cause damage to your tooth enamel.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste :)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li>I make my own natural toothpaste</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>dof time, I am my confident talking to people without having to chew gum all the time, it makes my mouth that clean , absoluely love it, dont think I will switch back to another toothpaste</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not gritty, tastes great, and really leaves my teeth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Although it leaves my teeth feeling clean and my breath fresh, I keep hearing &amp;#34;lead, lead, lead&amp;#34; as I&#x27;m brushing.</li>
            <li>Leaves my teeth and mouth clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Clean, fresh</li>
            <li>This toothpaste tastes fresh and leaves my mouth clean and no worries of any cancer causing agents in this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super allergic to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, it does &#x27;liquifiy&#x27; quickly, but it still does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Then I got pregnant again, and my mouth turned into a disaster zone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and minty and leaves your teeth feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>and or you still can have cavities, but luckily this does.</li>
            <li>so beware if you&#x27;re pregnant.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste didn&#x27;t seem to do anything more than just &#x27;be&#x27; toothpaste, but it did irritate my gums if I accidentally happened to brush too high.  </li>
            <li>I have not tried the other flavors but the wintergreen is nice and not over powering at all like most wintergreen tooth pastes.</li>
            <li>This is the first natural toothpaste that I have tried, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I would use this as a back up and there wasn&#x27;t particularly any issues with this but wasn&#x27;t the best natural paste for me</li>
            <li>it minize tremendously, and my mouth does stay fresh for longer period</li>
            <li>It works for me as good as for many people who wants to become as organic and natural as possible with all the stuff that becames directly in contact with our own health...</li>
            <li>Tasted good and worked well, left me feeling clean and fresh, and is gentle.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Redmond for a life saver and a pocket saver too!!</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for good oral health!</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were looking for in a toothpaste!</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little disconcerting to see brown toothpaste, but it tastes fine and does a good polishing job on my teeth.</li>
            <li>But my teeth feel clean and much healthier!</li>
            <li>The lemon was fine,  cinnamon was gross (and i out cinnamon on everything),  wintergreen is my favorite one yet.  </li>
            <li>With rumors of brand name toothpastes being hazardous with certain chemicals in them, I decided to try Earth Paste as a natural alternative.  </li>
            <li>I also bought a tube of the cinnamon which I liked a little better, but I won&#x27;t repurchase this brand.</li>
            <li>I really do use this toothpaste and enjoy the after taste.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the taste and really like the texture.</li>
            <li>This product is DEFINITELY worth the buy.  </li>
            <li>I feel the need to rinse with Act or something for really fresh breath, afterwards, though.</li>
            <li>I must say this is the most natural toothpaste I have ever used</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s defeating the purpose of why I switched over to more natural brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Along with the Prop 65 warning, this just wasn&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
            <li>so I can have a more complete care regimine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I thought it would be worth a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; toothpastes, and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>the thing with natural toothpaste is that many don&#x27;t have an ingredient that kills bacteria, as kids</li>
            <li>no fluoride no artificial stuff.</li>
            <li>all natural and safe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been almost 3 months, so well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Why cant all toothpaste be natural and safe like this.  </li>
            <li>I had been searching for more natural toothpastes and ran into a website that recommended Earthpaste.  </li>
            <li>We started looking into more natural options right away to see if that would help.</li>
            <li>full of natural minerals to keep your teeth strong.</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t think of the right word.)</li>
            <li>I took my time and did a lot of research to find the right toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Our teeth are living and they have the ability to fix themselves, if given the right conditions.</li>
            <li>did not know that before purchasing -- it says so right on the label of the tube,</li>
            <li>This the only flavor that you can really taste, very refreshing.</li>
            <li>My whole mouth feels SO clean after I use this.  </li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t really leave my teeth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam up like ordinary toothpaste (no soap), but has a nice, fresh taste and leaves your mouth feeling clean and your teeth feeling smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I  really like how it leaves my teeth feeling so clean and sleek.</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel very refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li>With this flavour as well as the peppermint (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s true with all the flavours, but I&#x27;ve only tried two)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really a shame since I&#x27;d love to have a healthy toothpaste that also made my teeth pure white.</li>
            <li>I talked to an employee of Native American Nutritionals asking if it is safe since the toothpaste clearly states on the container that it is safe to eat.</li>
            <li>easiest thing to do is follow the FDA&#x27;s GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) list, as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I think going back and forth between this toothpaste and another natural toothpaste (such as trader joe&#x27;s brand) will create the best balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I mean it has a strong taste of mint and does a good job and whitening</li>
            <li>I found that this was not that amazing, especially for the cost (you don&#x27;t get much for the price either)</li>
            <li>The wintergreen is nice and gentle, not over powering, but enough that my breath is clean.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>The main problem that I have with this is that it seems to have made my teeth more sensitive since I started using it.</li>
            <li>We normally make our own, but I wanted to have an option that I could purchase that was as close to our homemade stuff as possible.  </li>
            <li>I will be using this with my son now that he has gotten his first teeth.</li>
            <li>So it feels more like a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>only reason I gave 4 stars is because sometimes I do miss the overwhelming mint taste that refreshes my mouth.</li>
            <li>They need to take the \\&quot;safe to eat\\&quot; statement off for those who are unaware and who trust this company like I did.</li>
            <li>while my dental health seemed to improve a lot with the toothsoap, I believe that the Earthpaste has had a greater overall improvement.  </li>
            <li>toothpaste comes out of the tube as liquid, with an occasional chunk of something more recognizable as paste now and then.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It worked well enough, not my favorite though.  </li>
            <li>I love this .. the taste for the first couple days is different but after that it no longer bothers me .  </li>
            <li>(No weird aftertaste).</li>
            <li>THIS IS MY FIRST TUBE</li>
            <li>I love the toothpaste itself, but simply can&#x27;t use something that doesn&#x27;t whiten like I need.</li>
            <li>I love the taste of this toothpaste and find it effective and refreshing, but it is a lot more expensive than the tooth powder I was using before which really goes a long way compared to this stuff.</li>
            <li>first time I used this, I thought I would see where I was after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>It has nothing I can&#x27;t swallow unlike regular toothpaste and leaves my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li>This natural toothpaste doesn&#x27;t cost those problems but it doesn&#x27;t clean well</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to because it doesn&#x27;t foam up like regular toothpaste, but this stuff does a great job of cleaning teeth and leaving your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>finding natural toothpaste with no flavor is really hard, this is the best one I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a great natural product, because all the other ingredients are natural, but when I received the package there was a warning on it that said the item contained lead, and that lead is known to cause birth defects and reproductive problems, and that it may be unsafe for children to use or swallow.</li>
            <li>So yeah one tube goes by pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for natural toothpastes that actually work, and this one seems to be good so far.</li>
            <li>No way to know how effective it is at preventing cavities until I go back to the dentist in a few months. :)</li>
            <li>It feels very similar to conventional toothpaste, also the flavor is great.</li>
            <li>I love the concept, but I could not get that clean feeling and taste and went back to my regular floride toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It seems to become less effective with time at dealing with morning dragon breath.</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth so slick and clean and my gums are starting to look more pink, more healthy.  </li>
            <li>and I am certain that I never again wish to use &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m certain the rest of my teeth are getting some of it.</li>
            <li>It did make my mouth a little bit dry but not like the more popular brands</li>
            <li>Please be forewarned, this item has a Proposition 65 Warning on the back in fine print.</li>
            <li>But it isn&#x27;t gritty and it rinses just fine.</li>
            <li>, well this is my lazy tooth paste, i love the flavour, it makes my teeth feel really clean after</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like my toothpaste to have to much mint flavor or really any at all but</li>
            <li>This toothpaste works very well.  </li>
            <li>Our whole family uses it and loves it.</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t like the taste or mouth</li>
            <li>My kids prefer peppermint, but the adults in the house really like wintergreen.</li>
            <li>so much I start drooling toothpaste remnants all over myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thought I would like it, but I really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the wintergreen as much as the peppermint.</li>
            <li>My husband and I had been researching the harmful effects of fluoride and decided to invest in a more natural product, especially since it is an item that is used so much.  </li>
            <li>I wonder also if it really has the ability to kill mouth micro organisms.  </li>
            <li>Its not the nicest looking toothpaste in the world, and tends to get all over the sink, but I really like this brand.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t think it really works very well.  </li>
            <li>Daughter really likes this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I really like your toothpaste</li>
            <li>Also, I felt that the product went by too fast.</li>
            <li>If my eyes were closed, I wouldnt be able to tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Earthpaste is a simple, natural toothpaste that anyone can feel comfortable using as it only contains ingredients that are safe to eat.</li>
            <li>B00473VPNM real salt]] and tea tree</li>
            <li>Second to Desert Essence gluten free toothpastes with Neem.</li>
            <li>But really...</li>
            <li>(in fact I often find her sucking the toothpaste straight out of the tube.  </li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t foamy and it is unusual if you&#x27;ve been using toothpaste with foaming agents in it.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;spread&#x27; too well; the front of my teeth (where I start the brushing) ends up &#x27;muddy&#x27;, but as for the rest of my mouth...not as much.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the blend flavor.</li>
            <li>IT IS SMOOTH AND CREAMY NOT GRITTY.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been alternating it with Tom&#x27;s of Maine fluoride free spearmint, using the Tom&#x27;s as a booster or when I think the Earthpaste just isn&#x27;t going to conceal enough of my fragrant dietary bouquet.</li>
            <li>I really like the way my teeth and mouth feel after using this product.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t really taste earthy or anything like that.</li>
            <li>- I much prefer my tooth powder.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised as it looks questionable, but this is one of the best toothpastes I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I want to make our own tooth powder, but settled on this until we get the chance to round all those ingredients together.</li>
            <li>My husband and I began switching to more natural products summer of last year.</li>
            <li>Though at first I really didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for a tube of toothpaste when I can buy others on sale for much less, I read the outstanding reviews and decided to take the plunge.  </li>
            <li>If they took the lead out this would be a great product, but unfortunately I cannot in my right mind or conscience use this product if it contain any amount of lead in it.</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural toothpaste other than Tom&#x27;s of Maine, which seems to be the only kind available for purchase in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products that I like better.</li>
            <li>The only issue is the clay feeling in my mouth which is gone after rinsing(not worth deducting a star for that!)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a natural toothpaste, and it is so much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>but he tried it and said it was better than all of the other &amp;#34;natural crap&amp;#34; I had bought.</li>
            <li>I do feel my teeth are as clean as when I used a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth CLEAN and WHITE.  </li>
            <li>but, if I just give it a minute my mouth feels just as clean as using a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My teeth and mouth just did not feel clean enough after using this product.</li>
            <li>my teeth &amp; mouth don&#x27;t feel fresh and clean afterwards, like it does with some other brands, and I don&#x27;t like the after-taste at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like all of the other people that reviewed this toothpaste, I feel like it made my mouth clean &amp; fresh</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>you need to make sure that you shake it a few times when you first get it and for the next couple of days to make sure the essential oils are redistributed.</li>
            <li>Clay is a pretty natural thing.  </li>
            <li>First time trying it, pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li>Not as sweet or &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; as regular toothpaste</li>
            <li>My husband and I have talked about using a more natural toothpaste for awhile now, but never really got around to it.</li>
            <li>Well, I guess if you&#x27;re looking for a simple but effective toothpaste and not worried about the minimal lead content, then knock yourself out.</li>
            <li>recently started making my own toothpaste (baking soda, calcium magnesium powder, bentonite clay, etc.), but have never really found a recipe that I liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam like traditional toothpaste and it doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth super &amp;#34;wintergreeney&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The wintergreen is just enough to make your mouth feel clean, but not enough to ruin the taste of the food you eat right after.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>It did not clean my teeth at all - I would have to brush three or more times in one sitting.  </li>
            <li>This gets my teeth cleaner, whiter, and fresher than any other paste I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried most natural brands out there.</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to because it has no foaming agents like most toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a different toothpaste since Tom&#x27;s is now filled with junk after being bought by a major well known company.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to get used to.  </li>
            <li>I figured I spent a good portion of my life brushing my teeth with chemicals in those conventional brands</li>
            <li>It is brown in color and it does not include a foaming agent so you don&#x27;t get that frothiness that you normally do upon brushing.</li>
            <li>Interesting toothpaste alternative, did not last too long.</li>
            <li>OK taste and takes a few uses to get use too.</li>
            <li>It is also cheaper (and more natural) than other natural toothpastes, which is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>Today I noticed the back right side of my mouth feels a bit sore and</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling clean but very dry.</li>
            <li>I really really loved this toothpaste, but my teeth have a few sensitive areas and my dentisit put me back on a sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Found a new fave.</li>
            <li>My favorite natural tooth paste hands down!</li>
            <li>I came on Amazon as I had already confirmed to myself that it was this product, and I found similar 1 star reviews stating the same.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little off put by the consistency, but you quickly become accustomed to it</li>
            <li>The taste is not objectionable, and overall, my teeth have been whiter and happier since using this (full disclosure - I also recently started using HealThyMouth rinse, which I highly recommend).</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t quite convince my 4 year old grandson to try it, because of the color, but I&#x27;ll continue to try!</li>
            <li>But we only use this brand and really love the other flavors.  </li>
            <li>having no foaming agents in it means I have to use a lot more toothpaste than usual per brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>This was my first time to purchase and use this product but it will not be my last!!</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel so clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate my gum like other toothpastes do.</li>
            <li>and it left major wanting of fresh breath.</li>
            <li>The only real difference in texture from normal toothpaste is that it doesnt foam.</li>
            <li>The flavor is good as well, not weird or dirty tasting at all.</li>
            <li>Until I used this paste, I did not realize how much I disliked foam and strongly flavored pastes.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it now for about 3 months and the only positive benefit has been that it has helped with my sensitivity to hot/cold.</li>
            <li>After a few days it will be fine from then on.</li>
            <li>It will definitely make your teeth feel clean, but brushing just before bed makes my mouth dry throughout the night.  </li>
            <li>My sensitivities to cold went away so now I can enjoy a frozen yogurt or ice cream without being in pain and my teeth feel cleaner and look better than they ever did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, the feel left in my mouth was CLEAN yet dry....</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>PS - as far as the lead content - there is lead in everything that comes from the earth, it&#x27;s naturally occurring and comes from dirt, so it makes sense it would be in something that is made of clay.  </li>
            <li>So this regular sized tube of toothpaste ran out so fast and at this price I can would not buy it again.</li>
            <li>know it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t really stick to the toothbrush, but it is all-natural so it&#x27;s lacking those ingredients that would make it stick.</li>
            <li>for a natural organic toothpaste.</li>
            <li>as natural and harmless as it&#x27;s claimed to be, it has traces of lead.</li>
            <li>This product claims it&#x27;s ingredients are all natural, but what it doesn&#x27;t advertise is it contains trace amounts of lead.</li>
            <li>How natural can this be?</li>
            <li>All natural paste.</li>
            <li>And translucence I had in the front four teeth is nearly gone after a month with Earthpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>old uses it also and likes it.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this toothpaste, as compared to regular toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>This is an all natural toothpaste for the crunchy mamas and dads out there.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about it is the packaging.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave that super-clean minty flavor that more common toothpastes leave.</li>
            <li>, It made my teeth sensitive, and it has a california warning for trace amounts of lead.</li>
            <li>Truth is lead is naturally occurring in anything from the earth</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been taking baby steps over to natural products.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain anything harmful in the least</li>
            <li>This happens with all natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li>After I switched to natural toothpaste (Tom&#x27;s of Maine)</li>
            <li>I do not taste clay or salt, which are in the ingredients, just soft wintergreen mint.</li>
            <li>Therefore, your teeth can not repair themselves and you get sensitive teeth or cavities.</li>
            <li>It may look and feel a bit strange at first, but you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li>I will not purchase online anymore as  I found it much cheaper at my local Sprouts store.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so much cleaner than when I was using my regular brand of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I like that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>I always buy this natural toothpaste as I don&#x27;t agree that our bodies can process all the chemicals that we introduce.</li>
            <li>IT IS NATURAL</li>
            <li>As far as effectiveness, it works alright.</li>
            <li>We changed everything except our toothpaste because we worried that a natural couldn&#x27;t do as well as</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make my sensitive teeth ache</li>
            <li>But I  can&#x27;t keep using it, because it does absolutely nothing to keep my teeth white.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the taste and texture of this product.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the screw top definitely sucks.</li>
            <li>I did some looking before I bought the tube, and discovered it&#x27;s a naturally occurring element in the clay.</li>
            <li>I have another dentist cleaning in months, so we will see how that goes, as far as plague buildup.</li>
            <li>I recognize that some people want a totally natural product and this may be the one for some, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>About 2 months after switching I started having extremely sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get away from the toxic chemicals of traditional toothpaste and this does the trick and it has the same minty fresh taste that I&#x27;m use to.</li>
            <li>I want to try a few more of their flavors later.</li>
            <li>I have only had this a few days, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to convince my small children to use this product, but maybe one day!</li>
            <li>I never understood why all things good for you have to be more expensive, but Earth Paste is more expensive than your average toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Traditional toothpaste the last year has left an overly sweet taste in my mouth, that bothers me even in the morning.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean, for a very long time after brushing, dark spots and &amp;#34;fissures&amp;#34; in my teeth that started to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; with toothsoap have continued to improve with the Earthpaste.  </li>
            <li>The small red dot started to become more of a nuisance as the day went on</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the clay is too abrasive for my gums or if it is the combination of using this product with a Sonic toothbrush, but it is more than just a small streak of blood, so I discontinued using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>First time trying this toothpaste and have to say it does not help keep white teeth white.</li>
            <li>It does have a salty taste &amp; it is of course the greyish color, so the first time I used it, I jumped back &amp; gasped when I spit it out because I forgot it wasn&#x27;t white toothpaste LOL.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have been having strange reactions to certain food items and toothpaste.</li>
            <li>other top brand toothpaste  were always very rough on my mouth.</li>
            <li>It felt odd on my teeth while brushing - as if the brush was not smoothly gliding or effectively cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>It wouldnt hurt if I ate the whole tube as long as I drank plenty of water.</li>
            <li>This is very different from normal toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The consistency is a lot different than normal paste &amp; it sort of liquefies into the nooks &amp; crannies of your mouth.</li>
            <li>Used the product like normal toothpaste, slightly different feel, rised and was done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other natural toothpastes and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for freshening breath and makes my mouth dry.</li>
            <li>My teeth not only feel so much cleaner than when I was brushing with the standard fluoride/ glycerin paste, but they are now getting whiter too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok as a natural toothpaste, but is thin.  </li>
            <li>Wish the paste was thicker maybe they will tweak it to the right thickness like other tooth pastes !&lt;</li>
            <li>Typically, I find conventional toothpaste flavor to be way too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I like that it contains none of the chemicals found in the major brands.</li>
            <li>And a couple days later, it stopped completely and has yet to return!</li>
            <li>Texture is firm and grainy, but not unpleasantly so.</li>
            <li>One last thing, although I only brushed with it for 5 days, I did notice my white smile start to develop a sort of colored hue, which should go away (I hope) as I discontinued use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are certain oils you should never ingest -- and this is industry wide, not just with us.</li>
            <li>As natural as humanly possible.</li>
            <li>So far I have only tried the Wintergreen.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is the only toothpaste I am going to use from now on.  </li>
            <li>I got this because I wanted to get a toothpaste that is as natural as possible.</li>
            <li>It seems like there is barely anything you&#x27;re brushing your teeth with.</li>
            <li>The wintergreen flavor is definitely my fave of all the flavors Earthpaste offers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a japanese binchotan charcoal toothbrush along with Earthpaste Natural toothpaste for about 4 months.  </li>
            <li>This is kind of expensive for what it is though, so I won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
            <li>was hoping it was just an adjustment period like when switching to natural shampoo, but no, this just flat out did not work for me.</li>
            <li>(makes a pretty ugger mess in sink as this toothpaste is brown).  </li>
            <li>If only Earthpaste made it clear where they source their essential oils from...</li>
            <li>and you made a basket with various natural personal products and included this....</li>
            <li>No foaming agent, no artificial coloring, just a few simple ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have felt that I have to sacrafice quality at times using natural products, but this one far surpasses conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth minty (not as minty as the typical brands) and it really cleans my teeth, doesn&#x27;t leave them feeling gunky.</li>
            <li>Plus my children still said my breath still smelled like morning breath - and my teeth felt like they needed more brushing AGAIN in just a few hours, or even after a small snack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At my last dentist appointment, my hygienist (who has been cleaning my teeth for years) commented on how much whiter my teeth were, with less plaque buildup and healthier looking gums.  </li>
            <li>And even so much scrubbing still made me feel like there were not clean.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive mouth and cannot use other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes as they tend to practically burn my lips.  </li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s great to brush our teeth without all the &amp;#34;junk.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Did I mention, tastes great?</li>

            <li> It has a very nice wintergreen flavor and I feel like my teeth are staying cleaner for a longer amount of time.</li>
            <li> Very nice toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Taste and texture is pleasant, not like using baking soda or salt.</li>
            <li> It is pleasantly abrasive (so you still get squeaky-clean).</li>
            <li> I get the sense that it&#x27;s easy on the enamel, and my teeth feel perfectly clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste - I love it!</li>
            <li> I like this better than making my own paste from coconut oil and baking soda, which I used to think was the best option.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good toothpaste, and</li>
            <li> The paste even tasted good.  </li>
            <li> Also cleans well and tasts good</li>

            <li> for a chemical free paste..I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s great!</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t love that the box I got from Amazon came with a warning label that it may contain lead!</li>
            <li> LOVE this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> My favorite!</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the lack of foam when brushing, this flavor makes that routine more pleasant.</li>
            <li> Much more pleasant than the homemade version i was using.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is AMAZING for your enamel</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant, but it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> We have used Claybrite for some time with amazing results, cleaner teeth, healthier gums.</li>
            <li> I liked the tooth paste</li>
            <li> The best part is the great list of ingredients with no extra chemicals or stuff you don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> We found, while the cinnamon &amp; lemon have nice scents, they lack flavor.</li>
            <li> The taste is really nice too.</li>
            <li> Ordered this Earthpaste in Wintergreen since I have read so many good things about bentonite clay (and have used it for cleansing, masks, etc.)</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t begin making my own tooth powder I&#x27;ll continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> I make our own tooth powder but wanted to try this earthpaste as I saw a blog on how to make your own.  </li>
            <li> many studies, including in the book, \\&quot;Good Teeth, Birth to Death\\&quot; by Dr. Judd, the author explains that when we brush our teeth with a paste that has glycerin in it, the glycerin coats our teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for toothpastes that don&#x27;t have all the popular name brand harmful ingredients in them, so when I came across Earth Paste and saw that it contains no fluoride, SLS, etc.</li>
            <li> Thrilled with the ingredients list (you could eat this stuff if you so desired).</li>
            <li> You always feel as though you need more in your mouth to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Nice flavor though.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your breath very fresh and the taste is great.</li>
            <li> Tastes great, and leaves my teeth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> Best natural toothpaste!!  </li>
            <li> If you want a good FLURIODE-FREE TOOTHPASTE go with Tom&#x27;s of Maine they are the best and it feels like &#x27;&#x27;regular&#x27;&#x27; toothpaste too...</li>
            <li> Pleasant, mild wintergreen taste (I wouldn&#x27;t mind a bit more wintergreen oil in it) and good polishing with NO foaming agents.</li>
            <li> The flavor is good not too strong.</li>
            <li> My gums feel so much better and look better too!</li>
            <li> It works very good, shows all natural ingredients and has a pleasant taste as well as makes your teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is an excellent natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have more fillings and crowns then my own teeth.</li>
            <li> Best natural toothpaste on the market.</li>
            <li> I think it would make an excellent gift if you had someone who was into natural things</li>
            <li> I think the best thing to do at this point for natural toothpaste is making bakingsoda paste....which would save my wallet as well.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will be effective, but we won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Best natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve found, and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to switch it up every once in a while, and I&#x27;m sure I will probably buy it again eventually, but it won&#x27;t be a staple for me</li>
            <li> The smell is STRONG!</li>
            <li> Love love love being a MUD MOUTH!</li>
            <li> and they are pretty awesome about using our all natural/homemade hygiene products so they&#x27;ll enjoy this a bit more than the tooth powder.  </li>
            <li> Love using this with my children, as we are working on remineralizing and have been having great success with clay.</li>
            <li> Gets teeth clean and tastes good.</li>
            <li> but it tastes good, rinses clean and leaves my mouth healthier and cleaner feeling than before I used this product.  </li>
            <li> This is a great fluoride free, chemical free toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great price though, thanks!</li>
            <li> It does have a very light hint of wintergreen.</li>
            <li> AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.  </li>
            <li> It is very smooth, if you&#x27;re worried about it being gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice flavor, works with my electric toothbrush just fine from all I can tell.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve really enjoyed the Earthpaste toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> I have exceptionally good gum health and rarely do I ever encounter any sores or pain.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> No xanthan gum which is in most toothpaste and which</li>
            <li> I just took a flip top off something else and put it on this,</li>
            <li> Vegetables are exempt from prop 65 warning, but a handful of organic spinach probably contains more lead than Earthpaste.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> and he said it was safe for the enamel on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit to get used to the idea of brushing your teeth with toothpaste that is not white, but aside from that, this is the best toothpaste out there.</li>
            <li> Of all the Earthpaste, I think this is our favorite flavor.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste because I know every ingredient that is listed in it and</li>
            <li> The wintergreen is my favorite because it has the most minty flavor out of all the others.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> They and more sources recommend not to.</li>
            <li> Wintergreen flavoring is okay to swallow.</li>
            <li> topical and aroma are still the best methods of application.</li>
            <li> it is :)</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I love how there is no glycerin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> even swallow it as everything is safe and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better organic toothpastes.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> The wintergreen is legitimately my favorite.</li>
            <li> Although it tastes okay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I would put some on my toothbrush, start brushing my teeth and it felt like I was just scrubbing my teeth with just my tooth brush, so I would put some more on my toothbrush</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It is more like a hair gel or sunscreen tube which allow air in.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I like brushing my teeth so much more now.</li>
            <li> And you have to put some on the brush for the top teeth and another glob on the brush for the bottom teeth because it doesn&#x27;t foam.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like its working much better.  </li>
            <li> I love reading the ingredients lists and not seeing anything I don&#x27;t recognize.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> i wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> It leaves cleaner teeth, the mineral clay pulls impurities from teeth and does a better job fighting our many cavities than fluoride pastes ever did.  </li>
            <li> The lemon is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> a mom who is conscientious about trying to use healthcare items with safe ingredients and avoid products laden with harmful chemicals, I LOVE this toothpaste and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I switched from Crest/Colgate toothpastes to Jason Healthy Mouth Gel, Teatree Oil &amp; Cinnamon with Flouride</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Mostly our grandchildren visit</li>
            <li> and my issues didn&#x27;t get any better, I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite flavor too as it is the most &#x27;minty&#x27;.</li>
            <li> (cinnamon is more like a clove flavor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 3yo uses this because I know she&#x27;ll be ok if she swallows it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I prefer something more minty.</li>
            <li> I love Earthpaste,  </li>
            <li> But, that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this product.</li>
            <li> Winter mint is our favorite flavor.</li>
            <li> Though I do have friends that use it and love it.</li>
            <li> This is okay.</li>
            <li> and I love it for that.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to love it</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> The company opted for the warning even though they could have been exempt from it to be safe.</li>
            <li> Earthpaste does leave my teeth feeling clean, and the wintergreen is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Your teeth just feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean, stronger and the taste is nice.</li>
            <li> and it makes my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> I like all the minty flavors and my mouth feels very clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using Earthpaste now for months and my hygienist said my teeth are very clean.</li>
            <li> Pretty good toothpaste.</li>
            <li> First impression is a good one.</li>
            <li> what a unique gift that would be!</li>
            <li> Tastes great, safe for toddler, all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Ok, it does take a bit of getting used to after using the popular foamy toothpastes...but the feeling you get on your teeth is worth trying to get out of your comfort zone.</li>
            <li> taste was very mild and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love that this toothpaste is so safe, that it&#x27;s free of fluoride and that I understand what all the ingredients are.</li>
            <li> The taste is not all that great and the product &amp;#34;thins out&amp;#34; pretty quickly in my mouth.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean in the morning before I brush my teeth!</li>
            <li> it costs more than other non-fluoride/natural brands (like Grants of Australia toothpaste, which I find to be an excellent brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is so nice to feel the smooth clean teeth feeling after every use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used peppermint, but I enjoy this one more.</li>
            <li> My son who calls my natural choices &amp;#34;witchcraft&amp;#34; (LOL) even loves this.</li>
            <li> Keep your brain healthy by being fluoride free.</li>
            <li> I proved it to my friends that fluoride free, titanium dioxide free, will (those two alone) change your life!</li>
            <li> I am convinced that these two products together is the most effective  system for cleaning, whitening and providing good overall health for my teeth.</li>
            <li> I think the flavor is really nice and fresh too</li>
            <li> Hubby likes mint while I like cinnamon but other than that we both agree that Earth Paste is the best!</li>
            <li> Refreshing and clean feeling without all those harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> but it goes very quickly.</li>
            <li> But it is safe to eat, goes on smoth, tastes like mint, and leaves your teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling as though I need to clean it more.</li>
            <li> The clean feeling lasts most of the day, until it&#x27;s time to brush again.</li>
            <li> Like.....bengay menthol smell strong.</li>
            <li> Cinnamon is my favorite so far, but the Wintergreen is good too.  </li>
            <li> and it does a good job removing normal plaque.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s the Xylitol (which contrary to popular belief, is not all that great and can actually be considered toxic in certain aspects), or the salt, I feel that this product is much more detrimental than it is beneficial to my health.</li>
            <li> We both love it, teeth feel smooth and clean in the morning.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s fine now, but you&#x27;d think for the price they&#x27;d have one.  </li>
            <li> Tasted fine for what it was.</li>
            <li> This has zero foam and the taste is very mild - lightly minty and earthy.  </li>
            <li> The taste is fine, no issues.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not unpleasant or overwhelming and NO FOAM, so no gagging.</li>
            <li> After using Colgate all my life, it was a huge change using this product.</li>
            <li> I wish they had a neem formula, but overall this is great</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients (even in kids fluoride free) toothpaste is horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Also, the top would be a lot more convenient if it were a flip top instead of having to unscrew it off completely.</li>
            <li> As a health coach I know how important it is to watch what you are cleaning your teeth and body with.</li>
            <li> enjoy</li>
            <li> Well worth the price :)</li>
            <li> I figured he would throw a fit when he read the ingredients</li>
            <li> I think I will go back to Grant&#x27;s toothpaste, as it tastes great</li>
            <li> It was smooth despite the clay in it.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I did and in a matter of days I was free of the sensitivity again.</li>
            <li> So, since hearing good things about how natural and cleansing earthpaste is, I decided to order some.</li>
            <li> The good news is that I don&#x27;t have the reaction that I have to so many traditional toothpastes, including Tom&#x27;s \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; one, when I use it.</li>
            <li> It taste good too and it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li> no crappy ingredients and makes my teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li> This product has a pleasant MILD wintergreen flavor, especially compared to the peppermint (peppermint has more of that \\&quot;mint bite.)</li>
            <li> Yes, it costs more than drug store toothpaste but it does not leave grit in my mouth after I rinse, the flavor is  fresh but not obtrusive, and it gets my teeth silky clean.</li>
            <li> Strong, bold flavor.</li>
            <li> Most importantly,  it just feels better to cut out so many chemicals out of your daily hygiene</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m a convert for life.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny for the peace of mind!</li>
            <li> Once you get past the color this stuff is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> No cavities or plaque build up at the dentist this year proves my point!</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to, being that it&#x27;s non-foaming and its texture and taste is so unique.</li>
            <li> that squeaky clean, shiny feel.  </li>
            <li> it does not leave my teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Also, the product makes my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt clean, but my mouth did not</li>
            <li> It does work and makes teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> my teeth just never felt clean.</li>
            <li> and it makes my teeth and mouth feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> , is fluoride and junk-free, AND leaves my teeth feeling clean and my mouth refreshed.</li>
            <li> This one leaves my teeth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> Tastes great, its all natural, and you can really feel a difference in the cleanliness of your mouth and teeth.</li>
            <li> I like it but do not feel as though they clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth and gums feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth were completely clean.</li>
            <li> It tastes good, it leaves my teeth feeling great, and it just feels nice using a toothpaste that isn&#x27;t full of questionable chemicals!</li>
            <li> I always appreciate when company makes natural production with 100% natural ingredients, so smell and taste also is good, that&#x27;s why natural + normal smell &amp; taste &#x3D; best choice for the health</li>
            <li> It makes me feel good that I can keep my teeth clean without all the extra chemicals entering my body.</li>
            <li> It is thinner than regular toothpaste and its easy to use more and pours out more quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on great reviews and without carefully reading the box it comes in.</li>
            <li> is kind of a gray color (hence the natural clay ingredients)  and doesn&#x27;t bubble like &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is a true wintergreen oil flavor.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but it&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li> So we have moved on, and just discovered straight birch Xylitol, which seems to do much better for all of us.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride, foaming agents or chemicals to make it white, all of which aren&#x27;t good for and can cause damage to your tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste :)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> I make my own natural toothpaste</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> dof time, I am my confident talking to people without having to chew gum all the time, it makes my mouth that clean , absoluely love it, dont think I will switch back to another toothpaste</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not gritty, tastes great, and really leaves my teeth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> Although it leaves my teeth feeling clean and my breath fresh, I keep hearing &amp;#34;lead, lead, lead&amp;#34; as I&#x27;m brushing.</li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth and mouth clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Clean, fresh</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes fresh and leaves my mouth clean and no worries of any cancer causing agents in this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super allergic to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, it does &#x27;liquifiy&#x27; quickly, but it still does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Then I got pregnant again, and my mouth turned into a disaster zone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh and minty and leaves your teeth feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> and or you still can have cavities, but luckily this does.</li>
            <li> so beware if you&#x27;re pregnant.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste didn&#x27;t seem to do anything more than just &#x27;be&#x27; toothpaste, but it did irritate my gums if I accidentally happened to brush too high.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried the other flavors but the wintergreen is nice and not over powering at all like most wintergreen tooth pastes.</li>
            <li> This is the first natural toothpaste that I have tried, and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I would use this as a back up and there wasn&#x27;t particularly any issues with this but wasn&#x27;t the best natural paste for me</li>
            <li> it minize tremendously, and my mouth does stay fresh for longer period</li>
            <li> It works for me as good as for many people who wants to become as organic and natural as possible with all the stuff that becames directly in contact with our own health...</li>
            <li> Tasted good and worked well, left me feeling clean and fresh, and is gentle.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Redmond for a life saver and a pocket saver too!!</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for good oral health!</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for in a toothpaste!</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little disconcerting to see brown toothpaste, but it tastes fine and does a good polishing job on my teeth.</li>
            <li> But my teeth feel clean and much healthier!</li>
            <li> The lemon was fine,  cinnamon was gross (and i out cinnamon on everything),  wintergreen is my favorite one yet.  </li>
            <li> With rumors of brand name toothpastes being hazardous with certain chemicals in them, I decided to try Earth Paste as a natural alternative.  </li>
            <li> I also bought a tube of the cinnamon which I liked a little better, but I won&#x27;t repurchase this brand.</li>
            <li> I really do use this toothpaste and enjoy the after taste.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the taste and really like the texture.</li>
            <li> This product is DEFINITELY worth the buy.  </li>
            <li> I feel the need to rinse with Act or something for really fresh breath, afterwards, though.</li>
            <li> I must say this is the most natural toothpaste I have ever used</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s defeating the purpose of why I switched over to more natural brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Along with the Prop 65 warning, this just wasn&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
            <li> so I can have a more complete care regimine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I thought it would be worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; toothpastes, and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> the thing with natural toothpaste is that many don&#x27;t have an ingredient that kills bacteria, as kids</li>
            <li> no fluoride no artificial stuff.</li>
            <li> all natural and safe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 3 months, so well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Why cant all toothpaste be natural and safe like this.  </li>
            <li> I had been searching for more natural toothpastes and ran into a website that recommended Earthpaste.  </li>
            <li> We started looking into more natural options right away to see if that would help.</li>
            <li> full of natural minerals to keep your teeth strong.</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t think of the right word.)</li>
            <li> I took my time and did a lot of research to find the right toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Our teeth are living and they have the ability to fix themselves, if given the right conditions.</li>
            <li> did not know that before purchasing -- it says so right on the label of the tube,</li>
            <li> This the only flavor that you can really taste, very refreshing.</li>
            <li> My whole mouth feels SO clean after I use this.  </li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t really leave my teeth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam up like ordinary toothpaste (no soap), but has a nice, fresh taste and leaves your mouth feeling clean and your teeth feeling smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I  really like how it leaves my teeth feeling so clean and sleek.</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel very refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li> With this flavour as well as the peppermint (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s true with all the flavours, but I&#x27;ve only tried two)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really a shame since I&#x27;d love to have a healthy toothpaste that also made my teeth pure white.</li>
            <li> I talked to an employee of Native American Nutritionals asking if it is safe since the toothpaste clearly states on the container that it is safe to eat.</li>
            <li> easiest thing to do is follow the FDA&#x27;s GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) list, as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I think going back and forth between this toothpaste and another natural toothpaste (such as trader joe&#x27;s brand) will create the best balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I mean it has a strong taste of mint and does a good job and whitening</li>
            <li> I found that this was not that amazing, especially for the cost (you don&#x27;t get much for the price either)</li>
            <li> The wintergreen is nice and gentle, not over powering, but enough that my breath is clean.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> The main problem that I have with this is that it seems to have made my teeth more sensitive since I started using it.</li>
            <li> We normally make our own, but I wanted to have an option that I could purchase that was as close to our homemade stuff as possible.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this with my son now that he has gotten his first teeth.</li>
            <li> So it feels more like a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> only reason I gave 4 stars is because sometimes I do miss the overwhelming mint taste that refreshes my mouth.</li>
            <li> They need to take the \\&quot;safe to eat\\&quot; statement off for those who are unaware and who trust this company like I did.</li>
            <li> while my dental health seemed to improve a lot with the toothsoap, I believe that the Earthpaste has had a greater overall improvement.  </li>
            <li> toothpaste comes out of the tube as liquid, with an occasional chunk of something more recognizable as paste now and then.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It worked well enough, not my favorite though.  </li>
            <li> I love this .. the taste for the first couple days is different but after that it no longer bothers me .  </li>
            <li> (No weird aftertaste).</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FIRST TUBE</li>
            <li> I love the toothpaste itself, but simply can&#x27;t use something that doesn&#x27;t whiten like I need.</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this toothpaste and find it effective and refreshing, but it is a lot more expensive than the tooth powder I was using before which really goes a long way compared to this stuff.</li>
            <li> first time I used this, I thought I would see where I was after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> It has nothing I can&#x27;t swallow unlike regular toothpaste and leaves my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> This natural toothpaste doesn&#x27;t cost those problems but it doesn&#x27;t clean well</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to because it doesn&#x27;t foam up like regular toothpaste, but this stuff does a great job of cleaning teeth and leaving your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> finding natural toothpaste with no flavor is really hard, this is the best one I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a great natural product, because all the other ingredients are natural, but when I received the package there was a warning on it that said the item contained lead, and that lead is known to cause birth defects and reproductive problems, and that it may be unsafe for children to use or swallow.</li>
            <li> So yeah one tube goes by pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for natural toothpastes that actually work, and this one seems to be good so far.</li>
            <li> No way to know how effective it is at preventing cavities until I go back to the dentist in a few months. :)</li>
            <li> It feels very similar to conventional toothpaste, also the flavor is great.</li>
            <li> I love the concept, but I could not get that clean feeling and taste and went back to my regular floride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It seems to become less effective with time at dealing with morning dragon breath.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth so slick and clean and my gums are starting to look more pink, more healthy.  </li>
            <li> and I am certain that I never again wish to use &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;m certain the rest of my teeth are getting some of it.</li>
            <li> It did make my mouth a little bit dry but not like the more popular brands</li>
            <li> Please be forewarned, this item has a Proposition 65 Warning on the back in fine print.</li>
            <li> But it isn&#x27;t gritty and it rinses just fine.</li>
            <li> , well this is my lazy tooth paste, i love the flavour, it makes my teeth feel really clean after</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like my toothpaste to have to much mint flavor or really any at all but</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works very well.  </li>
            <li> Our whole family uses it and loves it.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t like the taste or mouth</li>
            <li> My kids prefer peppermint, but the adults in the house really like wintergreen.</li>
            <li> so much I start drooling toothpaste remnants all over myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thought I would like it, but I really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the wintergreen as much as the peppermint.</li>
            <li> My husband and I had been researching the harmful effects of fluoride and decided to invest in a more natural product, especially since it is an item that is used so much.  </li>
            <li> I wonder also if it really has the ability to kill mouth micro organisms.  </li>
            <li> Its not the nicest looking toothpaste in the world, and tends to get all over the sink, but I really like this brand.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think it really works very well.  </li>
            <li> Daughter really likes this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I really like your toothpaste</li>
            <li> Also, I felt that the product went by too fast.</li>
            <li> If my eyes were closed, I wouldnt be able to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Earthpaste is a simple, natural toothpaste that anyone can feel comfortable using as it only contains ingredients that are safe to eat.</li>
            <li> B00473VPNM real salt]] and tea tree</li>
            <li> Second to Desert Essence gluten free toothpastes with Neem.</li>
            <li> But really...</li>
            <li> (in fact I often find her sucking the toothpaste straight out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t foamy and it is unusual if you&#x27;ve been using toothpaste with foaming agents in it.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;spread&#x27; too well; the front of my teeth (where I start the brushing) ends up &#x27;muddy&#x27;, but as for the rest of my mouth...not as much.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the blend flavor.</li>
            <li> IT IS SMOOTH AND CREAMY NOT GRITTY.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been alternating it with Tom&#x27;s of Maine fluoride free spearmint, using the Tom&#x27;s as a booster or when I think the Earthpaste just isn&#x27;t going to conceal enough of my fragrant dietary bouquet.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my teeth and mouth feel after using this product.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t really taste earthy or anything like that.</li>
            <li> - I much prefer my tooth powder.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised as it looks questionable, but this is one of the best toothpastes I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I want to make our own tooth powder, but settled on this until we get the chance to round all those ingredients together.</li>
            <li> My husband and I began switching to more natural products summer of last year.</li>
            <li> Though at first I really didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for a tube of toothpaste when I can buy others on sale for much less, I read the outstanding reviews and decided to take the plunge.  </li>
            <li> If they took the lead out this would be a great product, but unfortunately I cannot in my right mind or conscience use this product if it contain any amount of lead in it.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural toothpaste other than Tom&#x27;s of Maine, which seems to be the only kind available for purchase in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that I like better.</li>
            <li> The only issue is the clay feeling in my mouth which is gone after rinsing(not worth deducting a star for that!)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a natural toothpaste, and it is so much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> but he tried it and said it was better than all of the other &amp;#34;natural crap&amp;#34; I had bought.</li>
            <li> I do feel my teeth are as clean as when I used a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth CLEAN and WHITE.  </li>
            <li> but, if I just give it a minute my mouth feels just as clean as using a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My teeth and mouth just did not feel clean enough after using this product.</li>
            <li> my teeth &amp; mouth don&#x27;t feel fresh and clean afterwards, like it does with some other brands, and I don&#x27;t like the after-taste at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like all of the other people that reviewed this toothpaste, I feel like it made my mouth clean &amp; fresh</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> you need to make sure that you shake it a few times when you first get it and for the next couple of days to make sure the essential oils are redistributed.</li>
            <li> Clay is a pretty natural thing.  </li>
            <li> First time trying it, pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li> Not as sweet or &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; as regular toothpaste</li>
            <li> My husband and I have talked about using a more natural toothpaste for awhile now, but never really got around to it.</li>
            <li> Well, I guess if you&#x27;re looking for a simple but effective toothpaste and not worried about the minimal lead content, then knock yourself out.</li>
            <li> recently started making my own toothpaste (baking soda, calcium magnesium powder, bentonite clay, etc.), but have never really found a recipe that I liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam like traditional toothpaste and it doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth super &amp;#34;wintergreeney&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The wintergreen is just enough to make your mouth feel clean, but not enough to ruin the taste of the food you eat right after.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> It did not clean my teeth at all - I would have to brush three or more times in one sitting.  </li>
            <li> This gets my teeth cleaner, whiter, and fresher than any other paste I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried most natural brands out there.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to because it has no foaming agents like most toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a different toothpaste since Tom&#x27;s is now filled with junk after being bought by a major well known company.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to get used to.  </li>
            <li> I figured I spent a good portion of my life brushing my teeth with chemicals in those conventional brands</li>
            <li> It is brown in color and it does not include a foaming agent so you don&#x27;t get that frothiness that you normally do upon brushing.</li>
            <li> Interesting toothpaste alternative, did not last too long.</li>
            <li> OK taste and takes a few uses to get use too.</li>
            <li> It is also cheaper (and more natural) than other natural toothpastes, which is a bonus.  </li>
            <li> Today I noticed the back right side of my mouth feels a bit sore and</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling clean but very dry.</li>
            <li> I really really loved this toothpaste, but my teeth have a few sensitive areas and my dentisit put me back on a sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Found a new fave.</li>
            <li> My favorite natural tooth paste hands down!</li>
            <li> I came on Amazon as I had already confirmed to myself that it was this product, and I found similar 1 star reviews stating the same.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little off put by the consistency, but you quickly become accustomed to it</li>
            <li> The taste is not objectionable, and overall, my teeth have been whiter and happier since using this (full disclosure - I also recently started using HealThyMouth rinse, which I highly recommend).</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t quite convince my 4 year old grandson to try it, because of the color, but I&#x27;ll continue to try!</li>
            <li> But we only use this brand and really love the other flavors.  </li>
            <li> having no foaming agents in it means I have to use a lot more toothpaste than usual per brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> This was my first time to purchase and use this product but it will not be my last!!</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel so clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate my gum like other toothpastes do.</li>
            <li> and it left major wanting of fresh breath.</li>
            <li> The only real difference in texture from normal toothpaste is that it doesnt foam.</li>
            <li> The flavor is good as well, not weird or dirty tasting at all.</li>
            <li> Until I used this paste, I did not realize how much I disliked foam and strongly flavored pastes.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it now for about 3 months and the only positive benefit has been that it has helped with my sensitivity to hot/cold.</li>
            <li> After a few days it will be fine from then on.</li>
            <li> It will definitely make your teeth feel clean, but brushing just before bed makes my mouth dry throughout the night.  </li>
            <li> My sensitivities to cold went away so now I can enjoy a frozen yogurt or ice cream without being in pain and my teeth feel cleaner and look better than they ever did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, the feel left in my mouth was CLEAN yet dry....</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> PS - as far as the lead content - there is lead in everything that comes from the earth, it&#x27;s naturally occurring and comes from dirt, so it makes sense it would be in something that is made of clay.  </li>
            <li> So this regular sized tube of toothpaste ran out so fast and at this price I can would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> know it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t really stick to the toothbrush, but it is all-natural so it&#x27;s lacking those ingredients that would make it stick.</li>
            <li> for a natural organic toothpaste.</li>
            <li> as natural and harmless as it&#x27;s claimed to be, it has traces of lead.</li>
            <li> This product claims it&#x27;s ingredients are all natural, but what it doesn&#x27;t advertise is it contains trace amounts of lead.</li>
            <li> How natural can this be?</li>
            <li> All natural paste.</li>
            <li> And translucence I had in the front four teeth is nearly gone after a month with Earthpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> old uses it also and likes it.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this toothpaste, as compared to regular toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> This is an all natural toothpaste for the crunchy mamas and dads out there.</li>
            <li> The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about it is the packaging.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave that super-clean minty flavor that more common toothpastes leave.</li>
            <li> , It made my teeth sensitive, and it has a california warning for trace amounts of lead.</li>
            <li> Truth is lead is naturally occurring in anything from the earth</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been taking baby steps over to natural products.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain anything harmful in the least</li>
            <li> This happens with all natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li> After I switched to natural toothpaste (Tom&#x27;s of Maine)</li>
            <li> I do not taste clay or salt, which are in the ingredients, just soft wintergreen mint.</li>
            <li> Therefore, your teeth can not repair themselves and you get sensitive teeth or cavities.</li>
            <li> It may look and feel a bit strange at first, but you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase online anymore as  I found it much cheaper at my local Sprouts store.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so much cleaner than when I was using my regular brand of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I like that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I always buy this natural toothpaste as I don&#x27;t agree that our bodies can process all the chemicals that we introduce.</li>
            <li> IT IS NATURAL</li>
            <li> As far as effectiveness, it works alright.</li>
            <li> We changed everything except our toothpaste because we worried that a natural couldn&#x27;t do as well as</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make my sensitive teeth ache</li>
            <li> But I  can&#x27;t keep using it, because it does absolutely nothing to keep my teeth white.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the taste and texture of this product.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the screw top definitely sucks.</li>
            <li> I did some looking before I bought the tube, and discovered it&#x27;s a naturally occurring element in the clay.</li>
            <li> I have another dentist cleaning in months, so we will see how that goes, as far as plague buildup.</li>
            <li> I recognize that some people want a totally natural product and this may be the one for some, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> About 2 months after switching I started having extremely sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from the toxic chemicals of traditional toothpaste and this does the trick and it has the same minty fresh taste that I&#x27;m use to.</li>
            <li> I want to try a few more of their flavors later.</li>
            <li> I have only had this a few days, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to convince my small children to use this product, but maybe one day!</li>
            <li> I never understood why all things good for you have to be more expensive, but Earth Paste is more expensive than your average toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Traditional toothpaste the last year has left an overly sweet taste in my mouth, that bothers me even in the morning.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean, for a very long time after brushing, dark spots and &amp;#34;fissures&amp;#34; in my teeth that started to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; with toothsoap have continued to improve with the Earthpaste.  </li>
            <li> The small red dot started to become more of a nuisance as the day went on</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the clay is too abrasive for my gums or if it is the combination of using this product with a Sonic toothbrush, but it is more than just a small streak of blood, so I discontinued using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> First time trying this toothpaste and have to say it does not help keep white teeth white.</li>
            <li> It does have a salty taste &amp; it is of course the greyish color, so the first time I used it, I jumped back &amp; gasped when I spit it out because I forgot it wasn&#x27;t white toothpaste LOL.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have been having strange reactions to certain food items and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> other top brand toothpaste  were always very rough on my mouth.</li>
            <li> It felt odd on my teeth while brushing - as if the brush was not smoothly gliding or effectively cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> It wouldnt hurt if I ate the whole tube as long as I drank plenty of water.</li>
            <li> This is very different from normal toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a lot different than normal paste &amp; it sort of liquefies into the nooks &amp; crannies of your mouth.</li>
            <li> Used the product like normal toothpaste, slightly different feel, rised and was done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other natural toothpastes and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for freshening breath and makes my mouth dry.</li>
            <li> My teeth not only feel so much cleaner than when I was brushing with the standard fluoride/ glycerin paste, but they are now getting whiter too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok as a natural toothpaste, but is thin.  </li>
            <li> Wish the paste was thicker maybe they will tweak it to the right thickness like other tooth pastes !&lt;</li>
            <li> Typically, I find conventional toothpaste flavor to be way too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I like that it contains none of the chemicals found in the major brands.</li>
            <li> And a couple days later, it stopped completely and has yet to return!</li>
            <li> Texture is firm and grainy, but not unpleasantly so.</li>
            <li> One last thing, although I only brushed with it for 5 days, I did notice my white smile start to develop a sort of colored hue, which should go away (I hope) as I discontinued use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are certain oils you should never ingest -- and this is industry wide, not just with us.</li>
            <li> As natural as humanly possible.</li>
            <li> So far I have only tried the Wintergreen.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is the only toothpaste I am going to use from now on.  </li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to get a toothpaste that is as natural as possible.</li>
            <li> It seems like there is barely anything you&#x27;re brushing your teeth with.</li>
            <li> The wintergreen flavor is definitely my fave of all the flavors Earthpaste offers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a japanese binchotan charcoal toothbrush along with Earthpaste Natural toothpaste for about 4 months.  </li>
            <li> This is kind of expensive for what it is though, so I won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
            <li> was hoping it was just an adjustment period like when switching to natural shampoo, but no, this just flat out did not work for me.</li>
            <li> (makes a pretty ugger mess in sink as this toothpaste is brown).  </li>
            <li> If only Earthpaste made it clear where they source their essential oils from...</li>
            <li> and you made a basket with various natural personal products and included this....</li>
            <li> No foaming agent, no artificial coloring, just a few simple ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have felt that I have to sacrafice quality at times using natural products, but this one far surpasses conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth minty (not as minty as the typical brands) and it really cleans my teeth, doesn&#x27;t leave them feeling gunky.</li>
            <li> Plus my children still said my breath still smelled like morning breath - and my teeth felt like they needed more brushing AGAIN in just a few hours, or even after a small snack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At my last dentist appointment, my hygienist (who has been cleaning my teeth for years) commented on how much whiter my teeth were, with less plaque buildup and healthier looking gums.  </li>
            <li> And even so much scrubbing still made me feel like there were not clean.  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive mouth and cannot use other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes as they tend to practically burn my lips.  </li>
            <li> Clean teeth and mouth without the usual gagging of other foaming toothpastes I have used.  </li>
            <li> Says it has traces of lead in it, not good for pregnant ladies.</li>
            <li> It works just fine, but something in it irritated my gums pretty badly causing swelling and tenderness.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean, no sugar mint taste left behind</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural brands but they didn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling as minty.</li>
            <li> If you really like your toothpaste to foam, it will be weird at first since it does not foam.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have really sensitive teeth (I usually eat/drink things at room temperature because the extreme temperatures are too much on my teeth).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also worth noting that at least 4 times a week I&#x27;ll leave it in my mouth for at least a minute, just to &amp;#34;marinate&amp;#34; in all the good minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do yourself a favor and stop using conventional toothpaste, even if you don&#x27;t end up with this one (at the very least don&#x27;t use a toothpaste with glycerin in it -</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sensitive to Sulfates, which aren&#x27;t in this product, so I had none of the typical adverse reactions I get from commercial brands.</li>
            <li> The mint taste doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> You would think salt would to that, but I have awakened with a mouth that is a bit sour, verses when I use a natural mouthwash the night before.  </li>
            <li> The brown color is a little odd at first, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I was a little dubious about what other people had been saying, but once I tired it, I really liked it.</li>
            <li> but it is not at all bad tasting…I feel much better using this natural toothpaste without all the added chemicals and fluoride.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the size of grain of sand and far less than the amount found in fruits and vegetables.  </li>
            <li> All of the others were ok but left my teeth feeling dirty.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago, I made my own toothpaste out of the Redmond Clay (which I also recommend) and after about a month, it started leaving a weird taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> So although I like the toothpastes overall, the wintergreen flavored toothpaste is NOT safe to eat, since on the ingredient list it clearly states wintergreen essential oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to take care of garlic breath or other serious offenders, but for regular daily usage it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> A little gritty but only contains clay and essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I find it strange that the paste comes out overly liquid and</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a tooth paste like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> The no foaming part is a strange sensation, but my teeth do appear to be cleaned.  </li>
            <li> I will buy this as long as I can get it ..</li>
            <li> The earth paste does make my mouth feel strange immediately after using it</li>
            <li> I guess when you work on teeth for that long, you notice these things.  </li>
            <li> It does not contain any harmful and nasty ingredients/chemicals that most toothpastes are full of.</li>
            <li> I was curious how long the tube would last.</li>
            <li> IT HAS JUST A TINY BIT OF MINTY TASTE, JUST ENOUGH TO NOT TASTE BLAND.</li>
            <li> It takes a few days to get used to if you&#x27;re switched from the typical grocery store brands, but I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Although I did see the Lead warning, I decided to try a tube anyways as I know that due to California State Law, Prop 65, labels such as those on this toothpaste must be posted.</li>
            <li> My entire family of seven prefers this over any other toothpaste we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> We will definitely be buying again and trying the other flavors.</li>
            <li> It is an acquired taste kinda toothpaste, but once you get use to it, it totally gets my teeth feeling cleaner than any other toothpaste I have tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a junk-free product that can balance high quality ingredients with effectiveness.</li>
            <li> They dry out the skin around my lip and burn my tongue.</li>
            <li> Since I have used &amp;#34;sensitive teeth&amp;#34; toothpaste for the last few years, the cost is about the same for</li>
            <li> only issue is the ingredients might not be mixed that well - i have to give the tube a few shakes before squeezing it onto my brush.</li>
            <li> Same size tube as conventional.</li>
            <li> (oh yeah, another thing is there&#x27;s a lot of air in the tube for what you&#x27;re paying), and continued brushing with my other toothpaste, Green Beaver (which I was looking alternatives to due to the high price per tube as they are a Canadian based company</li>
            <li> only issue is that it&#x27;s brown, which can leave the sink looking dirty if you don&#x27;t clean it well after each use.  </li>
            <li> I have begun using essential oils and learned that Wintergreen essential oil is toxic even at small amounts.</li>
            <li> because I know that regular toothpaste is full of artificial ingredients and this one isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I am using less of this than I was of regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s super expensive.  </li>
            <li> super sad it didnt work out.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone with sensitive gums or teeth who are looking for something that is not full of harsh cleaners and dyes.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does not clean as well as my regular Colgate toothpaste -</li>
            <li> Dislike the texture which is a little on the runny side; However, it definitely gets the job done by whitening the teeth.</li>
            <li> The texture is a little different, but it doesn&#x27;t taste like mud or dirt.</li>
            <li> just a little different than you&#x27;re used to.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has natural ingredients, but I had a hard time adjusting to it.</li>
            <li> I love that there is nothing bad in it.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a great toothpaste that tastes great, but doesn&#x27;t have all those nasty, horrible ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> A bitter taste that lingered even after I used mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really anything to worry about.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no fillers or synthetic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I mean, it was natural, I guess.  </li>
            <li> not tried any of the other flavors but the Mint is recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also have issues using Colgate, Crest and other chemical added (like SLS and so) Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My teeth just feel stronger than when I used other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice the &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34; texture other folks have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> an other chemicals are not in this which is a plus</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other flavors yet</li>
            <li> This did wonders for reducing sensitivity due to enamel loss, presumably because of the minerals contained in this.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; like other toothpastes, but it doesn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
            <li> However, unlike other reviewers my teeth did not get any whiter.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any of the other flavors, so I might have to check them out.</li>
            <li> tried natural flouride free toothpaste from Trader Joes and Tom&#x27;s Of Maine and hated both of them.  </li>
            <li> Other than the color and the lack of foam, it&#x27;s just like brushing with a conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is alright, taste fine, doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste or anything, but it feels like I have got to use alot of it to brush my teeth with.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste because the conventional toothpastes create a lot of foam, which cause me to gag.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price imo</li>
            <li> , I had a dark coating underneath my gum with one brushing with this</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the packaging.</li>
            <li> I wish that I could keep using this product, but my receding gum line was getting worse and my teeth were really sensitive.</li>
            <li> and I feel like my sensitivity has gone down.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not so bad, and my teeth feel relatively clean.&amp;#34; I continued to use it as I thought it was decent, however, that&#x27;s when I noticed a small red &amp;#34;inflamed&amp;#34</li>
            <li> my teeth ache slightly.</li>
            <li> I used it for about a week and a half morning and night before I gave up.</li>
            <li> and their is no lingering residue or odd taste like after brushing with Colgate.</li>
            <li> I threw it away before half was used.</li>
            <li> So I am disappointed by the integrity of the ingredients, otherwise, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I struggled with the consistency, but what I couldn&#x27;t get past was the intensely bitter taste to it.</li>
            <li> Letting littles use this unsupervised was unwise on my part, but air pockets make this a mess waiting to happen.</li>
            <li> Still I am very curious about the lemon flavor, however I was not brave enough to try that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used toothsoap chips in the recent past (at least 3 months) and</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> My teeth are even a little whiter.</li>
            <li> , what&#x27;s a little lead?</li>
            <li> I threw the tube out, which is a shame because it&#x27;s not cheap</li>
            <li> It takes a few days to get used to, but I prefer using a toothpaste that is not filled with a bunch of chemicals any day.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the tube doesn&#x27;t have a flip top which is very annoying!</li>
            <li> Few ingredients and tastes</li>
            <li> So there was some waste with two children using it.  </li>
            <li> We used it a few times and threw it out.</li>
            <li> I leave some in trouble spots and let it do its work.  </li>
            <li> I was definitely expecting it to feel a little gritty and weird, but it didn&#x27;t at all!</li>
            <li> Its worth it though to avoid all the crap that is in other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> often times it shoots out past my tooth brush creating waste.  </li>
            <li> But I wish it was a little cheaper!</li>
            <li> It can be a little hard to squeeze out of the bottle and has a tendency to pop and spray everywhere.</li>
            <li> was a little worried about trying out this toothpasted because of the negative reveiws about it staining my teeth</li>
            <li> I cannot get past the color.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam or leave your teeth slick.</li>
            <li> no more pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to work with once the tube starts to run low too.</li>
            <li> Finally a toothpaste that isn&#x27;t secretly trying to poison us!</li>
            <li> Not sure what the offending ingredient is......</li>
            <li> and you just want to be lazy</li>
            <li> Not sure what I think about the trace lead content.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I will continue to use it or not.</li>
            <li> so not sure how the wintergreen is.</li>
            <li> I have HATED normal toothpaste as for whatever reason it makes me gag when spitting it out, hence I don&#x27;t brush enough as I should for past 30 years.</li>
            <li> Was it the foaming agents that was causing me to gag the past 20-30 years?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I also have no more bleeding when flossing.  </li>
            <li> I went with this product because it is one of the VERY FEW toothpastes that do not have fluoride AND do not have glycerin.</li>
            <li> I thought, &amp;#34;hey, maybe I&#x27;m brushing too hard as I am not used to the texture of this paste.&amp;#34; Low and behold, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> the taste of it is quite weak, having just a slight menthol tinge to it, if that.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It makes it near impossible to squeeze out when you are nearing the end.</li>
            <li> I used this for about a year, then switched to something a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> and this should be the least of your worries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick plastic.</li>
            <li> No more Crest for us!</li>
            <li> /&gt;But just because the ingredients are not harmful, it doesn&#x27;t mean they are beneficial.</li>
            <li> I have never loved my toothpaste...</li>
            <li> My teeth would feel clean after brushing, but my mouth still felt dirty, my breath was bad and I would constantly get a nasty taste in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bad news is that my gums bleed each time I use this one, and they normally do not bleed when I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Disappointingly thin.  </li>
            <li> just to the point of thinking about false teeth.</li>
            <li> The foam in those regular toothpastes made brushing my teeth a very unpleasant experience, so I started looking for an alternative.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very subtle minty taste.</li>
            <li> The taste and look take a little getting used to, but the taste isn&#x27;t bad ...</li>
            <li> I thought this was it, however I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was sad to find out that this product contains lead, which makes it unsafe to use.</li>
            <li> Maybe my boys did something weird.</li>
            <li> needless to say...</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical of the toothpaste, but for the price of a 6 pack of beer, why not try it.</li>
            <li> how everytime I use it my mouth feels grose and weird....</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> I used to hate brushing my teeth, now I know I just hate using regular tooth paste.</li>
            <li> anyway I was trying to buy some time because dental work is so crazy expensive.....</li>
            <li> it leaves your mouth with a dirty feeling after brushing...</li>
            <li> I had always suffered from sensitivities to cold and noticed enamel damage while using the toothpastes we are told to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find a toothpaste that has no glycerin- google it, your mouth will thank you.</li>
            <li> it would be to boost it&#x27;s strenght in killing bad bacteria in the mouth.</li>
            <li> because of all the bad ingredients in everything.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy this crap again.....</li>
            <li> I also hated the flavours of the those toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> no one should complain about the price seriously!! !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> They both had the worst taste ever</li>
            <li> I found it was AWFUL.  </li>
            <li> Have even noticed there is not the disgusting plaque buildup by the end of day I always had before.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I just love Earthpaste! It makes my mouth feel so clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate my gum like other toothpastes do.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve really enjoyed the Earthpaste toothpastes.  We normally make our own, but I wanted to have an option that I could purchase that was as close to our homemade stuff as possible.  This is it!  I don&#x27;t have to be concerned about any of the ingredients, and it actually works.  My whole mouth feels SO clean after I use this.  My teeth and gums feel similar to what they do after oil pulling- that squeaky clean, shiny feel.  Love using this with my children, as we are working on remineralizing and have been having great success with clay.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste! It feels very similar to conventional toothpaste, also the flavor is great. Typically, I find conventional toothpaste flavor to be way too overwhelming. The wintergreen is just enough to make your mouth feel clean, but not enough to ruin the taste of the food you eat right after. Same size tube as conventional.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like my toothpaste to have to much mint flavor or really any at all but finding natural toothpaste with no flavor is really hard, this is the best one I&#x27;ve found so far. I like it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a different toothpaste since Tom&#x27;s is now filled with junk after being bought by a major well known company. I thought this was it, however I was wrong. Although I did see the Lead warning, I decided to try a tube anyways as I know that due to California State Law, Prop 65, labels such as those on this toothpaste must be posted. Now, my initial reaction when I received this toothpaste was, &amp;#34;Okay, it&#x27;s not so bad, and my teeth feel relatively clean.&amp;#34; I continued to use it as I thought it was decent, however, that&#x27;s when I noticed a small red &amp;#34;inflamed&amp;#34; dot on my gums. I have exceptionally good gum health and rarely do I ever encounter any sores or pain. I thought, &amp;#34;hey, maybe I&#x27;m brushing too hard as I am not used to the texture of this paste.&amp;#34; Low and behold, I was wrong. The small red dot started to become more of a nuisance as the day went on and I started to feel sensitivity in the area. Either way, I disregarded it and continued to brush with the toothpaste for a couple of days. Today I noticed the back right side of my mouth feels a bit sore and my teeth ache slightly. I came on Amazon as I had already confirmed to myself that it was this product, and I found similar 1 star reviews stating the same. Whether it&#x27;s the Xylitol (which contrary to popular belief, is not all that great and can actually be considered toxic in certain aspects), or the salt, I feel that this product is much more detrimental than it is beneficial to my health. I threw the tube out, which is a shame because it&#x27;s not cheap (oh yeah, another thing is there&#x27;s a lot of air in the tube for what you&#x27;re paying), and continued brushing with my other toothpaste, Green Beaver (which I was looking alternatives to due to the high price per tube as they are a Canadian based company and I am American), which I may end up sticking to. One last thing, although I only brushed with it for 5 days, I did notice my white smile start to develop a sort of colored hue, which should go away (I hope) as I discontinued use.</li>
            <li> I was sad to find out that this product contains lead, which makes it unsafe to use. At first I thought it was a great natural product, because all the other ingredients are natural, but when I received the package there was a warning on it that said the item contained lead, and that lead is known to cause birth defects and reproductive problems, and that it may be unsafe for children to use or swallow. If they took the lead out this would be a great product, but unfortunately I cannot in my right mind or conscience use this product if it contain any amount of lead in it. I hope that the manufacturers can consider this, and reformulate their product in a purer form.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works very well.  It has nothing I can&#x27;t swallow unlike regular toothpaste and leaves my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> I really do use this toothpaste and enjoy the after taste.  As we use up all the &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34; toothpaste, our family is replacing it with the Earth Paste!</li>
            <li> Tastes a lot like dirt</li>
            <li> Favorite toothpaste! Our whole family uses it and loves it. No more Crest for us!</li>
            <li> I find it strange that the paste comes out overly liquid and often times it shoots out past my tooth brush creating waste.  I&#x27;ve tried other products that I like better.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good toothpaste, and I like that it contains none of the chemicals found in the major brands. I&#x27;m trying to limit my exposure to all kinds of chemicals, and found out about this toothpaste via an Autoimmune webinar. It was mentioned as an aside by a biological dentist who holds no financial interest in the referral. Since I have used &amp;#34;sensitive teeth&amp;#34; toothpaste for the last few years, the cost is about the same for me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little disconcerting to see brown toothpaste, but it tastes fine and does a good polishing job on my teeth. I get the sense that it&#x27;s easy on the enamel, and my teeth feel perfectly clean.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again and again; for me it&#x27;s a permanent change.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t like the taste or mouth feel</li>
            <li> It takes a few days to get used to, but I prefer using a toothpaste that is not filled with a bunch of chemicals any day.  I have tried the lemon flavor before and didn&#x27;t care for it, but the wintergreen flavor is great!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  It takes a few days to get used to if you&#x27;re switched from the typical grocery store brands, but I really like it.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other natural toothpastes and this is my favorite.  It leaves my mouth minty (not as minty as the typical brands) and it really cleans my teeth, doesn&#x27;t leave them feeling gunky.</li>
            <li> The flavor of this is just like traditional toothpaste. The brown color is a little odd at first, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. I like that it&#x27;s natural and it makes my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Dislike the texture which is a little on the runny side; However, it definitely gets the job done by whitening the teeth.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is awesome to use it because it puts your mind at ease. I will be using this with my son now that he has gotten his first teeth. I don&#x27;t have to worry if he swallows it. However, it doesn&#x27;t really leave my teeth feeling really clean. I guess it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m use to regular toothpaste and it doesn&#x27;t have a really big &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; effect. (I can&#x27;t think of the right word.)</li>
            <li> Refreshing and clean feeling without all those harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Have not tried any of the other flavors but the Mint is recommended.</li>
            <li> This was just what i was looking for.  The paste even tasted good.  I couldn&#x27;t quite convince my 4 year old grandson to try it, because of the color, but I&#x27;ll continue to try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the fact that it says it contains lead on the back. I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
            <li> Purchased for daughter but everyone in household likes it. Great taste and great price. Will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Works well. No xanthan gum which is in most toothpaste and which I&#x27;m super allergic to. Also cleans well and tasts good</li>
            <li> I switched to this from Desert Essence neem, and I&#x27;m very happy.  It&#x27;s very difficult to find a toothpaste that has no glycerin- google it, your mouth will thank you. I&#x27;m not about to make my own toothpaste, so this has been great. The taste is not objectionable, and overall, my teeth have been whiter and happier since using this (full disclosure - I also recently started using HealThyMouth rinse, which I highly recommend). My only complaint is that the tube doesn&#x27;t have a flip top which is very annoying! I just took a flip top off something else and put it on this, so it&#x27;s fine now, but you&#x27;d think for the price they&#x27;d have one.  I wish they had a neem formula, but overall this is great and I will happily continue to use it. PS - as far as the lead content - there is lead in everything that comes from the earth, it&#x27;s naturally occurring and comes from dirt, so it makes sense it would be in something that is made of clay.  Vegetables are exempt from prop 65 warning, but a handful of organic spinach probably contains more lead than Earthpaste.</li>
            <li> I cannot get past the color.</li>
            <li> Please be forewarned, this item has a Proposition 65 Warning on the back in fine print. It contains trace amount of lead.  I was unaware of this when I purchased the product and will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I liked the tooth paste but it goes very quickly. It is thinner than regular toothpaste and its easy to use more and pours out more quickly. So this regular sized tube of toothpaste ran out so fast and at this price I can would not buy it again. Still I am very curious about the lemon flavor, however I was not brave enough to try that.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  A little gritty but only contains clay and essential oil.  Checked with my dentist and he said it was safe for the enamel on my teeth.  Gets teeth clean and tastes good. If you are used to a gel or cream paste, the consistency will be a surprise.</li>
            <li> So happy I tried this! Takes some getting use to, after years of using foamy toothpaste, this doesn&#x27;t foam. But my teeth feel clean and much healthier!</li>
            <li> My kids prefer peppermint, but the adults in the house really like wintergreen.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a great toothpaste that tastes great, but doesn&#x27;t have all those nasty, horrible ingredients in it. I found Earthpaste and decided to give it a try. The smell is STRONG! Like.....bengay menthol smell strong. Tastes great, and leaves my teeth feeling really clean. The only issue is the clay feeling in my mouth which is gone after rinsing(not worth deducting a star for that!)</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to get used to the idea of brushing your teeth with toothpaste that is not white, but aside from that, this is the best toothpaste out there. I like all the minty flavors and my mouth feels very clean. The best part is the great list of ingredients with no extra chemicals or stuff you don&#x27;t need. I took my time and did a lot of research to find the right toothpaste. I have been using Earthpaste now for months and my hygienist said my teeth are very clean.</li>
            <li> Of all the Earthpaste, I think this is our favorite flavor. We found, while the cinnamon &amp; lemon have nice scents, they lack flavor. The wintergreen smells great and tastes great, too. It creates a lovely tingle on the tongue!!</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste - I love it! It doesn&#x27;t foam up like ordinary toothpaste (no soap), but has a nice, fresh taste and leaves your mouth feeling clean and your teeth feeling smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I used to hate brushing my teeth, now I know I just hate using regular tooth paste. My teeth feel cleaner, softer, and look whiter after months of using this stuff. Just bought my 2nd tube. I would recommend to anyone with sensitive gums or teeth who are looking for something that is not full of harsh cleaners and dyes. I have not tried the other flavors but the wintergreen is nice and not over powering at all like most wintergreen tooth pastes.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste because I know every ingredient that is listed in it and know it&#x27;s all natural. It is the only toothpaste I have found that does not have sodium lauryl sulfate. It&#x27;s basically clay and essential oils. The wintergreen is my favorite because it has the most minty flavor out of all the others. So it feels more like a regular toothpaste. It takes some getting used to because you essentially are brushing your teeth with clay. But it isn&#x27;t gritty and it rinses just fine. It doesn&#x27;t foam at all because there isn&#x27;t any baking soda but I don&#x27;t like toothpastes that foam so much I start drooling toothpaste remnants all over myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave 4 stars is because sometimes I do miss the overwhelming mint taste that refreshes my mouth. After using this toothpaste, I still feel like I need something to freshen my breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is an excellent natural toothpaste. It makes me feel good that I can keep my teeth clean without all the extra chemicals entering my body.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste because the conventional toothpastes create a lot of foam, which cause me to gag. The foam in those regular toothpastes made brushing my teeth a very unpleasant experience, so I started looking for an alternative. Earthpaste does leave my teeth feeling clean, and the wintergreen is a nice touch. I think next time I will try peppermint because people say the flavor is stronger. I am used to regular toothpaste, so I&#x27;m still getting the hang of the difference in texture/flavor but it&#x27;s not unpleasant or overwhelming and NO FOAM, so no gagging. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t really stick to the toothbrush, but it is all-natural so it&#x27;s lacking those ingredients that would make it stick.</li>
            <li> Strong, bold flavor. As natural as humanly possible. Incredible ingredients + mouth feels clean w/o any chemical aftertaste. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a tooth paste like this for a long time. I have gone through three tubes already and I really like it. I plan to keep buying it and I hope they will always make it!!</li>
            <li> Tasted fine for what it was. It&#x27;s not supposed to be delicious but it was o.k. for a natural organic toothpaste. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I swear by it.</li>
            <li> Gave it away and never got to try it out, but never got any complaints - so happy about this purchase.</li>
            <li> as natural and harmless as it&#x27;s claimed to be, it has traces of lead. but I mean it has a strong taste of mint and does a good job and whitening so I gotta give some props</li>
            <li> I have begun using essential oils and learned that Wintergreen essential oil is toxic even at small amounts. It is not recommended to ingest even by the FDA. I talked to an employee of Native American Nutritionals asking if it is safe since the toothpaste clearly states on the container that it is safe to eat. They and more sources recommend not to. So although I like the toothpastes overall, the wintergreen flavored toothpaste is NOT safe to eat, since on the ingredient list it clearly states wintergreen essential oil. They need to take the \\&quot;safe to eat\\&quot; statement off for those who are unaware and who trust this company like I did. Especially if given to children since they like to swallow the toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their response to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says Wintergreen Essential oil and not Wintergreen food grade oil? If it&#x27;s the essential oil, don&#x27;t swallow it. Wintergreen flavoring is okay to swallow. And food grade oils are different than essential oils. -- Shannon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the statement from Native American Nutritionals:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are certain oils you should never ingest -- and this is industry wide, not just with us. They are Eucalyptus Globulus, Eucalyptus Radiata, Wintergreen, Birch Bark, Artemesia, and Pennyroyal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The easiest thing to do is follow the FDA&#x27;s GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) list, as well. We indicate in the product descriptions which oils are GRAS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though topical and aroma are still the best methods of application. -- Shannon</li>
            <li> This product claims it&#x27;s ingredients are all natural, but what it doesn&#x27;t advertise is it contains trace amounts of lead. How natural can this be? I won&#x27;t be endorsing this product nor will I buy it again.</li>
            <li> I used it for about a week and a half morning and night before I gave up. I can deal with brown toothpaste and I can deal with non-foaming. I can even deal with toothpaste that has no flavor, but this stuff does not work!&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the salt way over powers the mint flavor so it&#x27;s like brushing with salt water. Second, it just tastes bad.&lt;br /&gt;After about a week I literally felt like I hadn&#x27;t brushed at all. My teeth would feel clean after brushing, but my mouth still felt dirty, my breath was bad and I would constantly get a nasty taste in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping it was just an adjustment period like when switching to natural shampoo, but no, this just flat out did not work for me.</li>
            <li> It may have stained my teeth, the texture wasn&#x27;t for me, and my breath didn&#x27;t taste as fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s it is :)</li>
            <li> All natural paste. No fluoride, Titanium Dioxide or Sodium Benzoate. However, the back of the tube wards about traces of led.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. But I wish it was a little cheaper! Its worth it though to avoid all the crap that is in other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Been using the paste for about a month now and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m a convert for life.  I&#x27;ve used toothsoap chips in the recent past (at least 3 months) and while my dental health seemed to improve a lot with the toothsoap, I believe that the Earthpaste has had a greater overall improvement.  My teeth feel very clean, for a very long time after brushing, dark spots and &amp;#34;fissures&amp;#34; in my teeth that started to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; with toothsoap have continued to improve with the Earthpaste.  And translucence I had in the front four teeth is nearly gone after a month with Earthpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it like brushing with surfactants?  No, but it tastes good, rinses clean and leaves my mouth healthier and cleaner feeling than before I used this product.  It&#x27;s also worth noting that at least 4 times a week I&#x27;ll leave it in my mouth for at least a minute, just to &amp;#34;marinate&amp;#34; in all the good minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do yourself a favor and stop using conventional toothpaste, even if you don&#x27;t end up with this one (at the very least don&#x27;t use a toothpaste with glycerin in it - it coats the teeth and prevents remineralization).</li>
            <li> Worth every penny for the peace of mind! I was looking for something I could give my toddler to use. The list of ingredients (even in kids fluoride free) toothpaste is horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;This is kind of a gray color (hence the natural clay ingredients)  and doesn&#x27;t bubble like &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste. But it is safe to eat, goes on smoth, tastes like mint, and leaves your teeth feeling clean. Plus my toddler likes it and asks for more! Will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste!  Pleasantly surprised as it looks questionable, but this is one of the best toothpastes I have ever used.  Clean teeth and mouth without the usual gagging of other foaming toothpastes I have used.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste! other top brand toothpaste  were always very rough on my mouth. I use this toothpaste combined with another organic toothpaste at my local organic store. I have actually noticed enamel being restored.  I definitely recommend this toothpaste</li>
            <li> I really really loved this toothpaste, but my teeth have a few sensitive areas and my dentisit put me back on a sensitive toothpaste. I wish that I could keep using this product, but my receding gum line was getting worse and my teeth were really sensitive. This product was great thou and I feel like my teeth whitened a but while using!</li>
            <li> This is my second tube.  Last one was the peppermint flavor.  I will have to say I like them both, but prefer this wintergreen flavor.</li>
            <li> Thought I would like it, but I really don&#x27;t. The taste is not all that great and the product &amp;#34;thins out&amp;#34; pretty quickly in my mouth. I&#x27;m not looking for it to foam like regular toothpastes, but at the same time, there&#x27;s no volume to it.</li>
            <li> I love how there is no glycerin. Few ingredients and tastes great!!&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would sub stevia for xylitol but otherwise we love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I did not like the lemon flavor but this one is great.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste didn&#x27;t seem to do anything more than just &#x27;be&#x27; toothpaste, but it did irritate my gums if I accidentally happened to brush too high.  I also bought a tube of the cinnamon which I liked a little better, but I won&#x27;t repurchase this brand.</li>
            <li> I will never buy this crap again.....it leaves your mouth with a dirty feeling after brushing...I just dont like it. If you want a good FLURIODE-FREE TOOTHPASTE go with Tom&#x27;s of Maine they are the best and it feels like &#x27;&#x27;regular&#x27;&#x27; toothpaste too...That&#x27;s what I use and I have been using that for about a month now with no complaints.</li>
            <li> It works for me as good as for many people who wants to become as organic and natural as possible with all the stuff that becames directly in contact with our own health...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my mouth refreshed and my teeth feeling&lt;br /&gt;cleaner than with any toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It even has tea tree oil for the antibacterial properties.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the clay color. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even swallow it as everything is safe and edible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does &#x27;liquifiy&#x27; quickly, but it still does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have recommended it to others and will order again and again.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is like brushing with water, it does not foam up at all like others would and it does not leave my teeth feeling clean. I&#x27;ll use what I have but I will not be buying it again. I&#x27;ve used better organic toothpastes.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have talked about using a more natural toothpaste for awhile now, but never really got around to it. Then I got pregnant again, and my mouth turned into a disaster zone. My gums were bleeding like I have never seen before! It was beyond any pregnancy bleeding I had ever seen. We started looking into more natural options right away to see if that would help. I want to make our own tooth powder, but settled on this until we get the chance to round all those ingredients together. Well, after THREE days all of the bleeding in my gums stopped except for an area around one tooth. And a couple days later, it stopped completely and has yet to return!</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the lack of foam when brushing, this flavor makes that routine more pleasant. I&#x27;ve also used peppermint, but I enjoy this one more.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this toothpaste.  Clean and refreshing, no chemicals!!!  My mouth feels clean in the morning before I brush my teeth!</li>
            <li> My kids and I love this toothpaste!  I have a very sensitive mouth and cannot use other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes as they tend to practically burn my lips.  I have been using this product for almost 2 years and have never had an issue with it!  Also, the product makes my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also have issues using Colgate, Crest and other chemical added (like SLS and so) Toothpaste. They dry out the skin around my lip and burn my tongue. This natural toothpaste doesn&#x27;t cost those problems but it doesn&#x27;t clean well, I can tell its just that obvious. Maybe its just me.....</li>
            <li> I love the concept, but I could not get that clean feeling and taste and went back to my regular floride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a little over a month now and I am certain that I never again wish to use &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; toothpaste. It tastes good, it leaves my teeth feeling great, and it just feels nice using a toothpaste that isn&#x27;t full of questionable chemicals!</li>
            <li> I prefer the cinnamon.  But we only use this brand and really love the other flavors.  This is a true wintergreen oil flavor.</li>
            <li> I looooooove earthpaste! A few months ago, I made my own toothpaste out of the Redmond Clay (which I also recommend) and after about a month, it started leaving a weird taste in my mouth. So, since hearing good things about how natural and cleansing earthpaste is, I decided to order some. LOVE. The wintergreen is legitimately my favorite. I&#x27;ve got my mom hooked, my sister hooked and now I&#x27;m working on my brother. Ha! Will definitely repurchase!!!!</li>
            <li> Great! My teeth just feel stronger than when I used other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The texture is a little different, but it doesn&#x27;t taste like mud or dirt. It does have a very light hint of wintergreen. Not over powering like some products. It doesn&#x27;t foam or leave your teeth slick. Your teeth just feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li> It fell off the toothbrush when water hit it.  So there was some waste with two children using it.  Not worth the price imo</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but it&#x27;s just okay.  Although it tastes okay and I do believe the clay is beneficial for the gums, I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.  Also, the top would be a lot more convenient if it were a flip top instead of having to unscrew it off completely.</li>
            <li> I like how my teeth feel after brushing with this toothpaste. It doesn&#x27;t do much for freshening breath and makes my mouth dry.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural toothpaste other than Tom&#x27;s of Maine, which seems to be the only kind available for purchase in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste comes out of the tube as liquid, with an occasional chunk of something more recognizable as paste now and then.  Even squishing and kneading the tube before use didn&#x27;t help.  I struggled with the consistency, but what I couldn&#x27;t get past was the intensely bitter taste to it. A bitter taste that lingered even after I used mouthwash.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great but I don&#x27;t know that I can justify spending $7 a month on 4 oz. toothpaste... My 1 yr. old uses it also and likes it. The mint taste doesn&#x27;t last long so you end up brushing with the clay taste but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Tried but did not care for this item! Exactly as advertised. This item is just as pictured.arrived promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> This is the first natural toothpaste that I have tried, and I love it!  My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this toothpaste, as compared to regular toothpastes.  The taste and look take a little getting used to, but the taste isn&#x27;t bad ... just a little different than you&#x27;re used to.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this toothpaste are all pronouncable and edible. It wouldnt hurt if I ate the whole tube as long as I drank plenty of water. The taste is really nice too. I  really like how it leaves my teeth feeling so clean and sleek. There is no flouride or glyecerin in this product so that your teeth can re-enamel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the wintergreen as much as the peppermint. It&#x27;s ok but I won&#x27;t buy this flavor again. Great price though, thanks!</li>
            <li> It worked well enough, not my favorite though.  I would use this as a back up and there wasn&#x27;t particularly any issues with this but wasn&#x27;t the best natural paste for me</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is alright, taste fine, doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste or anything, but it feels like I have got to use alot of it to brush my teeth with.  I would put some on my toothbrush, start brushing my teeth and it felt like I was just scrubbing my teeth with just my tooth brush, so I would put some more on my toothbrush then it felt like I was scrubbing my teeth with toothpaste.  I think its because of how water it is.  So yeah one tube goes by pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I like the taste, and how my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for natural toothpastes that actually work, and this one seems to be good so far. My teeth are even a little whiter. Pricey though!</li>
            <li> This is an all natural toothpaste for the crunchy mamas and dads out there. I really appreciate that this product does not contain any SLS, fluoride, glycerine, or harsh chemicals. After using Colgate all my life, it was a huge change using this product. I have noticed my teeth feel cleaner and their is no lingering residue or odd taste like after brushing with Colgate. Earthpaste is a wonderful product for adults. I have not been able to convince my small children to use this product, but maybe one day!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve used a tube and just ordered a second. I enjoy the taste and really like the texture. This is very different from normal toothpaste.  It is brown in color and it does not include a foaming agent so you don&#x27;t get that frothiness that you normally do upon brushing. My husband couldn&#x27;t get over that difference. The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about it is the packaging.  It is not in a regular toothpaste tube. It is more like a hair gel or sunscreen tube which allow air in. It makes it near impossible to squeeze out when you are nearing the end.</li>
            <li> I like everything about  the quality of Earthpaste. Yes, it costs more than drug store toothpaste but it does not leave grit in my mouth after I rinse, the flavor is  fresh but not obtrusive, and it gets my teeth silky clean. I will continue to buy it as long as it is available. So far I have only tried the Wintergreen.</li>
            <li> Love love love being a MUD MOUTH! Great taste. Hubby likes mint while I like cinnamon but other than that we both agree that Earth Paste is the best! I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about it too!! I&#x27;ve converted several people to Mud Mouth-ness! lol</li>
            <li> This product is DEFINITELY worth the buy.  My husband and I had been researching the harmful effects of fluoride and decided to invest in a more natural product, especially since it is an item that is used so much.  We are very pleased with the product.  Though at first I really didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for a tube of toothpaste when I can buy others on sale for much less, I read the outstanding reviews and decided to take the plunge.  This toothpaste tastes great and it is wonderful for children because it can even be swallowed without any harmful effects.  It doesn&#x27;t foam up like other pastes but that doesn&#x27;t stop the cleaning action that takes place!</li>
            <li> Ordered this Earthpaste in Wintergreen since I have read so many good things about bentonite clay (and have used it for cleansing, masks, etc.) and I have been having strange reactions to certain food items and toothpaste. The good news is that I don&#x27;t have the reaction that I have to so many traditional toothpastes, including Tom&#x27;s \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; one, when I use it. The bad news is that my gums bleed each time I use this one, and they normally do not bleed when I brush my teeth.  I don&#x27;t know if the clay is too abrasive for my gums or if it is the combination of using this product with a Sonic toothbrush, but it is more than just a small streak of blood, so I discontinued using it on a regular basis. The no foaming part is a strange sensation, but my teeth do appear to be cleaned.  I feel the need to rinse with Act or something for really fresh breath, afterwards, though.</li>
            <li> We tried 4 different tubes of this (different flavors included).  It will definitely make your teeth feel clean, but brushing just before bed makes my mouth dry throughout the night.  I wonder also if it really has the ability to kill mouth micro organisms.  You would think salt would to that, but I have awakened with a mouth that is a bit sour, verses when I use a natural mouthwash the night before.  So we have moved on, and just discovered straight birch Xylitol, which seems to do much better for all of us.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to because it doesn&#x27;t foam up like regular toothpaste, but this stuff does a great job of cleaning teeth and leaving your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Wonderful taste.  Don&#x27;t notice the &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34; texture other folks have mentioned.  Found a new fave.</li>
            <li> Its not the nicest looking toothpaste in the world, and tends to get all over the sink, but I really like this brand.  Does a great job at cleaning your teeth and refreshes for breath.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  Until I used this paste, I did not realize how much I disliked foam and strongly flavored pastes.  This has zero foam and the taste is very mild - lightly minty and earthy.  It makes my mouth feel very refreshed and clean.  I like brushing my teeth so much more now.</li>
            <li> I love this .. the taste for the first couple days is different but after that it no longer bothers me .  I will buy this as long as I can get it ..</li>
            <li> I mean, it was natural, I guess.  Clay is a pretty natural thing.  But I don&#x27;t think it really works very well.  And it&#x27;s super expensive.  And you have to put some on the brush for the top teeth and another glob on the brush for the bottom teeth because it doesn&#x27;t foam.  I know, I know, that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t have SLSs or whatever, but a person really gets to missing them when they&#x27;re not around.  I guess I&#x27;m just not dedicated enough to &amp;#34;The Cause&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed to Arm and Hammer baking soda toothpaste and I feel like its working much better.  My teeth are cleaner and my gums healthier.</li>
            <li> Letting littles use this unsupervised was unwise on my part, but air pockets make this a mess waiting to happen. Then if it hasn&#x27;t been shaken there&#x27;s watery stuff that leaks out. Maybe my boys did something weird. I love that there is nothing bad in it. If I don&#x27;t begin making my own tooth powder I&#x27;ll continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> We stocked up on Earthpaste. As a health coach I know how important it is to watch what you are cleaning your teeth and body with.</li>
            <li> felt like brushing my teeth with nothing, fluoride, protect us from rampant sugar!</li>
            <li> Daughter really likes this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste. I love reading the ingredients lists and not seeing anything I don&#x27;t recognize. This toothpaste takes getting used to. It doesn&#x27;t leave that super-clean minty flavor that more common toothpastes leave. So, I just make a homemade mouth wash to follow up and it feels great! (Recipe for mouthwash:1/2 cup water, 2 teaspoons baking soda, 2 drops tea trea essential oil, 2 drops peppermint) Most importantly,  it just feels better to cut out so many chemicals out of your daily hygiene</li>
            <li> Pleasant, mild wintergreen taste (I wouldn&#x27;t mind a bit more wintergreen oil in it) and good polishing with NO foaming agents. I like that there is no fluoride, as that inhibits the thyroid and my thyroid already has issues. My teeth come out feeling as if I had just had the hygienist polish them!</li>
            <li> I really like your toothpaste but my daughter checked the ingredients and notice there is lead in it. I&#x27;m health minded and that bothered me.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness.  I read another review stating it dries the mouth out - it does!!!  My teeth felt clean, but my mouth did not and it felt like it had cotton in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;While this might work for someone else, this is not for me.  YUCK!!!</li>
            <li> I have been waiting to write a review because I wanted to give time to see how the product would do on my teeth. Well, I have always had issues with my teeth. I have more fillings and crowns then my own teeth. Had pain with gums...and abbesses ....just to the point of thinking about false teeth. I started using this product and the pain has stopped! My gums feel so much better and look better too! I had one molar that I know needs a crown...the fillings are just not doing it anymore...anyway I was trying to buy some time because dental work is so crazy expensive.....needless to say...I had pain like a abbess was starting...but then I kept brushing with the clay and it&#x27;s gone!!!! No joke...no more pain. Now I know at some point I will need the crown..but this clay has kept my mouth cleaner then reg toothpaste so I know it&#x27;s the clay!!! It tastes great and you do feel like you stepped out of a dentist chair. I will NEVER go without this toothpaste again. Thank you so much Redmond for a life saver and a pocket saver too!!</li>
            <li> I must say this is the most natural toothpaste I have ever used and it does not dissapointe me, I had a dark coating underneath my gum with one brushing with this it minize tremendously, and my mouth does stay fresh for longer period dof time, I am my confident talking to people without having to chew gum all the time, it makes my mouth that clean , absoluely love it, dont think I will switch back to another toothpaste sorry, it stole me away :) and its soo affordable no one should complain about the price seriously!! !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Me and my wife didn&#x27;t like this stuff, It made my teeth sensitive, and it has a california warning for trace amounts of lead. We used it a few times and threw it out.</li>
            <li> I started using this product almost a year ago.  I had always suffered from sensitivities to cold and noticed enamel damage while using the toothpastes we are told to use.  I also hated the flavours of the those toothpastes.  My sensitivities to cold went away so now I can enjoy a frozen yogurt or ice cream without being in pain and my teeth feel cleaner and look better than they ever did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried natural flouride free toothpaste from Trader Joes and Tom&#x27;s Of Maine and hated both of them.  They both had the worst taste ever even Tom&#x27;s of Maine still has the chemcals that stick to your teeth and damages them.  Neither felt like they were cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know people have concerns over the &amp;#34;trace amounts of lead&amp;#34; found in this product but it&#x27;s not really anything to worry about.  It&#x27;s about the size of grain of sand and far less than the amount found in fruits and vegetables.  Truth is lead is naturally occurring in anything from the earth and this should be the least of your worries. I would recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride, foaming agents or chemicals to make it white, all of which aren&#x27;t good for and can cause damage to your tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like texture, color or taste. Threw away. Some might think it is great, but I didn&#x27;t. &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
            <li> It does work and makes teeth feel clean. However, I did not like the texture and could not get over the thought of mud in my mouth.  Also, I felt that the product went by too fast.</li>
            <li> Have tried lemon, cinnamon, and now wintergreen.  The lemon was fine,  cinnamon was gross (and i out cinnamon on everything),  wintergreen is my favorite one yet.  Leaves your breath very fresh and the taste is great.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on great reviews and without carefully reading the box it comes in. I was alarmed when I received it and read the warning for CA residents that this product contains trace amounts of lead. I figured I spent a good portion of my life brushing my teeth with chemicals in those conventional brands, what&#x27;s a little lead? Although it leaves my teeth feeling clean and my breath fresh, I keep hearing &amp;#34;lead, lead, lead&amp;#34; as I&#x27;m brushing. Is anyone else not alarmed by this?  I feel like it&#x27;s defeating the purpose of why I switched over to more natural brands. Well, I guess if you&#x27;re looking for a simple but effective toothpaste and not worried about the minimal lead content, then knock yourself out.</li>
            <li> Ummm. This product contains lead. No thank you. If I would of known that I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste. It&#x27;s fresh and minty and leaves your teeth feeling super clean. I&#x27;ve tried other natural brands but they didn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling as minty. Even my husband likes it and asked me to order another tube.</li>
            <li> I always appreciate when company makes natural production with 100% natural ingredients, so smell and taste also is good, that&#x27;s why natural + normal smell &amp; taste &#x3D; best choice for the health</li>
            <li> Not what I was hoping for.  I have read from a well known blogger that this is what her family uses.  I found it was AWFUL.  It did not clean my teeth at all - I would have to brush three or more times in one sitting.  And even so much scrubbing still made me feel like there were not clean.  Plus my children still said my breath still smelled like morning breath - and my teeth felt like they needed more brushing AGAIN in just a few hours, or even after a small snack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with the Prop 65 warning, this just wasn&#x27;t worth the money.  I threw it away before half was used.</li>
            <li> Best natural toothpaste on the market. Absolutely no fillers or synthetic ingredients. Tastes great and works great. Doesn&#x27;t foam up like a standard toothpaste, but that&#x27;s the only downside I could find.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a natural toothpaste, and it is so much better than I expected. I was definitely expecting it to feel a little gritty and weird, but it didn&#x27;t at all! The only real difference in texture from normal toothpaste is that it doesnt foam. If my eyes were closed, I wouldnt be able to tell the difference. The flavor is good as well, not weird or dirty tasting at all. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Pretty good toothpaste. Fluoride an other chemicals are not in this which is a plus enjoy</li>
            <li> no glycerin or fluoride in this one.  It taste good too and it&#x27;s natural.  all toothpastes have glycerin except for this one.</li>
            <li> i wanted to love this. i used it for THREE Months. my teeth just never felt clean. and it left major wanting of fresh breath. super sad it didnt work out.</li>
            <li> Wish the paste was thicker maybe they will tweak it to the right thickness like other tooth pastes !&lt;br /&gt;Thx, Emily</li>
            <li> My entire family of seven prefers this over any other toothpaste we&#x27;ve tried.  It leaves cleaner teeth, the mineral clay pulls impurities from teeth and does a better job fighting our many cavities than fluoride pastes ever did.  This also has whitened my teeth noticeably within one month.  I leave some in trouble spots and let it do its work.  The lemon is my favorite.  Very pleasant and it is so nice to feel the smooth clean teeth feeling after every use.</li>
            <li> Earthpaste is a simple, natural toothpaste that anyone can feel comfortable using as it only contains ingredients that are safe to eat. It comes in peppermint, cinnamon and wintergreen flavors and has a very simple list of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: water, food grade clay, xylitol sweetener, essential oils, [[ASIN:B00473VPNM real salt]] and tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a mom who is conscientious about trying to use healthcare items with safe ingredients and avoid products laden with harmful chemicals, I LOVE this toothpaste and would recommend it to anyone. Great product!</li>
            <li> Let me start off with saying I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because it had no flouride in it. I switched from Crest/Colgate toothpastes to Jason Healthy Mouth Gel, Teatree Oil &amp; Cinnamon with Flouride so I&#x27;ve been taking baby steps over to natural products. I really loved the Jason&#x27;s toothpaste but I wanted something without flouride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried about trying out this toothpasted because of the negative reveiws about it staining my teeth but I decided to try it out for myself. I&#x27;m glad I did! I really like this toothpaste :) At first I was a little off put by the consistency, but you quickly become accustomed to it and now I like it. I think the flavor is really nice and fresh too and there is no gritty feel to the paste either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really sensitive teeth (I usually eat/drink things at room temperature because the extreme temperatures are too much on my teeth). I have been using this off and on since December and I feel like my sensitivity has gone down. I was munching on frozen strawberries earlier with no problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that my teeth aren&#x27;t as pearly white BUT they don&#x27;t look yellow or brown or red. I think the difference is that there are no whiteners in this toothpaste. Despite not looking so glamourously white, my teeth look cleaner so I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could change one thing about this product it would be to boost it&#x27;s strenght in killing bad bacteria in the mouth. This toothpaste is AMAZING for your enamel but I feel like it&#x27;s lacking just a bit in the anti-tar tar area. Because of that I switch back and forth between this toothpaste and the Jason&#x27;s I mentioned earlier so I can have a more complete care regimine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great toothpaste! Well worth the price :)</li>
            <li> Fantastic! This gets my teeth cleaner, whiter, and fresher than any other paste I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried most natural brands out there. I like this better than making my own paste from coconut oil and baking soda, which I used to think was the best option. My only complaint is the packaging. It&#x27;s thick plastic. It&#x27;s difficult to work with once the tube starts to run low too.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the color this stuff is AWESOME. My son who calls my natural choices &amp;#34;witchcraft&amp;#34; (LOL) even loves this. I figured he would throw a fit when he read the ingredients but he tried it and said it was better than all of the other &amp;#34;natural crap&amp;#34; I had bought. That&#x27;s good enough for me! I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain anything harmful in the least and it makes my teeth and mouth feel clean and refreshed. The flavor of the Wintergreen is really good. We will definitely be buying again and trying the other flavors.</li>
            <li> With this flavour as well as the peppermint (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s true with all the flavours, but I&#x27;ve only tried two) you need to make sure that you shake it a few times when you first get it and for the next couple of days to make sure the essential oils are redistributed. After a few days it will be fine from then on. I forgot that from the last tube I had and had a geyser of oil on the second day. No one&#x27;s fault; I&#x27;m just warning those who don&#x27;t know. This happens with all natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I make our own tooth powder but wanted to try this earthpaste as I saw a blog on how to make your own.  It works very good, shows all natural ingredients and has a pleasant taste as well as makes your teeth very clean. Compared to my homemade tooth powder, it works just as well so I probably won&#x27;t bother making it myself but I will be happy to have this tube on hand for company.  Mostly our grandchildren visit and they are pretty awesome about using our all natural/homemade hygiene products so they&#x27;ll enjoy this a bit more than the tooth powder.  I think it would make an excellent gift if you had someone who was into natural things and you made a basket with various natural personal products and included this....what a unique gift that would be!</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste because I was having issues with allergies and regular toothpaste.  After I switched to natural toothpaste (Tom&#x27;s of Maine) and my issues didn&#x27;t get any better, I decided to try this.  It works great, and the problems I&#x27;ve been having with my gums have gone away!  It tastes great and leave my teeth feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that it&#x27;s brown, which can leave the sink looking dirty if you don&#x27;t clean it well after each use.  But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for good oral health!</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste I have used.  Second to Desert Essence gluten free toothpastes with Neem. Earthpaste was recommended to me by my dentist.  Granted it isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; as mainstream toothpastes, but for a chemical free paste..I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the brown color scare you, this is a good toothpaste alternative.  Good wintergreen flavor.  Leaves my teeth and mouth clean and fresh.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> Finally a toothpaste that isn&#x27;t secretly trying to poison us! But really... This stuff is awesome! My teeth not only feel so much cleaner than when I was brushing with the standard fluoride/ glycerin paste, but they are now getting whiter too! This is my favorite flavor too as it is the most &#x27;minty&#x27;. I have never loved my toothpaste... before now.</li>
            <li> I went with this product because it is one of the VERY FEW toothpastes that do not have fluoride AND do not have glycerin.* This product has a pleasant MILD wintergreen flavor, especially compared to the peppermint (peppermint has more of that \\&quot;mint bite.) Taste and texture is pleasant, not like using baking soda or salt. Texture is firm and grainy, but not unpleasantly so. I do not taste clay or salt, which are in the ingredients, just soft wintergreen mint. I like the lemon and cinnamon flavors too (cinnamon is more like a clove flavor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*In many studies, including in the book, \\&quot;Good Teeth, Birth to Death\\&quot; by Dr. Judd, the author explains that when we brush our teeth with a paste that has glycerin in it, the glycerin coats our teeth. Glycerin is added to pastes to moisturize and coat the teeth to protect them from stains (as a barrier). However, this coating on your teeth also prevents your enamel to regrow, or re-mineralize. Therefore, your teeth can not repair themselves and you get sensitive teeth or cavities. Our teeth are living and they have the ability to fix themselves, if given the right conditions. Research how teeth can re-mineralize and heal.</li>
            <li> This is the type of toothpaste we should all be using. It does not contain any harmful and nasty ingredients/chemicals that most toothpastes are full of. No foaming agent, no artificial coloring, just a few simple ingredients. It may look and feel a bit strange at first, but you&#x27;ll get used to it. I haven&#x27;t tried the other flavors yet but this flavor was really good. It&#x27;s a very subtle minty taste.</li>
            <li> LOVE this!  My 3yo uses this because I know she&#x27;ll be ok if she swallows it. (in fact I often find her sucking the toothpaste straight out of the tube.  It tastes great and seems to work well.  It can be a little hard to squeeze out of the bottle and has a tendency to pop and spray everywhere.</li>
            <li> Says it has traces of lead in it, not good for pregnant ladies.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients, and I like Earth Paste.  I just don&#x27;t like the taste of this one.  It tastes like wintergreen tobacco smells.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste truly lives up to its ad. My teeth are healthier or so my dentist tells me. This the only flavor that you can really taste, very refreshing.</li>
            <li> First time trying this toothpaste and have to say it does not help keep white teeth white.</li>
            <li> Takes getting used to but seems to be doing the job that regular toothpaste does without the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for toothpastes that don&#x27;t have all the popular name brand harmful ingredients in them, so when I came across Earth Paste and saw that it contains no fluoride, SLS, etc., I thought it would be worth a try. Not to mention it purports to be able to be swallowed without ill effect, albeit I haven&#x27;t tested that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just because the ingredients are not harmful, it doesn&#x27;t mean they are beneficial. I have no idea if ingredients like clay and salt actually promote dental health in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t like about Earth Paste :&lt;br /&gt;- the taste of it is quite weak, having just a slight menthol tinge to it, if that.&lt;br /&gt;- having no foaming agents in it means I have to use a lot more toothpaste than usual per brushing.&lt;br /&gt;- my teeth &amp; mouth don&#x27;t feel fresh and clean afterwards, like it does with some other brands, and I don&#x27;t like the after-taste at all.&lt;br /&gt;- it costs more than other non-fluoride/natural brands (like Grants of Australia toothpaste, which I find to be an excellent brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think I will go back to Grant&#x27;s toothpaste, as it tastes great, is fluoride and junk-free, AND leaves my teeth feeling clean and my mouth refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Regular toothpaste makes me gag. Earthpaste allows me to brush my teeth w/o the possibility of throwing up.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing but once you use it the flavor and scent go away. I do feel my teeth are as clean as when I used a regular toothpaste. I will not purchase online anymore as  I found it much cheaper at my local Sprouts store. Great product though!</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste for toddlers, and no flouride!</li>
            <li> Wow!  Seriously love this stuff!  I was a bit hesitant, but it&#x27;s amazing.  If you are debating, just give it a chance.  My favorite natural tooth paste hands down!</li>
            <li> Interesting toothpaste alternative, did not last too long.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice wintergreen flavor and I feel like my teeth are staying cleaner for a longer amount of time.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is the only toothpaste I am going to use from now on.  It gets my teeth CLEAN and WHITE.  It is also cheaper (and more natural) than other natural toothpastes, which is a bonus.  Try it!!!</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to get a toothpaste that is as natural as possible. Like all of the other people that reviewed this toothpaste, I feel like it made my mouth clean &amp; fresh (No weird aftertaste). I like that I could swallow it if I wanted to &amp; no harm would come to me. The consistency is a lot different than normal paste &amp; it sort of liquefies into the nooks &amp; crannies of your mouth. It does have a salty taste &amp; it is of course the greyish color, so the first time I used it, I jumped back &amp; gasped when I spit it out because I forgot it wasn&#x27;t white toothpaste LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would/will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Best natural toothpaste!!  I&#x27;ve tried quite a few &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; toothpastes, and this one is by far the best.  All of the others were ok but left my teeth feeling dirty.  This one leaves my teeth feeling clean.  I love it and recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to get used to.  It seems like there is barely anything you&#x27;re brushing your teeth with.</li>
            <li> This was my first time to purchase and use this product but it will not be my last!! My mouth feels so much cleaner than when I was using my regular brand of toothpaste. My children even like this toothpaste and I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients added. Try this product and you will be sold on it!</li>
            <li> Are you kidding me. &amp;#34;This product contains trace amounts of lead&amp;#34; per the packaging. How is this good for you?</li>
            <li> My all time favorite toothpaste! Tastes great, its all natural, and you can really feel a difference in the cleanliness of your mouth and teeth.</li>
            <li> It works just fine, but something in it irritated my gums pretty badly causing swelling and tenderness. Not sure what the offending ingredient is......</li>
            <li> Thrilled with the ingredients list (you could eat this stuff if you so desired). I think this is the best flavor but I have tried their cinnamon flavor and it&#x27;s not terrible. It is pleasantly abrasive (so you still get squeaky-clean). The only thing that takes some getting used to is the texture.. it isn&#x27;t foamy and it is unusual if you&#x27;ve been using toothpaste with foaming agents in it. This did wonders for reducing sensitivity due to enamel loss, presumably because of the minerals contained in this. Love it.</li>
            <li> Very nice toothpaste. I like that it is all natural. It did make my mouth a little bit dry but not like the more popular brands</li>
            <li> I like it. Great flavor. However, it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;spread&#x27; too well; the front of my teeth (where I start the brushing) ends up &#x27;muddy&#x27;, but as for the rest of my mouth...not as much. Still, I&#x27;m certain the rest of my teeth are getting some of it.</li>
            <li> I always buy this natural toothpaste as I don&#x27;t agree that our bodies can process all the chemicals that we introduce. Great taste, fast shipping, awesome product.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the blend flavor. I prefer something more minty. I think it will take me forever to use up this tube.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does not clean as well as my regular Colgate toothpaste - I wanted to try organic. I found that this was not that amazing, especially for the cost (you don&#x27;t get much for the price either) I think the best thing to do at this point for natural toothpaste is making bakingsoda paste....which would save my wallet as well.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has natural ingredients, but I had a hard time adjusting to it. It felt odd on my teeth while brushing - as if the brush was not smoothly gliding or effectively cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok as a natural toothpaste, but is thin.  It often falls off my brush before I can get it to my mouth (makes a pretty ugger mess in sink as this toothpaste is brown).  You always feel as though you need more in your mouth to do a good job.</li>
            <li> I make my own natural toothpaste but sometimes you just don&#x27;t want to buy all the ingredients and you just want to be lazy, well this is my lazy tooth paste, i love the flavour, it makes my teeth feel really clean after and even my kids will use it. the thing with natural toothpaste is that many don&#x27;t have an ingredient that kills bacteria, as kids and or you still can have cavities, but luckily this does.</li>
            <li> My teeth are the whitest  they have ever been and cleaner than they have ever been! I love Earthpaste,  I wil never go back to store bought.</li>
            <li> Disappointingly thin.  Nice flavor though.  Not sure what I think about the trace lead content.</li>
            <li> Great product. It taste good. no fluoride no artificial stuff. all natural and safe. Good price too.</li>
            <li> IT DOES TAKE GWTTING USE TO NO FOAM.  HOWEVER  I DO LIKE IT.  IT IS NATURAL AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.  IT HAS JUST A TINY BIT OF MINTY TASTE, JUST ENOUGH TO NOT TASTE BLAND. IT IS SMOOTH AND CREAMY NOT GRITTY.  THIS IS MY FIRST TUBE BUT IT SEEMS  TO WORK WELL.  I WOULD BUY IT  AGAIN</li>
            <li> The cap wouldn&#x27;t snap shut &amp; the product didn&#x27;t come out evenly.</li>
            <li> We have used Claybrite for some time with amazing results, cleaner teeth, healthier gums. I thought I would try this since it was a similar concept. However both my husband and I didn&#x27;t like the taste or the consistency as well as Claybrite. I am sure it will be effective, but we won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste! no crappy ingredients and makes my teeth feel super clean! doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; like other toothpastes, but it doesn&#x27;t matter to me. taste is good. only issue is the ingredients might not be mixed that well - i have to give the tube a few shakes before squeezing it onto my brush. also - the toothpaste is brown, which might turn people off. doesn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
            <li> Other than the color and the lack of foam, it&#x27;s just like brushing with a conventional toothpaste. I wanted to get away from the toxic chemicals of traditional toothpaste and this does the trick and it has the same minty fresh taste that I&#x27;m use to.</li>
            <li> I love that this toothpaste is so safe, that it&#x27;s free of fluoride and that I understand what all the ingredients are. I don&#x27;t love that the box I got from Amazon came with a warning label that it may contain lead! Another box I got at a local health foods store did not have that warning label. As far as effectiveness, it works alright. It&#x27;s not going to take care of garlic breath or other serious offenders, but for regular daily usage it works pretty well. Clean, fresh and it does a good job removing normal plaque. It seems to become less effective with time at dealing with morning dragon breath. I&#x27;ve been alternating it with Tom&#x27;s of Maine fluoride free spearmint, using the Tom&#x27;s as a booster or when I think the Earthpaste just isn&#x27;t going to conceal enough of my fragrant dietary bouquet.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean, stronger and the taste is nice. I was curious how long the tube would last. It&#x27;s been almost 3 months, so well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is brown and it doesn&#x27;t suds up.  But, that&#x27;s ok because I know that regular toothpaste is full of artificial ingredients and this one isn&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t taste like clay or dirt - just minty.  No way to know how effective it is at preventing cavities until I go back to the dentist in a few months. :)</li>
            <li> I like it but do not feel as though they clean your teeth. It leaves me feeling as though I need to clean it more.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  Why cant all toothpaste be natural and safe like this.  No wonder why people get cancer, its because of all the bad ingredients in everything.  This toothpaste tastes fresh and leaves my mouth clean and no worries of any cancer causing agents in this</li>
            <li> The wintergreen flavor is definitely my fave of all the flavors Earthpaste offers. However, unlike other reviewers my teeth did not get any whiter. I feel like I have to use 3 times the toothpaste. I have been using it now for about 3 months and the only positive benefit has been that it has helped with my sensitivity to hot/cold. I am not sure if I will continue to use it or not.</li>
            <li> Best working tooth paste ever. full of natural minerals to keep your teeth strong. Keep your brain healthy by being fluoride free.</li>
            <li> Best natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tested several. Flavor is really great and the non-foaming formula sets it apart.</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste based on a blog review for the product, and it did NOT disappoint. I have that \\&quot;after dentist\\&quot; feeling after each brush! I have felt that I have to sacrafice quality at times using natural products, but this one far surpasses conventional toothpaste. It tastes great, feels good in the mouth, and my teeth are very clean!</li>
            <li> Like it - I got the cinnamon though...... so not sure how the wintergreen is.</li>
            <li> I am using this. Nice flavor, works with my electric toothbrush just fine from all I can tell.</li>
            <li> This product does contain trace amounts of lead -- did not know that before purchasing -- it says so right on the label of the tube, so beware if you&#x27;re pregnant.  So I am disappointed by the integrity of the ingredients, otherwise, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Me and my son(3) both use this paste. We both love it, teeth feel smooth and clean in the morning. It takes some time to get use to non foaming toothpaste but the minty flavor is excellent. I purchased this brand because of the bentonite clay in it and it&#x27;s ability to draw infection out. Fingers are crossed it will aid in healing some cavities.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste. The smell is heavenly. My husband and I began switching to more natural products summer of last year. We changed everything except our toothpaste because we worried that a natural couldn&#x27;t do as well as our store bought well known brand had done. On a whim I watched a blogger review video of earthpaste. I purchased it to see for myself. This stuff is awesome. And the best part my teeth haven&#x27;t ever felt this clean without being at the hygienist office. Have even noticed there is not the disgusting plaque buildup by the end of day I always had before. This was a great purchase!</li>
            <li> With rumors of brand name toothpastes being hazardous with certain chemicals in them, I decided to try Earth Paste as a natural alternative.  It&#x27;s not all bubbly like the known toothpastes, but it cleans well and has a good taste.  I never understood why all things good for you have to be more expensive, but Earth Paste is more expensive than your average toothpaste.  Will I try it again?  Maybe.</li>
            <li> This is a great fluoride free, chemical free toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist even asked what I was using and he didn&#x27;t believe me. If you like the mint of regular toothpaste, but don&#x27;t want chemicals, try this!</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this product. I proved it to my friends that fluoride free, titanium dioxide free, will (those two alone) change your life! No cavities or plaque build up at the dentist this year proves my point! Give this a try. Winter mint is our favorite flavor. If only Earthpaste made it clear where they source their essential oils from... I&#x27;d be a truly happy camper!</li>
            <li> Love this product - tastes great and it&#x27;s great to brush our teeth without all the &amp;#34;junk.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Well, I guess I&#x27;m a Mud Mouth now. I only purchased the wintergreen flavored toothpaste as I noticed it on here while buying &amp;#34;First Aid&amp;#34; to help with scratches while mountain bike riding as suggested by a blog or magazine article. I have HATED normal toothpaste as for whatever reason it makes me gag when spitting it out, hence I don&#x27;t brush enough as I should for past 30 years. Fluoride treatment at the dentist, I was a puker if I didn&#x27;t sit up and lean over the bowl. So I was skeptical of the toothpaste, but for the price of a 6 pack of beer, why not try it. I knew it would look like mud going it, that didn&#x27;t bother me on bit. Used the product like normal toothpaste, slightly different feel, rised and was done. Except one thing...there was no gagging while spitting up/rinsing my mouth out. Yes, the feel left in my mouth was CLEAN yet dry....but that didn&#x27;t bother me. Was it the foaming agents that was causing me to gag the past 20-30 years? I&#x27;m not sure. I know I will be brushing daily now using this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I&#x27;m not a treehugger...well yet but after products like this....</li>
            <li> I really like the way my teeth and mouth feel after using this product. The only suggestion I would have is to make it a thicker paste.</li>
            <li> First impression is a good one. Much more pleasant than the homemade version i was using.</li>
            <li> Tastes great, safe for toddler, all natural ingredients. Exactly what we were looking for in a toothpaste! Did I mention, tastes great?</li>
            <li> I know that Earthpaste  is good for our teeth and if you swallow it is good for you body too... I just can&#x27;t get over the texture and how everytime I use it my mouth feels grose and weird.... I am not going to be buying anymore..  Though I do have friends that use it and love it.</li>
            <li> I was a little dubious about what other people had been saying, but once I tired it, I really liked it. If you really like your toothpaste to foam, it will be weird at first since it does not foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste was very mild and refreshing. The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t really taste earthy or anything like that. It is very smooth, if you&#x27;re worried about it being gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have also been very white, just like others have claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think going back and forth between this toothpaste and another natural toothpaste (such as trader joe&#x27;s brand) will create the best balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on ordering this again in the future. I have not tried any of the other flavors, so I might have to check them out.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 4 tubes of this and this one was the only one that was watery. Weird. Still use it though.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, fluoride-free toothpastes for years, but only recently found out that glycerin could interfere with enamel formation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started making my own toothpaste (baking soda, calcium magnesium powder, bentonite clay, etc.), but have never really found a recipe that I liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this toothpaste!  It&#x27;s not gritty, tastes great, and really leaves my teeth feeling clean.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will help with enamel reformation, but I am looking forward to finding out!</li>
            <li> The earth paste does make my mouth feel strange immediately after using it but, if I just give it a minute my mouth feels just as clean as using a regular toothpaste. The texture is definitely different from regular toothpastes. The flavor is good not too strong.</li>
            <li> Tasted good and worked well, left me feeling clean and fresh, and is gentle. Didn&#x27;t make my sensitive teeth ache and I&#x27;m sensitive to Sulfates, which aren&#x27;t in this product, so I had none of the typical adverse reactions I get from commercial brands. This is kind of expensive for what it is though, so I won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
            <li> This is okay. It takes a little getting used to because it has no foaming agents like most toothpastes. The main problem that I have with this is that it seems to have made my teeth more sensitive since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Ok, it does take a bit of getting used to after using the popular foamy toothpastes...but the feeling you get on your teeth is worth trying to get out of your comfort zone. Your teeth feel amazing after a good brush...like your teeth have been polished!</li>
            <li> I still feel like I need to brush my teeth again after use. It&#x27;s hard to find a junk-free product that can balance high quality ingredients with effectiveness. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great healthy toothpaste and I love it for that. It does take some getting used to, being that it&#x27;s non-foaming and its texture and taste is so unique. But I  can&#x27;t keep using it, because it does absolutely nothing to keep my teeth white. I love the toothpaste itself, but simply can&#x27;t use something that doesn&#x27;t whiten like I need. That&#x27;s really a shame since I&#x27;d love to have a healthy toothpaste that also made my teeth pure white.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for more natural toothpastes and ran into a website that recommended Earthpaste.  It makes my teeth so slick and clean and my gums are starting to look more pink, more healthy.  I also have no more bleeding when flossing.  I purchased another flavor.  Cinnamon is my favorite so far, but the Wintergreen is good too.  I want to try a few more of their flavors later.</li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth and gums feeling refreshed and clean. Not as minty as spearmint. First time trying it, pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the taste and texture of this product. It was smooth despite the clay in it. And had a very good flavor. The best part about this is it can be swallowed and is not dangerous.</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this toothpaste and find it effective and refreshing, but it is a lot more expensive than the tooth powder I was using before which really goes a long way compared to this stuff. It&#x27;s nice to switch it up every once in a while, and I&#x27;m sure I will probably buy it again eventually, but it won&#x27;t be a staple for me - I much prefer my tooth powder.</li>
            <li> Good Product. My teeth feel clean, no sugar mint taste left behind</li>
            <li> I was hoping to love it but it&#x27;s ok. The taste is fine, no issues. Texture is water and gritty at the same time. Leaves my mouth feeling clean but very dry. Oh, and the screw top definitely sucks. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have only had this a few days, and I love it. Traditional toothpaste the last year has left an overly sweet taste in my mouth, that bothers me even in the morning. I would brush my teeth for 3 -4 minutes and still find where my teeth weren&#x27;t clean.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, I thought I would see where I was after 2 minutes. My teeth were completely clean. I couldn&#x27;t find a spot that I needed to go over again. The clean feeling lasts most of the day, until it&#x27;s time to brush again. No, this doesn&#x27;t foam up, and it does get watery in the mouth. That doesn&#x27;t bother me though. The wintergreen is nice and gentle, not over powering, but enough that my breath is clean.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, my tube has a lead warning on it. I did some looking before I bought the tube, and discovered it&#x27;s a naturally occurring element in the clay. The company opted for the warning even though they could have been exempt from it to be safe. I am using less of this than I was of regular toothpaste. I have another dentist cleaning in months, so we will see how that goes, as far as plague buildup. I&#x27;m keeping this!</li>
            <li> My son and I reviewed this on our YouTube Channel. http://youtu.be/m7GBUqfxquM</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste, especially for the price. OK taste and takes a few uses to get use too. Wish the flavor was stronger, will try mint next time.</li>
            <li> My teeth and mouth just did not feel clean enough after using this product. I recognize that some people want a totally natural product and this may be the one for some, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> It is an acquired taste kinda toothpaste, but once you get use to it, it totally gets my teeth feeling cleaner than any other toothpaste I have tried.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  Not as sweet or &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; as regular toothpaste but it is not at all bad tasting…I feel much better using this natural toothpaste without all the added chemicals and fluoride.  Highly recommend.  Update:  I&#x27;ve been using a japanese binchotan charcoal toothbrush along with Earthpaste Natural toothpaste for about 4 months.  At my last dentist appointment, my hygienist (who has been cleaning my teeth for years) commented on how much whiter my teeth were, with less plaque buildup and healthier looking gums.  I guess when you work on teeth for that long, you notice these things.  She was amazed!  I knew she would be.  That&#x27;s why I brought both the binchotan toothbrush and Earthpaste along with me that day to show her.  I am convinced that these two products together is the most effective  system for cleaning, whitening and providing good overall health for my teeth.</li>
            <li> My favorite! It doesn&#x27;t foam like traditional toothpaste and it doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth super &amp;#34;wintergreeney&amp;#34; taste - which I like. I used this for about a year, then switched to something a little less expensive. About 2 months after switching I started having extremely sensitive teeth. My dentist told me to go back to what I was using (Earthpaste). I did and in a matter of days I was free of the sensitivity again. I&#x27;ll never switch - please don&#x27;t ever change your formula! I love this product!!!!</li>
