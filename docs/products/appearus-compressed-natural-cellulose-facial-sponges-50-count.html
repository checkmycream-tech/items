    <ol>
            <li> Work great, exactly what I was looking for. Im an Esthetician but don&#x27;t need to buy the 200 bulk from prof store so this works great!</li>
            <li> I use these facial cleansing sponges and cannot be without them, especially when traveling. I have found that you cannot find these at big box stores and the usual array of consumer pharmaceutical stores. While you may be able to find facial sponges, they typically  are not cellulose, &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; sponges such as these.&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are gentle to your tender facial skin, and are neither abrasive or rough.. They rinse easily, and are reusable. True, they don&#x27;t last forever - think toothbrushes, which also must be periodically replaced. But I never leave home in my travels, even overnight, without one of these tucked in my carryon.</li>
            <li> These sponges work very well.  I will order them again.</li>
            <li> Just what I thought it would be.  These are great for packing on trips too.</li>
            <li> Love these things! They make my face feel cleaner, I have rosacea so I must use gentle cleansers or it irritates my skin, these help without scratching! And as a bonus, after I use them on my face I use reuse them for household cleaning before I toss them.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful.  They hold water well, scrub well, last quite awhile, and they&#x27;re fun to watch as they puff up from water.  I love them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my fault I really didn&#x27;t understand what compressed like this meant I washed and dried them and they aren&#x27;t like the ones I had from another company so I am just giving them away to my clients to use with their cleansers, cause they aren&#x27;t going to hold up to using them on the back bar</li>
            <li> Thick and easy to travel with</li>
            <li> The sponges are wonderful. I cannot find them in the stores. I love using them for my facials.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using this kind of sponges  of fiive yrs and they really work good.</li>
            <li> Great price. Love the fact they are compressed</li>
            <li> Just what I needed - thank you!!</li>
