            <li>Nice caps</li>
            <li>BUT...One of my hobbies is baking my own bread from scratch.</li>

            <li>I was able to keep a couple of packs</li>
            <li>These caps are better suited for children.</li>
            <li>For me, these processing caps are okay.  </li>
            <li>It does its job but these processing caps could be better.</li>
            <li>, it met met my expectations :-)</li>
            <li>I reuse them many times and when the elastic gives out just toss.</li>
            <li>Much better than the ones at the beauty supplier.</li>
            <li>These caps last a couple of weeks each and are the perfect shower cap for the price.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s excellent for deep conditioning</li>

            <li>I love this cap for my hair treatments.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>These can be used more than once if you are just using them&#x27; as a shower cap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am really pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love that they are so packable and disposable that I can throw them in a gym bag or travel bag for use away from home.</li>
            <li>Most recently the caps that arrived were not the &amp;#34;Diane&amp;#34; brand (which are EXCELLENT) as described and pictured.</li>
            <li>I can never have to many of these conditioning caps.</li>

            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have found that if someone has a longer stay that they appreciate a better shower cap</li>
            <li>did order more already</li>
            <li>The processing caps are ok .</li>
            <li>Perfect shower, deep conditioner hats!</li>
            <li>Holds my hair perfectly when I do my deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>Also, more closet space without BOWLS, BOWLS EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li>Excellent buy overall!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, It helps the color penetrate better and keeps the dye from just getting everywhere while waiting to develop so one can still walk around the house while waiting.</li>
            <li>Perfectly sized and absolutely necessary for my hair care needs.  </li>
            <li>I can reuse my caps as they wear and tear overtime and don&#x27;t have to worry about buying more for a while.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>I think they are better than the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>Excellent for any and all hair processing whether it is bleach, color, or deep conditioning</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several ti condition my hair some as a backup shower cap during travels and great for cooking in the kitchen too!</li>
            <li>If I ever need more, I will order from this company again.</li>
            <li>but there could have been more cap....</li>
            <li>I will buy more of these when I run out.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize they were sending so many.  </li>
            <li>Sure, you probably donâ€™t need 100</li>
            <li>I WILL ORDER MORE,I AM PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE.</li>
            <li>Very economical!</li>
            <li>so i guess its better then the normal plastic bag that i use lol</li>
            <li>Package arrived neat and Great price with a decent quantity.</li>

            <li>They are pretty good size</li>
            <li>The price for these caps were pretty good</li>
            <li>Much needed and very cheap but good caps.</li>
            <li>They are a perfect fit for my larger head.</li>
            <li>Believe it, or not, these cheap plastic ones work better for keeping water out.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and it was able to fit my hair with room to spare.</li>
            <li>and I doubt this will fit over my head once my hair grows a bit more.</li>
            <li>So glad you get so many for such a great price.</li>
            <li>and I was able to get free shipping with it.</li>
            <li>these are perfect for what i need, but theres not much to them</li>
            <li>great quality, great fast service, would do business with these folks again, may order a second one as a gift.</li>
            <li>I am pleased about the quantity of this item and how it fits snugglely on my head full of hair :).</li>
            <li>Good thing that this brings so many,  because I find myself discarding them too quickly,  sometimes after the first use.</li>
            <li>therefore water leaks easily under rim of cap if you shower with this.  </li>
            <li>Easy shopping experience.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for those who do many deep conditioning on your hair.  </li>
            <li>They were packaged well and easily separated.  </li>
            <li>The elastic band is fairly strong and stays put where I set it.</li>
            <li>Super good price thanks!</li>
            <li>Good quality normal conditioning caps.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked out just fine.</li>
            <li>this might be fine</li>
            <li>They have a bit of an odor, but it is fine after a night.</li>
            <li>They work just fine and seem to be non-leaking.  </li>
            <li>This shower cap works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>Bulk caps cheap and easy to dispose of.</li>
            <li>The elastic was fine</li>
            <li>Fit great and love that they are so affordable fits all my long curly hair</li>
            <li>These are very flimsy shower caps that I would not recommend using more than one-time each, there are a lot of them though!</li>
            <li>These are easy to use and great for home coloring with henna and deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>For anyone with softer hair this will fit them just fine.</li>
            <li>Nice and large.</li>
            <li>Very good product that performs exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li>I have a huge lion&#x27;s mane and this cap covers it all</li>
            <li>what else is there to say besides WOOT, never going to have to buy any again after getting this huge pack.</li>
            <li>They are great for when I deep conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for hair dyeing, deep conditioning overnight, etc.</li>
            <li>I henna my hair, do oil treatments, etc., and these are indispensable.</li>
            <li>Fit over my hair clip well.</li>
            <li>Basic caps for a great price.</li>
            <li>But for now they work great especially for the price and quantity.</li>
            <li>I was in such need of this product and it has been a welcome addition to my haircare regimen.  </li>
            <li>The caps I&#x27;ve always used from the bss always fit.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with such a great value.</li>
            <li>; However, they are so cheap</li>
            <li>Such a GREAT value that you can afford to use them once and then toss.  </li>
            <li>100 caps that actually fit....</li>
            <li>They are very well made and hugs and snugs quite nice.</li>
            <li>These are so cheap I can throw them away after a week.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for some more shower caps to use for a month&#x27;s worth of my oil.  </li>
            <li>Cheap price.  </li>
            <li>I use it for myself only but it would be great for a salon too.</li>
            <li>I primarily purchased these to wear in the shower, therefore, if I set my hair in rollers and want to keep my hair from getting wet...I&#x27;m out of luck.</li>
            <li>It is great for when I deep condition overnight and want to ensure that my pillow doesn&#x27;t get soaked and all oily.</li>
            <li>Great for deep conditioning!</li>
            <li>It is cheap and functional.</li>
            <li>I have an AirBnb and these are great when someone has a short stay.  </li>
            <li>They fit anyone who has hair to the nape of the neck.</li>
            <li>but theyâ€™re cheap.  </li>
            <li>:) I am think that I will get a good amount of personal uses out of this</li>
            <li>They really worked great and are very well-priced.</li>
            <li>These are very economical  to have.</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>It looks like it rips super easily</li>
            <li>These are a good size and easily cover a dinner plate and big bowls.</li>
            <li>I have ordered these on several occasions and they are excellent caps, better than the ones I was getting from a local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>i am still using my first one :))  </li>
            <li>They are durable, well made and SO worth the money!</li>
            <li>Terriffic deal, great for long hair, does the job!</li>
            <li>I use processing caps at home often for deep conditioning treatments and love being able to get a larger quantity of them at a great price.</li>
            <li>Good quality for health and beauty treatments and many other household uses.</li>
            <li>They are great for treatments or if you just don&#x27;t want to wet your hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>The price that Amazon offers is amazing</li>
            <li>the caps are sturdy and good enough for what I&#x27;m using them for.</li>
            <li>mostly 3 at a time to cover my whole head of hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is room for a full head of hair longer than shoulder length.</li>
            <li>Might be good to ask seller which caps are currently being shipped before buying.</li>
            <li>Cool for doing hair masks, etc</li>
            <li>Good for deep conditioning too.</li>
            <li>Good enough quality</li>
            <li>The elastic starts to wear out after about a week of use, which is not bad for a disposable cap.</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>So far so good with my first cap.  </li>
            <li>They fit my largest proofing bowls, are easy to see through without lifting them and can be punctured so large batches can breath.  </li>
            <li>I have a large head, and these fit just fine.  </li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t use shower caps; but this is what she requested, and I am sure she will love them.  </li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>quick delivery too.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and packaged as pictured...10 in each bunch.</li>
            <li>Item arrived super quick.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re for the most part decent...</li>
            <li>I love these caps they can be used for many different things two of which I use them for is to protect my head from water as I shower and to cover my head for an overnight leave-in treatment process I do.</li>
            <li>These caps are just the right size and price is such a good deal.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice &amp; thick, better then ones in most beauty/drug stores.</li>
            <li>I am not a professional and cannot comment on how they would work for professionals but for my own use these work fine.</li>
            <li>They stretch too much, too easily.</li>
            <li>they are exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>and I am so happy that I paid such a little amount for so many!</li>
            <li>This is a great deal for a little money.  </li>
            <li>They are fine shower caps and price is great, but definitely do not buy these if you&#x27;re expecting them to be larger.</li>
            <li>In addition, they fit very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because I don&#x27;t have to waste my time having to wash it and reuse it.</li>
            <li>I have a LOT of hair and it all fit very well.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll get a couple of years worth of showers off this well-priced purchase.  </li>
            <li>Not re-usable but worth the money.</li>
            <li>For health reasons I have my students wear one of these caps and they appreciate it and feel more comfortable trying on the different hats.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Worth the money...</li>
            <li>Size of cap is universal and will fit mostly all heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are definately worth the price paid, I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy if you use shower cap a lot.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Price and quantity was right.</li>
            <li>Who wants to deal with trying to clean a shower cap.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying in a normal drugstore and satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li>I bought the 30-pack at first, but soon realized how handy these are and bought the larger economy pack.  </li>
            <li>These seem decent and are very economically priced.</li>
            <li>Much easier that plastic wrap and much cheaper as you can easily reuse them.  </li>
            <li>they are nice enough, but they stretch out after a few use, so will have to keep replacing, good thing</li>
            <li>My hair is long, but fine, so no difficulty with fitting my hair easily and using these as long as you aren&#x27;t trying to fit rollers under it.  </li>
            <li>They come in little bundles of ten, perfect for toting to the gym.</li>
            <li>They work great for what I had originally purchased them for: to help deep condition my wet hair in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the first one in the pack as a shower cap for almost a month now</li>
            <li>And, you can also use these caps to cover large bowls!</li>
            <li>It is a great deal at such low price.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast too.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these to all naturalistas (and hair enthusiasts) for deep conditioning, hot oil treatments, water protection, and more!</li>
            <li>Only reason I give this 4 stars is that we don&#x27;t use this product for its intended use, so I can&#x27;t make any claims on how fabulous it works for its original purpose.</li>
            <li>They work perfectly and are thin yet sturdy enough to wrap them around easily but not rip through when a heel pushes into it.</li>
            <li>They tear very easily and do not completely cover the head.</li>
            <li>will only fit the smallest of solo saddles!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>The caps barely fit adult heads.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Okay possibly for oil treatments</li>
            <li>Love my bonnet dryer for deep conditioner just wish it wasn&#x27;t so</li>
            <li>they are plastic disposable caps and are exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I suggest buying it to anyone who&#x27;s interested.</li>
            <li>However, they fit my son just as well, and he is young.</li>
            <li>I use them when I do my hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>Will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Compare these to the one from the dollar store or even the drug store even if you don&#x27;t need a larger cap the quality of these is better.</li>
            <li>We use these when doing hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>I used them to cover my head/hair for hot oil treatments.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I think I will not open any more sections.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This pack of 100 was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>first I was like &amp;#34;do</li>
            <li>Great value and each cap can be used at least twice.</li>
            <li>Very well made product!</li>
            <li>Good for covering bowls of food, shower cap, conditioning cap and terrific for putting on your bare or stockinged feet to walk through security.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>I really love this item, and I am using the caps on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>one for developing and one as a showercap the first month after the dye process.</li>
            <li>i can feel the heat upto my scalp not like before im only using a ordinary shower cap and the price is great!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I guess it can be kind of  medium size probably, but not large</li>
            <li>I also use them as shower caps -- two fit over my hair if it&#x27;s in a particularly voluminous style (puff, high bun, etc).</li>
            <li>The caps are the perfect size - not too large, not too small - I would definitely recommend and purchase again from this company.</li>
            <li>great caps, especially for lots of hair or larger heads very comfort head band, seller ships fast..</li>
            <li>And they come in handy for other things too</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to hunt down shower caps in hotel/motels any more!</li>
            <li>Simple good quality and big amount!</li>
            <li>They are also pretty large</li>
            <li>I really like these caps because of the tight fit and the fact that so many came in one packaged.</li>
            <li>I wish the company would change their product description to be more accurate, as it is definitely misleading to describe them as &amp;#34;extra large.&amp;#34; I definitely will not be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li>That said, these are beyond just durable, they are large and will cater to your protective needs.</li>
            <li>My head is rather large (I wear a 7 3/4 &amp;#34; hat)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman with a large head.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable to bath with this cap on while preventing the hair from getting wet or for coloring application.</li>
            <li>The caps are large enough to fit my curlers when showering, so I don&#x27;t have to take them out and then put on a shower cap.  </li>
            <li>They work nicely and last for several uses but they not that large...</li>
            <li>Flimsy and hard to get on, but cheap and disposable, so they&#x27;re OK.</li>
            <li>These are much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfies with this item.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>The elastic seems to have a too much stretch than what am use to.  </li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews I was hesitant about ordering these caps, but really, they&#x27;re just plastic caps for use in processing, showering, etc.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t need to last forever or fit like a glove...</li>
            <li>fit my entire head of hair</li>
            <li>Work really well.</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably with enough room for a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>And they are very durable.  </li>
            <li>I really bought this because I needed a shower cap for when I take a bath.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and as described, thanks.</li>
            <li>These caps hold up really well.</li>
            <li>I really need 100???&amp;#34;, but for the price I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying any for quite some time.</li>
            <li>They are just like the ones in the store and so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>They are very durable to use.  </li>
            <li>Helps keep our work area sanitary, and cheap enough to make them feasible for a one-time-use.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>I need to use two caps to cover my whole head of hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is just passed shoulder length and very curly</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Or I just have too much hair, which I have been told before.  </li>
            <li>These are really quality caps.</li>
            <li>AND THESE ARE SO MUCH CHEAPER THAN BUYING SEPERATELY IN THE STORE.</li>
            <li>The Diane hair conditioning caps are far better quality than the plastic caps I was purchasing from the local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly its not so delicate as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I use the cap for hot oil treatment about three times before I replace it with a new cap.</li>
            <li>and they are significantly cheaper than standard elastic food cover.</li>
            <li>I know that these will last me a VERY long time and the price was phenomenal!</li>
            <li>Great caps, wider and bigger in size a bit than what you usually get in hotels and spa.</li>
            <li>The classic saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; really struck gold here.</li>
            <li>, they are adequate but should be bigger since they say they are large.</li>
            <li>The material is thin, which I actually prefer and it kind of suctions to my wet hair which works great since that seems to help it stay in place</li>
            <li>I love the caps I just wish there was an Extra Extra Large.</li>
            <li>I use these as a liner to keep my hair dry since the material one doesn&#x27;t keep out water enough on its own.</li>
            <li>I liked the cloth line shower caps but like another reviewer said they took awhile to dry and would get gross.</li>
            <li>But these will a long time, so you really get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>Like a big bowl full of bread dough as it rises.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the caps that come in the boxes are balled up and you end up with a fist full of caps when you only wanted one.</li>
            <li>I initially loved the value for the quantity, however, I specifically chose &amp;#34;EXTRA LARGE&amp;#34; caps because I have a head full of really long and thick hair.  </li>
            <li>They also keep most product from leaking out and down neck and forehead.</li>
            <li>They are cheap little baggies, not overpriced, each lasts longer than expected, and is great to have around for those who need  their hair dry in the shower.</li>
            <li>My hair is very long and this cap still fit well.</li>
            <li>Works fine for the uses we intended them to have, but even for a male with shortish hair, this caps look small, if you have longer hair is better to look for something else</li>
            <li>but I think these are very well worth the tiny price that they cost.</li>
            <li>I would love to purchase in the future &amp; definitely recommend</li>
            <li>My only warning is for those with longer, fuller hair: mine is long and fine to medium thickness, and these one size fits all caps are just about right</li>
            <li>The elastic is good, not too weak nor to tight.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s better for shorter hair or  less density hair, I have normal density though.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these,</li>
            <li>I found these online and decided to give them a try especially since they said they were extra large fit</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a great buy for me to save time running to the bss &amp; money even though their not that expensive.</li>
            <li>n send a few more to my sister&#x27;s,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it is food safe, but I don&#x27;t really let the food touch it.</li>
            <li>There is a little more than enough room for my head of short fine hair.</li>
            <li>You would not expect to use many times for a single cap but even it only holds for 2</li>
            <li>This thing is great and will last a long time because you can reuse the caps a few times b4</li>
            <li>They fit over my Kitchen Aid 6 quart mixing bowl with plent of rooms to spare and also am assortment of other bowls I have in my kitchen.  </li>
            <li>This new pkg contains about 1/4  defective caps where the plastic is not attached to the elastic.  </li>
            <li>I use each one 7-8 times before throwing it out and getting a new one.  </li>
            <li>Because these are so cheap and meant to be disposable, I was expecting a really thin, cheaply made cap.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable too because the elastic is just loose enough and not tight around the head.</li>
            <li>Normally I pay a couple $ for 8 or less for cheap made bags, so I started using plastic shopping bags to save $.</li>
            <li>I use it for my Deep Conditioners, Tea Rinses and hot oil Treatments</li>
            <li>There are so many caps in here that I find myself using them for other things, such as to cover a paint brush between coats when I was painting my bathroom.</li>
            <li>and I can usually reuse them so it will take a while for me to need more.</li>
            <li>They are pretty big</li>
            <li>I use these to condition my hair and they are pretty durable (which allows me to use the same cap repeatedly).</li>
            <li>I was doing ACV rinses &amp;/or honey treatments, deep conditioning treatments, hot oil treatments every two wks</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair (not more than most)</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The caps are big enough to hold my long hair, and they&#x27;re pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li>They are not made for everyday shower cap use they will rip easy.</li>
            <li>The cap is not too big or small, the  elastic band holds nicely without leaving marks on my head.</li>
            <li>They are not extra Large.</li>
            <li>These are extra large.  </li>
            <li>They are large enough to do just what I wanted to do!!!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that these are extra large.</li>
            <li>But honestly it is a little cheap filling.  </li>
            <li>I have huge hair so caps never fit me.</li>
            <li>Being natural I use a lot of the plastic caps.</li>
            <li>These work very well for DIY hair treatments such as coloring, hair masks, etc.</li>
            <li>They work very well for deep conditioning.  </li>
            <li>There are no holes or anything and the caps suit my needs so far.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how generously sized these caps are and how durable.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on these bags.</li>
            <li>When I put natural dyes on my hair or conditioning treatments I use two of these to cover my hair, pulling them so they cover everything.</li>
            <li>At that price, I just throw them away after one use -- no messy cleanup.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had the elastic separate from the plastic cap.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any troubles with these caps so far.</li>
            <li>So far I have used them for henna (worn 3-4 hours) and for some coconut oil treatments (worn 1 hr each).</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>and I am a complete product junkie,</li>
            <li>We have well-water, so I throw one of these on before I shower (I&#x27;m a blonde) and it keeps the water off my hair (which keeps my hair from absorbing the minerals in the water).</li>
            <li>so maybe someone with shorter hair or straight hair wouldn&#x27;t have the same problem.</li>
            <li>I should be able to use at least 3 times.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re big, so even my 6&amp;#34; stilettos fit nicely into them and don&#x27;t damage or dirty my clothes.</li>
            <li>The elastic was old and lost it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li>I think they are made as cheap as possible and are certainly not large.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I have a normal sized head with short hair, so I was worried because they&#x27;re extra large.  </li>
            <li>Also useful for covering bowls of food in fridge, bicycle seat, and other uses.</li>
            <li>They are light, dry fast, and can be used for a few days.</li>
            <li>If you have a lot of hair, you might have to use two, as the elastic isn&#x27;t super tight.</li>
            <li>the over light turned ON to supply the small amount of heat needed to speed up the process.</li>
            <li>The elastic bands fit tight enough around my head to not allow water in when I use them as a shower cap.  </li>
            <li>They are great quality, not too loose, tight or small.</li>
            <li>These are REGULAR size caps NOT EXTRA LARGE.</li>
            <li>They fit my head very well; even though the package says \\&quot;extra large\\&quot; and my head is on the small side, the elastic band stays snug enough against my head.  </li>
            <li>They are inexpensive and work very well to keep her hair dry.</li>
            <li>The expensive ones are hot and can easily get moldy if not cleaned often</li>
            <li>They don&#x27; t split or tare easy as some that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past!  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a more economical solution from the market offerings for elastic-banded bowl covers for leftovers since they are so expensive and tada!  </li>
            <li>but I am just looking for general coverage while my color processes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one so far</li>
            <li>The info on the site is very misleading, anyone in their rite mind wouldn&#x27;t purchase a pack of 100 individual caps for $22, the caps are sold locally for $7.99 for the same amount.  </li>
            <li>Being a 4c natural and between dyeing my hair and deep conditioning</li>
            <li>I have no regrets with these disposable processing caps.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on these low quality bags.</li>
            <li>I have started treating my hair with coconut oil a couple of times a week because I had read several places that this would improve the condition of my hair (so far, seems to be working).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not sure you would want to use these in place of real shower caps, for actually keeping water out of your hair while showering or bathing, as they&#x27;re pretty flimsy.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to use with at home deep conditioning treatments because scrubbing out my shower cap after using an oil treatment was getting old.  </li>
            <li>I Got this because i went natural and will be doing my hair at home alot and dont want to use shopping bags for my deep condition treatment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i received 100 pack and didnt spent that much,&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommed it !</li>
            <li>the paint stays fresh without having to put on the messy paint can lid.</li>
            <li>I usually use two shower caps to cover my full head and hair when conditioning and when applying henna.  </li>
            <li>I have thick wavy shoulder-length hair and these fit me well with room to spare.</li>
            <li>the size of these caps will snuggly fit your head and hair that is thick and to bra strap length.</li>
            <li>Worth purchasing so hair coloring doesn&#x27;t run down your face and back.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hard to clean around the elastic creased</li>
            <li>I am a retired old coot and do not have enough hair left on my head to worry about...</li>
            <li>I bought this big bag of caps because I deep condition my hair or do henna treatments quite frequently.</li>
            <li>I ended up giving them to my eight year old daughter to wear because they are not big enough for me!</li>
            <li>just large enough if you pack all of your hair down as if you&#x27;re putting on a wig.</li>
            <li>large enough for lots of natural hair, tight enough around the head so no product drips and sturdy enough for multiple uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and not flimsy and the band does not stretch out quickly.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and band is tight and stays well on head.  </li>

            <li> Nice quality</li>
            <li> Fast shipment - great value!</li>
            <li> Nice size for coloring hair and sitting under a heat cap.</li>
            <li> Good if I have my hair up in jumbo rollers and need to pull a top over my head</li>
            <li> I have always liked using hotel shower caps.</li>
            <li> So many and good quality.</li>
            <li> Nice caps</li>
            <li> BUT...One of my hobbies is baking my own bread from scratch.</li>
            <li> I also use these when I do oil treatments, they hold the hair in, warm my scalp, and let the treatment soak in nicely.</li>
            <li> Really liked these</li>
            <li> Have used each many times in shower, are fairly sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Well packed , and they did the job nicely, I shared it whit my mom and sister</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to leave warm house to get it.</li>
            <li> so these def come in handy.</li>
            <li> so you can store the rest and have just one roll handy.</li>
            <li> I can use during warm shower to condition the hair with cream treatment and just dispose it after use.</li>
            <li> The size is good for folks with more hair.</li>
            <li> this is ok but it can not keep around your head as well, so if you use a lot something like oil, it leak.but generally is good</li>
            <li> This fit very nicely and stay put.  </li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I got this many in the pack.  </li>
            <li> You get so many for the price by buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this in bulk.</li>
            <li> I was able to keep a couple of packs</li>
            <li> These caps are better suited for children.</li>
            <li> For me, these processing caps are okay.  </li>
            <li> It does its job but these processing caps could be better.</li>
            <li> , it met met my expectations :-)</li>
            <li> I reuse them many times and when the elastic gives out just toss.</li>
            <li> Much better than the ones at the beauty supplier.</li>
            <li> These caps last a couple of weeks each and are the perfect shower cap for the price.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s excellent for deep conditioning</li>
            <li> I have had better processing caps.  </li>
            <li> I love buying things that I use a lot in bulk.  </li>
            <li> always love the plastic caps.</li>
            <li> You can use this as most once.</li>
            <li> Had so many, gave some to fellow rider who takes youngsters out riding.</li>
            <li> I love these caps.</li>
            <li> I love this cap for my hair treatments.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> These can be used more than once if you are just using them&#x27; as a shower cap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am really pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love that they are so packable and disposable that I can throw them in a gym bag or travel bag for use away from home.</li>
            <li> Most recently the caps that arrived were not the &amp;#34;Diane&amp;#34; brand (which are EXCELLENT) as described and pictured.</li>
            <li> I can never have to many of these conditioning caps.</li>
            <li> Love them..</li>
            <li> Love that it comes with so many so that I don&#x27;t have to rewash them over</li>
            <li> this is a lifetime supply for me, it would seem :))</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I have found that if someone has a longer stay that they appreciate a better shower cap</li>
            <li> did order more already</li>
            <li> The processing caps are ok .</li>
            <li> Perfect shower, deep conditioner hats!</li>
            <li> Holds my hair perfectly when I do my deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> Also, more closet space without BOWLS, BOWLS EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy overall!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, It helps the color penetrate better and keeps the dye from just getting everywhere while waiting to develop so one can still walk around the house while waiting.</li>
            <li> Perfectly sized and absolutely necessary for my hair care needs.  </li>
            <li> I can reuse my caps as they wear and tear overtime and don&#x27;t have to worry about buying more for a while.</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> I think they are better than the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Excellent for any and all hair processing whether it is bleach, color, or deep conditioning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several ti condition my hair some as a backup shower cap during travels and great for cooking in the kitchen too!</li>
            <li> If I ever need more, I will order from this company again.</li>
            <li> but there could have been more cap....</li>
            <li> I will buy more of these when I run out.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize they were sending so many.  </li>
            <li> Sure, you probably donâ€™t need 100</li>
            <li> I WILL ORDER MORE,I AM PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> Very economical!</li>
            <li> so i guess its better then the normal plastic bag that i use lol</li>
            <li> Package arrived neat and Great price with a decent quantity.</li>
            <li> Great value, well packaged, high quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Best deal I&#x27;ve found in a long time.</li>
            <li> Perfect for conditioning my long hair.</li>
            <li> They are pretty good size</li>
            <li> The price for these caps were pretty good</li>
            <li> Much needed and very cheap but good caps.</li>
            <li> They are a perfect fit for my larger head.</li>
            <li> Believe it, or not, these cheap plastic ones work better for keeping water out.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it was able to fit my hair with room to spare.</li>
            <li> and I doubt this will fit over my head once my hair grows a bit more.</li>
            <li> So glad you get so many for such a great price.</li>
            <li> and I was able to get free shipping with it.</li>
            <li> these are perfect for what i need, but theres not much to them</li>
            <li> great quality, great fast service, would do business with these folks again, may order a second one as a gift.</li>
            <li> I am pleased about the quantity of this item and how it fits snugglely on my head full of hair :).</li>
            <li> Good thing that this brings so many,  because I find myself discarding them too quickly,  sometimes after the first use.</li>
            <li> therefore water leaks easily under rim of cap if you shower with this.  </li>
            <li> Easy shopping experience.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for those who do many deep conditioning on your hair.  </li>
            <li> They were packaged well and easily separated.  </li>
            <li> The elastic band is fairly strong and stays put where I set it.</li>
            <li> Super good price thanks!</li>
            <li> Good quality normal conditioning caps.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked out just fine.</li>
            <li> this might be fine</li>
            <li> They have a bit of an odor, but it is fine after a night.</li>
            <li> They work just fine and seem to be non-leaking.  </li>
            <li> This shower cap works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Bulk caps cheap and easy to dispose of.</li>
            <li> The elastic was fine</li>
            <li> Fit great and love that they are so affordable fits all my long curly hair</li>
            <li> These are very flimsy shower caps that I would not recommend using more than one-time each, there are a lot of them though!</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and great for home coloring with henna and deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> For anyone with softer hair this will fit them just fine.</li>
            <li> Nice and large.</li>
            <li> Very good product that performs exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> I have a huge lion&#x27;s mane and this cap covers it all</li>
            <li> what else is there to say besides WOOT, never going to have to buy any again after getting this huge pack.</li>
            <li> They are great for when I deep conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for hair dyeing, deep conditioning overnight, etc.</li>
            <li> I henna my hair, do oil treatments, etc., and these are indispensable.</li>
            <li> Fit over my hair clip well.</li>
            <li> Basic caps for a great price.</li>
            <li> But for now they work great especially for the price and quantity.</li>
            <li> I was in such need of this product and it has been a welcome addition to my haircare regimen.  </li>
            <li> The caps I&#x27;ve always used from the bss always fit.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with such a great value.</li>
            <li> ; However, they are so cheap</li>
            <li> Such a GREAT value that you can afford to use them once and then toss.  </li>
            <li> 100 caps that actually fit....</li>
            <li> They are very well made and hugs and snugs quite nice.</li>
            <li> These are so cheap I can throw them away after a week.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for some more shower caps to use for a month&#x27;s worth of my oil.  </li>
            <li> Cheap price.  </li>
            <li> I use it for myself only but it would be great for a salon too.</li>
            <li> I primarily purchased these to wear in the shower, therefore, if I set my hair in rollers and want to keep my hair from getting wet...I&#x27;m out of luck.</li>
            <li> It is great for when I deep condition overnight and want to ensure that my pillow doesn&#x27;t get soaked and all oily.</li>
            <li> Great for deep conditioning!</li>
            <li> It is cheap and functional.</li>
            <li> I have an AirBnb and these are great when someone has a short stay.  </li>
            <li> They fit anyone who has hair to the nape of the neck.</li>
            <li> but theyâ€™re cheap.  </li>
            <li> :) I am think that I will get a good amount of personal uses out of this</li>
            <li> They really worked great and are very well-priced.</li>
            <li> These are very economical  to have.</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> It looks like it rips super easily</li>
            <li> These are a good size and easily cover a dinner plate and big bowls.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these on several occasions and they are excellent caps, better than the ones I was getting from a local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> i am still using my first one :))  </li>
            <li> They are durable, well made and SO worth the money!</li>
            <li> Terriffic deal, great for long hair, does the job!</li>
            <li> I use processing caps at home often for deep conditioning treatments and love being able to get a larger quantity of them at a great price.</li>
            <li> Good quality for health and beauty treatments and many other household uses.</li>
            <li> They are great for treatments or if you just don&#x27;t want to wet your hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> The price that Amazon offers is amazing</li>
            <li> the caps are sturdy and good enough for what I&#x27;m using them for.</li>
            <li> mostly 3 at a time to cover my whole head of hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is room for a full head of hair longer than shoulder length.</li>
            <li> Might be good to ask seller which caps are currently being shipped before buying.</li>
            <li> Cool for doing hair masks, etc</li>
            <li> Good for deep conditioning too.</li>
            <li> Good enough quality</li>
            <li> The elastic starts to wear out after about a week of use, which is not bad for a disposable cap.</li>
            <li> Not bad.  </li>
            <li> So far so good with my first cap.  </li>
            <li> They fit my largest proofing bowls, are easy to see through without lifting them and can be punctured so large batches can breath.  </li>
            <li> I have a large head, and these fit just fine.  </li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t use shower caps; but this is what she requested, and I am sure she will love them.  </li>
            <li> Lucky for me</li>
            <li> quick delivery too.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and packaged as pictured...10 in each bunch.</li>
            <li> Item arrived super quick.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re for the most part decent...</li>
            <li> I love these caps they can be used for many different things two of which I use them for is to protect my head from water as I shower and to cover my head for an overnight leave-in treatment process I do.</li>
            <li> These caps are just the right size and price is such a good deal.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice &amp; thick, better then ones in most beauty/drug stores.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional and cannot comment on how they would work for professionals but for my own use these work fine.</li>
            <li> They stretch too much, too easily.</li>
            <li> they are exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> and I am so happy that I paid such a little amount for so many!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for a little money.  </li>
            <li> They are fine shower caps and price is great, but definitely do not buy these if you&#x27;re expecting them to be larger.</li>
            <li> In addition, they fit very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great because I don&#x27;t have to waste my time having to wash it and reuse it.</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of hair and it all fit very well.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll get a couple of years worth of showers off this well-priced purchase.  </li>
            <li> Not re-usable but worth the money.</li>
            <li> For health reasons I have my students wear one of these caps and they appreciate it and feel more comfortable trying on the different hats.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Worth the money...</li>
            <li> Size of cap is universal and will fit mostly all heads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are definately worth the price paid, I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy if you use shower cap a lot.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Price and quantity was right.</li>
            <li> Who wants to deal with trying to clean a shower cap.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying in a normal drugstore and satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> I bought the 30-pack at first, but soon realized how handy these are and bought the larger economy pack.  </li>
            <li> These seem decent and are very economically priced.</li>
            <li> Much easier that plastic wrap and much cheaper as you can easily reuse them.  </li>
            <li> they are nice enough, but they stretch out after a few use, so will have to keep replacing, good thing</li>
            <li> My hair is long, but fine, so no difficulty with fitting my hair easily and using these as long as you aren&#x27;t trying to fit rollers under it.  </li>
            <li> They come in little bundles of ten, perfect for toting to the gym.</li>
            <li> They work great for what I had originally purchased them for: to help deep condition my wet hair in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the first one in the pack as a shower cap for almost a month now</li>
            <li> And, you can also use these caps to cover large bowls!</li>
            <li> It is a great deal at such low price.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast too.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these to all naturalistas (and hair enthusiasts) for deep conditioning, hot oil treatments, water protection, and more!</li>
            <li> Only reason I give this 4 stars is that we don&#x27;t use this product for its intended use, so I can&#x27;t make any claims on how fabulous it works for its original purpose.</li>
            <li> They work perfectly and are thin yet sturdy enough to wrap them around easily but not rip through when a heel pushes into it.</li>
            <li> They tear very easily and do not completely cover the head.</li>
            <li> will only fit the smallest of solo saddles!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> The caps barely fit adult heads.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Okay possibly for oil treatments</li>
            <li> Love my bonnet dryer for deep conditioner just wish it wasn&#x27;t so</li>
            <li> they are plastic disposable caps and are exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I suggest buying it to anyone who&#x27;s interested.</li>
            <li> However, they fit my son just as well, and he is young.</li>
            <li> I use them when I do my hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> Will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Compare these to the one from the dollar store or even the drug store even if you don&#x27;t need a larger cap the quality of these is better.</li>
            <li> We use these when doing hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> I used them to cover my head/hair for hot oil treatments.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I think I will not open any more sections.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This pack of 100 was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> first I was like &amp;#34;do</li>
            <li> Great value and each cap can be used at least twice.</li>
            <li> Very well made product!</li>
            <li> Good for covering bowls of food, shower cap, conditioning cap and terrific for putting on your bare or stockinged feet to walk through security.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> I really love this item, and I am using the caps on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> one for developing and one as a showercap the first month after the dye process.</li>
            <li> i can feel the heat upto my scalp not like before im only using a ordinary shower cap and the price is great!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I guess it can be kind of  medium size probably, but not large</li>
            <li> I also use them as shower caps -- two fit over my hair if it&#x27;s in a particularly voluminous style (puff, high bun, etc).</li>
            <li> The caps are the perfect size - not too large, not too small - I would definitely recommend and purchase again from this company.</li>
            <li> great caps, especially for lots of hair or larger heads very comfort head band, seller ships fast..</li>
            <li> And they come in handy for other things too</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to hunt down shower caps in hotel/motels any more!</li>
            <li> Simple good quality and big amount!</li>
            <li> They are also pretty large</li>
            <li> I really like these caps because of the tight fit and the fact that so many came in one packaged.</li>
            <li> I wish the company would change their product description to be more accurate, as it is definitely misleading to describe them as &amp;#34;extra large.&amp;#34; I definitely will not be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> That said, these are beyond just durable, they are large and will cater to your protective needs.</li>
            <li> My head is rather large (I wear a 7 3/4 &amp;#34; hat)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman with a large head.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable to bath with this cap on while preventing the hair from getting wet or for coloring application.</li>
            <li> The caps are large enough to fit my curlers when showering, so I don&#x27;t have to take them out and then put on a shower cap.  </li>
            <li> They work nicely and last for several uses but they not that large...</li>
            <li> Flimsy and hard to get on, but cheap and disposable, so they&#x27;re OK.</li>
            <li> These are much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfies with this item.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> The elastic seems to have a too much stretch than what am use to.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I was hesitant about ordering these caps, but really, they&#x27;re just plastic caps for use in processing, showering, etc.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t need to last forever or fit like a glove...</li>
            <li> fit my entire head of hair</li>
            <li> Work really well.</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably with enough room for a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> And they are very durable.  </li>
            <li> I really bought this because I needed a shower cap for when I take a bath.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and as described, thanks.</li>
            <li> These caps hold up really well.</li>
            <li> I really need 100???&amp;#34;, but for the price I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying any for quite some time.</li>
            <li> They are just like the ones in the store and so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> They are very durable to use.  </li>
            <li> Helps keep our work area sanitary, and cheap enough to make them feasible for a one-time-use.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> I need to use two caps to cover my whole head of hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is just passed shoulder length and very curly</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Or I just have too much hair, which I have been told before.  </li>
            <li> These are really quality caps.</li>
            <li> AND THESE ARE SO MUCH CHEAPER THAN BUYING SEPERATELY IN THE STORE.</li>
            <li> The Diane hair conditioning caps are far better quality than the plastic caps I was purchasing from the local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly its not so delicate as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I use the cap for hot oil treatment about three times before I replace it with a new cap.</li>
            <li> and they are significantly cheaper than standard elastic food cover.</li>
            <li> I know that these will last me a VERY long time and the price was phenomenal!</li>
            <li> Great caps, wider and bigger in size a bit than what you usually get in hotels and spa.</li>
            <li> The classic saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; really struck gold here.</li>
            <li> , they are adequate but should be bigger since they say they are large.</li>
            <li> The material is thin, which I actually prefer and it kind of suctions to my wet hair which works great since that seems to help it stay in place</li>
            <li> I love the caps I just wish there was an Extra Extra Large.</li>
            <li> I use these as a liner to keep my hair dry since the material one doesn&#x27;t keep out water enough on its own.</li>
            <li> I liked the cloth line shower caps but like another reviewer said they took awhile to dry and would get gross.</li>
            <li> But these will a long time, so you really get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> Like a big bowl full of bread dough as it rises.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the caps that come in the boxes are balled up and you end up with a fist full of caps when you only wanted one.</li>
            <li> I initially loved the value for the quantity, however, I specifically chose &amp;#34;EXTRA LARGE&amp;#34; caps because I have a head full of really long and thick hair.  </li>
            <li> They also keep most product from leaking out and down neck and forehead.</li>
            <li> They are cheap little baggies, not overpriced, each lasts longer than expected, and is great to have around for those who need  their hair dry in the shower.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and this cap still fit well.</li>
            <li> Works fine for the uses we intended them to have, but even for a male with shortish hair, this caps look small, if you have longer hair is better to look for something else</li>
            <li> but I think these are very well worth the tiny price that they cost.</li>
            <li> I would love to purchase in the future &amp; definitely recommend</li>
            <li> My only warning is for those with longer, fuller hair: mine is long and fine to medium thickness, and these one size fits all caps are just about right</li>
            <li> The elastic is good, not too weak nor to tight.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s better for shorter hair or  less density hair, I have normal density though.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these,</li>
            <li> I found these online and decided to give them a try especially since they said they were extra large fit</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a great buy for me to save time running to the bss &amp; money even though their not that expensive.</li>
            <li> n send a few more to my sister&#x27;s,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is food safe, but I don&#x27;t really let the food touch it.</li>
            <li> There is a little more than enough room for my head of short fine hair.</li>
            <li> You would not expect to use many times for a single cap but even it only holds for 2</li>
            <li> This thing is great and will last a long time because you can reuse the caps a few times b4</li>
            <li> They fit over my Kitchen Aid 6 quart mixing bowl with plent of rooms to spare and also am assortment of other bowls I have in my kitchen.  </li>
            <li> This new pkg contains about 1/4  defective caps where the plastic is not attached to the elastic.  </li>
            <li> I use each one 7-8 times before throwing it out and getting a new one.  </li>
            <li> Because these are so cheap and meant to be disposable, I was expecting a really thin, cheaply made cap.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable too because the elastic is just loose enough and not tight around the head.</li>
            <li> Normally I pay a couple $ for 8 or less for cheap made bags, so I started using plastic shopping bags to save $.</li>
            <li> I use it for my Deep Conditioners, Tea Rinses and hot oil Treatments</li>
            <li> There are so many caps in here that I find myself using them for other things, such as to cover a paint brush between coats when I was painting my bathroom.</li>
            <li> and I can usually reuse them so it will take a while for me to need more.</li>
            <li> They are pretty big</li>
            <li> I use these to condition my hair and they are pretty durable (which allows me to use the same cap repeatedly).</li>
            <li> I was doing ACV rinses &amp;/or honey treatments, deep conditioning treatments, hot oil treatments every two wks</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair (not more than most)</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The caps are big enough to hold my long hair, and they&#x27;re pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li> They are not made for everyday shower cap use they will rip easy.</li>
            <li> The cap is not too big or small, the  elastic band holds nicely without leaving marks on my head.</li>
            <li> They are not extra Large.</li>
            <li> These are extra large.  </li>
            <li> They are large enough to do just what I wanted to do!!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that these are extra large.</li>
            <li> But honestly it is a little cheap filling.  </li>
            <li> I have huge hair so caps never fit me.</li>
            <li> Being natural I use a lot of the plastic caps.</li>
            <li> These work very well for DIY hair treatments such as coloring, hair masks, etc.</li>
            <li> They work very well for deep conditioning.  </li>
            <li> There are no holes or anything and the caps suit my needs so far.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how generously sized these caps are and how durable.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on these bags.</li>
            <li> When I put natural dyes on my hair or conditioning treatments I use two of these to cover my hair, pulling them so they cover everything.</li>
            <li> At that price, I just throw them away after one use -- no messy cleanup.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had the elastic separate from the plastic cap.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any troubles with these caps so far.</li>
            <li> So far I have used them for henna (worn 3-4 hours) and for some coconut oil treatments (worn 1 hr each).</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> and I am a complete product junkie,</li>
            <li> We have well-water, so I throw one of these on before I shower (I&#x27;m a blonde) and it keeps the water off my hair (which keeps my hair from absorbing the minerals in the water).</li>
            <li> so maybe someone with shorter hair or straight hair wouldn&#x27;t have the same problem.</li>
            <li> I should be able to use at least 3 times.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re big, so even my 6&amp;#34; stilettos fit nicely into them and don&#x27;t damage or dirty my clothes.</li>
            <li> The elastic was old and lost it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> I think they are made as cheap as possible and are certainly not large.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I have a normal sized head with short hair, so I was worried because they&#x27;re extra large.  </li>
            <li> Also useful for covering bowls of food in fridge, bicycle seat, and other uses.</li>
            <li> They are light, dry fast, and can be used for a few days.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of hair, you might have to use two, as the elastic isn&#x27;t super tight.</li>
            <li> the over light turned ON to supply the small amount of heat needed to speed up the process.</li>
            <li> The elastic bands fit tight enough around my head to not allow water in when I use them as a shower cap.  </li>
            <li> They are great quality, not too loose, tight or small.</li>
            <li> These are REGULAR size caps NOT EXTRA LARGE.</li>
            <li> They fit my head very well; even though the package says \\&quot;extra large\\&quot; and my head is on the small side, the elastic band stays snug enough against my head.  </li>
            <li> They are inexpensive and work very well to keep her hair dry.</li>
            <li> The expensive ones are hot and can easily get moldy if not cleaned often</li>
            <li> They don&#x27; t split or tare easy as some that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a more economical solution from the market offerings for elastic-banded bowl covers for leftovers since they are so expensive and tada!  </li>
            <li> but I am just looking for general coverage while my color processes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one so far</li>
            <li> The info on the site is very misleading, anyone in their rite mind wouldn&#x27;t purchase a pack of 100 individual caps for $22, the caps are sold locally for $7.99 for the same amount.  </li>
            <li> Being a 4c natural and between dyeing my hair and deep conditioning</li>
            <li> I have no regrets with these disposable processing caps.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on these low quality bags.</li>
            <li> I have started treating my hair with coconut oil a couple of times a week because I had read several places that this would improve the condition of my hair (so far, seems to be working).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure you would want to use these in place of real shower caps, for actually keeping water out of your hair while showering or bathing, as they&#x27;re pretty flimsy.  </li>
            <li> I bought these to use with at home deep conditioning treatments because scrubbing out my shower cap after using an oil treatment was getting old.  </li>
            <li> I Got this because i went natural and will be doing my hair at home alot and dont want to use shopping bags for my deep condition treatment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i received 100 pack and didnt spent that much,&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommed it !</li>
            <li> the paint stays fresh without having to put on the messy paint can lid.</li>
            <li> I usually use two shower caps to cover my full head and hair when conditioning and when applying henna.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy shoulder-length hair and these fit me well with room to spare.</li>
            <li> the size of these caps will snuggly fit your head and hair that is thick and to bra strap length.</li>
            <li> Worth purchasing so hair coloring doesn&#x27;t run down your face and back.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to clean around the elastic creased</li>
            <li> I am a retired old coot and do not have enough hair left on my head to worry about...</li>
            <li> I bought this big bag of caps because I deep condition my hair or do henna treatments quite frequently.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving them to my eight year old daughter to wear because they are not big enough for me!</li>
            <li> just large enough if you pack all of your hair down as if you&#x27;re putting on a wig.</li>
            <li> large enough for lots of natural hair, tight enough around the head so no product drips and sturdy enough for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and not flimsy and the band does not stretch out quickly.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and band is tight and stays well on head.  </li>
            <li> However, the first one I&#x27;ve used, for keeping my hair dry as I shower, has lasted a few weeks already.</li>
            <li> If you have SUPER THICK  AND LONG HAIR...</li>
            <li> These do not fit my head well, and I have a very small head compared to most people.  </li>
            <li> These are a little on the small side, but they still fit over my updo</li>
            <li> The caps are big enough for my long hair.</li>
            <li> This is large for a small child&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The elastic is pretty strong, though. :-(</li>
            <li> I have used the same cap for the last three colourings, just rinse and let dry.</li>
            <li> These caps are very flimsy and too small.  </li>
            <li> I can get several wears with one cap before it gets stretched out of shape.  </li>
            <li> And they last a long time</li>
            <li> Since there are 100 caps, this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> She is seeing how long just one will last.</li>
            <li> I hardly can fit it in there, need to try to find some ways to take less space so it fits properly and doesn&#x27;t make my hair wet</li>
            <li> I like buying in bulk so these will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> this will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I now have a VERY long supply, and they are the same quality as those 4times the cost.</li>
            <li> Simply rinse it out, turn inside out and dry.</li>
            <li> I just air dry it and reuse it several times before throwing it away.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about them being cheap and flimsy but there aren&#x27;t any different from baggies you&#x27;d buy at sally&#x27;s...except the price that is...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to last me a long, long time.</li>
            <li> The caps are very large and fits my hair even with crazy updos or a head of large rollers.</li>
            <li> My 100-pack is going to last a very long time!</li>
            <li> However, technically, they&#x27;re not marketed for such a use anyway (although I note that some of the other reviewers use them for just this purpose).  </li>
            <li> The medicine/oil itself comes with two shower caps, but I usually can only get one use out of them before they&#x27;ve stretched out completely.  </li>
            <li> I use them in the shower, for rainy days when I don&#x27;t want to get my hair wet, and when I&#x27;m deep conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> so if you have long hair it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  </li>
            <li> Also, the elastic around the cap does not get baggy after it has been stretched when you have placed over your head.  </li>
            <li> and they work for treatments on long hair using two</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it all fits underneath.  </li>
            <li> These shower caps are larger and thicker than I expected.  </li>
            <li> They are slightly smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I am so guilty of using my shower caps until they are totally stretched out and finding the cheap ones like these at the dollar store is always a hassle</li>
            <li> Especially since I could use the same one 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m finding other uses for them like putting them on my shoes when I pack for trips (putting on hotel tv remote for that matter), or putting it on my iPad when I need to read recipes while cooking</li>
            <li> I use these to deep condition and to keep my hair from getting wet in the shower!</li>
            <li> These are smaller and thinner than the caps I usually get from the local beauty supply store, but they definitely work in a pinch!</li>
            <li> one for the front abs the other for the back .</li>
            <li> I  use these to protect my hair when bathing between washing my hair (I have very long hair</li>
            <li> (I have very long hair)</li>
            <li> They keep my hair mostly dry.</li>
            <li> I have waist-length, color-treated hair that tends to dry out.  </li>
            <li> They get the job done, keep my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I have an oil to put on my scalp overnight to get rid of dry, flakey skin</li>
            <li> you  have straight or very short thin hair</li>
            <li> Decent quality that lasts for a week at least.</li>
            <li> Even though the material is thin, I found it to be pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> There elastic band is too loose to keep the cap on my head.</li>
            <li> On the thin and small size but using for hair treatments and then throw away - works fine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll run out of caps for a very long time!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t keep all of my hair dry like they used to!</li>
            <li> At my local hair place I got way less than this for almost the price I paid for these</li>
            <li> The plastic was different and they were not as well constructed as the &amp;#34;Diane&amp;#34; brand caps that I received previously.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about only half my hair getting conditioned.</li>
            <li> Buying in bulk makes them very affordable, 100 will last me a few years at least for less that 10$</li>
            <li> They do seem a little smaller than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered that 100 caps would last into eternity, or at least for the next 10 years.</li>
            <li> You get what you expected.</li>
            <li> without getting product everywhere, or for just taking a shower without getting your hair wet.</li>
            <li> This did not cover my hair the way I expected it to.</li>
            <li> W#aste of money - this product has absolutely NO elasticity</li>
            <li> Yes it does product the hair from getting wet while in the shower</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> therefore there is no mold build up in the cap or a wet shower cap hanging around the bath room.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use them as shower caps when my hair is done to keep my hair from getting wet and as processing caps for deep/heat conditioning treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Not low quality at all, I haven&#x27;t had trouble with them tearing or anything.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and shouldn&#x27;t run out anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair roughly 3 times a year, and in that year I&#x27;d end up using just 6 of these.</li>
            <li> i used to go to the beauty supply to buy this caps, and spent like 3.99 for a pack of 10 caps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much to say, 100 plastic caps.</li>
            <li> They are what I expected.  </li>
            <li> but if you are a natural  girl with thick growing hair these caps will not work for you.</li>
            <li> I have thick natural hair that&#x27;s shoulder length</li>
            <li> Deep conditioning and as a plain shower cap.</li>
            <li> Other caps I&#x27;ve tried have an elastic band that is way too loose!</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy when I pulled out the first bag because they seemed a bit thin</li>
            <li> These keep my cap dry and can be easily hidden.</li>
            <li> Some were so small they would not fit on&lt;br /&gt;an adult head.</li>
            <li> Sally&#x27;s is really going overboard with prices lately.</li>
            <li> I have hair almost to my back, but I have thin hair and the shower caps barely fits.</li>
            <li> and I have middle long thick hair</li>
            <li> Which solves the common complaint of the standard food covers... not big enough!</li>
            <li> While they are indeed thin, they are not so thin that they fall apart easily.  </li>
            <li> usually use for my deep conditioners..</li>
            <li> That is not always the case with other caps.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day and one lasts for a quite some time.</li>
            <li> I should have went with my gut and listened to some of the other Amazon reviews that talked about the size.</li>
            <li> ,  will look elsewhere for other brand caps.</li>
            <li> I put my hair up in a clip to take a shower and other shower caps</li>
            <li> There was lot of dust and other stuff stuck on caps which were on outer side of each bundle</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put these over my head, so if that&#x27;s what you want to do with them, read the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found with other XL caps, that one cap is sufficient.</li>
            <li> The caps were too loose; did not fit as snugly around my head as I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just now getting a little stretched out!!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also relatively expensive, especially when I need to replace my old ones.</li>
            <li> I mean, who knew it would take so long to find something that fit well and wasn&#x27;t awkward to sleep in?  </li>
            <li> I also use them on my puppy by making a hole and slipping it over her head to protect her little ears during a bath.</li>
            <li> I have very thick natural hair longer than a twa but not  at my neck.</li>
            <li> I know these will last me and my daughter for at least 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price</li>
            <li> I use these for my deep conditioning treatments that I do at least one/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a larger disposable processing cap as my hair is quite thick</li>
            <li> They are small like others have said and I need them to be bigger for my long thick hair.</li>
            <li> and I have a lot of thick coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> They are so thick and durable I only need one</li>
            <li> find these are good for working under nasty rusty/oily cars</li>
            <li> These are the typical shower caps and get the job done.</li>
            <li> But a little too small to cover all my dry hair pulled up.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t want a drippy mess.  </li>
            <li> but if you have a lot of long thick hair</li>
            <li> She has long, thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and about 10 inches long.  </li>
            <li> put a terry clothe turban over it..as they are not to tight</li>
            <li> The elastic band isn&#x27;t tight at all</li>
            <li> Not too tight of an elastic edge.  </li>
            <li> The elastic is still tight and the plastic has not torn.</li>
            <li> They are pretty flimsy and a bit difficult to put on (I have medium /long thick hair), but they get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> little headed people.&lt;br /&gt;Using to cover telescope aperture.</li>
            <li> These might be a little snug for anlot of hair.</li>
            <li> Fits my head with a little room to spare.  </li>
            <li> They are not too heavy or too tight .</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and is still growing so eventually these won&#x27;t work for me in the future.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also cheap enough that I don&#x27;t feel terribly wasteful when I do throw them out, if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone says to just use plastic wrap but that is messy and a PITA.</li>
            <li> you wanted to, you could probably get a few uses out of each.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will probably not fit those who have</li>
            <li> Did have a few where the elastic loosed, but wasn&#x27;t an issue for my usage.</li>
            <li> I use these caps for everyday use and have no problems.</li>
            <li> Had to throw these away because they are too thin, don&#x27;t stay on the head, and last for seconds.</li>
            <li> I use the disposable caps now for a few times before throwing them out (which is about once every two weeks).</li>
            <li> but my hands are messy.</li>
            <li> also the band that securs it to the head is firm and snug.</li>
            <li> I like that each cap can be used a few times before having to replace it.</li>
            <li> I bought the shower For my wife and daughter so after a few uses date can be disposal I give it a five star rating</li>
            <li> In fact the band has virtually no elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;Money wasted.</li>
            <li> However, I find myself having to use two caps since one will not fit over my hair.</li>
            <li> They may be too small if you are using them to hold a lot of long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> No more waste with clear wrap of fighting with twisted wrap all tangled  around the roll in the box</li>
            <li> Not cheap and does not rip!</li>
            <li> Packaging is conveniently small for storage.</li>
            <li> I could only give this item 1 star unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The problem is that these caps are so small that I have to use 2-3  </li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> Yup, when I make potato salad, I usually cover the bowl with a plastic cap.</li>
            <li> These are small.  </li>
            <li> These caps are so small</li>
            <li> and I actually have to use 2 caps when I&#x27;m deep conditioning my hair :(</li>
            <li> Plastic cover that contained small bundles of caps had one hair inside it already.</li>
            <li> The caps are shoddily made and too small.</li>
            <li> I used to wear regular thick shower caps, but the problem is that they always take long to dry and then eventually begin to smell terribly.</li>
            <li> Too small, very small...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s SO annoying to continuously wash it out and dry it after I have deep conditioned, or shampooed or showered.</li>
            <li> Very tight!</li>
            <li> A little thin but still get the job done.</li>
            <li> but again cap is so very, very thin and loose.  </li>
            <li> I have thick kinky hair</li>
            <li> Beware, too small!</li>
            <li> They are so inexpensive that it&#x27;s probably less expensive than struggling with cling wrap.</li>
            <li> Got them to insulate bike helmet from cold and wet... worked.</li>
            <li> Thin..</li>
            <li> This is the secret.  </li>
            <li> Really poor quality.</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying them</li>
            <li> I tired of messing up my hair wraps, so I bought these</li>
            <li> Thin, but who cares...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I felt lame buying this</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I read in the description where it says &amp;#34;one size fits all,&amp;#34; yet it also says &amp;#34;extra large.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Also, they don&#x27;t bother my ears (I have 6 piercings in each ear, including 2 in the cartilage on each side -- some beauty salon-style caps can be uncomfortable, but these are</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> This renders the cap useless and must be discarded immediately.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying these from online</li>
            <li> Extremely angry with this.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t mark it as totally bad since they are disposable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so affordable I don&#x27;t feel bad tossing them out when I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with these caps.</li>
            <li> I like to use a shower cap but hate reusing them.  </li>
            <li> They are worthless and now I&#x27;m stuck with 90+ of these caps that I can&#x27;t return.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My daughter has to bathe me and uses the caps daily.  They are inexpensive and work very well to keep her hair dry.</li>
            <li> Great value, well packaged, high quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I use these to deep condition and to keep my hair from getting wet in the shower! Works great both ways. Not cheap and does not rip!</li>
            <li> Great for conditioning and coloring hair, as disposable shower caps, under the hair therapy wrap/cordless heating cap, as shoe covers in luggage, as bowl covers at picnics, etc. These are a bargain with so many uses.</li>
            <li> I use these processing caps for the &amp;#34;greenhouse&amp;#34; effect and they work......the caps are sturdy and good enough for what I&#x27;m using them for.</li>
            <li> Awesome product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Awesome! I use the cap for hot oil treatment about three times before I replace it with a new cap.</li>
            <li> These are much better than I expected.  The elastic bands fit tight enough around my head to not allow water in when I use them as a shower cap.  I have a normal sized head with short hair, so I was worried because they&#x27;re extra large.  The band isn&#x27;t XL, but the plastic cap part is.  I bought these to use as shower cap when I realized my fancy smancy one needed to be washed every couple of days because it would get yucky.  Believe it, or not, these cheap plastic ones work better for keeping water out.  I love how they&#x27;re disposable, too -just toss them when they get yucky.  I also like that I can use them for deep conditioning or hair dying.</li>
            <li> Thin..but they do what I need them to do..usually use for my deep conditioners..put a terry clothe turban over it..as they are not to tight</li>
            <li> I am very satisfies with this item. It is a very good deall. 100 of them I dsont have to buy this for a while. I use in the shower and for deep conditioning my hair</li>
            <li> This item was purchased for my sister who lives abroad.  I personally don&#x27;t use shower caps; but this is what she requested, and I am sure she will love them.  Although she asked for about 25-30 shower caps, I thought this was a great deal.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR PEOPLE WHO DYE THEIR HAIR ALOT. I LOVE IT WAS IN A BULK PACKAGE</li>
            <li> I use this to cover cakes, boxes with no lid ect...&lt;br /&gt;A must have in the kitchen :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one so far and it&#x27;s worked out just fine. I think it&#x27;s a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Its a plastic cap. I use them for henna treatments, greenhousing, prepooing and DC and protein treatments.</li>
            <li> I color my hair every 4 wks and deep condition weekly. I always use these caps. Normally I pay a couple $ for 8 or less for cheap made bags, so I started using plastic shopping bags to save $. This was a must buy for me. I expect to not need to buy any for a couple yrs. They are great quality, not too loose, tight or small. Perfect. Best deal I&#x27;ve found in a long time.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase, item was delivered very quickly and everything came intact. The caps are the perfect size - not too large, not too small - I would definitely recommend and purchase again from this company.</li>
            <li> You get what you expected.</li>
            <li> No complaints..Nice quality nothing special but does a great job in holding hair in and did not rip..Would purchase again..Great quality and amount for price..</li>
            <li> Being natural I use a lot of the plastic caps. I like them. They are not too heavy or too tight . I am very comfortable walking around for hours in these caps. I also bought some for my friend .</li>
            <li> i love these, cheap and best</li>
            <li> Perfect for conditioning my long hair. Just throw it away after using!</li>
            <li> Use these for deep conditioning. A little thin but still get the job done.</li>
            <li> These seem decent and are very economically priced. Good for keeping the oil off your pillow if you or you child has head lice.</li>
            <li> Too small, very small... I do not think these could be made any cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Try another mfg.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have multiple uses for these caps. I use them in the shower, for rainy days when I don&#x27;t want to get my hair wet, and when I&#x27;m deep conditioning my hair. It&#x27;s a great product to have and it&#x27;s very affordable. The shipping was very fast too.</li>
            <li> The info on the site is very misleading, anyone in their rite mind wouldn&#x27;t purchase a pack of 100 individual caps for $22, the caps are sold locally for $7.99 for the same amount.  The wording online is suggesting that 1000 caps could be purchased for $22.</li>
            <li> They are great for when I deep conditioning my hair.  I like that I got this many in the pack.  At my local hair place I got way less than this for almost the price I paid for these and they were the same quality cap.  This is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Excellent deal for processing caps. Packaging is conveniently small for storage.</li>
            <li> They are not extra Large.</li>
            <li> Great caps, wider and bigger in size a bit than what you usually get in hotels and spa. Very comfortable to bath with this cap on while preventing the hair from getting wet or for coloring application. Tried both options and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This was a must buy for me.  Being a 4c natural and between dyeing my hair and deep conditioning this is must have.</li>
            <li> These work very well for DIY hair treatments such as coloring, hair masks, etc. to keep from dripping or drying out.</li>
            <li> Good caps and a great deal.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional and cannot comment on how they would work for professionals but for my own use these work fine. The elastic band isn&#x27;t tight at all but I am just looking for general coverage while my color processes.</li>
            <li> Everyone says to just use plastic wrap but that is messy and a PITA. These are easy to use and great for home coloring with henna and deep conditioning treatments. At this price don&#x27;t bother saving pennies with the plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> I felt lame buying this but these have a million uses. Great for hair dyeing, deep conditioning overnight, etc. without getting product everywhere, or for just taking a shower without getting your hair wet.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment - great value!</li>
            <li> Use these for conditioning caps and they work great.  Also wash my hair, condition it and put this on so that I can stuff my hair under a baseball cap and run to the store.  These keep my cap dry and can be easily hidden.</li>
            <li> Just what I was searching for. Since I&#x27;ve started deep conditioning as part of my hair care regimen, these were a must have. You get so many for the price by buying in bulk. Not only are they great to wear around while giving your hair conditioning treatments, they also make a great shower cap. I even use them when I want to keep my hair out of the way while washing my face. Glad I found this in bulk.</li>
            <li> These are REGULAR size caps NOT EXTRA LARGE. I have very thick natural hair longer than a twa but not  at my neck. This did not cover my hair the way I expected it to. I returned them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you  have straight or very short thin hair this might be fine but if you are a natural  girl with thick growing hair these caps will not work for you.</li>
            <li> Excellent product n I was able to keep a couple of packs n send a few more to my sister&#x27;s,  she has 2 daughters. Very economical!</li>
            <li> The caps were larger than I thought. I have a lot of hair and it was able to fit my hair with room to spare. That is not always the case with other caps.</li>
            <li> great caps, especially for lots of hair or larger heads very comfort head band, seller ships fast..</li>
            <li> Bought these to use as disposable rain covers for my motorcycle seat. EXCELLENT! _ PLEASE NOTE: will only fit the smallest of solo saddles!</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for. Disposable caps are disposable. That&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for conditioning hair and wearing to bed. Nice size for coloring hair and sitting under a heat cap. Good if I have my hair up in jumbo rollers and need to pull a top over my head (rollers stay in place). The cap is not too big or small, the  elastic band holds nicely without leaving marks on my head.</li>
            <li> good quality and just as described.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> These caps are better suited for children. The caps barely fit adult heads. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I thought that I had found my plastic cap source.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT VALUE FOR DOLLAR</li>
            <li> They are plastic caps. They get the job done. They do seem a little smaller than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the price!!  Like them better than the expensive shower caps in the store</li>
            <li> I have always liked using hotel shower caps. Now I have them to use all the time. They are light, dry fast, and can be used for a few days.</li>
            <li> great to have, satisfied.</li>
            <li> I can get several wears with one cap before it gets stretched out of shape.  But these will a long time, so you really get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> Does the job. Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I henna my hair, do oil treatments, etc., and these are indispensable.</li>
            <li> Flimsy and hard to get on, but cheap and disposable, so they&#x27;re OK.</li>
            <li> W#aste of money - this product has absolutely NO elasticity therefore water leaks easily under rim of cap if you shower with this.  Okay possibly for oil treatments but again cap is so very, very thin and loose.  Look elsewhere is my advice.</li>
            <li> I use these caps as bowl coversâ€¦does the job and excellent price!</li>
            <li> Everything I ordered came on time. Love my bonnet dryer for deep conditioner just wish it wasn&#x27;t so li uh d</li>
            <li> I like the quality and price point. Easy shopping experience.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re shower caps. They work</li>
            <li> Very handy to have. Works well as a shower cap or processing cap.</li>
            <li> These are great. Fit over my hair clip well. I use them for taking showers and for putting over deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> I still have so many of them!  Great amount for the price I paid!</li>
            <li> For me, these processing caps are okay.  The elastic seems to have a too much stretch than what am use to.  It does its job but these processing caps could be better.</li>
            <li> PERFECT for using with hair color!&lt;br /&gt;Use and discard....they are exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> These work great for removing makeup.</li>
            <li> Basic caps for a great price. I use them as shower caps.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Before you plan to use them, take them out, unroll them, and let them air out.  They have a bit of an odor, but it is fine after a night.</li>
            <li> great product/gr8 price/overall purchase experience, it met met my expectations :-)</li>
            <li> So many and good quality. I use them for covering food containers to put in refrigerator and also for covering hair to cleanse face or when get in the shower.</li>
            <li> These are like the ones they have at hotels, except they are larger and can accommodate longer hair. These will last me forever! I reuse them many times and when the elastic gives out just toss. Yay</li>
            <li> These caps are a great price.  I just wish they were bigger!  They work very well for deep conditioning.  If you have SUPER THICK  AND LONG HAIR... I would try looking for a jumbo cap.  My hair is very thick and is still growing so eventually these won&#x27;t work for me in the future.  But for now they work great especially for the price and quantity.</li>
            <li> 100 large shower caps at a good price!</li>
            <li> Grear buy. The cap holds up well. I would buy this again. Much better than the ones at the beauty supplier.</li>
            <li> Great amount for the price.</li>
            <li> These caps last a couple of weeks each and are the perfect shower cap for the price.  Who wants to deal with trying to clean a shower cap.  I think I&#x27;ll get a couple of years worth of showers off this well-priced purchase.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> Great product...just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I like to use a shower cap but hate reusing them.  The expensive ones are hot and can easily get moldy if not cleaned often and it&#x27;s hard to clean around the elastic creased areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These disposables caps are great, one use and toss it out not having to worry about mold or heat.  They are pretty good size so if you have long hair it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  The elastic is good, not too weak nor to tight.&lt;br /&gt;If you wanted to, you could probably get a few uses out of each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, Great one use item that I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers and Vidimo Se!</li>
            <li> I am using these shower caps daily and no complaints. Suitable for my needs. Not re-usable but worth the money.</li>
            <li> Terriffic deal, great for long hair, does the job!</li>
            <li> Nice caps I use them when I&#x27;m deep conditioning, I just wish they were a bit bigger. I have thick kinky hair and I doubt this will fit over my head once my hair grows a bit more. For anyone with softer hair this will fit them just fine. I love the caps I just wish there was an Extra Extra Large.</li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to do...</li>
            <li> Much needed and very cheap but good caps. I will never run out of shower caps again.</li>
            <li> The classic saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; really struck gold here. These are very flimsy shower caps that I would not recommend using more than one-time each, there are a lot of them though!</li>
            <li> Works well for what it is.  The elastic starts to wear out after about a week of use, which is not bad for a disposable cap.</li>
            <li> I am a retired old coot and do not have enough hair left on my head to worry about...so...I don&#x27;t need a shower cap...BUT...One of my hobbies is baking my own bread from scratch. I must confess that when it comes to plastic wrap I am all thumbs.  These caps are perfect for covering yeast dough in the proofing and rising processes.  They fit my largest proofing bowls, are easy to see through without lifting them and can be punctured so large batches can breath.  I am very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proofing Tip:  I proof my dough in the oven with the over turned OFF and the over light turned ON to supply the small amount of heat needed to speed up the process.</li>
            <li> These caps are just the right size and price is such a good deal.  I would spend the same amount for 1/3 the caps.</li>
            <li> They never tore while on the heads of the people protecting their hair from the paint we distributed during carnival. That said, these are beyond just durable, they are large and will cater to your protective needs.</li>
            <li> I use these for hair moisturizing &amp; they get the job done.</li>
            <li> A shower cap. What else can I say. Yes it does product the hair from getting wet while in the shower, it&#x27;s excellent for deep conditioning and it&#x27;s great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I like to condition my hair often so I use these under a towel to contain whatever conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  They work just fine and seem to be non-leaking.  I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars because frankly I can&#x27;t &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; a processing cap?</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with these caps. I bought them because I ran out of a pack that I had for a year or so.  These do not fit my head well, and I have a very small head compared to most people.  I use them to cover my head while showering but it doesn&#x27;t keep all of my hair dry like they used to!</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I was hesitant about ordering these caps, but really, they&#x27;re just plastic caps for use in processing, showering, etc.  They don&#x27;t need to last forever or fit like a glove... they are plastic disposable caps and are exactly as advertised.  They work for three or four uses if I am using just for conditioning.  Simply rinse it out, turn inside out and dry.</li>
            <li> It works, sometimes leaves tiny pieces of plastic in your hair.</li>
            <li> This fit very nicely and stay put.  They also keep most product from leaking out and down neck and forehead.</li>
            <li> Beware, too small! covers the head alright but not the hair!&lt;br /&gt;So using hair masks...etc wouldn&#x27;t work for you as the cap works for shaved heads!</li>
            <li> Good price for the caps.  But honestly it is a little cheap filling.  I have had better processing caps.  I will probably look for another brand when I but again.  I wear clips in my hair while I have the caps on and I fear that they will push a hole through because of the thinness of the plastic.</li>
            <li> I do a career unit and have a variety of hats that I have my students try on.  For health reasons I have my students wear one of these caps and they appreciate it and feel more comfortable trying on the different hats. Who doesn&#x27;t want to wear a king&#x27;s crown for a day?</li>
            <li> Good quality for health and beauty treatments and many other household uses.</li>
            <li> I was in such need of this product and it has been a welcome addition to my haircare regimen.  I use it for my Deep Conditioners, Tea Rinses and hot oil Treatments and I plan to do a Henna Treatment (which I hope goes well!).  If it is a tea rinse, I&#x27;ve found I can actually wash and reuse the cap but if it is something heavier I just dispose and move on to the next.  Thankfully at 100 caps, I won&#x27;t have to buy for awhile.  There are no holes or anything and the caps suit my needs so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably never need to buy another plastic cap again. These are well made and I gave ten to my sister with plenty left over. The price is also great. I suggest buying it to anyone who&#x27;s interested.</li>
            <li> I have thick natural hair that&#x27;s shoulder length and these caps are so big thy fit my entire head of hair plus it&#x27;s big enough to cover my hair when it&#x27;s clipped in multiple sections with hair clips. I used to need two shower caps now I only use one. I highly recommend these,</li>
            <li> I could only give this item 1 star unfortunately. I bought this big bag of caps because I deep condition my hair or do henna treatments quite frequently. I thought it would be a great buy for me to save time running to the bss &amp; money even though their not that expensive. The problem is that these caps are so small that I have to use 2-3  mostly 3 at a time to cover my whole head of hair. I don&#x27;t have an especially big head. The caps I&#x27;ve always used from the bss always fit. I never had a problem only the price .  I didn&#x27;t get ahead with this item I bought 100 but using 2-3 at a time does not save me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Good weight, can be used multi times. I use one all week to sleep in after moisturizing &amp; sealing. They&#x27;re nice &amp; thick, better then ones in most beauty/drug stores. Very happy I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I use these for my weekly deep conditioning treatments. They are a perfect fit for my larger head. However, they fit my son just as well, and he is young. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with such a great value.</li>
            <li> The material is thinner than paper, all caps with holes in it.  It&#x27;s totally unusable. Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> The Diane hair conditioning caps are far better quality than the plastic caps I was purchasing from the local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> The caps are shoddily made and too small. Another import deceptively advertised. Did not even arrive with opportunity for return, which is no surprise given the lack of quality.</li>
            <li> I got a hell a lot of caps. And great value for the price</li>
            <li> I  use these to protect my hair when bathing between washing my hair (I have very long hair so don&#x27;t want to wash it daily). I also use these when I do oil treatments, they hold the hair in, warm my scalp, and let the treatment soak in nicely. Great price for a ton of these.</li>
            <li> This shower cap works just fine for me. It will probably not fit those who have big/ a lot of hair. I have hair almost to my back, but I have thin hair and the shower caps barely fits. I am sure they will fit much better once I cut my hair, but I am still happy with my purchase. I use this every other day and one lasts for a quite some time.</li>
            <li> They can be used about 5 times before they begin to stretch so I figured they must be disposable. If so, I think they are overpriced at $7+. I have a big head.</li>
            <li> I love buying things that I use a lot in bulk.  This is a great deal for a little money.  I know these will last me and my daughter for at least 6 months.  I use to deep condition every week.  I will purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li> always love the plastic caps. works well with my deep conditioning. I use them when I do my hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for hair coloring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a larger disposable processing cap as my hair is quite thick and I&#x27;m growing it out longer. The standard shower cap no longer works well for me. Someone in an online discussion board suggested I try these. I should have went with my gut and listened to some of the other Amazon reviews that talked about the size. I was skeptical when I read in the description where it says &amp;#34;one size fits all,&amp;#34; yet it also says &amp;#34;extra large.&amp;#34; However, they are so cheap I thought it would be worth a shot. I just received my order in the mail yesterday, and they are the very same size as your basic disposable shower cap. I wish I could post a picture showing a side by side comparison to the shower caps I already have. They are fine shower caps and price is great, but definitely do not buy these if you&#x27;re expecting them to be larger. I wish the company would change their product description to be more accurate, as it is definitely misleading to describe them as &amp;#34;extra large.&amp;#34; I definitely will not be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE,I LOOK FORWARD TO DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU AGAIN,I HAVE REFERED MY FRIENDS TO YOU.</li>
            <li> You just never what you will get when you order disposable items.  I have no regrets with these disposable processing caps.  We use these when showering, coloring our hair and using deep penetrating hair conditioners.  I was pleasantly surprised how generously sized these caps are and how durable.  Also, the elastic around the cap does not get baggy after it has been stretched when you have placed over your head.  Such a GREAT value that you can afford to use them once and then toss.  Will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Work really well. So glad you get so many for such a great price. Really great buy did exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> YES! I finally got them! Great for moisturizing my hair and keep styles in. They are cheap little baggies, not overpriced, each lasts longer than expected, and is great to have around for those who need  their hair dry in the shower. NO BUYER&#x27;s REMORSE HERE!</li>
            <li> Elastic almost non-existant. You can use this as most once. I can&#x27;t imagine using these for ANYTHING. Ordering &amp;#34;Bath Secrets Disposable Shower Caps&amp;#34; then I&#x27;ll put these in the trash where they belong</li>
            <li> Works well and fit is good.  Use as a shower cap and can get several uses from each one.</li>
            <li> These processing caps are great and there are a lot of them..Worth the money...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and not flimsy and the band does not stretch out quickly. It fits comfortably with enough room for a lot of hair. The price is affordable but the quality is good.</li>
            <li> I think they are made as cheap as possible and are certainly not large.&lt;br /&gt;For little headed people.&lt;br /&gt;Using to cover telescope aperture.</li>
            <li> I use Diane Processing Caps for my weekly deep conditioning treatments on my kinky coily hair. I wear a Diane Processing Cap when I deep condition under my hooded dryer or with beanie hat for body heat. I also use them as shower caps -- two fit over my hair if it&#x27;s in a particularly voluminous style (puff, high bun, etc). They work well, are good quality and are super affordable (~$0.07 per cap). Diane Processing Caps are a staple in my hair care routine. I buy them from beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> Bought these a couple of years ago. Got them to insulate bike helmet from cold and wet... worked. Had so many, gave some to fellow rider who takes youngsters out riding. Still had a lot and started using them to cover plates of cookies, big bowls of pasta. Even though the material is thin, I found it to be pretty sturdy. Would wash them out after food use. Did have a few where the elastic loosed, but wasn&#x27;t an issue for my usage. Really liked these and they are significantly cheaper than standard elastic food cover. They are all one size, but for smaller bowls, would double it over on itself. These are a good size and easily cover a dinner plate and big bowls. Which solves the common complaint of the standard food covers... not big enough!</li>
            <li> I use processing caps at home often for deep conditioning treatments and love being able to get a larger quantity of them at a great price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> These are smaller and thinner than the caps I usually get from the local beauty supply store, but they definitely work in a pinch! My only warning is for those with longer, fuller hair: mine is long and fine to medium thickness, and these one size fits all caps are just about right but on the smaller side. These might be a little snug for anlot of hair. Still, a great bargain!</li>
            <li> Just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the first one in the pack as a shower cap for almost a month now and it has not as yet fallen apart.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on these bags. Some of them arrive with the elastic already pulled away&lt;br /&gt;from the plastic, others tore as soon as I put them on. Some were so small they would not fit on&lt;br /&gt;an adult head. Do not waste your money on these low quality bags.</li>
            <li> Its 4 people in my house and  3 of us are often painting our hair and always in need of these so I bought these a great value</li>
            <li> I bought these caps to use while doing heated treatments for my hair.  They work great, keep my hair in place (I have very long hair) and I can even sleep in them overnight and they don&#x27;t come off.  Not too tight of an elastic edge.  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Do I ever think I&#x27;ll use 100?  I think I will.  These are priced well enough that I will use for food covering and then toss!  Can&#x27;s beat that!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy these again! They are great for all my hair care needs! And they last a long time</li>
            <li> I love these caps. They come with 10 bundles, 10 in each bundle, so I take out 1 bundle at a time. I use them as food covers so that I don&#x27;t have to search for lids that may or may not exist in my kitchen. i just throw them away when I&#x27;m done, and don&#x27;t worry about washing them - wasteful, yes, but so time-saving!</li>
            <li> I will purchase theses again. I just wish they were not an add on item. That was the biggest issue I&#x27;ve had with them.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and band is tight and stays well on head.  Size of cap is universal and will fit mostly all heads.  I just air dry it and reuse it several times before throwing it away.  Good for travel too.</li>
            <li> I love this cap for my hair treatments. Will inshallah continue buying it forever.</li>
            <li> This is the secret.  I was looking for a more economical solution from the market offerings for elastic-banded bowl covers for leftovers since they are so expensive and tada!  Here they are.</li>
            <li> 100 caps that actually fit.... I love it. I have huge hair so caps never fit me. Now I have 100 of them. They are great for treatments or if you just don&#x27;t want to wet your hair in the shower. Compare these to the one from the dollar store or even the drug store even if you don&#x27;t need a larger cap the quality of these is better. The elastic doesn&#x27;t break and I haven&#x27;t poked a hole in one yet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll run out of caps for a very long time! I use these caps for everyday use and have no problems.</li>
            <li> I use these for my daytime shower. They keep my hair mostly dry. I also use them on my puppy by making a hole and slipping it over her head to protect her little ears during a bath. These are a little on the small side, but they still fit over my updo okay. They may be too small if you are using them to hold a lot of long, thick hair. These can be used more than once if you are just using them&#x27; as a shower cap.</li>
            <li> Right size works perfect for my clients</li>
            <li> We use these when doing hot oil treatments. Because these are so cheap and meant to be disposable, I was expecting a really thin, cheaply made cap.  While they are indeed thin, they are not so thin that they fall apart easily.  It even appears that they could re-used if desired.</li>
            <li> They work--much better than trying to keep henna and indigo off my face and neck! There are so many caps in here that I find myself using them for other things, such as to cover a paint brush between coats when I was painting my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Its a great price for a lot of caps!</li>
            <li> Good count making it available for a while. Good pricing and Well packed. Decent quality that lasts for a week at least.</li>
            <li> Caps arrived as promised.  Exceeded expectations, at an excellent price.  I would recommend these caps for anything that needs to be covered, not only hair.</li>
            <li> The caps were too loose; did not fit as snugly around my head as I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li> Big. Stretchy. Plastic. No leaks. Plus I have 100 of them and since I am just using them for at home hair dying they will probably last me until I wear out or they do.</li>
            <li> Really poor quality. Had to throw these away because they are too thin, don&#x27;t stay on the head, and last for seconds. Awful!</li>
            <li> My hair is short for now, and these caps provide plenty of coverage.  I use them quite often.  Would buy again.    --8/27 UPDATE:  Well I did by again but the pkging was not labeled &#x27;Diane&#x27;.  This new pkg contains about 1/4  defective caps where the plastic is not attached to the elastic.  Had I opened the pkg as soon as it arrived, I would have demanded a refund.  I will probably buy &#x27;Diane&#x27; caps from a beauty store from now.</li>
            <li> These caps were just what I needed for the task!</li>
            <li> Great fit, straightforward product.</li>
            <li> They are small like others have said and I need them to be bigger for my long thick hair. They are the regular size you can get from hotels. When I put natural dyes on my hair or conditioning treatments I use two of these to cover my hair, pulling them so they cover everything. When I put on the material shower cap I got for baths or showers I use these as a liner to keep my hair dry since the material one doesn&#x27;t keep out water enough on its own. So they work well as a liner for a material cap and they work for treatments on long hair using two, they are adequate but should be bigger since they say they are large.</li>
            <li> I use these when I color my hair or do deep conditioning treatments. They could also be used as a shower cap. Buying in bulk makes them very affordable, 100 will last me a few years at least for less that 10$</li>
            <li> they are nice enough, but they stretch out after a few use, so will have to keep replacing, good thing I have the 100 pack, because I can see these will be finishing fast!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have waist-length, color-treated hair that tends to dry out.  I have started treating my hair with coconut oil a couple of times a week because I had read several places that this would improve the condition of my hair (so far, seems to be working).  However, I&#x27;d been trying to keep my hair out of the way while the coconut oil was in my hair (for 30 minutes) by balling it up and holding it with a scrunchie, and this was not working.  I was getting drips of coconut oil all over my skin, clothes, etc.  So I went looking for something that would keep my hair off my clothes during the coconut oil treatment, and I ordered these caps from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really pleased with the purchase.  These hold all my hair and minimize drips.  They fit my head very well; even though the package says \\&quot;extra large\\&quot; and my head is on the small side, the elastic band stays snug enough against my head.  I can wear glasses with these on.  Also, they don&#x27;t bother my ears (I have 6 piercings in each ear, including 2 in the cartilage on each side -- some beauty salon-style caps can be uncomfortable, but these are perfect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the price I paid for a 100-pack was between $8 and $9, which means these are 8 or 9 cents each.  At that price, I just throw them away after one use -- no messy cleanup.  And the number you get in the package (100) means it&#x27;ll last me close to a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure you would want to use these in place of real shower caps, for actually keeping water out of your hair while showering or bathing, as they&#x27;re pretty flimsy.  However, technically, they&#x27;re not marketed for such a use anyway (although I note that some of the other reviewers use them for just this purpose).  For hair treatments, at any rate, these are great.</li>
            <li> They work for all purposes..</li>
            <li> Shower caps - great bang for your buck.  I use these at the gym and on days where I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair.  They work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Too small. This is large for a small child&#x27;s head. Lucky for me I only have shoulder length hair. They hold up as a temporary shower cap, but only with pulled back hair no rollers.</li>
            <li> Good quality, great value. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fits my head with a little room to spare.  Have used each many times in shower, are fairly sturdy.  Also useful for covering bowls of food in fridge, bicycle seat, and other uses.</li>
            <li> These are extra large.  Much bigger than the ones I find at my local stores.  And they are very durable.  I used them to cover my head/hair for hot oil treatments.  Well made.  So far I haven&#x27;t had the elastic separate from the plastic cap.  And this is after sleeping with the cap on  all night.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected. Love it</li>
            <li> terrific. exactly what I wanted.  quick delivery too.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use with at home deep conditioning treatments because scrubbing out my shower cap after using an oil treatment was getting old.  Good value for the price,  I&#x27;ve used them as a 1x use and then toss.</li>
            <li> Is the quality good?  No.  Do I need 100 disposable shower caps?  You guessed it.  No.&lt;br /&gt;So, it does take up needed space and I can&#x27;t mark it as totally bad since they are disposable.&lt;br /&gt;I opened one and it seems like it grew in size, so I think I will not open any more sections.</li>
            <li> I bought these, not because of the obvious use.  These are great for putting your shoes in for traveling.  Instead of using plastic garbage bags, the elastic in the caps hold the shoes in place.</li>
            <li> Bulk caps cheap and easy to dispose of.</li>
            <li> Work well and at a great price!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use the processing cap as a shower cap.  Because they are inexpensive you can throw them away after each use therefore there is no mold build up in the cap or a wet shower cap hanging around the bath room.  Also if you paint you an put a cap on the paint can and have lunch and the paint stays fresh without having to put on the messy paint can lid.</li>
            <li> I use these when I condition my hair under a hooded dryer, or when Im doing a henna treatment on my hair.  Good quality normal conditioning caps.  I have long hair and it all fits underneath.  Definitely very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy when I pulled out the first bag because they seemed a bit thin but I was wrong. They are very well made and hugs and snugs quite nice. I know that these will last me a VERY long time and the price was phenomenal!</li>
            <li> I really bought this because I needed a shower cap for when I take a bath. I used to wear regular thick shower caps, but the problem is that they always take long to dry and then eventually begin to smell terribly. They&#x27;re also relatively expensive, especially when I need to replace my old ones. I use the disposable caps now for a few times before throwing them out (which is about once every two weeks). Since there are 100 caps, this will last me a long time. The plastic is thin, but not fragile or delicate, and the band on the edge gives it a good grip around my head. I have not had any troubles with these caps so far. I also deep condition my hair and these are obviously great for that. The price that Amazon offers is amazing and I was able to get free shipping with it. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> For the quantity and the price point of these caps you are getting a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these to all naturalistas (and hair enthusiasts) for deep conditioning, hot oil treatments, water protection, and more!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and as described, thanks.</li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for. Price and quantity was right. It is resistant enough to be used one time.</li>
            <li> I prepoo, wash and Deep Condition my hair weekly so I use a lot of processing caps. It&#x27;s a good value for what you receive. Will order again when I get close to running out.</li>
            <li> These caps are perfect for me.  I use them for showering, deep conditioning my hair, and wearing under a hat when its raining outside to protect my hair.  The caps are large enough to fit my curlers when showering, so I don&#x27;t have to take them out and then put on a shower cap.  AND, it comes in a pack of 100!!  You can&#x27;t beat that either.</li>
            <li> These make good shower caps which is why I purchased mine. I love that they are so packable and disposable that I can throw them in a gym bag or travel bag for use away from home.</li>
            <li> large enough for lots of natural hair, tight enough around the head so no product drips and sturdy enough for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> These shower caps are larger and thicker than I expected.  My head is rather large (I wear a 7 3/4 &amp;#34; hat) and I have a lot of thick coarse hair.  I usually use two shower caps to cover my full head and hair when conditioning and when applying henna.  They are so thick and durable I only need one and I can usually reuse them so it will take a while for me to need more.</li>
            <li> These processing conditioning caps are a MUST HAVE for anyone doing deep conditioning, hair color, perms etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will receive 100 caps that are well packaged, and shipped even faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are definately worth the price paid, I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Works well for hair treatment</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these for showering, they keep me from needing a shower until the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I find these are good for working under nasty rusty/oily cars and they&#x27;re very cheap.</li>
            <li> I use these for shower caps. I don&#x27;t like shower caps that you use over and over because of the mildew on the elastic. These are so cheap I can throw them away after a week. In addition, they fit very well.</li>
            <li> now I don&#x27;t have to raid the hotel cart when the maid is doing my room for shower caps....use it everytime I color my hair.</li>
            <li> These caps are perfect to use with the Hair Therapy Wrap.  I just wish the outside packaging came in a resealable bag.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Good price</li>
            <li> These are a really good value!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use. Great value for your money.</li>
            <li> Good thing that this brings so many,  because I find myself discarding them too quickly,  sometimes after the first use. They stretch too much, too easily. This renders the cap useless and must be discarded immediately. Not worth the price,  will look elsewhere for other brand caps.</li>
            <li> saves time for me ..usable one</li>
            <li> These will last me forever! I use these for deep conditioning and hair coloring. It&#x27;s so affordable I don&#x27;t feel bad tossing them out when I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and the product is great for hair treatments.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing these cap for home use (hair conditioning and shower caps) at Sally&#x27;s but this is more economical for me and just as good!</li>
            <li> Very very good deal!!!! Excellent size. Simple good quality and big amount! I use this for castor oil hair mask. Thank you! Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good product. I will order again.</li>
            <li> You get more for your money on this buy!</li>
            <li> I am a person who is always messing with my hair. I like to change colors and do highlights often. And, when I&#x27;m conditioning my hair, these caps keep the conditioner on my hair and not my shirt. And, you can also use these caps to cover large bowls! Yup, when I make potato salad, I usually cover the bowl with a plastic cap. They are so inexpensive that it&#x27;s probably less expensive than struggling with cling wrap.</li>
            <li> these are perfect for what i need, but theres not much to them so i guess its better then the normal plastic bag that i use lol</li>
            <li> These caps are the perfect fit for my head and hair. Other caps I&#x27;ve tried have an elastic band that is way too loose! These are perfect and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!!</li>
            <li> Good Price.  Good Quality.  The product was delivered quickly, and in very good condition.</li>
            <li> I use these when I color my hair. Excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my family because buying four caps from the local mass retailer wasn&#x27;t working. These are the typical shower caps and get the job done. Plus, for the price, it was a good fit for us.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy shoulder-length hair and these fit me well with room to spare. So far I have used them for henna (worn 3-4 hours) and for some coconut oil treatments (worn 1 hr each). The elastic holds well without digging in, and I&#x27;ve had no problems with leaks or drips.</li>
            <li> Good quality, will order again.</li>
            <li> They get the job done, keep my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Cheap good throw away caps.</li>
            <li> I use them as shower caps &amp; conditioning caps. I like that they&#x27;re in bulk. It saves a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I Got this because i went natural and will be doing my hair at home alot and dont want to use shopping bags for my deep condition treatment. This thing is great and will last a long time because you can reuse the caps a few times b4 you throw it away unless you color or something. I would definatley get these again whenveer they run out.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and packaged as pictured...10 in each bunch.Shower cap material seemed thinner compared to the ones I got from hotels. However, the first one I&#x27;ve used, for keeping my hair dry as I shower, has lasted a few weeks already. The elastic is still tight and the plastic has not torn. Some variation in sizes. The smallest has an opening of 7&amp;#34;. Diameter of flatten cap is about 16&amp;#34; and depth of 7&amp;#34;. The largest has additional 1&amp;#34; all around. There is a little more than enough room for my head of short fine hair. I don&#x27;t think there is room for a full head of hair longer than shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these on several occasions and they are excellent caps, better than the ones I was getting from a local beauty supply store. Most recently the caps that arrived were not the &amp;#34;Diane&amp;#34; brand (which are EXCELLENT) as described and pictured. The plastic was different and they were not as well constructed as the &amp;#34;Diane&amp;#34; brand caps that I received previously. Might be good to ask seller which caps are currently being shipped before buying. Hope this helps another buyer.</li>
            <li> Well packed , and they did the job nicely, I shared it whit my mom and sister</li>
            <li> I can never have to many of these conditioning caps. This pack of 100 was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Really great bargain and they stay on better then the ones I bought at Sallys Beauty Supply. They are pretty big but if you have a lot of long thick hair like I do its still a stretch to get it all in.</li>
            <li> I initially loved the value for the quantity, however, I specifically chose &amp;#34;EXTRA LARGE&amp;#34; caps because I have a head full of really long and thick hair.  These caps are the same size as the tiny cheapo caps you get in hotel bathrooms. When I&#x27;m in the shower, I need two of them to cover all of my hair. I wanted to use them as shower caps when my hair is done to keep my hair from getting wet and as processing caps for deep/heat conditioning treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of my money. They are worthless and now I&#x27;m stuck with 90+ of these caps that I can&#x27;t return.  Will not order again from this company.</li>
            <li> On the thin and small size but using for hair treatments and then throw away - works fine.  When on sale a good value.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and I am a complete product junkie, but I think these are very well worth the tiny price that they cost. I never used processing caps on myself, I would always just use my shower cap and it&#x27;s SO annoying to continuously wash it out and dry it after I have deep conditioned, or shampooed or showered. I was literally trying to use one cap for everything, not anymore :) I am think that I will get a good amount of personal uses out of this and I am so happy that I paid such a little amount for so many!</li>
            <li> These caps are great for the gym. They come in little bundles of ten, perfect for toting to the gym. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have an oil to put on my scalp overnight to get rid of dry, flakey skin and then I cover it with a shower cap and then sleep in it.  The medicine/oil itself comes with two shower caps, but I usually can only get one use out of them before they&#x27;ve stretched out completely.  I have been looking for some more shower caps to use for a month&#x27;s worth of my oil.  I found these online and decided to give them a try especially since they said they were extra large fit (I have a lot of hair) and all the 5 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the same one for about 4 nights in a row now and it&#x27;s just now getting a little stretched out!!  I&#x27;m so happy with these caps - I mean, who knew it would take so long to find something that fit well and wasn&#x27;t awkward to sleep in?  The material is thin, which I actually prefer and it kind of suctions to my wet hair which works great since that seems to help it stay in place better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I run out, I will be buying more! :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be buying processing caps for a while. These caps hold up really well. I was a bit skeptical about them being cheap and flimsy but there aren&#x27;t any different from baggies you&#x27;d buy at sally&#x27;s...except the price that is...</li>
            <li> Great product that was cheap and useful and came on time. Much cheaper than buying in a normal drugstore and satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as advertised</li>
            <li> This helps out for what I use them for. Good product.</li>
            <li> Basic caps, just as you&#x27;d expect them to be. Nothing special but do the job at a great price. Not low quality at all, I haven&#x27;t had trouble with them tearing or anything.</li>
            <li> I use these for my deep conditioning treatments that I do at least one/twice a week. This is definitely a money saver and it is packaged neatly so that the caps will never get out of order. I will be buying all of my processing caps from this buyer from here on out. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, you can never have enough. Love them.. I use to get them at hotels through the years but with these I will never run out.</li>
            <li> Item arrived super quick. This is definitely a good buy for the price, no complaints. Surprisingly its not so delicate as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Not bad.  One size fits all.  Cheap price.  Worth the buy if you use shower cap a lot.</li>
            <li> Great study caps. Love that it comes with so many so that I don&#x27;t have to rewash them over and over I can just use them and toss it if need be when done.</li>
            <li> Incredibly quick service and good quality caps</li>
            <li> I liked the cloth line shower caps but like another reviewer said they took awhile to dry and would get gross. I got tired of buying them so I thought I&#x27;d try these. They&#x27;re for the most part decent... They are pretty flimsy and a bit difficult to put on (I have medium /long thick hair), but they get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was like &amp;#34;do I really need 100???&amp;#34;, but for the price I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying any for quite some time. Especially since I could use the same one 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m finding other uses for them like putting them on my shoes when I pack for trips (putting on hotel tv remote for that matter), or putting it on my iPad when I need to read recipes while cooking but my hands are messy.</li>
            <li> These do the trick. We have well-water, so I throw one of these on before I shower (I&#x27;m a blonde) and it keeps the water off my hair (which keeps my hair from absorbing the minerals in the water). I use them once then pitch them. Great value.</li>
            <li> It is good for hair conditioning!</li>
            <li> Great value and each cap can be used at least twice.</li>
            <li> I use these for deep conditioning &amp; coloring. Reused a couple of times to preserve a salon blowout without any problems.</li>
            <li> These caps are very flimsy and too small.  They tear very easily and do not completely cover the head.</li>
            <li> Too stinky to wear- plastic smells toxic</li>
            <li> i am still using my first one :))  this is a lifetime supply for me, it would seem :))</li>
            <li> I use these to condition my hair and they are pretty durable (which allows me to use the same cap repeatedly). They are also pretty large so I don&#x27;t have to worry about only half my hair getting conditioned.</li>
            <li> Wife loves these. She has long, thick hair and they hold it with no problem. She uses it like a shower cap and for holding in a moisturizer when she does shampoo. She is seeing how long just one will last. She has used it over a dozen times and it is still working great. Very well made product! Would recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> Fit great and love that they are so affordable fits all my long curly hair</li>
            <li> Cheaper than Sally and you don&#x27;t have to leave warm house to get it. This is what you need to hold mosture in your hair.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and shouldn&#x27;t run out anytime soon. I only use it for deep conditioning my hair but can be used for a shower cap.</li>
            <li> The caps are very large and fits my hair even with crazy updos or a head of large rollers. eh best thing about it though is that it is 100 for such a low price!!.. Good job Diane!</li>
            <li> the size of these caps will snuggly fit your head and hair that is thick and to bra strap length. anything longer you will need to double bag it or find a larger size cap. also the band that securs it to the head is firm and snug.</li>
            <li> Good caps. Fits on head and covers hair perfectly well.</li>
            <li> great value. I was doing ACV rinses &amp;/or honey treatments, deep conditioning treatments, hot oil treatments every two wks so these def come in handy.</li>
            <li> There are lots of conditioning caps and it was just what i wanted. I use it for myself only but it would be great for a salon too.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying these from online but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  They are just like the ones in the store and so much cheaper.  Sally&#x27;s is really going overboard with prices lately.</li>
            <li> Good for covering bowls of food, shower cap, conditioning cap and terrific for putting on your bare or stockinged feet to walk through security.  Onetime use so don&#x27;t expect perfect quality.</li>
            <li> This product arrived exactly as advertised. The caps are big enough to hold my long hair, and they&#x27;re pretty comfortable. They&#x27;re a good buy.</li>
            <li> These are just perfect and surprisingly durable. Great purchase</li>
            <li> These last forever! Great value</li>
            <li> I am so guilty of using my shower caps until they are totally stretched out and finding the cheap ones like these at the dollar store is always a hassle and you only get like 5 or 6 for a dollar! This is an excellent buy if you are looking for the salon style conditioning caps! I use them in the shower, for deep conditioning, etc! They are one size fits all and perfect for me and my 3 year old daughter! Get price great product!</li>
            <li> Used this yesterday after coloring my hair. Worth purchasing so hair coloring doesn&#x27;t run down your face and back.</li>
            <li> The price for these caps were pretty good and I say they service the purpose for which I bought them for. I use them to deep condition my daughter and my hair and they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I like the value for the quantity, however, I specifically chose &amp;#34;EXTRA LARGE&amp;#34; caps because I have a lot of hair! These caps are the same size as the tiny caps you get in hotel bathrooms...just large enough if you pack all of your hair down as if you&#x27;re putting on a wig. There is no room to allow for rollers if you set your hair or anything. I primarily purchased these to wear in the shower, therefore, if I set my hair in rollers and want to keep my hair from getting wet...I&#x27;m out of luck. There simply isn&#x27;t enough room for these caps to cover sufficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elastic is pretty strong, though. :-(</li>
            <li> I get the full set at a very good price and they are very good quality and is worth to buy it like this</li>
            <li> This is a great product for those who do many deep conditioning on your hair.  They are very durable to use.  I like buying in bulk so these will last a very long time.  They don&#x27; t split or tare easy as some that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past!  When I eventually run out I will purchase these again!</li>
            <li> We purchased these to use as disposable arm rest covers for our tattoo studio.  The caps fit the armrest perfectly.  Helps keep our work area sanitary, and cheap enough to make them feasible for a one-time-use.  Only reason I give this 4 stars is that we don&#x27;t use this product for its intended use, so I can&#x27;t make any claims on how fabulous it works for its original purpose.</li>
            <li> I deep condition my hair every week! I tired of messing up my hair wraps, so I bought these and I love them! They are durable, well made and SO worth the money! You will not regret this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I deep condition my hair weekly and need something to cover my hair. I use it for 8 hours and then discard. It&#x27;s great because I don&#x27;t have to waste my time having to wash it and reuse it. It is great for when I deep condition overnight and want to ensure that my pillow doesn&#x27;t get soaked and all oily. It looks like it rips super easily but it doesn&#x27;t. I have a huge lion&#x27;s mane and this cap covers it all so don&#x27;t underestimate the size of these caps, they will cover your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived on time with no damage.</li>
            <li> These are very economical  to have.</li>
            <li> Great deal but lack elastic hold. Probably would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really like these caps because of the tight fit and the fact that so many came in one packaged. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Great for deep conditioning! You get a bang for you buck.&lt;br /&gt;1 year later I am still using the from the 100 pack</li>
            <li> It is cheap and functional. You would not expect to use many times for a single cap but even it only holds for 2-3 uses it is still a great deal considering the cheap price. I used it as a shower cap and I have middle long thick hair and it is big enough for me~</li>
            <li> Cool for doing hair masks, etc</li>
            <li> These are small.  I need to use two caps to cover my whole head of hair.  My hair is just passed shoulder length and very curly so maybe someone with shorter hair or straight hair wouldn&#x27;t have the same problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman with a large head.  I put my hair up in a clip to take a shower and other shower caps just don&#x27;t cover my hair line.  These do though, so I&#x27;m really happy I found them.  I use each one 7-8 times before throwing it out and getting a new one.  My 100-pack is going to last a very long time!</li>
            <li> excellent... Thank you for service</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and this cap still fit well. The price is nice and the quality is OK for this price.</li>
            <li> Great price!  If you have a lot of hair, you might have to use two, as the elastic isn&#x27;t super tight.</li>
            <li> I have an AirBnb and these are great when someone has a short stay.  I have found that if someone has a longer stay that they appreciate a better shower cap so I provide one that is $3.99, and that is a gift to them.</li>
            <li> I will always always always always have processing caps.  This 100-pack WILL last forever.  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  And they come in handy for other things too (just google search it??!!).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even used these. Hope they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> Great for treatments and the shower. Use them, toss them...convenient.</li>
            <li> great value for your money. this will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for all of my hair needs.  I like that each cap can be used a few times before having to replace it. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> SO happy to have found these. I am tickled. They are large enough to do just what I wanted to do!!!</li>
            <li> I use these quality salon bags for a variety of things. Deep conditioning and as a plain shower cap.</li>
            <li> I like these. I have a LOT of hair and it all fit very well. Still I need to keep it in place with some hair clips but they do the job. I like that they come in rolls of 10 so you can store the rest and have just one roll handy. Good product.</li>
            <li> These caps are so small it&#x27;s ridiculous! I ended up giving them to my eight year old daughter to wear because they are not big enough for me!</li>
            <li> I deep condition my hair once a week and this is so convenient I can just throw them out afterwards. They are not made for everyday shower cap use they will rip easy.</li>
            <li> I bought them to condition my hair...they do the job!  Great price...and they are well packaged.  I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> item is great. great quality, great fast service, would do business with these folks again, may order a second one as a gift. did order more already</li>
            <li> The processing caps are ok . The 2 things I would change are the thickness of the caps and the depth. I have a lot of hair (not more than most) and I actually have to use 2 caps when I&#x27;m deep conditioning my hair :( one for the front abs the other for the back .</li>
            <li> Perfect shower, deep conditioner hats!</li>
            <li> It is a great deal at such low price. The caps are big enough for my long hair. I should be able to use at least 3 times. Good for deep conditioning too.</li>
            <li> Great price and great caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use them for everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not fall apart easily and does a great job for perming, conditioning, showers, etc.</li>
            <li> Wow! Great deal for the amount you get. Holds my hair perfectly when I do my deep conditioning treatments. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> These caps are great for storing leftovers in your refrigerator, or covering food to take on a picnic.  No more waste with clear wrap of fighting with twisted wrap all tangled  around the roll in the box it came in. .  Also, more closet space without BOWLS, BOWLS EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> Purchased to use with my conditioning and henna treatments. They fit anyone who has hair to the nape of the neck. My hair is thick and about 10 inches long.  Any longer and I would need 2 caps</li>
            <li> Because I use these so often this worked out great for me at this price and quantity. Excellent buy overall!</li>
            <li> I bought the shower For my wife and daughter so after a few uses date can be disposal I give it a five star rating</li>
            <li> I would buy this pack again.</li>
            <li> I really love this item, and I am using the caps on a regular basis. Also, the cap size is a good fit.</li>
            <li> The caps are good for the cost.  They are slightly smaller than I expected.  Or I just have too much hair, which I have been told before.  They work great for what I had originally purchased them for: to help deep condition my wet hair in the shower.  But a little too small to cover all my dry hair pulled up.</li>
            <li> Extremely angry with this. Plastic cover that contained small bundles of caps had one hair inside it already. There was lot of dust and other stuff stuck on caps which were on outer side of each bundle so i threw this out. If u want hygiene then dont buy this.</li>
            <li> So far so good with my first cap.  I just hope the elastic on the others last until I can use the remaning 99!</li>
            <li> great price for the product</li>
            <li> Very good product that performs exactly as expected.  I use these for deep conditioning and they work well for this.</li>
            <li> I came keep my hair moist at night for treatments.</li>
            <li> I use these for when I develop my hair dye and also as a shower cap. The elastic band is fairly strong and stays put where I set it. I dye my hair roughly 3 times a year, and in that year I&#x27;d end up using just 6 of these. one for developing and one as a showercap the first month after the dye process. I also use them when I help others dye their hair. In my opinion, It helps the color penetrate better and keeps the dye from just getting everywhere while waiting to develop so one can still walk around the house while waiting. To this point, I still haven&#x27;t gone through one of the mini stacks yet. It&#x27;s going to last me a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Perfectly sized and absolutely necessary for my hair care needs.  I like to slap homemade concoctions on my hair, put the cap on and work around the house.  No spills.  No frills.  It simply does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Very useful. I don&#x27;t need to hunt down shower caps in hotel/motels any more!</li>
            <li> They work as they should...what else is there to say besides WOOT, never going to have to buy any again after getting this huge pack.</li>
            <li> Excelent. I can use during warm shower to condition the hair with cream treatment and just dispose it after use.</li>
            <li> Good fit with stitched elastic banding.</li>
            <li> I am pleased about the quantity of this item and how it fits snugglely on my head full of hair :). I can reuse my caps as they wear and tear overtime and don&#x27;t have to worry about buying more for a while. A recommended buy!</li>
            <li> I use these for shower caps, hair conditioning caps, henna caps... I love them.  They are good quality, and you get a ton of them for the price. I think they are better than the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> I bought the 30-pack at first, but soon realized how handy these are and bought the larger economy pack.  Excellent for any and all hair processing whether it is bleach, color, or deep conditioning and you don&#x27;t want a drippy mess.  I have a large head, and these fit just fine.  My hair is long, but fine, so no difficulty with fitting my hair easily and using these as long as you aren&#x27;t trying to fit rollers under it.  Perm rods would likely not be a problem though.  I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> Works fine for the uses we intended them to have, but even for a male with shortish hair, this caps look small, if you have longer hair is better to look for something else</li>
            <li> Thin, but who cares... You have 100 in the pack so you can use it and throw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> These caps are PERFECT for anytime situations!  I&#x27;ve used several ti condition my hair some as a backup shower cap during travels and great for cooking in the kitchen too! Package arrived neat and Great price with a decent quantity. I would love to purchase in the future &amp; definitely recommend</li>
            <li> DId I get a defective product? There elastic band is too loose to keep the cap on my head. In fact the band has virtually no elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;Money wasted.</li>
            <li> This was shipped and received quick and a great deal for 100 caps. I recently decided to wash and deep condition my hair at homu to save time and this is definitely needed.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome price for 100 &amp;#34;shower&amp;#34; caps. I don&#x27;t use it for showers though. I use it to cover up bowls of food. Like a big bowl full of bread dough as it rises. Beats using plastic wrap. I&#x27;m not sure if it is food safe, but I don&#x27;t really let the food touch it.</li>
            <li> Work just like they should!  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered that 100 caps would last into eternity, or at least for the next 10 years. Caps are not cheapo&#x27;s, good quality plastic  that doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise like a garbage bag. If I ever need more, I will order from this company again.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because they could have been bigger. The elastic was fine but there could have been more cap....or maybe I have a big head.</li>
            <li> i used to go to the beauty supply to buy this caps, and spent like 3.99 for a pack of 10 caps.&lt;br /&gt;i received 100 pack and didnt spent that much,&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommed it !</li>
            <li> Good enough quality so i can reuse several times, and low enough in price that i could throw them out without regret.  I have used the same cap for the last three colourings, just rinse and let dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put these over my head, so if that&#x27;s what you want to do with them, read the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When traveling, I use these to cover my shoes, then throw in an extra roll into a side pocket just in case for my trip back home. They work perfectly and are thin yet sturdy enough to wrap them around easily but not rip through when a heel pushes into it. They&#x27;re big, so even my 6&amp;#34; stilettos fit nicely into them and don&#x27;t damage or dirty my clothes. They&#x27;re also cheap enough that I don&#x27;t feel terribly wasteful when I do throw them out, if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to pack efficiently and keep your clothes and belongings away from the nastiness under your shoes, get these and thank me later!</li>
            <li> They work nicely and last for several uses but they not that large...</li>
            <li> I found these caps to be quite sturdy for conditioning my short to medium afro</li>
            <li> Awesome!! i can feel the heat upto my scalp not like before im only using a ordinary shower cap and the price is great!</li>
            <li> Product as advertised</li>
            <li> Use as shower cap and cover while deep conditioning my hair. You get a great quantity, almost equivalent to a year supply and the price is very reasonable</li>
            <li> I use these to protect my hat collection from dust and dirt and they work great! Super good price thanks!</li>
            <li> These are really quality caps. The packaging is convenient for removing the cap to use. Sometimes the caps that come in the boxes are balled up and you end up with a fist full of caps when you only wanted one. The size is good for folks with more hair. These also stay put when you place the heat cap on your head. I will buy more of these when I run out.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that these are extra large. I have a LOT of hair that I deep condition and use these caps as shower caps at the gym. The value is great. These are cheaper than they are at my local beauty supply. However, I find myself having to use two caps since one will not fit over my hair. I have found with other XL caps, that one cap is sufficient. They last through one conditioning treatment well.</li>
            <li> thank you great for hair masks</li>
            <li> Good quality and price!!! Works perfect for hair treatments!</li>
            <li> Nice and large. I have a lot of hair and these caps stretch out and are good quality. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Wow! Didn&#x27;t realize they were sending so many.  I will probably have these in 2020. lol  The price was great!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for covering your dough as it rises.  They fit over my Kitchen Aid 6 quart mixing bowl with plent of rooms to spare and also am assortment of other bowls I have in my kitchen.  Much easier that plastic wrap and much cheaper as you can easily reuse them.  Sure, you probably donâ€™t need 100 but theyâ€™re cheap.  Be a friend and can a roll or two over to someone that could use them</li>
            <li> The elastic was old and lost it&#x27;s shape. I&#x27;m sure it was great at one point.</li>
            <li> My hair goes close to bra line and has layers, with a clip in my hair I hardly can fit it in there, need to try to find some ways to take less space so it fits properly and doesn&#x27;t make my hair wet, it&#x27;s better for shorter hair or  less density hair, I have normal density though. I guess it can be kind of  medium size probably, but not large</li>
            <li> I bought these for using coconut oil on my hair as a conditioner.  I put the coconut oil on, then covered my hair with one of these caps.  I waited two hours, then shampooed my hair.  This worked great!</li>
            <li> Not much to say, 100 plastic caps. They work.</li>
            <li> The best way to keep food longer and not fuss with that roll that sticks to itself and then stabs you on the fingertips with its spiky aluminum edges or whatever they are.</li>
            <li> this is ok but it can not keep around your head as well, so if you use a lot something like oil, it leak.but generally is good</li>
            <li> I have a normal sized head and mid-length hair, these are the perfect size for me.</li>
            <li> They really worked great and are very well-priced. Very tight!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and convenient processing caps, I sit watching tv while conditioning is applied.</li>
            <li> Good shower caps and also good for hair treatments.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRICE FOR SO MANY.  I USE THEM FOR FACIALS AND THESE ARE SO MUCH CHEAPER THAN BUYING SEPERATELY IN THE STORE.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> Received as product is shown. Happy purchase!</li>
            <li> They are what I expected.  They were packaged well and easily separated.  Very comfortable too because the elastic is just loose enough and not tight around the head.</li>
            <li> I love these caps they can be used for many different things two of which I use them for is to protect my head from water as I shower and to cover my head for an overnight leave-in treatment process I do. I realize that one cap can be used multiple times when taking a shower but only once while sleeping and on any leave-in treatment(perms, overnight hair conditioning, etc). I will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I WILL ORDER MORE,I AM PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> I love these and it a great value.</li>
            <li> I use when I condition &amp; color my hair. Instead of paying 4x;s the price at the local beauty supply, and often running out when I need them. I now have a VERY long supply, and they are the same quality as those 4times the cost. A great deal. Has saved me money and trips to the store.</li>
