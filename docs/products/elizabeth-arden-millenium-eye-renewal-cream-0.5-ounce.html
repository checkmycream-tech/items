    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Simply a great product with its creamy texture, moisturising property without the greasiness of it all.    </li>
            <li>Millenium, however, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, keeps my skin moist, and works great under makeup.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizing eye cream.</li>
            <li>I have had great luck with this product and it feels really good on.  </li>
            <li>Great product and a fair price.</li>
            <li>Great product, love the results.</li>
            <li>So glad I can still get it here at Amazon!</li>
            <li>For the fine lines around my eyes this product is great.</li>
            <li>It may be slightly more greasy than what most people are used to, but for me it works great.  </li>
            <li>The price was on the money and the seller couldn&#x27;t be more honest.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I bought 2 more just in case.</li>
            <li>I have been using Elizabeth Arden Millennium products since released many years ago.  </li>
            <li>for them many years ago.</li>
            <li>Have not been able to tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>Elizabeth Arden discontinued this eye cream, so I&#x27;m glad I can find it here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and have allergic reactions to so many eye creams; it&#x27;s been a problem forever.  </li>
            <li>Better than many that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>my favorite eye cream</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>Great for older skin</li>
            <li>is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered from this particular vendor (Go Happy Shop) and have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li>What a great purchase overall.</li>
            <li>It is looks so cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure genes played a part, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, this helps too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know it is the right one or defected one.</li>
            <li>I have very fair, thin skin.</li>
            <li>Actually, I think I have more now, but this is of course because of me getting older and not the cream.</li>
            <li>I can really tell the difference under my eyes with this product.</li>
            <li>cannot believe Elizabeth Arden dropped the whole line of Millenium.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Joanie Anderson</li>
            <li>I use it nightly and It helps to smooth the lines and gives the skin around the eyes an overall smoothness.</li>
            <li>It makes a 76-years lady look like 62 (no one believes me that I&#x27;m really 76).  </li>
            <li>It did not do much for my eye wrinkles after using the whole tube.</li>
            <li>I love this product started using it a year ago and noticed the difference in less than 2 weeks...  </li>
            <li>highly recommend all products of Millenium.</li>
            <li>Bought it at TJ Max for less than $20 and found it at Amazon for less than $25 great value..  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see it as doing anything different than many other products.  </li>
            <li>Indianapolis developed these products.</li>

            <li> I simply can not live without Elizabeth Ardern&#x27;s Eye Renewal Cream. Simply a great product with its creamy texture, moisturising property without the greasiness of it all.    The price was on the money and the seller couldn&#x27;t be more honest. What a great purchase overall. Je suis bon.</li>
            <li> I can really tell the difference under my eyes with this product. I still have the dark circles but when I don&#x27;t put the cream on they look darker.</li>
            <li> I love this product started using it a year ago and noticed the difference in less than 2 weeks...  Bought it at TJ Max for less than $20 and found it at Amazon for less than $25 great value..  This product is usually around $50.  I love it I bought 2 more just in case. You know how it goes..  when you like something it goes off the market...</li>
            <li> I have been using Elizabeth Arden Millennium products since released many years ago.  Last summer I traveled for a few weeks and forgot my eye cream.  At 59 moisture for the face it paramount.  By the time I returned home I had the beginnings of crows feet.  After 5 days of using my eye cream the wrinkles were gone.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the results.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 30 years. I am so grateful that I can find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe Elizabeth Arden dropped the whole line of Millenium. I used to be a make-up&lt;br /&gt;artist for them many years ago. highly recommend all products of Millenium. You know Eli Lilly&lt;br /&gt;of Indianapolis developed these products. A must have for me!!! Thanks, Joanie Anderson</li>
            <li> Have not been able to tell a difference.  I have been using the product for about two weeks</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me years ago when I got a very bad sunburn on my face and actually had burned underneath my eyes.  I have had great luck with this product and it feels really good on.  It may be slightly more greasy than what most people are used to, but for me it works great.  I have very few, barely noticeable wrinkles around my eyes.....I&#x27;m sure genes played a part, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, this helps too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered from this particular vendor (Go Happy Shop) and have been very satisfied.</li>

            <li> Elizabeth Arden discontinued this eye cream, so I&#x27;m glad I can find it here at Amazon.  I have very fair, thin skin. and have allergic reactions to so many eye creams; it&#x27;s been a problem forever.  Millenium, however, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, keeps my skin moist, and works great under makeup.  As long as I can find it, I&#x27;m using it!</li>
            <li> It is looks so cheap. I don&#x27;t know it is the right one or defected one. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> It makes a 76-years lady look like 62 (no one believes me that I&#x27;m really 76).  Have used Elizabeth Arden Products FOREVER</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was 35 (now 66), and when I tell people my age they&#x27;re amazed at the smoothness of my under-eye area.</li>
            <li> Great product and a fair price.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years!  So glad I can still get it here at Amazon!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it as doing anything different than many other products.  I&#x27;m uncommitted to this product versus other products..</li>
            <li> I purchased the eye cream at TJ Max. It did not do much for my eye wrinkles after using the whole tube. Actually, I think I have more now, but this is of course because of me getting older and not the cream. I wont&#x27;t buy it anymore, also because I just realized it contains a lot of parabens.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing eye cream. Better than many that I&#x27;ve tried. Great for older skin</li>
            <li> How sad not to say that I feel very disappointed not knowing who has deceived me. This was a gift for my mother and it turns out she had nothing to receive in the product. Everything was like in</li>
            <li> my favorite eye cream</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years. However the last tine I ordered it, I received &amp;#34;Visible Difference&amp;#34; Eye Cream instead. I wonder if the Millenium Eye Cream has ben discontinued.</li>
