            <li>This stuff did a really good job.</li>
            <li>conditioner also smells so good.</li>
            <li>People are always saying how good she smells.</li>
            <li>Gives a good amount of slippage...</li>
            <li>This is a good conditioner for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizing hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell you how good my hair feels.</li>
            <li>I get to an evening where the hair feels good already.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help detangle my type of hair.</li>
            <li>but while it&#x27;s good i wouldn&#x27;t rave about it.  </li>
            <li>Always liked that because it tames frizz-hair into curls and smells great.  </li>
            <li>This product also has a very lovely scent.</li>
            <li>I love to saturate my hair and this one is a great addition to my shower choices.  </li>
            <li>It has an ingredient in it that I assume is some kind of silicone because it sounds like it (amodimethicone) which I want to avoid because it&#x27;s not supposed to be good for hair moisture.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m satisfied !</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this conditioner!</li>

            <li>If I would be fair and honest I am going to write pages to explain how much I love the product .</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s both a conditioner &amp; leave-in conditioner which is also nice :)</li>
            <li>Love it love love love it!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent hair product as a deep conditioner with a cap and heat work wonders.</li>

            <li>However it has the thickness of mayonnaise it gives your hair a shiny healthy look that everyone admire.</li>
            <li>I really love the way Neutrogena triple moisture conditioner makes my hair feel and look, but wanted to get away from any chemicals...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite brand of hair care product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love the smell and</li>
            <li>I dont think it can get any better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Maybe I have to give it a bit more time to seem some added softness and smoothness.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love their products</li>
            <li>Better priced at target.</li>

            <li>I only put it on my ends, and it smells delicious!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love these products.  </li>
            <li>May be better for others.</li>
            <li>I love to use as it as a conditioner and a leave-in.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my hair feels in a month once I&#x27;ve been using it for a while.</li>
            <li>I love what shea butter does to my hair</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I love Shea Moisture products and had never tried their hair care line.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that these formulas are sulfate free, which protects my precious hair color.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing and works really well!</li>
            <li>My hairs was full of moisture which I love</li>
            <li>Good, light weight, natural conditioner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the results would be as great if you only use the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I use a lot of styling products and this shampoo keeps my hair light and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>Just 5 minutes in the shower is all the time necessary for great results.</li>
            <li>(I also switched to a sulfate free shampoo when I started using this.</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li>fantastic scent.</li>
            <li>light weight is the 2 stars.</li>
            <li>It is also organic and cruelty free..</li>
            <li>It isnt silky smooth when in the hair</li>
            <li>My hair is so silky smooth after this.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I tried these products, or I probably would have cut my hair short by now.  </li>
            <li>This product is really great for mixed textured hair.</li>
            <li>my hair feels smooth and it makes it easier to comb through</li>
            <li>My hair type:&lt;br /&gt;Bleached then dyed a light reddish color about 6-7 months ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells delicious, and would most likely work better if my hair was not as long as it</li>
            <li>He and his wife had been doing this for a few years, and both of them have beautiful, shiny, bouncy, healthy curls.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is okay, but I feel like my hair is pretty tangled feeling by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>rich lotion without being greasy.</li>
            <li>yet I am excited</li>
            <li>Moisture Rich.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have the chemical garbage in it that most hair products have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells like graham crackers, which is interesting, and I love how soft and shiny it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>--I use it both in the shower to clean my scalp/roots and after showering to condition the ends.</li>
            <li>I guess i&#x27;ll just have to add some essential oil with a pleasant smell to deal with it.</li>
            <li>These products have been amazing at moisturizing my hair and helping me have soft but controlled curls.  </li>
            <li>My hair used to be oily and very straight, plus fine.</li>
            <li>The first time I used them, my hair didn&#x27;t really respond; my waves fell flat but after about 2 shampoos, my hair began to respond well and every time thereafter, I&#x27;ve had very good hair days.</li>
            <li>Super hydrating.</li>
            <li>but atleast the smell is mild so no bugs chasing you.</li>
            <li>Ive tried a lot of products since going sulfate free and natural almost a year ago and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>so I get lots of tangles and this helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>and I am white - so I use it for my ends only and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my hair quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue even if I use it multiple times between washes, and it&#x27;s pretty good at holding my curly pattern.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel very soft and it seemed as if the product just sat on top of my hair instead of penetrating the cuticle.</li>
            <li>Exactly  what my hair needed, MOISTURE!</li>
            <li>My hair is so pretty and soft-looking!</li>
            <li>I used this product as a leave in after I wash my hair and follow the LOC method (I add a touch of Jamaican Black Castor oil and Shea butter) and my hair is soft, tangle free and SHINY for DAYS!!!!!</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for moisture and shine that will calm my frizz.</li>
            <li>It lasts awhile so it is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pricey and worth it  </li>
            <li>I just figured they were simply over priced, overrated nice smelling products.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a about 3 months now, and nearly every day I have compliments on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I do color my hair (professionally), and I am sure that has contributed a bit to the dryness.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my dye looking fresh for 2 months</li>
            <li>After a couple of days, the natural oils in my scalp react better with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>After a couple of days, the natural oils in my scalp react better with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and it rinses out without weighing down the hair.</li>
            <li>I only left it on for a minute but these two have made my hair beautiful and shiny.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner w/o any harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li>The price point is higher than what I used to pay for &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; type hair products, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the fact that the conditioner can be used as a leave-out or a leave in and it contains all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>Makes my daughters natural hair soft and very easy to manage.</li>
            <li>For extra conditioning I use them for 45 minutes with a heat cap and the outcome is nothing short of amazing!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the two products for several months and am really pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I actually have people complimenting me now, which is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I actually have people complimenting me now, which is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>You can pick this stuff up at Bed Bath and Beyond for around $9, Amazon prices always seem to be higher for this product.</li>
            <li>Great for my long wavy coarse hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years, even since I realized my &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; hair was actually curly at the age of 15.  </li>
            <li>I love the entire SM line, and this conditioner takes the cake.  </li>
            <li>I just tried this for the first time, Mind</li>
            <li>I make sure I get all my strands covered especially midshaft to ends.</li>
            <li>Later on, the side without conditioner felt much better than the one with.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>I was using this stuff as a leave-in for a while and decided today to use it as a regular conditioner, and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>thanks birth control!)</li>
            <li>Helps with frizz and makes my hair soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>I love how this product does not have the build up effect often associated with deep conditioners.</li>
            <li>That means about 10-12 inches of my hair is still dyed, and there’s about 4-5 inches of my natural light brownish/red hair showing at the crown.&lt;br /&gt;Hits</li>
            <li>I use it about twice a week, and between washings my hair remains soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate free</li>
            <li>Amazon price is almost $5 more than I pay at Target price, which is only $9.99.</li>
            <li>Amazon price is almost $5 more than I pay at Target price, which is only $9.99.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and i love it for my facial hair as leave in-</li>
            <li>Even with my long hair, I need only a small amount after every shampoo to keep my hair healthy, strong and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I felt like this product did a decent job on my long hair, but it did not do a spectacular job.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough how much I love this line and how much it has saved my hair.</li>
            <li>I have switched to Shea Moisture products entirely, and they are a good value at local stores.</li>
            <li>The very first time that I conditioned my hair with this, it made my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Shea moisture has great products but this feels really flat and wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair super soft  </li>
            <li>I have hair that is curly and on the dry side, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love the coconut and hibiscus shampoo, but this conditioner makes my hair dry.</li>
            <li>I use this conditioner daily, even though it has a strong chemical smell, imo.</li>
            <li>However, I strongly prefer the Shea Moisture products overall.</li>
            <li>This shea restorative conditioner tames &amp; relaxes the curls a little more (i.e., less product is needed) and most importantly, and it makes my hair noticeably softer, as a leave-in ought to do.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner has enough &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; that it detangled my hair just fine despite the fact that it contains no silicone.  </li>
            <li>I have 4A type hair that gets dry pretty fast and that tangles easy.</li>
            <li>Works wonders on my Caucasian hair which is curly and dyed very often.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much of the product to do the job.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>really helps my frizzy hair</li>
            <li>how much healthier this line has made my hair.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommended it!</li>
            <li>Using this along with the Shea Moisture shampoo has really transformed my hair.</li>
            <li>But straight.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This is a very dependable product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes hair really soft.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>(http://www.target.com/p/sheamoisture-raw-shea-butter-restorative-conditioner-13-fl-oz/-/A-12239241#item-guestreviews-link)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn’t really help with frizz when it’s just been washed.</li>
            <li>(http://www.target.com/p/sheamoisture-raw-shea-butter-restorative-conditioner-13-fl-oz/-/A-12239241#item-guestreviews-link)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn’t really help with frizz when it’s just been washed.</li>
            <li>pump action makes it easier to get the right amount of conditioner, and not too much at one time like squeeze bottles tend to</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a very noticeable difference when I run my hands through my hair after using this compared to many other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have long, naturally red hair that is kind of wavy and very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since tossed out the conditioner, but there are other shea moisture products I love and will continue to use.</li>
            <li>It was still really dry, and tangled and snagged easily.</li>
            <li>Light and pleasantly fragrant, it tames my humid day frizz as well as cold weather fly-aways.</li>
            <li>The product smells amazing and it isn&#x27;t harsh on your hair at all!</li>
            <li>I rinsed with vinegar water and final rinse was cool water.</li>
            <li>You have to keep the bottle sitting upside down in the shower and then have to unscrew the top every time you want to use it.</li>
            <li>I also love the Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo, which removes styling buildup with apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li>Over a decade later, I have had trouble finding something that gets me consistently good results, until I tried this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine recommended a different method of going shampoo free, using natural conditioners instead of shampoo (or baking soda).</li>
            <li>This conditioner works very well to detangle my daughter&#x27;s curly hair leaving it very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Also as a leave in on my natural hair only a small amount is great.</li>
            <li>This also works very well for my daughter&#x27;s long, super curly hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all the Shea Moisture hair products.ese masks keep it at bay.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend all the Shea Moisture hair products.</li>
            <li>I could use a little more conditioning power which is why I gave it a 3 star.</li>
            <li>As a leave in, this product fairs a little better.</li>
            <li>Now, my hair is actually soft as soon as it dries, and stays pretty soft between washings, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to women who wish to rock their natural hairstyles!</li>
            <li>I live in a humid environment and this shampoo helps my frizz to be controlled.</li>
            <li>Arrived new, not used.  </li>
            <li>It is so hard to find good organic products that actually work for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>I also love the Shea Moisture masks (the raw shea butter and the 10 in 1 renewal formulas).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that one bottle lasts me a long time, much longer than most other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>I like the coconut oil in it, since I use a mask of that mixed with coconut milk for my hair pretty often.</li>
            <li>The ends were more damaged than usual.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I so appreciate quality natural products!</li>
            <li>Granted, it wasn’t some miracle serum that instantly helped my hair after the first wash.</li>
            <li>This just proves that a larger price tag doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean a better product.</li>
            <li>Especially if you have a dry hair or if you&#x27;re that kind of person who takes shower every single day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and the Shea Moisture brand in general (FYI-you can get Shea Moisture products cheaper at drugstores and Target.).</li>
            <li>I did not leave it on very long, as I always wash my hair in a rush, but I believe I have had much better results with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels just as soft ether way.</li>
            <li>I use a natural baby shampoo with this conditioner and it keeps my hair soft, curly, and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and silky without getting frizzy/fluffy or creating buildup.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and natural ingredients in this conditioner.</li>
            <li>This stuff does not seem to really soften the ends although I have yet to leave it in as a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, moisturized, and isnt frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I also like the fact that the product in natural and has not been tested on animals.</li>
            <li>It completely restored my hair</li>
            <li>I gets all the knots out of my hair and it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>my hair feels dryish and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair just feel so soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>When using the LOC (liquid oil cream) method it leaves my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>Does not strip away your natural moisture.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s all or almost all natural,</li>
            <li>Dries out my frequently colored hair.</li>
            <li>maybe i&#x27;m sensitive, but the smell made me nauseous.</li>
            <li>I swear by this product, I always use it, it has helped to make my hair thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read some other reviews where people said they didn&#x27;t like it in the shower, but I actually find it to work better as an actual conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I have 3b, fine, caucasian curly hair with frizz, porosity, and damage from past bleaching and straightening endeavors.)</li>
            <li>I know these seem to be marketed toward natural African American hair, but I am a Caucasian/Hispanic woman with medium length (about 3-4 inches below shoulder length) very curly hair that has become more coarse as I get older (late 30s).  </li>
            <li>The next morning, more often than not, the slightly slick feeling is gone and there&#x27;s just softness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I’ve been using it several months now, and there is such an improvement over when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>: I am white with fairly normal hair, not super fine or coarse and not curly but not pin-straight either.</li>
            <li>After drying my hair, I put a little bit of this in my hair as a leave-in conditioner and this eliminates all of my frizz and allows me to shape my thick, wavy hair just as good as a cream.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was looking for a new deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>Doing it this way has restored my dry ends and really helped with the frizzies and fights the humidity.</li>
            <li>I use it as a deep and a leave in, this line after searching for years really helped my hair grow back , I will forever use it!!</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to some essential oils also, but I have a fighting chance with natural products.  </li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have any major issues with dryness (my hair isn&#x27;t dyed or chemically processed)</li>
            <li>I do need to be careful to focus less conditioner at the roots and more at the ends to avoid a heavier feel at the roots, but I still am a big fan.  </li>
            <li>I have been natural almost 2 years and finally found this.</li>
            <li>I could barely comb through my hair while in the shower.</li>
            <li>The bottle I received must be several years old.  </li>
            <li>Last week the old conditioner ran out and I started using this, and</li>
            <li>Left a greasy residue, but they don&#x27;t test on animals and they use natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>We use wide combs and a lot of gently finger plucking to remove tangles and knots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I might wait a little while before I add the cream or add it right after.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering with dry, frizzy hair and also recommend getting the shampoo to go along with</li>
            <li>so as much as i keep looking for other brands they never work as well as this one does.</li>
            <li>’s a thicker formula, which is probably not good for really fine hair.</li>
            <li>’s a thicker formula, which is probably not good for really fine hair.</li>
            <li>I only react slightly from this product, and slightly is such a rare thing with me that I call it a winner.  </li>
            <li>My hair is really long and curly, but not very thick</li>
            <li>This makes my long, thick, heavy hair feel so nice and soft.</li>
            <li>my curly long hair frequently.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick hair that tangles easy.</li>
            <li>And it air dried in only an hour or so after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>After the bottle gets a little more than half empty, the pump stops working.</li>
            <li>She has very soft curly hair and normally when using shampoo and other conditioners it got extremely tangley.</li>
            <li>I thought it would have a little more consistency and provide the moisture I need because my water&#x27;s so hard,  </li>
            <li>extreme frizz, especially in the Georgia climate I live in.&lt;br /&gt;Light-moderately oily roots, and</li>

            <li> This is a good conditioner for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizing hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell you how good my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I get to an evening where the hair feels good already.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help detangle my type of hair.</li>
            <li> but while it&#x27;s good i wouldn&#x27;t rave about it.  </li>
            <li> Always liked that because it tames frizz-hair into curls and smells great.  </li>
            <li> This product also has a very lovely scent.</li>
            <li> I love to saturate my hair and this one is a great addition to my shower choices.  </li>
            <li> It has an ingredient in it that I assume is some kind of silicone because it sounds like it (amodimethicone) which I want to avoid because it&#x27;s not supposed to be good for hair moisture.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m satisfied !</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>

            <li> Maybe I have to give it a bit more time to seem some added softness and smoothness.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>

            <li> I love to use as it as a conditioner and a leave-in.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my hair feels in a month once I&#x27;ve been using it for a while.</li>
            <li> I love what shea butter does to my hair</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I love Shea Moisture products and had never tried their hair care line.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that these formulas are sulfate free, which protects my precious hair color.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works really well!</li>
            <li> My hairs was full of moisture which I love</li>
            <li> Good, light weight, natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the results would be as great if you only use the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I use a lot of styling products and this shampoo keeps my hair light and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> Just 5 minutes in the shower is all the time necessary for great results.</li>
            <li> (I also switched to a sulfate free shampoo when I started using this.</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> fantastic scent.</li>
            <li> light weight is the 2 stars.</li>
            <li> It is also organic and cruelty free..</li>
            <li> It isnt silky smooth when in the hair</li>
            <li> My hair is so silky smooth after this.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I tried these products, or I probably would have cut my hair short by now.  </li>
            <li> This product is really great for mixed textured hair.</li>
            <li> my hair feels smooth and it makes it easier to comb through</li>
            <li> My hair type:&lt;br /&gt;Bleached then dyed a light reddish color about 6-7 months ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells delicious, and would most likely work better if my hair was not as long as it</li>
            <li> He and his wife had been doing this for a few years, and both of them have beautiful, shiny, bouncy, healthy curls.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is okay, but I feel like my hair is pretty tangled feeling by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> rich lotion without being greasy.</li>
            <li> yet I am excited</li>
            <li> Moisture Rich.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have the chemical garbage in it that most hair products have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells like graham crackers, which is interesting, and I love how soft and shiny it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> --I use it both in the shower to clean my scalp/roots and after showering to condition the ends.</li>
            <li> I guess i&#x27;ll just have to add some essential oil with a pleasant smell to deal with it.</li>
            <li> These products have been amazing at moisturizing my hair and helping me have soft but controlled curls.  </li>
            <li> My hair used to be oily and very straight, plus fine.</li>
            <li> The first time I used them, my hair didn&#x27;t really respond; my waves fell flat but after about 2 shampoos, my hair began to respond well and every time thereafter, I&#x27;ve had very good hair days.</li>
            <li> Super hydrating.</li>
            <li> but atleast the smell is mild so no bugs chasing you.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a lot of products since going sulfate free and natural almost a year ago and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> so I get lots of tangles and this helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> and I am white - so I use it for my ends only and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into my hair quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue even if I use it multiple times between washes, and it&#x27;s pretty good at holding my curly pattern.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel very soft and it seemed as if the product just sat on top of my hair instead of penetrating the cuticle.</li>
            <li> Exactly  what my hair needed, MOISTURE!</li>
            <li> My hair is so pretty and soft-looking!</li>
            <li> I used this product as a leave in after I wash my hair and follow the LOC method (I add a touch of Jamaican Black Castor oil and Shea butter) and my hair is soft, tangle free and SHINY for DAYS!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for moisture and shine that will calm my frizz.</li>
            <li> It lasts awhile so it is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pricey and worth it  </li>
            <li> I just figured they were simply over priced, overrated nice smelling products.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a about 3 months now, and nearly every day I have compliments on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I do color my hair (professionally), and I am sure that has contributed a bit to the dryness.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my dye looking fresh for 2 months</li>
            <li> After a couple of days, the natural oils in my scalp react better with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> After a couple of days, the natural oils in my scalp react better with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and it rinses out without weighing down the hair.</li>
            <li> I only left it on for a minute but these two have made my hair beautiful and shiny.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner w/o any harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> The price point is higher than what I used to pay for &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; type hair products, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the fact that the conditioner can be used as a leave-out or a leave in and it contains all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> Makes my daughters natural hair soft and very easy to manage.</li>
            <li> For extra conditioning I use them for 45 minutes with a heat cap and the outcome is nothing short of amazing!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the two products for several months and am really pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I actually have people complimenting me now, which is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I actually have people complimenting me now, which is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> You can pick this stuff up at Bed Bath and Beyond for around $9, Amazon prices always seem to be higher for this product.</li>
            <li> Great for my long wavy coarse hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years, even since I realized my &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; hair was actually curly at the age of 15.  </li>
            <li> I love the entire SM line, and this conditioner takes the cake.  </li>
            <li> I just tried this for the first time, Mind</li>
            <li> I make sure I get all my strands covered especially midshaft to ends.</li>
            <li> Later on, the side without conditioner felt much better than the one with.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li> I was using this stuff as a leave-in for a while and decided today to use it as a regular conditioner, and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> thanks birth control!)</li>
            <li> Helps with frizz and makes my hair soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> I love how this product does not have the build up effect often associated with deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> That means about 10-12 inches of my hair is still dyed, and there’s about 4-5 inches of my natural light brownish/red hair showing at the crown.&lt;br /&gt;Hits</li>
            <li> I use it about twice a week, and between washings my hair remains soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate free</li>
            <li> Amazon price is almost $5 more than I pay at Target price, which is only $9.99.</li>
            <li> Amazon price is almost $5 more than I pay at Target price, which is only $9.99.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and i love it for my facial hair as leave in-</li>
            <li> Even with my long hair, I need only a small amount after every shampoo to keep my hair healthy, strong and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I felt like this product did a decent job on my long hair, but it did not do a spectacular job.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough how much I love this line and how much it has saved my hair.</li>
            <li> I have switched to Shea Moisture products entirely, and they are a good value at local stores.</li>
            <li> The very first time that I conditioned my hair with this, it made my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Shea moisture has great products but this feels really flat and wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li> it makes my hair super soft  </li>
            <li> I have hair that is curly and on the dry side, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love the coconut and hibiscus shampoo, but this conditioner makes my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner daily, even though it has a strong chemical smell, imo.</li>
            <li> However, I strongly prefer the Shea Moisture products overall.</li>
            <li> This shea restorative conditioner tames &amp; relaxes the curls a little more (i.e., less product is needed) and most importantly, and it makes my hair noticeably softer, as a leave-in ought to do.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner has enough &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; that it detangled my hair just fine despite the fact that it contains no silicone.  </li>
            <li> I have 4A type hair that gets dry pretty fast and that tangles easy.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my Caucasian hair which is curly and dyed very often.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much of the product to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> really helps my frizzy hair</li>
            <li> how much healthier this line has made my hair.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommended it!</li>
            <li> Using this along with the Shea Moisture shampoo has really transformed my hair.</li>
            <li> But straight.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a very dependable product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes hair really soft.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> (http://www.target.com/p/sheamoisture-raw-shea-butter-restorative-conditioner-13-fl-oz/-/A-12239241#item-guestreviews-link)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn’t really help with frizz when it’s just been washed.</li>
            <li> (http://www.target.com/p/sheamoisture-raw-shea-butter-restorative-conditioner-13-fl-oz/-/A-12239241#item-guestreviews-link)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn’t really help with frizz when it’s just been washed.</li>
            <li> pump action makes it easier to get the right amount of conditioner, and not too much at one time like squeeze bottles tend to</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a very noticeable difference when I run my hands through my hair after using this compared to many other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally red hair that is kind of wavy and very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since tossed out the conditioner, but there are other shea moisture products I love and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It was still really dry, and tangled and snagged easily.</li>
            <li> Light and pleasantly fragrant, it tames my humid day frizz as well as cold weather fly-aways.</li>
            <li> The product smells amazing and it isn&#x27;t harsh on your hair at all!</li>
            <li> I rinsed with vinegar water and final rinse was cool water.</li>
            <li> You have to keep the bottle sitting upside down in the shower and then have to unscrew the top every time you want to use it.</li>
            <li> I also love the Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo, which removes styling buildup with apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> Over a decade later, I have had trouble finding something that gets me consistently good results, until I tried this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended a different method of going shampoo free, using natural conditioners instead of shampoo (or baking soda).</li>
            <li> This conditioner works very well to detangle my daughter&#x27;s curly hair leaving it very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Also as a leave in on my natural hair only a small amount is great.</li>
            <li> This also works very well for my daughter&#x27;s long, super curly hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all the Shea Moisture hair products.ese masks keep it at bay.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend all the Shea Moisture hair products.</li>
            <li> I could use a little more conditioning power which is why I gave it a 3 star.</li>
            <li> As a leave in, this product fairs a little better.</li>
            <li> Now, my hair is actually soft as soon as it dries, and stays pretty soft between washings, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to women who wish to rock their natural hairstyles!</li>
            <li> I live in a humid environment and this shampoo helps my frizz to be controlled.</li>
            <li> Arrived new, not used.  </li>
            <li> It is so hard to find good organic products that actually work for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I also love the Shea Moisture masks (the raw shea butter and the 10 in 1 renewal formulas).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that one bottle lasts me a long time, much longer than most other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> I like the coconut oil in it, since I use a mask of that mixed with coconut milk for my hair pretty often.</li>
            <li> The ends were more damaged than usual.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I so appreciate quality natural products!</li>
            <li> Granted, it wasn’t some miracle serum that instantly helped my hair after the first wash.</li>
            <li> This just proves that a larger price tag doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean a better product.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have a dry hair or if you&#x27;re that kind of person who takes shower every single day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and the Shea Moisture brand in general (FYI-you can get Shea Moisture products cheaper at drugstores and Target.).</li>
            <li> I did not leave it on very long, as I always wash my hair in a rush, but I believe I have had much better results with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels just as soft ether way.</li>
            <li> I use a natural baby shampoo with this conditioner and it keeps my hair soft, curly, and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and silky without getting frizzy/fluffy or creating buildup.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and natural ingredients in this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not seem to really soften the ends although I have yet to leave it in as a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, moisturized, and isnt frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I also like the fact that the product in natural and has not been tested on animals.</li>
            <li> It completely restored my hair</li>
            <li> I gets all the knots out of my hair and it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> my hair feels dryish and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair just feel so soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> When using the LOC (liquid oil cream) method it leaves my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Does not strip away your natural moisture.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s all or almost all natural,</li>
            <li> Dries out my frequently colored hair.</li>
            <li> maybe i&#x27;m sensitive, but the smell made me nauseous.</li>
            <li> I swear by this product, I always use it, it has helped to make my hair thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some other reviews where people said they didn&#x27;t like it in the shower, but I actually find it to work better as an actual conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I have 3b, fine, caucasian curly hair with frizz, porosity, and damage from past bleaching and straightening endeavors.)</li>
            <li> I know these seem to be marketed toward natural African American hair, but I am a Caucasian/Hispanic woman with medium length (about 3-4 inches below shoulder length) very curly hair that has become more coarse as I get older (late 30s).  </li>
            <li> The next morning, more often than not, the slightly slick feeling is gone and there&#x27;s just softness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’ve been using it several months now, and there is such an improvement over when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> : I am white with fairly normal hair, not super fine or coarse and not curly but not pin-straight either.</li>
            <li> After drying my hair, I put a little bit of this in my hair as a leave-in conditioner and this eliminates all of my frizz and allows me to shape my thick, wavy hair just as good as a cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a new deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Doing it this way has restored my dry ends and really helped with the frizzies and fights the humidity.</li>
            <li> I use it as a deep and a leave in, this line after searching for years really helped my hair grow back , I will forever use it!!</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to some essential oils also, but I have a fighting chance with natural products.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have any major issues with dryness (my hair isn&#x27;t dyed or chemically processed)</li>
            <li> I do need to be careful to focus less conditioner at the roots and more at the ends to avoid a heavier feel at the roots, but I still am a big fan.  </li>
            <li> I have been natural almost 2 years and finally found this.</li>
            <li> I could barely comb through my hair while in the shower.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received must be several years old.  </li>
            <li> Last week the old conditioner ran out and I started using this, and</li>
            <li> Left a greasy residue, but they don&#x27;t test on animals and they use natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> We use wide combs and a lot of gently finger plucking to remove tangles and knots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I might wait a little while before I add the cream or add it right after.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering with dry, frizzy hair and also recommend getting the shampoo to go along with</li>
            <li> so as much as i keep looking for other brands they never work as well as this one does.</li>
            <li> ’s a thicker formula, which is probably not good for really fine hair.</li>
            <li> ’s a thicker formula, which is probably not good for really fine hair.</li>
            <li> I only react slightly from this product, and slightly is such a rare thing with me that I call it a winner.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really long and curly, but not very thick</li>
            <li> This makes my long, thick, heavy hair feel so nice and soft.</li>
            <li> my curly long hair frequently.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that tangles easy.</li>
            <li> And it air dried in only an hour or so after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> After the bottle gets a little more than half empty, the pump stops working.</li>
            <li> She has very soft curly hair and normally when using shampoo and other conditioners it got extremely tangley.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have a little more consistency and provide the moisture I need because my water&#x27;s so hard,  </li>
            <li> extreme frizz, especially in the Georgia climate I live in.&lt;br /&gt;Light-moderately oily roots, and</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the shampoo though, which doesn&#x27;t really lather..</li>
            <li> Curly hair is very dry and needs moisturizer almost every day for us who live in the dry desert.</li>
            <li> Raw shampoo is different from other shampoos (even other sulfate free formulas) and it takes several uses to reap the benefits.  </li>
            <li> Even though I rinsed it out like crazy, the scent was very strong.</li>
            <li> , I am black and Native American &amp; also transitioning to Natural</li>
            <li> It actually stinks rather strong like old wax.  </li>
            <li> I left it in for a long time and nothing.</li>
            <li> After the first two washes, I had my bouncy, tight little curls</li>
            <li> With that combination of products, my hair was a solid &amp;#34;good,&amp;#34; but still took a long time to dry without a hair dryer and was prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that it be left on for about 5 minutes for very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and flat iron</li>
            <li> I had been looking for sulfate-free shampoo and silicone-free conditioner for some time since they really are hard to find that truly are what they say they are.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to get away with using anything on my hair to wash and condition, but lately the Suave Professionals line just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore for me, and my hair was very tangled and matted at the ends.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and a tablespoon is all I need.  </li>
            <li> With long hair, dryness is always a problem and these masks keep it at bay.  </li>
            <li> I have Caucasian, curly/wavy brown hair that is around 35 inches long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, this conditioner was a lifesaver when I was a swim instructor for awhile and my hair was getting long exposure to chlorine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair had been dry for a long time and I could not find a product that would help with that while not causing allergic reactions (I&#x27;m allergic to fragrances).</li>
            <li> I apply it for 3 minutes before shower and sometimes I put a very small amount of it after using hairdryer and it really works.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I also purchased the shampoo (different seller).  </li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with the raw shea butter shampoo and, together, these two products give me shiny, soft hair with lots of body.  </li>
            <li> It is now a bit wavy and the ends feel dry, even though I just cut it into a bob again.</li>
            <li> I squeeze excess moisture of of my hair with a towel, scrunch with this conditioner, and air dry.  </li>
            <li> but it was dry like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can feel the difference between dry crunch hair with oil on it and moisturized hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lifesaver for people with processed hair or dry hair.</li>
            <li> , I just have a bit of dry ends.</li>
            <li> dry, brittle, split-end prone</li>
            <li> This winter was terribly dry</li>
            <li> 3 star rating is merely because I felt it was good, but not - great.</li>
            <li> As a deep conditioner, my experience was below average.</li>
            <li> I shampooed my hair, and then applied the conditioner to only half of my head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m multi ethnic; Puerto Rican, black, native American.</li>
            <li> For anyone with really long curly hair, brushes are the bane of our existence and can only lead to frizz and limp curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s repaired my severely damaged and dry hair, due to environment and sun.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not really what it did.  </li>
            <li> It was money well spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Shea Moisture shampoo for a few months, but still had a giant bottle of chemically salon conditioner to use up.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, along with the raw shea butter shampoo, from a local drugstore where it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so that makes it quite a value for the price.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LONG way for me.</li>
            <li> little lasts a long ways.</li>
            <li> scent that is only slightly fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;Not overly greasy or heavy in my hair.</li>
            <li> so I can buy as soon as the other bottle is empty!)</li>
            <li> I have given up my other leave-in as a result.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend an additional product if you have extreme frizz</li>
            <li> I would recommend an additional product if you have extreme frizz</li>
            <li> let the liquid stage settle on my hair for a little bit, let it dry up a bit</li>
            <li> I had when I was little that I turned into a flat and frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> The smell fades slightly when my hair is dry, so this is less of an issue.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I started following the method of hair care where you use baking soda to wash your hair, as a way to cleanse without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> A raw shampoo takes a little getting used to, but once you do, you&#x27;ll definitely sing its praises.  </li>
            <li> My curly hair is softer, curlier, and less frizzy with this conditioner than any other conditioner I have used.  </li>
            <li> My fault because I should&#x27;ve done my research on hard water prior to looking for a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long I leave it in for.</li>
            <li> I have thick red hair and this smoothies it out, makes.it shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> It will leave your hair feeling moisturized but not greasy or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt look greasy, sticky, or weighed down at all.  </li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;m done showering, I take down the clip and rinse out the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll be buying this again, it seems watered down.</li>
            <li> and this does not weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any particular benefit over other less expensive conditioners.  </li>
            <li> hair had less tangles</li>
            <li> I previously was using ORS&#x27; Olive Oil Replenshing Conditioner</li>
            <li> Plus it costs less.</li>
            <li> I had less hair come out while I felt my hair strengthen.</li>
            <li> I used to always where my hair up because it was just going to turn into a mess anyways.</li>
            <li> I have  really thick and dry hair.</li>
            <li> a little floral with a hint of earthiness.  </li>
            <li> A Little Pricey....</li>

            <li> It is one of the few products on the beauty market that truly lives up to its promises.</li>
            <li> And unlike other all natural hair products, which tend to be thin and runny, this one is very thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> The little hole for dispensing is small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to go back to Wen hair products, but this is way less expensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;I might have to do this a few nights in a row, but EVENTUALLY  (usually 2 or 3 days)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve purchased this from another retailer store and the only thing i don&#x27;t like is the smell, but boy has it saved me from grabbing scissors and cutting all my hair off from the excessive amount of single strand knots i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kimmaytube mixture as the leave-in as the liquid and avocado oil as the oil and Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner as the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was wondering if it was the conditioner, so I did my usual test for hair products.</li>

            <li> I am extremely sensitive to chemical (artificial) fragrances.</li>
            <li> I use this as a leave-in conditioner and while I have badly damaged hair from trying to comb it this winter; I was pulling handfuls of hair out of the comb; this product has fixed the problem.  </li>

            <li> After about a month I was disappointed with the results, but I didn&#x27;t want to go back to cleansing with chemicals.  </li>

            <li> The product does not moisturizes and leaves completely dry, tangled hair, it is very bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Previous to this, I WAS using Bioloage shampoo and conditioner (which is about twice as expensive), and I started noticing after a couple of months that it just wasn’t working for my hair.</li>
            <li> I had a really bad reaction to this.</li>
            <li> so I was a bit disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Super hydrating. Works wonders on my Caucasian hair which is curly and dyed very often. Amazing.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my granddaughter per her request. She was thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair product as a deep conditioner with a cap and heat work wonders. Also as a leave in on my natural hair only a small amount is great. I have been natural almost 2 years and finally found this.</li>
            <li> I have medium texture Caucasian hair that&#x27;s somewhat wavy and I am truly impressed with this conditioner.  I use it in conjunction with the raw shea butter shampoo and, together, these two products give me shiny, soft hair with lots of body.  Raw shampoo is different from other shampoos (even other sulfate free formulas) and it takes several uses to reap the benefits.  I&#x27;ve used the two products for several months and am really pleased with the results.  The first time I used them, my hair didn&#x27;t really respond; my waves fell flat but after about 2 shampoos, my hair began to respond well and every time thereafter, I&#x27;ve had very good hair days. This conditioner has enough &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; that it detangled my hair just fine despite the fact that it contains no silicone.  And itt smells wonderful; a little floral with a hint of earthiness.  It doesn&#x27;t take much of the product to do the job.  My hair is long and a tablespoon is all I need.  Together, these two products are amazing.  I would recommend that you try them in unison.  I don&#x27;t think the results would be as great if you only use the conditioner.  A raw shampoo takes a little getting used to, but once you do, you&#x27;ll definitely sing its praises.  I love the fact that these formulas are sulfate free, which protects my precious hair color.  I purchase my Shea Moisture products at Walgreens, CVS, Sally Beauty Supply or Ulta for about $10-$11 a bottle.  I also love the Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo, which removes styling buildup with apple cider vinegar.  I use it about every 3rd or 4th shampoo.  I use a lot of styling products and this shampoo keeps my hair light and bouncy.  I also love the Shea Moisture masks (the raw shea butter and the 10 in 1 renewal formulas).  Just 5 minutes in the shower is all the time necessary for great results. For extra conditioning I use them for 45 minutes with a heat cap and the outcome is nothing short of amazing!  With long hair, dryness is always a problem and these masks keep it at bay.  I&#x27;m truly in love with all the Shea Moisture products I use.  My hair has never been in better condition.  I actually have people complimenting me now, which is fantastic!  I highly recommend all the Shea Moisture hair products.ese masks keep it at bay.  I&#x27;m truly in love with all the Shea Moisture products I use.  My hair has never been in better condition.  I actually have people complimenting me now, which is fantastic!  I highly recommend all the Shea Moisture hair products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! It smells great and is super moisturizing. So happy I chose to buy this product. Also, it&#x27;s all natural! A must have for curly hair. I will definitely be buying this stuff again.</li>
            <li> Love it love love love it! I use it as a deep and a leave in, this line after searching for years really helped my hair grow back , I will forever use it!! I may try as I am products just for curiosity but I&#x27;m satisfied !</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. After the first two washes, I had my bouncy, tight little curls I had when I was little that I turned into a flat and frizzy mess. (I also switched to a sulfate free shampoo when I started using this. Not shea moisture, but I&#x27;m glad that they have one so I can buy as soon as the other bottle is empty!) I only use it as leave in if I&#x27;m going to style my hair for the day, if not I leave it out. It feels just as soft ether way. Will buy again and again! I&#x27;ve been wanting to go back to Wen hair products, but this is way less expensive and I love the way this treats my hair even better.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is okay, but I feel like my hair is pretty tangled feeling by the end of the day. You can pick this stuff up at Bed Bath and Beyond for around $9, Amazon prices always seem to be higher for this product. One thing that drives me nuts about this product it the bottle. After the bottle gets a little more than half empty, the pump stops working. You have to keep the bottle sitting upside down in the shower and then have to unscrew the top every time you want to use it. I find it very annoying.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, along with the raw shea butter shampoo, from a local drugstore where it was cheaper. I recommend stopping into your local CVS or Walgreens before purchasing here as Shea Moisture products appear to always be more expensive on Amazon than drugstores or Target. Now, on to the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this conditioner. I use it in the shower after the shampoo and leave it in for 3 or so minutes and then wash it out. My hair feels silky smooth. After drying my hair, I put a little bit of this in my hair as a leave-in conditioner and this eliminates all of my frizz and allows me to shape my thick, wavy hair just as good as a cream. I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering with dry, frizzy hair and also recommend getting the shampoo to go along with</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I used this along with the Moisture Retention Shampoo. I rinsed with vinegar water and final rinse was cool water. I only left it on for a minute but these two have made my hair beautiful and shiny. I have Caucasian, curly/wavy brown hair that is around 35 inches long. I am always looking for moisture and shine that will calm my frizz. This stuff did a really good job. I like the coconut oil in it, since I use a mask of that mixed with coconut milk for my hair pretty often.</li>
            <li> Just started, smells great!!! A Little Pricey....</li>
            <li> Great product good delivery</li>
            <li> Love this product. It makes my hair nice and controlled, with no frizz. It smells like the beach to me, yummy.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve purchased this from another retailer store and the only thing i don&#x27;t like is the smell, but boy has it saved me from grabbing scissors and cutting all my hair off from the excessive amount of single strand knots i&#x27;ve had. so as much as i keep looking for other brands they never work as well as this one does. I guess i&#x27;ll just have to add some essential oil with a pleasant smell to deal with it. but atleast the smell is mild so no bugs chasing you.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this product, I was doing a No Poo hair care (only apple cider vinegar and baking soda in my hair). Although it made my hair grow faster, my hair looked greasy and limp (I have curly hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use a natural baby shampoo with this conditioner and it keeps my hair soft, curly, and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner also smells so good. My boyfriend loves the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the bottle for several months now and I&#x27;m maybe halfway through. It lasts awhile so it is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this conditioner was a lifesaver when I was a swim instructor for awhile and my hair was getting long exposure to chlorine.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> really helps my frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and it&#x27;s the best leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve come across thus far. It absorbs into my hair quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue even if I use it multiple times between washes, and it&#x27;s pretty good at holding my curly pattern. I highly recommend this product and the Shea Moisture brand in general (FYI-you can get Shea Moisture products cheaper at drugstores and Target.).</li>
            <li> While I LOVE LOVE this line and now most of my family uses it...this one was not my fav.  You have to use A LOT and have lots of water in your hair to actually get it all the way through.  I use this when I run out of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the coconut conditioner much better.</li>
            <li> LOVE! It&#x27;s the only conditioner that works with my daughters&#x27; hair. She has very soft curly hair and normally when using shampoo and other conditioners it got extremely tangley. This product also has a very lovely scent. People are always saying how good she smells.</li>
            <li> I felt like this product did a decent job on my long hair, but it did not do a spectacular job. I did not leave it on very long, as I always wash my hair in a rush, but I believe I have had much better results with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells delicious, and would most likely work better if my hair was not as long as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 star rating is merely because I felt it was good, but not - great.</li>
            <li> fantastic scent. rich lotion without being greasy. heals immediately and made a difference in both my husband and my father&#x27;s allergy to methylisothiazolinone immediately.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff.... Gives a good amount of slippage... And works wonderful as a leave in!</li>
            <li> The product does not moisturizes and leaves completely dry, tangled hair, it is very bad. I do not recommend it</li>
            <li> I freeeeeaaakin love this conditioner it makes my hair super soft  , I am black and Native American &amp; also transitioning to Natural and this is the best product for that I llooovvveee it love it love it</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re a curly haired person and are looking for a product to enhance those curls, this would be it lol. never leave home without it. and it&#x27;s both a conditioner &amp; leave-in conditioner which is also nice :)</li>
            <li> Shea moisture has great products but this feels really flat and wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  I thought it would have a little more consistency and provide the moisture I need because my water&#x27;s so hard,  but that&#x27;s not really what it did.  My fault because I should&#x27;ve done my research on hard water prior to looking for a conditioner.</li>
            <li> If I would be fair and honest I am going to write pages to explain how much I love the product . However it has the thickness of mayonnaise it gives your hair a shiny healthy look that everyone admire. Buy it now don&#x27;t hesitate it deserved every penny. Especially if you have a dry hair or if you&#x27;re that kind of person who takes shower every single day. I apply it for 3 minutes before shower and sometimes I put a very small amount of it after using hairdryer and it really works.</li>
            <li> Great for my long wavy coarse hair! Makes my hair soft and silky without getting frizzy/fluffy or creating buildup. I use this conditioner daily, even though it has a strong chemical smell, imo. The smell fades slightly when my hair is dry, so this is less of an issue.</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner for thinning hair. It did arrive with the pump wrapped with tape, but, some was leaking.</li>
            <li> This product is a great conditioner.  It will leave your hair feeling moisturized but not greasy or weighed down.  It was money well spent.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and natural ingredients in this conditioner. I have been coloring my hair for years and recently took a break and grew it out. The ends were more damaged than usual. My hair used to be oily and very straight, plus fine. It is now a bit wavy and the ends feel dry, even though I just cut it into a bob again. This stuff does not seem to really soften the ends although I have yet to leave it in as a deep conditioning treatment. I really love the way Neutrogena triple moisture conditioner makes my hair feel and look, but wanted to get away from any chemicals...</li>
            <li> This smells great. But the product itself did nothing for my hair. I used it as a deep conditioner. The shampoo is great. This product says it can be left in or rinsed. I left it in for a long time and nothing. Not sure how long I leave it in for. But it smells great and is light weight is the 2 stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite brand of hair care product. Makes my daughters natural hair soft and very easy to manage. Will continue to buy this brand of shampoo and conditioner. Love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner! It is used after a shampoo and also as a leave in. Light and pleasantly fragrant, it tames my humid day frizz as well as cold weather fly-aways. It is even nice as a boy lotion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years, even since I realized my &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; hair was actually curly at the age of 15.  Over a decade later, I have had trouble finding something that gets me consistently good results, until I tried this conditioner.  Whenever it is on sale, I buy multiple bottles.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a lot of products since going sulfate free and natural almost a year ago and this is my favorite.  I love the entire SM line, and this conditioner takes the cake.  I use it as an in-shower conditioner after my SM shampoo, and as a leave in styler.  I squeeze excess moisture of of my hair with a towel, scrunch with this conditioner, and air dry.  My hair feels soft, moisturized, and isnt frizzy.  It doesnt look greasy, sticky, or weighed down at all.  I love the smell and how much healthier this line has made my hair. It is also organic and cruelty free.. I dont think it can get any better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I have 3b, fine, caucasian curly hair with frizz, porosity, and damage from past bleaching and straightening endeavors.)</li>
            <li> My hair had been dry for a long time and I could not find a product that would help with that while not causing allergic reactions (I&#x27;m allergic to fragrances). This conditioner does the trick. I also like the fact that the product in natural and has not been tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and flat iron my curly long hair frequently.  This product helps to maintain my hair condition and look great with no split ends or frizzy results.  Even with my long hair, I need only a small amount after every shampoo to keep my hair healthy, strong and beautiful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been the ultimate in moisturizing and conditioning.  It&#x27;s repaired my severely damaged and dry hair, due to environment and sun.  It completely restored my hair</li>
            <li> I use this as a leave in conditioner and it does wonders for my curly hair. I Highly recommended it!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a solid for stars. I love that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have the chemical garbage in it that most hair products have. And unlike other all natural hair products, which tend to be thin and runny, this one is very thick and creamy.  I gets all the knots out of my hair and it leaves my hair soft and shiny. I&#x27;ve also noticed that one bottle lasts me a long time, much longer than most other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I had a really bad reaction to this. Even though I rinsed it out like crazy, the scent was very strong. And worse than that, it made my eyes, nose and throat burn. There has got to be something nasty in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair had less tangles but it was dry like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad for the return policy.</li>
            <li> Exactly  what my hair needed, MOISTURE!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, and it smells amazing! It is so hard to find good organic products that actually work for my skin and hair. Shea Moisture knows their stuff!</li>
            <li> I just tried this for the first time, Mind you I have hair that is curly and on the dry side, and I absolutely love it. I will definitely buy this product again when I run out. It&#x27;s Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I am not very impressed. Maybe I have to give it a bit more time to seem some added softness and smoothness. It isnt silky smooth when in the hair so I was a bit disappointed yet I am excited bc I know I will get results.</li>
            <li> Wow! This sure keeps the snarls out of my three daughters hair!  It also smells nice which is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Good, light weight, natural conditioner. I could use a little more conditioning power which is why I gave it a 3 star. I have straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that tangles easy. There was no slip factor with this product, I don&#x27;t like it. I could barely comb through my hair while in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful conditioner with a pleasant scent and works well as a leave in also. A little goes a long way so that makes it quite a value for the price. I so appreciate quality natural products!</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizing hair conditioner. The scent is pleasant and it rinses out without weighing down the hair. I would recommend that it be left on for about 5 minutes for very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m using the LOC method  (Liquid Oil Cream)for moisturizing my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using Kimmaytube mixture as the leave-in as the liquid and avocado oil as the oil and Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner as the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how good my hair feels. It took a while but I can finally see that I DO HAVE a curl pattern. I can feel the difference between dry crunch hair with oil on it and moisturized hair. And the last step, the cream, this shea butter is THE KEY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the liquid stage settle on my hair for a little bit, let it dry up a bit -until my hair feels dryish and soft. Then I use a little oil to seal the moisture in. I might wait a little while before I add the cream or add it right after. My hair just feel so soft and flexible. The next morning, more often than not, the slightly slick feeling is gone and there&#x27;s just softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have to do this a few nights in a row, but EVENTUALLY  (usually 2 or 3 days) I get to an evening where the hair feels good already. I may spritz some of kimmaytube or I may leave it alone. But this product is the key to getting that moisture in and keep it in. I adore it.</li>
            <li> Using this along with the Shea Moisture shampoo has really transformed my hair. I have long, naturally red hair that is kind of wavy and very prone to frizz. Humidity is my nemesis. I had been looking for sulfate-free shampoo and silicone-free conditioner for some time since they really are hard to find that truly are what they say they are. After I use the shampoo, I apply this in the shower. I make sure I get all my strands covered especially midshaft to ends. Then I twist my hair around and clip it up with a claw clip and finish the rest of my shower. I do this so the conditioner can use the heat from the shower to penetrate the hair shaft. Once I&#x27;m done showering, I take down the clip and rinse out the conditioner. My hair is so silky smooth after this. Then I take about a dime sized amount for my midshaft to ends as a leave-in. Doing it this way has restored my dry ends and really helped with the frizzies and fights the humidity. I just can&#x27;t say enough how much I love this line and how much it has saved my hair. I used to always where my hair up because it was just going to turn into a mess anyways. Now I can where my hair down and style it with confidence knowing that it&#x27;s not going to fail me by mid-day.</li>
            <li> I love their products</li>
            <li> I have to say, I don&#x27;t like this. I love the coconut and hibiscus shampoo, but this conditioner makes my hair dry. I was wondering if it was the conditioner, so I did my usual test for hair products. I shampooed my hair, and then applied the conditioner to only half of my head. Later on, the side without conditioner felt much better than the one with. I&#x27;ve since tossed out the conditioner, but there are other shea moisture products I love and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a new deep conditioner. I previously was using ORS&#x27; Olive Oil Replenshing Conditioner but I ran out and wanted a change. It seems like everyone is always raving about Shea Moisture so I wanted to give this brand a try. According to the directions of this product, it can be used as a deep comditioner and a leave in. As a deep conditioner, my experience was below average. My hair didn&#x27;t feel very soft and it seemed as if the product just sat on top of my hair instead of penetrating the cuticle. As a leave in, this product fairs a little better. When using the LOC (liquid oil cream) method it leaves my hair soft and shiny and I prefered it to the creamy leave in that I used in the past (Cantu Shea Butter). However, after my experience with it as a deep conditioner, I went back to my ORS deep conditioner. This just proves that a larger price tag doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean a better product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! I have  really thick and dry hair. This stuff takes  the frizz out and defines my curls.</li>
            <li> The little hole for dispensing is small but I LOVE THE CONDITIONER!  I love to saturate my hair and this one is a great addition to my shower choices.  Smells wonderful, washes out nicely and leaves hair soft!!!  Get it!</li>
            <li> Best stuff on earth , it always leaves my hair feeling moisturized !</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product. I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll be buying this again, it seems watered down.</li>
            <li> Moisture Rich. Does not strip away your natural moisture. Leaves hair soft and manageable. Pricey and worth it  in terms of results and ongoing health of hair.</li>
            <li> This is some seriously amazing conditioner! You can leave it in or rinse it out, your preference. It&#x27;s a lifesaver for people with processed hair or dry hair. It is one of the few products on the beauty market that truly lives up to its promises. Just wonderful!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair too oily</li>
            <li> This conditioner works very well to detangle my daughter&#x27;s curly hair leaving it very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works really well! Great product!</li>
            <li> Better priced at target. I love this stuff. I&#x27;m multi ethnic; Puerto Rican, black, native American. Hair is Everything But straight. This is a must have conditioner for me.</li>
            <li> I was using this stuff as a leave-in for a while and decided today to use it as a regular conditioner, and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some other reviews where people said they didn&#x27;t like it in the shower, but I actually find it to work better as an actual conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like graham crackers, which is interesting, and I love how soft and shiny it leaves my hair. There&#x27;s a very noticeable difference when I run my hands through my hair after using this compared to many other conditioners I&#x27;ve tried. Plus it&#x27;s all or almost all natural, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still had a tiny bit of dryness at my ends after blowdrying, but I also didn&#x27;t use any leave-in, so I&#x27;m guessing if I did, my hair would look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I am white with fairly normal hair, not super fine or coarse and not curly but not pin-straight either. I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of people say this is good for African-American hair, but it works great on my Caucasian hair too. And I don&#x27;t have any major issues with dryness (my hair isn&#x27;t dyed or chemically processed), I just have a bit of dry ends.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LONG way for me. My hair is really long and curly, but not very thick so I get lots of tangles and this helps tremendously. I only put it on my ends, and it smells delicious!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I have thinning (thanks birth control!) wavy/curly hair and I stopped shampooing and only conditioning to minimize damage to my scalp and hair. This stuff is great--I use it both in the shower to clean my scalp/roots and after showering to condition the ends. Helps with frizz and makes my hair soft &amp; smooth. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner w/o any harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> I live in a humid environment and this shampoo helps my frizz to be controlled. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st Shea Moisture product I&#x60;ve tried; I could just could never understand what the big rave was about Shea Moisture products. I just figured they were simply over priced, overrated nice smelling products. But honestly, I am so satisfied with this product! I have 4A type hair that gets dry pretty fast and that tangles easy. I used this product as a leave in after I wash my hair and follow the LOC method (I add a touch of Jamaican Black Castor oil and Shea butter) and my hair is soft, tangle free and SHINY for DAYS!!!!! Yes, DAYS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Not impressed with the price of this product though, but LOVE the way it makes my hair look. Great ingredients and excellent for thirsty hair.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I started following the method of hair care where you use baking soda to wash your hair, as a way to cleanse without harsh chemicals. After about a month I was disappointed with the results, but I didn&#x27;t want to go back to cleansing with chemicals.  A friend of mine recommended a different method of going shampoo free, using natural conditioners instead of shampoo (or baking soda). He and his wife had been doing this for a few years, and both of them have beautiful, shiny, bouncy, healthy curls. He and his wife recommended this conditioner. I have been using it for a about 3 months now, and nearly every day I have compliments on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Smells great and has a nice finish to it.. can be used as a leave in conditioner and leaves no greasy residue!</li>
            <li> This is a good quality conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help detangle my type of hair. However, I strongly prefer the Shea Moisture products overall.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this conditioner. The bottle I received must be several years old.  It actually stinks rather strong like old wax.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any particular benefit over other less expensive conditioners.  Won&#x27;t purchase this product from this seller again.  On the other hand, I also purchased the shampoo (different seller).  IT smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> My curly hair is softer, curlier, and less frizzy with this conditioner than any other conditioner I have used.  (It should be noted that I do not use a traditional shampoo, but rather scrub my scalp with a sulfate-free wash and then use this conditioner on my hair.)</li>
            <li> A deep conditioning conditioner essentially. It seems like it&#x27;s made for ethnic hair and I am white - so I use it for my ends only and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I really love these products.  I am currently using this, the Shea shampoo, and then I use the Coconut Hibiscus styling products too (a mix of the agave gel and a tiny bit of the &amp;#34;smoothie&amp;#34; - about 3/4 to 1/4 ratio).  I know these seem to be marketed toward natural African American hair, but I am a Caucasian/Hispanic woman with medium length (about 3-4 inches below shoulder length) very curly hair that has become more coarse as I get older (late 30s).  I used to be able to get away with using anything on my hair to wash and condition, but lately the Suave Professionals line just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore for me, and my hair was very tangled and matted at the ends.  I do color my hair (professionally), and I am sure that has contributed a bit to the dryness.  These products have been amazing at moisturizing my hair and helping me have soft but controlled curls.  I do need to be careful to focus less conditioner at the roots and more at the ends to avoid a heavier feel at the roots, but I still am a big fan.  I am so happy I tried these products, or I probably would have cut my hair short by now.  The price point is higher than what I used to pay for &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; type hair products, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Dries out my frequently colored hair. May be better for others.</li>
            <li> Keeps my dye looking fresh for 2 months</li>
            <li> This product is really great for mixed textured hair. I love to use as it as a conditioner and a leave-in.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this conditioner! I really enjoy the fact that the conditioner can be used as a leave-out or a leave in and it contains all natural ingredients! The product smells amazing and it isn&#x27;t harsh on your hair at all! The very first time that I conditioned my hair with this, it made my hair very soft and manageable. I highly recommend this to women who wish to rock their natural hairstyles!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Shea Moisture shampoo for a few months, but still had a giant bottle of chemically salon conditioner to use up. With that combination of products, my hair was a solid &amp;#34;good,&amp;#34; but still took a long time to dry without a hair dryer and was prone to frizz. Last week the old conditioner ran out and I started using this, and oh my gosh! My hair is so pretty and soft-looking! And it air dried in only an hour or so after the first time I used it. Can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my hair feels in a month once I&#x27;ve been using it for a while.</li>
            <li> Have gone shampoo-free, co-washing/ plus using diluted apple cider vinegar to get the chlorine out after swimming.  I love what shea butter does to my hair so tried this but while it&#x27;s good i wouldn&#x27;t rave about it.  Haven&#x27;t tried it as a leave-in, though, so can&#x27;t say how it works for that.  Update: this is very good as a leave-in.  I have given up my other leave-in as a result.  The one I&#x27;d been using for a couple decades (!) is Sebastian Potion 9 http://smile.amazon.com/Sebastian-Potion-Wearable-Treatment-16-9/dp/B003G42Y6A/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1429373134&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;sebastian+potion+no+9 Always liked that because it tames frizz-hair into curls and smells great.  It has an ingredient in it that I assume is some kind of silicone because it sounds like it (amodimethicone) which I want to avoid because it&#x27;s not supposed to be good for hair moisture.  This shea restorative conditioner tames &amp; relaxes the curls a little more (i.e., less product is needed) and most importantly, and it makes my hair noticeably softer, as a leave-in ought to do.  Plus it costs less.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived new, not used.  Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I swear by this product, I always use it, it has helped to make my hair thick and healthy. This is a very dependable product.</li>
            <li> Great hair moisturizer! my hair feels smooth and it makes it easier to comb through</li>
            <li> I love how this product does not have the build up effect often associated with deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> This makes my long, thick, heavy hair feel so nice and soft. My hair is easier to style with this because it makes it smoother. This also works very well for my daughter&#x27;s long, super curly hair. Curly hair is very dry and needs moisturizer almost every day for us who live in the dry desert. This is one of our favorite hair products!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. Can be used as conditioner or a leave in treatment. Not a huge fan of the shampoo though, which doesn&#x27;t really lather.. Both smell great though.</li>
            <li> Left a greasy residue, but they don&#x27;t test on animals and they use natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> My hair type:&lt;br /&gt;Bleached then dyed a light reddish color about 6-7 months ago. That means about 10-12 inches of my hair is still dyed, and there’s about 4-5 inches of my natural light brownish/red hair showing at the crown.&lt;br /&gt;Hits my waist, and is medium thickness.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally wavy/curly (the curls loosen out the longer it gets).&lt;br /&gt;Moderate-extreme frizz, especially in the Georgia climate I live in.&lt;br /&gt;Light-moderately oily roots, and dry, brittle, split-end prone tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous to this, I WAS using Bioloage shampoo and conditioner (which is about twice as expensive), and I started noticing after a couple of months that it just wasn’t working for my hair. It was still really dry, and tangled and snagged easily. For anyone with really long curly hair, brushes are the bane of our existence and can only lead to frizz and limp curls. We use wide combs and a lot of gently finger plucking to remove tangles and knots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this conditioner for a couple of weeks, I started to notice a difference. Granted, it wasn’t some miracle serum that instantly helped my hair after the first wash. I was still using this in conjunction with another conditioner to make it softer. I’ve been using it several months now, and there is such an improvement over when I first started using it. I was literally pulling nickel sized knots out of my hair and seeing A LOT of hair in the drain. Now, my hair is actually soft as soon as it dries, and stays pretty soft between washings, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair really soft.&lt;br /&gt;Easy pump action makes it easier to get the right amount of conditioner, and not too much at one time like squeeze bottles tend to distribute.&lt;br /&gt;A little lasts a long ways. I’ve been using this product for about 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Mild scent that is only slightly fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;Not overly greasy or heavy in my hair. I use it about twice a week, and between washings my hair remains soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate free (this makes it great on color treated hair).&lt;br /&gt;Also no parabens, paraffin, or synthetic fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price is almost $5 more than I pay at Target price, which is only $9.99. (http://www.target.com/p/sheamoisture-raw-shea-butter-restorative-conditioner-13-fl-oz/-/A-12239241#item-guestreviews-link)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn’t really help with frizz when it’s just been washed. After a couple of days, the natural oils in my scalp react better with the conditioner. I would recommend an additional product if you have extreme frizz (though one on the lighter side).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEUTRAL:&lt;br /&gt;It’s a thicker formula, which is probably not good for really fine hair. It may make hair like that greasy. It’s great for my medium-thick hair.this makes it great on color treated hair).&lt;br /&gt;Also no parabens, paraffin, or synthetic fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price is almost $5 more than I pay at Target price, which is only $9.99.

            <li> I am extremely sensitive to chemical (artificial) fragrances. I am sensitive to some essential oils also, but I have a fighting chance with natural products.  I only react slightly from this product, and slightly is such a rare thing with me that I call it a winner.  I&#x27;m a white male with type 3 hair. An African-American friend with cosmetology school experience told me I should be using &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; products. I used to have short hair, but since retiring, I am now playing blues music part-time and grew my hair out for the proper look. This winter was terribly dry and I had no knowledge in advance what that would do to my hair. The dryness left my hair unmanageably coarse and knotted. I couldn&#x27;t even pull out the knots with my fingers, so I had to learn about proper hair care. I use this as a leave-in conditioner and while I have badly damaged hair from trying to comb it this winter; I was pulling handfuls of hair out of the comb; this product has fixed the problem.  I have switched to Shea Moisture products entirely, and they are a good value at local stores.</li>
            <li> smells like chemically altered graham crackers and is so good for your hair :)</li>
            <li> This product is great. I love this. I used it as a deep conditioner and it did wonders for my hair. My hairs was full of moisture which I love and it was so manageable. I had a lot of breakage but this product is reversing that and I love it I had less hair come out while I felt my hair strengthen. This product is a must have.</li>
            <li> I do not care for the smell, but the product itself makes up for it. I have thick red hair and this smoothies it out, makes.it shiny and manageable. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 3 years now and i love it for my facial hair as leave in- conditioner doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, smells like coca butter which is a great plus and it keeps my beard/goatee from getting itchy and irritated. great for men and women!</li>
            <li> maybe i&#x27;m sensitive, but the smell made me nauseous. hair felt &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; when rinsing.</li>
            <li> I love Shea Moisture products and had never tried their hair care line. I love this conditioner and it smells great, my hair is really fine and this does not weigh it down at all.</li>
