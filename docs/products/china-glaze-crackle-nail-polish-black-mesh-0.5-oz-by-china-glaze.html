            <li>definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive it and the price was very affordable.</li>

            <li>This polish is lovely, I&#x27;ve been a fan of crackle since the first time I got to use it back in 1998.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>If you keep applying more, it will end up being just a blob of solid color.</li>
            <li>and I learned real quick only one</li>
            <li>I really did not want right a review like this.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use over a bright pink and yellow!  </li>
            <li>It got to me soo fast and well wrapped, too.</li>

            <li>It is a really.</li>
            <li>but I like my nails to really pop.</li>
            <li>i recommend it, highly!</li>
            <li>Wait for the nail polish to crackle and then make sure to protect with a final coat of clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>10/10 I would recommend this to anyone who wants lovely black crackle.</li>
            <li>I never liked this kind of &#x27;effects&#x27; in a nail polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much fun to play around with it to get different effects and it&#x27;s super fast to use if you&#x27;re in a rush to come up with a look and don&#x27;t want to spent hours coming up with a design.</li>

            <li>Then next day apply another clear coat.</li>
            <li>Also I tried it on bare nail</li>
            <li>For better results wait until the previous layer of nail polish has dried some.  </li>
            <li>So much easier than nail strips or any other stickers.</li>
            <li>that playing with a cat would mean the cat would get a mouth full of it.</li>

            <li> My personal favourite is to put it over dark, blood-red to give a spooky gore effect.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the idea on the picture with several different colored base colors at the same time.</li>
            <li> Just add base color</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work, so you hVe to have a base coat under it in order to work and get that craze look.</li>
            <li> I can use it over any base and it looks fantabulous!</li>

            <li> This polish is great except you must practice to get the correct effect, I love it and I also bought the white polish with same effect</li>
            <li> I tried using this several different times in different ways and it simply won&#x27;t work. Buy it somewhere else. l</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to use this.  I applied over a teal nail polish and it looks like a snake skin.  This is a fun product!  Can&#x27;t wait to use over a bright pink and yellow!  It has now been a week since I put it on my nails and it is holding up great, no chipping or even wear at the tips.  Long lasting!  So much easier than nail strips or any other stickers.</li>
            <li> I luv this  So much I can apply it over any nail polish and I get a super cute design</li>
            <li> It is a really. Nice crackle polish. It dries quickly and it crackles well. Just add base color let it dry then add the crackle and add top coat for a long lasting design.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive it and the price was very affordable. The packaging was use like an envelope and I believe somebody open and then place in the package dry. I couldn&#x27;t send it back because of this. So instead of them send me a better one, they decided to just give me a money back. I really did not want right a review like this. I just wanted them to send me another one in better condition but I guess, its a losing situation for me. I am still in search of a new nail polish.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this looks on my nails. The best part is that because it&#x27;s completely capricious; the crackles on each nail are unique in their own way while all of them are the same pattern. 10/10 I would recommend this to anyone who wants lovely black crackle. My personal favourite is to put it over dark, blood-red to give a spooky gore effect.</li>

            <li> Looks incredible over bright &amp;#34;Jack O&#x27; Lantern Orange&amp;#34; for a killer Halloween effect.  Add a little silver sparkle on top for an even better effect.  Lots of compliments!!!</li>
            <li> Love the Black and the White the best so far. I&#x27;m going to try the idea on the picture with several different colored base colors at the same time. Looks fun. Stick to just one application until you can see the effect. If you keep applying more, it will end up being just a blob of solid color. You need to be patient and let it do its thing for a couple minutes before deciding if you want to repair a spot. Always apply a clear top coat afterwards so it will be smooth. Then next day apply another clear coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase, it works just as described and for a great price! I&#x27;ll get some for my friend soon too.</li>
            <li> I though this wod goofy but it turned out great and looks really cool with a light or neon polish under it.  I do use a topcoat with it as it dries to a matte finish but I like my nails to really pop.</li>
            <li> I love this nail Polish it works more than perfect. I this is my very first time using crackle polish and I learned real quick only one this layer will get u perfection any more than that u will be doing the messed up nails over and over again. It dries in the blink of an eye which is amazing  this polish is a must have ladies.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money. its very cheap, and amazing nailpolish. i recommend it, highly! i was skeptic at first, but it ended up being worth it!</li>
            <li> Love this product very good price and very fast shipping and very good quality ðŸ˜„</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t know didn&#x27;t show up at my address......</li>
            <li> This is the best crackle polish Ive ever used! It is so long lasting and does not chip at all,</li>
