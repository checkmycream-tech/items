            <li>I do my own gel manicures and was looking for a case to store all the paraphernalia that comes with that.</li>
            <li>Kind of wish I would of bought two during the lighting deal.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my things organized and looking nice instead of having my makeup strewn all over my countertops.</li>
            <li>Has a lot of sorting options on the top and a good sized removable storage space on the bottom.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this over any kind of Caboodles case.</li>
            <li>The bottom section is nice and roomy, including room for my 16oz</li>
            <li>And I want to keep it just because it is so nice.  </li>
            <li>It came nicely packed  for shipping.</li>

            <li>This is the perfect case for the person who loves doing their own nails and wants to keep all of their nail accessories handy.</li>
            <li>High quality, and beautiful!</li>
            <li>First off, let me start by saying that the quality and build is very good.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, as described and great for storing bigger makeup items and nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Easy to put away once your done and looks really good.</li>
            <li>The drawer space is nice, bit I would have liked there to be more compartments.</li>
            <li>Easy to take around, and really good material quality.</li>
            <li>thanks, very happy :)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a nice solution for most of your home use nail supplies</li>
            <li>Nice box, would like more nail polish cubes.  </li>
            <li>The case is beautiful and sturdy, exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Polishes stored on the top and everything else for manicuring fits nicely in the bottom.</li>
            <li>four stars because she liked it, but would have preferred it to have more compartments.</li>
            <li>I have this one as full as I can get it!!</li>
            <li>I got all my nail stuff from everywhere lol and put it right in the case.  </li>
            <li>but it does a great job and keeps my nail polish up right</li>
            <li>this makes it so easy to stay organized!</li>
            <li>The elastic loops in the lid (either side of the mirror) are great for holding spare batteries or tips, and the elastic bands in the drawer are great for hold mods and larger bottles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be handy if it came with sectioning walls for the big compartment, but for what it is, it&#x27;s still wonderful.</li>
            <li>I do my own gel nails with an LED lamp and this would just be able to hold the lamp, tools and many polishes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made very well, and all my nail products fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>There is plenty of space for all of the polish up top and a large compartment underneath that stores the light perfectly!</li>
            <li>It is great for travel and the sides expand out so you can see exactly what you have in it.</li>
            <li>I am a proud owner of my first Shany Cosmetics product, The Shany Nail Polish Organizer Makeup Case...</li>
            <li>I ordered this case from Sydney, Australia - it seemed very cheap</li>
            <li>It is strong and sturdy and looks nice too.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to a friend :)</li>
            <li>I just got this today and love it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d lock the top of the box and not the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;The lock keys</li>
            <li>If you leave the dividers out, you can get more in there.  </li>
            <li>It is deeper than the top compartment, which is why I decided the brushes/tools/jewels/other nail accessories were more practical up top.  </li>
            <li>Also--in case anyone is wondering--, the dividers that are designed for the top compartment</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, you need more.</li>
            <li>I love this case.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>The top part holds a lot, though not all styles bottles.</li>
            <li>The plastic dividers don&#x27;t divide anything evenly on top</li>
            <li>I now use it just at home and don&#x27;t put many polishes in it.</li>
            <li>I just wish the company were more accommodating to their customers.</li>
            <li>The top has all the dividers, which holds all of the e-liquid bottles.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that i can keep lots of polish in one compartment.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love the elastic  bands in the bottom drawer for keeping the bottles upright.</li>
            <li>Perfect size to store essential oils!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with my purchase though.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>but I have it sitting on top of my dresser at home</li>
            <li>I took the dividers out because it gives me 40% more room</li>
            <li>he top.</li>
            <li>i have over 20 bottles and about 7-8 pens stored in the top.</li>
            <li>When she received it she tried fitting all her nail polish bottles</li>
            <li>It will hold 30 bottles of oil and the bottom will hold even more.</li>
            <li>I love this case.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s well-made, and it holds lots of polish both in the top lidded area and in the drawer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I bought this</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love the color and how sturdy it is, and finally have something awesome to put my nail polish in!!</li>
            <li>$3.00 Walmart plastic bathroom caddy ended up working better.</li>
            <li>I love this carrying case.</li>
            <li>It holds 24 nail polishes in the top (any sizes) and you can add more polishes or tools, remover, etc.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had more slots since I keep on buying nail polish.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a nail organizer for a while, and I am glad I went with this one.  </li>
            <li>i thought it was awefully cleaver of them to have a 24 slot nail polish slot on top for their nail polish set to go in.</li>
            <li>i put all those on the top in numberical order.</li>
            <li>yes, those fit just nicely too on top</li>
            <li>I love this organizer.</li>
            <li>I dare you to buy this and try to not fall in love...</li>
            <li>really love this.</li>
            <li>This is my third case, and it is perfect to carry my nail polish and accessories.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The top compartment has a lot of spaces for bottles of nail polish to be stored upright.</li>
            <li>with the dividers the top holds 24 bottles of nail polish.</li>
            <li>The clasp on the SHANY is much stronger and the quality is great.</li>
            <li>Glad I did, I love it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s room in the top tray for 24 bottles using the cardboard bottle divider that&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li>This was a fantastic purchase!</li>
            <li>I was able to put in the bottom drawer.</li>
            <li>My sister has so many bottles of nailpolish she needs another.</li>
            <li>Everything fits perfectly with extra room for files, etc.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly with my Red Carpet LED manicure kit.  </li>
            <li>Plenty of room in the top shelf for polish and</li>
            <li>I love this case.</li>
            <li>I love this case.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I love the separator s in the top compartment which organizes and stores my nail polishes.</li>
            <li>My nail polishes fit nicely.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I took the chance of this product.</li>
            <li>my nailpolishs will not be all over the place any more.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>i am glad that i did.</li>
            <li>that work better anyway.</li>
            <li>it allows her to be creative and practice art.  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>It fits all my nail polishes on the top and files and creams on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many bottles she has though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a piece of garbage love love love</li>
            <li>I often wished for a better system as I was always dumping the bag and searching through everything to find what I needed.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, for the use they are intended for, these separators are very sturdy and look great.  </li>
            <li>The Emjoi Micro Pedicure non electric unit and manicure kit will both fit nicely in this drawer.</li>
            <li>but I have since bought a dip and twist jar to soak off polish, it fits better.</li>
            <li>but I have since bought a dip and twist jar to soak off polish, it fits better.</li>
            <li>ADORABLE.</li>
            <li>Love the item that</li>
            <li>safe from sisters who borrow without asking.</li>
            <li>Love the colors and design.</li>
            <li>I may need a bigger one LOL!</li>
            <li>Way better than my purple plastic shower caddy i used to put all my nail stuff in.</li>
            <li>LOVE this makeup and nail polish storage.</li>
            <li>Two of my favorite colors.</li>
            <li>Love this organizer.</li>
            <li>The top holds 24 nail polishes</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even think I had more than 24</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I am a mother of 2 girls 10 and 14 and we all love doing our nails.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Way better than kaboodles and unsightly plastic containers.</li>
            <li>I paid more for the Caboodle and when the snap on it broke after about a year</li>
            <li>In most Caboodle&#x27;s you can&#x27;t do that</li>
            <li>but I can now say with a straight face that this was a great investment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my granddaughter will love this.</li>
            <li>Finally, the perfect case to hold all those bottles of nail polish, files, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is  a great case for  make up, nail polis and all other nice things that we use for beauty maintenance, Very well made as well excellent quality.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!!!!!</li>
            <li>I was able to fit all of my favorite polishes in the top (all sizes and brands) and put all my nail tools and extras in the drawer.</li>
            <li>I love the strong sturdy case.  </li>
            <li>Love it but bottom drawer doesn&#x27;t slide as easily as I would like.</li>
            <li>It is now easy to find our favorite colors and nail art.  </li>
            <li>and I was happy that it was such nice a quality and had lots of room for nail polish and all your nail accessories.</li>
            <li>I was able to fit all of my fill size nail polish bottles (OPI and Orly) in the top section.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t believe i have lived this long with out this adorable organizer !!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice and the best part is that everything I need is exactly where I left it.</li>
            <li>And I do mean they really loved it, the expressions on their faces when they saw what it was, was priceless!</li>
            <li>sound when I turn it.&lt;br /&gt;The box locks at the top.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Middle of the Road:&lt;br /&gt;The bottom doesn&#x27;t fit all my items (nor the top all of my nail polish bottles), but I still like the size of it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to fit 36 bottles (without the dividers)</li>
            <li>fit, it&#x27;s a bit snug, but with the rubber dropper tips on top I consider it just another safety restraint to keep my bottles from jostling or spilling.</li>
            <li>Happy with the professional look and plentiful storage</li>
            <li>It would make a great gift for any young lady.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that they all fit in the case.  </li>
            <li>But still very happy with it as I couldn&#x27;t find anything else even remotely like it.</li>
            <li>Sits proudly on my dressing table with the Shany Studio Quality Natural Cosmetic Brush Set with Leather Pouch.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for home use, but as a student or professional, I would look for something else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the solid construction and good looks of this organizer.</li>
            <li>I love it and can fit all my nail colors.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for all my polish and other things.</li>
            <li>The top is perfect for holding 5ml and 15ml bottles, and I keep blends, rollerballs, my FCO and sprays (angled - they don&#x27;t stand upright,) and my little &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; notebook in the bottom drawer.</li>
            <li>The drawer fits all my nails stuff easily as well.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s got everything in one box now, and can easily take it to another room to &amp;#34;set up shop.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>fits it all and is easy to carry to the couch to use.</li>
            <li>Everything is so well organized that all my nail polishes are easy to get instead of being jumbled up together in a box.</li>
            <li>I was able to fit all my polishes in and the one bottle that didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>Easy to store in my bathroom closet.</li>
            <li>Makes everything easy to find and easy to access.</li>
            <li>this is an easy case for travel to a friends or store in a closet.</li>
            <li>I was able to see her open it and it has some great compartments for organizing nail polish.</li>
            <li>shut easily</li>
            <li>I wish there were more room to put things in the bottom drawer for it to be more useful.  </li>
            <li>The bottom drawer pulls out easily and fits all my manicure tools.</li>
            <li>What do they want a strong box to up hold the atomic bomb.  </li>
            <li>If you remove all the separators these Colossal files would fit, but then you would not have the nice sections to hold polish bottles.  </li>
            <li>If you remove all the separators these Colossal files would fit, but then you would not have the nice sections to hold polish bottles.  </li>
            <li>It fits everything in a space saving, compact, highly functional and good looking case.</li>
            <li>Stylish and Cool.</li>
            <li>I think she&#x27;ll love the gift as much as she&#x27;ll love the gesture of me listening to her friends&#x27; opinions. :)</li>
            <li>Price was perfect for quality since I got it during a Black Friday deal.  </li>
            <li>Product was fine as per description.</li>
            <li>Sturdy organizer and super cute.</li>
            <li>Super adorable, space conserving and styling.</li>
            <li>The elastic in the top is great for my tools, and the drawer even holds my Sephora/OPI UV gel nail light, along with all of my other goodies :-)</li>
            <li>Perfect for storing the little odds and ends for vaping.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has a huge nail polish and accouterments collection.  </li>
            <li>Holds all her polish but taller nail polish bottles dont fit.</li>
            <li>I have filled it up and even bought another case.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find cubes to fit in the bottom as there are no dividers.</li>
            <li>This is just a fabulous case; I put it in my cart and waited for the price to drop</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit everything I have.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the $20, but I would hesitate to spend much more.</li>
            <li>and they all fit albeit varying in shapes and sizes.  </li>
            <li>a guy, the box was sturdy and all the components were securely affixed to the box.  </li>
            <li>Anything taller could easily fit in the bottom drawer.</li>
            <li>but enough about my shopping habits, the point im trying to make is that i knew it would come to no shock that this would be great to organize all the stuff ive bought for my nails and</li>
            <li>All of my polish and accessories fit in it</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic nail polish organizer,  and the construction is unparalleled.</li>
            <li>The bottom section is great for all the extras such as Emery boards, cuticle clippers, creams or whatever you need.</li>
            <li>I have since filled it to the brim with designer nail polish and remover.  </li>
            <li>and it probably weighs 2 tons now that I filled it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have all of my things in a very well compartmentally designed case.</li>
            <li>it will fit (see photo).  </li>
            <li>I bought this to store all my gel polish, led light, files etc.  </li>
            <li>The case doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li>Great for my starting nail art adventure.</li>
            <li>The bottom part of the case comes out like a drawer and can hold a variety of items comfortably.</li>
            <li>You could tell it was cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>I recently started buying my own Harmony Gelish no chip polishes to do my own no chip manicures.</li>
            <li>Besides it looking great (looks like real leather), its very functional.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t cheap, but I feel like I will get my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>I only wish there were more compartments to fit more polish but other than that it is great!</li>
            <li>also love the interior color of my new case :).</li>
            <li>Okay, so first of all I want to say that we don&#x27;t use this box for cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>When I first purchased this case I wasn&#x27;t really sure about it because what I wanted it for I had not seen any reviews on</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but so worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Be aware putting implements in the elastic holders in the lid top may keep the lid from closing if the nail polish bottles are too high.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this case, first off you can tell</li>
            <li>hold a all my makeup to bottom and nail polishes to top no need to search far anymore :)</li>
            <li>Love it so far :)</li>
            <li>The case stores a pretty good amount of nail polish and you are able to make the squares larger my removing the dividers.  </li>
            <li>Combine that with the amazing construction and beautiful design,  this is totally a winner,  hands down. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I think it was worth it because it will be super durable!</li>
            <li>Just the right size!</li>
            <li>I was super excited.</li>
            <li>I was well aware of the dimensions before I purchased it, but it was such a great price</li>
            <li>I LOVE this so much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well-made the dividers in the top help out so much.</li>
            <li>The Shany Cosmetic case has really helped me stay organized with my gel nail polish, uv light and all of the extras!</li>
            <li>go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End and all, we returned for a full refund.</li>
            <li>bought for my nail polish which fits very well into the top compartments.</li>
            <li>It shuts securely and feels like it will last for many, many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good case (not Lucite) for several years.  </li>
            <li>But it is not bad.</li>
            <li>Bonus: The outside is smooth enough to apply your favorite brands&#x27; stickers!!!</li>
            <li>but this is what I was needing for all my nail polish other than the handle breaking and price great item</li>
            <li>but I have discovered how great this case is for containing other stuff and because it is so sturdy and will NEVER need replacing I am buying another here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>However, the case in general is pretty awesome, and having the bulk of your nail stuff in a single, easily transferrable location is really cool.</li>
            <li>I just wish it was bigger and would hold more bottles and the drawer was had more room.</li>
            <li>Fairly decent, I would like more storage for nail polishes.</li>
            <li>All of my current polishes fit nicely (OPI, Sephora, Nails Inc, China Glaze, Finger Paints)</li>
            <li>but I do have more polish than fits in the top, I am tempted to buy a second one.</li>
            <li>The bottom box is remove able and room enough for more nail essentials or whatever you need.  </li>
            <li>Acetone bottles will fit if they are the smaller size kind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d actually be better if the case was designed to have a smaller drawer and more slots to hold nail polish.</li>
            <li>make up holder/box because the nail box is super well made</li>
            <li>All but my Butter polishes fit nicely into the slots, but the slots can be adjusted to accommodate larger bottles if you want.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you tend to leave your nail polish bottles everywhere in the house and your boyfriend uses the bottle as a cat toy time to time. :)</li>
            <li>It can hold more then enough polishes and accessories to keep me happy, but not enough that my collection becomes unwieldy.  </li>
            <li>so I feel that they are pretty secure in the case.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy but the detail of the case and pink color of the interior are really what makes it the perfect solution to my dilemma.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried a new brand even though I had been using Caboodle&#x27;s for years.</li>
            <li>This thing is very well built, I looked at several for my girlfriend before ordering this and there was none that were this nice!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery with Amazon Prime!!</li>
            <li>I know the typical person doesn&#x27;t own more than 24</li>
            <li>I use the large drawer for the LED light that dries the gel polishes.</li>
            <li>The top of the box also has latches that lock, which is nice to keep little ones away from the e-liquid if they happen to get a hold of the box.  </li>
            <li>The bottom drawer closure looks more stylish as it is, but I do think Shany should put the same snap locks on this drawer so it lessens the possibility the drawer will certainly fall out and get ruined.</li>
            <li>High quality and exactly what I wanted:)  </li>
            <li>and although she is NOT a girly girl, the bright pink didn&#x27;t bother her because she was so enamored with the case.</li>
            <li>I have some very tall bottles of ManiPure vegan polish and didn&#x27;t think they would fit</li>
            <li>Fits my polish and is worth the price.</li>
            <li>The case is solid and looks nice.</li>
            <li>The needle tipped bottles will also fit in the top as there is enough height for the lid to close with them in there.  </li>
            <li>The drawer itself is a nice size and works well for storing extra tanks ect.  </li>
            <li>The outside of this looks like leather and the inside lining is nice.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li>the entire kit fits nicely in the pull out drawer.</li>
            <li>If you get annoyed with nail polishes everywhere this is perfect to keep them in one place and out of the way.</li>
            <li>In doing my own nails for years and my mother&#x27;s nails, I had been keeping all of my polishes, and implements in a big plastic bag.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not huge, but its a great size for a college dorm.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described,  quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The bottom is good for decals or other nail tools.</li>
            <li>then this is the right case for you.</li>
            <li>I think this case is just right.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be made of wood and covered inside with a strong vinyl/satin like fabric that appears to have been stitched around the edges and is  tightly attached by being nicely glued in place.</li>
            <li>I really liked the setup of the case and that it locked on top to keep out small prying hands.</li>
            <li>it is very sturdy, seems like it will last, I love it!</li>
            <li>Right away I can tell it is higher quality.  </li>
            <li>As far as getting me organized this has made it easy.  </li>
            <li>now I have an extremely full top compartment, and a bunch of loose, glass bottles rolling around in the bottom.</li>
            <li>so I was a little skittish</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;There is a variety of storage options (elastics in the lid, a pocket in the back, etc) without having so many that items could get lost or disorganized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I wish I spend $20 more for bigger case!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li>Fits her favorite nail polishes and essential nail accessories she uses when doing her nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pretty sturdy and compact to store all our polishes.</li>
            <li>Only had this product for a week and my girlfriend love it.  </li>
            <li>(*shoulder shrug*)</li>
            <li>so much !1</li>
            <li>The top is tall enough to accommodate Julep, China Glaze, and OPI for Sephora polishes.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s pretty pricey for what it is.</li>
            <li>I love this, you get to put everything for your nails all in one and it fits all different bottles of nail</li>
            <li>If you have a lot of make up you might want something bigger. :)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for to hold my gel nail polish kit.</li>
            <li>The top compartment is adjustable, so larger bottles of polish can be accommodated.</li>
            <li>Making some larger spaces also meant I could put nail sponges and wipes in the top.</li>
            <li>Feels very well made and sturdy!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The two locks for the top section are shiny, sturdy and snap open</li>
            <li>top drawer has 24 sections for nail polish and it definitely LOCKS, some reviews said it does not lock, but it does, however the bottom drawer does not lock.  </li>
            <li>everything is organized n ready to go !</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I like the individual compartments for nail polishes on the top compartment.</li>
            <li>I wish it were a bit bigger, but I still love it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured, well crafted and put together.</li>
            <li>Then the bottom section had more than enough room for all my tools.</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t have the problems of it not closing correctly because the hinges and buckles are all higher quality.</li>
            <li>I needed something bigger because I have a LOT of nail polishes, i had to save the most part in the lower compartment wich</li>
            <li>is not what I wanted it for in the first place.</li>
            <li>Was great to start but very small for someone with a lot of nail art decorative products</li>
            <li>It is a very well made case and will do exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very well made, the latches are very sturdy!</li>
            <li>I really loved the look but had to return it because it was too small for all that I have.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, sturdy, rather small though for the price.</li>
            <li>I can easily find the polish that I&#x27;m looking for, not only that the bottom drawer holds the nail extras needed.  </li>
            <li>The dividers are customizable - you have to assemble them yourself, so you could easily leave one of the veritcal pieces off, thereby creating larger rectangles, rather than squares.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It also have a kaboodle for my regular non-gel manicure supplies and clasp on that broke very quickly.</li>
            <li>so you wind up with this section that is just kind of a black hole</li>
            <li>Not sure if I will keep it yet, will see if I can get most of my polish&#x27;s and accessories to fit in it?</li>
            <li>However, if you have a large collection of polish and tools, this case will not do.  </li>
            <li>The bottom has a large drawer that can hold almost anything.  </li>
            <li>The specifications state that the case is 12x10x10, but the shipping box is not even that large.  </li>
            <li>She keeps certain things in there</li>
            <li>so with that being said, i kept going to buy more and more stuff from this cosmetics line such as their nail polish, other brush sets (nail brushes), and i could continue to go on!</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>You also get little keys which are nice</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is really great for travel as it is a little big</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cute with the pink interior and it is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>built.&lt;br /&gt;The front/top clasps feel very sturdy</li>
            <li>Is very well made and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made</li>
            <li>Arrived fast, quality case.</li>
            <li>You are very organized with this</li>
            <li>And that extra inch or two in height and depth means that I can comfortably fit everything in this case.</li>
            <li>Very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li>She ended up just tossing the key in one of the bottle dividers since she didn&#x27;t need to secure it</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t cost so much I would give it a 5.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;would reccommend to anyone who wants to keep their stuff all together in a nice/stylish way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The case is very well done.  </li>
            <li>but I do love it and it is what I expected</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and will hold up to a lot of use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li>really, that&#x27;s nit picking.</li>
            <li>And it is really beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She LOVES this case, she can get so much into it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really well made</li>
            <li>She feels like a real cosmetologist with her kit.  </li>
            <li>The locks are also very well build</li>
            <li>The only thing is in the description it says it fit any and all size nail polish.</li>
            <li>that nail polish remover and toe separators don&#x27;t take up that much room in it.</li>
            <li>Keeps me very organized.</li>
            <li>We really help keeping our nail accessories organized.  </li>
            <li>High quality!Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I am really trying to organize myself this year..</li>
            <li>I like mine so much</li>
            <li>Very well-made.</li>
            <li>On the contrary, this is a well-made and seemingly durable case that holds way more nail polish than I expected.  </li>
            <li>The case is kind of heavy</li>
            <li>The quality is nice, but it&#x27;s MUCH smaller than it appears and smaller than measurements</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold all of my polish and tools, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much because I decided to use it for the items I use the most, and will continue to store other items as they were before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The latches are deterrent enough to keep my kids out, but super easy for me to open.</li>
            <li>Plus, you can fit two Julep polishes or two Super Black Laquers (or other polish in a tall rectangular bottle) in each of the top divider compartments.</li>
            <li>I love that it has dividers for all my nail polishes and storage for all my other miscellaneous nail tools and supplies.</li>
            <li>I love the pink inside of it too!</li>
            <li>I wish it held more bottles of polish and other nail products</li>
            <li>Feels nice and feels like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I just wish the box was a little bit bigger, because not all my nail polishes fit in the top compartment.  </li>
            <li>The elastics in the cover are nice to hold small containers like glitter.  </li>
            <li>It has really cool clips to open and close.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas, because her friends commented about her bag full of unorganized nail polish tubes.</li>
            <li>My first thought when I was opening the box for this was \\&quot;wow, it&#x27;s quite a bit heavier than I expected\\&quot;</li>
            <li>You can lock the top half, but not the bottom drawer.  </li>
            <li>The only way it could be better would be to include another drawer that is not so deep for tools like files and buffers.  </li>
            <li>Decent quality.</li>
            <li>I also inserted smaller nail files and nail clippers in the top holders, next to the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(The main reason I purchased this item)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t talk about everyday use but can say that this item arrived on time and looks like a good solid case upon inspection.</li>
            <li>A lot smaller than expected,  but holds a nice amount of items.</li>
            <li>I would suggest carrying something a little smaller to travel with but overall this case is beautiful</li>
            <li>It holds at least 20 plus bottles of nail polish between the top and bottom compartments as well as all manicure and pedicure at home tools!</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>Quality is extremely high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>But I still highly recommend this organizer, it surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li>It is made of high quality material and has ample space.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble fitting any of my other bottles of nail polish.</li>
            <li>I bought an LED kit to do my own gel nail polish and the LED lamp fits in the bottom &amp;#34;drawer&amp;#34; along with the power cord and plenty of space for other stuff left over.</li>
            <li>I accidentally got a little acetone on this fabric and was pleased that it did not leave a mark.</li>
            <li>The little compartments are great for my cosmetics, and the big drawer holds bigger things!  </li>
            <li>This case is very well made and classy.</li>
            <li>The case itself is very sturdy and professional looking.</li>
            <li>will not fit into the bottom because the top has a lid that flips up, and the bottom slides out, therefore</li>
            <li>I tried the SHANY case with the clear top first, but it was undersized for my small LED lamp and 4oz bottles of cleaner and remover.</li>
            <li>She intended to use the top part for hair clips, ties, cloth headbands and a few bows, hence the compartments.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom drawer was to keep  spray bottle, hairspray, mousse, brushes.</li>
            <li>If you have any separators in the top section, nail files or implements will not fit UNLESS YOU CUT the separators.</li>
            <li>If you have any separators in the top section, nail files or implements will not fit UNLESS YOU CUT the separators.</li>
            <li>Very nice, expensive looking nail accessory/makeup case.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently discovered a little obsession with gel nail polish and have purchased a kit to do my own.</li>
            <li>Maybe they will make a new one, that has turquoise, and I can get that just in time to start getting in to nail stamping ...</li>
            <li>to accompany her new gel manicure set.</li>
            <li>Colors are great as I&#x27;m a big pink and black lover.</li>
            <li>and while I am in no hurry to use up all the available space, if I ever do, I will definitely be buying a second case just like this.</li>
            <li>It is big enough to fit all kinds of nail polishes (some bottles are taller than others) and the drawer fits my 2 polish removers cotton balls</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough to fit the fat bottles of polish as others I found did not.</li>
            <li>unfortunately, the very popular Colossal Collection of Tropical nail files will not fit flat to one side in the bottom drawer (I have to put them in on the diagonal which wastes space), they would fit on the top section where polish iskept if you want to sacrifice AND ALTER some of the separators.  </li>
            <li>Loved the color pink and the black background!</li>
            <li>Nice moderate size, not too big or to small, just right</li>
            <li>There is more than enough room for my nail flies, clippers, and other supplies underneath.</li>
            <li>I waited a long time for this case, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old daughter loves it!  </li>
            <li>but I feel that the quality is somewhat cheap and therefore, the price is not worth it.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s expected with a full box of nail polishes.</li>
            <li>but it looks like it is, the top handle is very tough and fine unless you have a very large hand; it has two shiny bolts holding it on both sides, the case is small and not al all at as light as it looks, this must be because it is made of solid stuff.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is the bottom box is kind of small</li>
            <li>The black plastic squares in the top are removable, so you can make it into different configurations if you wanted to.  </li>
            <li>I really love this case, I use it for my Gel Polish kit, I do wish it was a little bigger</li>
            <li>Its sharp and glossy, and the clasps are shiny and easy to open.</li>
            <li>But so far everything is holding up</li>
            <li>There is a lot of room and potential but it is not used very well.</li>
            <li>It seems durable so far.</li>
            <li>i have never had organized nial polish , i am 32 years old and i am telling my husban</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this organizer.</li>
            <li>Well made and professional looking.</li>
            <li>I use this bag daily because its very easy&lt;br /&gt;I hold it to any place in the home to put the manicure</li>
            <li>, it looks so professional</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my 13 year old granddaughter&#x27;s birthday.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived, I was incredibly surprised by the quality of the synthetic leather.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really really like this case.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I found this one.  </li>
            <li>and I completely agree.  </li>
            <li>it just made me throw out my old polishes.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t that surprised.</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t really see what is back</li>
            <li>The top has individual compartments to hold compartments round polish bottles.</li>
            <li>worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>2 not crazy on pink</li>
            <li>which was a good thing in my mind as it meant this wasn&#x27;t simply an expensive plastic Caboodle-style case.  </li>
            <li>It holds 24 polishes in large squares (which so far has fit all the different polishes I have), but the drawer is quite small.</li>
            <li>Very pretty but not worth the price.</li>
            <li>ONLY complaint is that it could be a little bit bigger and hold more polishes in the top compartment, but I have alot of polishes.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a case that would work to hold all of our nail necessities.  </li>
            <li>it measures 9 inches across, 6 inches deep, 9 inches high.  </li>
            <li>Now that I know this case is of such high quality</li>
            <li>and I have even purchased a second one for my 14 year old daughter!!</li>
            <li>I got the pink on black love the colors together.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for something to organize all of my nail products for quite a long time and this one really does the job.  </li>
            <li>The inside is lined in hot pink fabric.  </li>
            <li>I like the product, the only problem was that I bought it for my wife and on the picture it looks like a normal size, but when it arrived it was 60% smaller than normal....</li>
            <li>the hot pink lining</li>
            <li>/&gt;I ended up buying the Shany Cosmetic Matters Nail Organizer in black with a deep pink interior and would have returned it (with Amazon&#x27;s great return policy) had I not liked it so much.</li>
            <li>It fits most of my nail polishes except for the OPI brand ones are a little too wide for the slots.</li>
            <li>Unable to fit acetone bottle for example!!</li>
            <li>The clips don&#x27;t hurt my hands and are not sharp like others are.</li>
            <li>The edges where the fabric was glued were pretty sharp.</li>
            <li>Taking out a shoe box every time I did my nails (weekly) is not fun, pretty or practical.</li>
            <li>so far it seems well thought out but not entirely durable.</li>
            <li>No regrets on this one stop for all my tools and polish.</li>
            <li>I am currently using it for my Young Living oils....</li>
            <li>Very sturdy for when I need to cart them around, and stays closed when latched.</li>
            <li>I love the case, but am annoyed with the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad but too small</li>
            <li>Instead of 2 actions, they only require a quick and effortless flip up or down to open.</li>
            <li>I saw it fluctuate by as much as $20 higher over the black friday hoopla</li>
            <li>, the issue my wife had with it was that its super small.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too small to hold anything larger like a UV light, but it&#x27;s so big</li>
            <li>I was putting together a gift of several nail polish collections and looked high and low for a proper case to present them in.  </li>
            <li>Sections for nail polish are 3.25\\&quot; high (with lid closed).</li>
            <li>Honestly I felt a little ridiculous spending $40 on something just to hold my nail polish</li>
            <li>It looks bigger in the picture, and I did manage to get all of my fingernail polishes and tools in it, but just barely.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that my polishes can stand up now and aren&#x27;t so hard to open from laying down.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but when we got it, I got right back online and ordered myself one.</li>
            <li>Her brushes fit the brush holder next to the mirror and didn&#x27;t seem weak as the brushes didn&#x27;t dangle.  </li>
            <li>, the area inside the bottom is a little smaller (not by much though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nicole by OPI nail polish fit a little awkwardly in the slots, but they do fit.</li>
            <li>only  complaint is THE CASE SHOULD BE AT LEAST ONE INCH BIGGER IN EVERY DIRECTION, so it can hold a little more and hold the longer Colossal nail files in the bottom drawer(see</li>

            <li> 15ml bottles fit perfectly in the top tray.</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>

            <li> so it is nice that it all fits in this handy case.</li>
            <li> I do my own gel manicures and was looking for a case to store all the paraphernalia that comes with that.</li>
            <li> Kind of wish I would of bought two during the lighting deal.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my things organized and looking nice instead of having my makeup strewn all over my countertops.</li>
            <li> Has a lot of sorting options on the top and a good sized removable storage space on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this over any kind of Caboodles case.</li>
            <li> The bottom section is nice and roomy, including room for my 16oz</li>
            <li> And I want to keep it just because it is so nice.  </li>
            <li> It came nicely packed  for shipping.</li>
            <li> It looks nice on my dresser, handy to grab and go and have all my manicure products together.</li>
            <li> It is really cute, and the quality on it is good.</li>
            <li> My daughter keeps all of her nail care items in here nice and organized.  </li>
            <li> Really nice sturdy case.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely nice.</li>
            <li> This is a nice organizer</li>
            <li> This is the perfect case for the person who loves doing their own nails and wants to keep all of their nail accessories handy.</li>
            <li> High quality, and beautiful!</li>
            <li> First off, let me start by saying that the quality and build is very good.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, as described and great for storing bigger makeup items and nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Easy to put away once your done and looks really good.</li>
            <li> The drawer space is nice, bit I would have liked there to be more compartments.</li>
            <li> Easy to take around, and really good material quality.</li>
            <li> thanks, very happy :)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a nice solution for most of your home use nail supplies</li>
            <li> Nice box, would like more nail polish cubes.  </li>
            <li> The case is beautiful and sturdy, exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Polishes stored on the top and everything else for manicuring fits nicely in the bottom.</li>
            <li> four stars because she liked it, but would have preferred it to have more compartments.</li>
            <li> I have this one as full as I can get it!!</li>
            <li> I got all my nail stuff from everywhere lol and put it right in the case.  </li>
            <li> but it does a great job and keeps my nail polish up right</li>
            <li> this makes it so easy to stay organized!</li>
            <li> The elastic loops in the lid (either side of the mirror) are great for holding spare batteries or tips, and the elastic bands in the drawer are great for hold mods and larger bottles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be handy if it came with sectioning walls for the big compartment, but for what it is, it&#x27;s still wonderful.</li>
            <li> I do my own gel nails with an LED lamp and this would just be able to hold the lamp, tools and many polishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made very well, and all my nail products fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> There is plenty of space for all of the polish up top and a large compartment underneath that stores the light perfectly!</li>
            <li> It is great for travel and the sides expand out so you can see exactly what you have in it.</li>
            <li> I am a proud owner of my first Shany Cosmetics product, The Shany Nail Polish Organizer Makeup Case...</li>
            <li> I ordered this case from Sydney, Australia - it seemed very cheap</li>
            <li> It is strong and sturdy and looks nice too.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to a friend :)</li>
            <li> I just got this today and love it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d lock the top of the box and not the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;The lock keys</li>
            <li> If you leave the dividers out, you can get more in there.  </li>
            <li> It is deeper than the top compartment, which is why I decided the brushes/tools/jewels/other nail accessories were more practical up top.  </li>
            <li> Also--in case anyone is wondering--, the dividers that are designed for the top compartment</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you need more.</li>
            <li> I love this case.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> The top part holds a lot, though not all styles bottles.</li>
            <li> The plastic dividers don&#x27;t divide anything evenly on top</li>
            <li> I now use it just at home and don&#x27;t put many polishes in it.</li>
            <li> I just wish the company were more accommodating to their customers.</li>
            <li> The top has all the dividers, which holds all of the e-liquid bottles.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that i can keep lots of polish in one compartment.</li>
            <li> Plus, I love the elastic  bands in the bottom drawer for keeping the bottles upright.</li>
            <li> Perfect size to store essential oils!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with my purchase though.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> but I have it sitting on top of my dresser at home</li>
            <li> I took the dividers out because it gives me 40% more room</li>
            <li> he top.</li>
            <li> i have over 20 bottles and about 7-8 pens stored in the top.</li>
            <li> When she received it she tried fitting all her nail polish bottles</li>
            <li> It will hold 30 bottles of oil and the bottom will hold even more.</li>
            <li> I love this case.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s well-made, and it holds lots of polish both in the top lidded area and in the drawer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought this</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I love the color and how sturdy it is, and finally have something awesome to put my nail polish in!!</li>
            <li> $3.00 Walmart plastic bathroom caddy ended up working better.</li>
            <li> I love this carrying case.</li>
            <li> It holds 24 nail polishes in the top (any sizes) and you can add more polishes or tools, remover, etc.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had more slots since I keep on buying nail polish.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a nail organizer for a while, and I am glad I went with this one.  </li>
            <li> i thought it was awefully cleaver of them to have a 24 slot nail polish slot on top for their nail polish set to go in.</li>
            <li> i put all those on the top in numberical order.</li>
            <li> yes, those fit just nicely too on top</li>
            <li> I love this organizer.</li>
            <li> I dare you to buy this and try to not fall in love...</li>
            <li> really love this.</li>
            <li> This is my third case, and it is perfect to carry my nail polish and accessories.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The top compartment has a lot of spaces for bottles of nail polish to be stored upright.</li>
            <li> with the dividers the top holds 24 bottles of nail polish.</li>
            <li> The clasp on the SHANY is much stronger and the quality is great.</li>
            <li> Glad I did, I love it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s room in the top tray for 24 bottles using the cardboard bottle divider that&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li> This was a fantastic purchase!</li>
            <li> I was able to put in the bottom drawer.</li>
            <li> My sister has so many bottles of nailpolish she needs another.</li>
            <li> Everything fits perfectly with extra room for files, etc.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my Red Carpet LED manicure kit.  </li>
            <li> Plenty of room in the top shelf for polish and</li>
            <li> I love this case.</li>
            <li> I love this case.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I love the separator s in the top compartment which organizes and stores my nail polishes.</li>
            <li> My nail polishes fit nicely.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took the chance of this product.</li>
            <li> my nailpolishs will not be all over the place any more.</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> i am glad that i did.</li>
            <li> that work better anyway.</li>
            <li> it allows her to be creative and practice art.  </li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> It fits all my nail polishes on the top and files and creams on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many bottles she has though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a piece of garbage love love love</li>
            <li> I often wished for a better system as I was always dumping the bag and searching through everything to find what I needed.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, for the use they are intended for, these separators are very sturdy and look great.  </li>
            <li> The Emjoi Micro Pedicure non electric unit and manicure kit will both fit nicely in this drawer.</li>
            <li> but I have since bought a dip and twist jar to soak off polish, it fits better.</li>
            <li> but I have since bought a dip and twist jar to soak off polish, it fits better.</li>
            <li> ADORABLE.</li>
            <li> Love the item that</li>
            <li> safe from sisters who borrow without asking.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and design.</li>
            <li> I may need a bigger one LOL!</li>
            <li> Way better than my purple plastic shower caddy i used to put all my nail stuff in.</li>
            <li> LOVE this makeup and nail polish storage.</li>
            <li> Two of my favorite colors.</li>
            <li> Love this organizer.</li>
            <li> The top holds 24 nail polishes</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even think I had more than 24</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I am a mother of 2 girls 10 and 14 and we all love doing our nails.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Way better than kaboodles and unsightly plastic containers.</li>
            <li> I paid more for the Caboodle and when the snap on it broke after about a year</li>
            <li> In most Caboodle&#x27;s you can&#x27;t do that</li>
            <li> but I can now say with a straight face that this was a great investment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my granddaughter will love this.</li>
            <li> Finally, the perfect case to hold all those bottles of nail polish, files, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is  a great case for  make up, nail polis and all other nice things that we use for beauty maintenance, Very well made as well excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was able to fit all of my favorite polishes in the top (all sizes and brands) and put all my nail tools and extras in the drawer.</li>
            <li> I love the strong sturdy case.  </li>
            <li> Love it but bottom drawer doesn&#x27;t slide as easily as I would like.</li>
            <li> It is now easy to find our favorite colors and nail art.  </li>
            <li> and I was happy that it was such nice a quality and had lots of room for nail polish and all your nail accessories.</li>
            <li> I was able to fit all of my fill size nail polish bottles (OPI and Orly) in the top section.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t believe i have lived this long with out this adorable organizer !!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice and the best part is that everything I need is exactly where I left it.</li>
            <li> And I do mean they really loved it, the expressions on their faces when they saw what it was, was priceless!</li>
            <li> sound when I turn it.&lt;br /&gt;The box locks at the top.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Middle of the Road:&lt;br /&gt;The bottom doesn&#x27;t fit all my items (nor the top all of my nail polish bottles), but I still like the size of it.  </li>
            <li> I was able to fit 36 bottles (without the dividers)</li>
            <li> fit, it&#x27;s a bit snug, but with the rubber dropper tips on top I consider it just another safety restraint to keep my bottles from jostling or spilling.</li>
            <li> Happy with the professional look and plentiful storage</li>
            <li> It would make a great gift for any young lady.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that they all fit in the case.  </li>
            <li> But still very happy with it as I couldn&#x27;t find anything else even remotely like it.</li>
            <li> Sits proudly on my dressing table with the Shany Studio Quality Natural Cosmetic Brush Set with Leather Pouch.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for home use, but as a student or professional, I would look for something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the solid construction and good looks of this organizer.</li>
            <li> I love it and can fit all my nail colors.</li>
            <li> I love it so much!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for all my polish and other things.</li>
            <li> The top is perfect for holding 5ml and 15ml bottles, and I keep blends, rollerballs, my FCO and sprays (angled - they don&#x27;t stand upright,) and my little &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; notebook in the bottom drawer.</li>
            <li> The drawer fits all my nails stuff easily as well.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s got everything in one box now, and can easily take it to another room to &amp;#34;set up shop.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> fits it all and is easy to carry to the couch to use.</li>
            <li> Everything is so well organized that all my nail polishes are easy to get instead of being jumbled up together in a box.</li>
            <li> I was able to fit all my polishes in and the one bottle that didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> Easy to store in my bathroom closet.</li>
            <li> Makes everything easy to find and easy to access.</li>
            <li> this is an easy case for travel to a friends or store in a closet.</li>
            <li> I was able to see her open it and it has some great compartments for organizing nail polish.</li>
            <li> shut easily</li>
            <li> I wish there were more room to put things in the bottom drawer for it to be more useful.  </li>
            <li> The bottom drawer pulls out easily and fits all my manicure tools.</li>
            <li> What do they want a strong box to up hold the atomic bomb.  </li>
            <li> If you remove all the separators these Colossal files would fit, but then you would not have the nice sections to hold polish bottles.  </li>
            <li> If you remove all the separators these Colossal files would fit, but then you would not have the nice sections to hold polish bottles.  </li>
            <li> It fits everything in a space saving, compact, highly functional and good looking case.</li>
            <li> Stylish and Cool.</li>
            <li> I think she&#x27;ll love the gift as much as she&#x27;ll love the gesture of me listening to her friends&#x27; opinions. :)</li>
            <li> Price was perfect for quality since I got it during a Black Friday deal.  </li>
            <li> Product was fine as per description.</li>
            <li> Sturdy organizer and super cute.</li>
            <li> Super adorable, space conserving and styling.</li>
            <li> The elastic in the top is great for my tools, and the drawer even holds my Sephora/OPI UV gel nail light, along with all of my other goodies :-)</li>
            <li> Perfect for storing the little odds and ends for vaping.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has a huge nail polish and accouterments collection.  </li>
            <li> Holds all her polish but taller nail polish bottles dont fit.</li>
            <li> I have filled it up and even bought another case.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find cubes to fit in the bottom as there are no dividers.</li>
            <li> This is just a fabulous case; I put it in my cart and waited for the price to drop</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit everything I have.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the $20, but I would hesitate to spend much more.</li>
            <li> and they all fit albeit varying in shapes and sizes.  </li>
            <li> a guy, the box was sturdy and all the components were securely affixed to the box.  </li>
            <li> Anything taller could easily fit in the bottom drawer.</li>
            <li> but enough about my shopping habits, the point im trying to make is that i knew it would come to no shock that this would be great to organize all the stuff ive bought for my nails and</li>
            <li> All of my polish and accessories fit in it</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic nail polish organizer,  and the construction is unparalleled.</li>
            <li> The bottom section is great for all the extras such as Emery boards, cuticle clippers, creams or whatever you need.</li>
            <li> I have since filled it to the brim with designer nail polish and remover.  </li>
            <li> and it probably weighs 2 tons now that I filled it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have all of my things in a very well compartmentally designed case.</li>
            <li> it will fit (see photo).  </li>
            <li> I bought this to store all my gel polish, led light, files etc.  </li>
            <li> The case doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li> Great for my starting nail art adventure.</li>
            <li> The bottom part of the case comes out like a drawer and can hold a variety of items comfortably.</li>
            <li> You could tell it was cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> I recently started buying my own Harmony Gelish no chip polishes to do my own no chip manicures.</li>
            <li> Besides it looking great (looks like real leather), its very functional.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t cheap, but I feel like I will get my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> I only wish there were more compartments to fit more polish but other than that it is great!</li>
            <li> also love the interior color of my new case :).</li>
            <li> Okay, so first of all I want to say that we don&#x27;t use this box for cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> When I first purchased this case I wasn&#x27;t really sure about it because what I wanted it for I had not seen any reviews on</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but so worth it!</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> Be aware putting implements in the elastic holders in the lid top may keep the lid from closing if the nail polish bottles are too high.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this case, first off you can tell</li>
            <li> hold a all my makeup to bottom and nail polishes to top no need to search far anymore :)</li>
            <li> Love it so far :)</li>
            <li> The case stores a pretty good amount of nail polish and you are able to make the squares larger my removing the dividers.  </li>
            <li> Combine that with the amazing construction and beautiful design,  this is totally a winner,  hands down. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I think it was worth it because it will be super durable!</li>
            <li> Just the right size!</li>
            <li> I was super excited.</li>
            <li> I was well aware of the dimensions before I purchased it, but it was such a great price</li>
            <li> I LOVE this so much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well-made the dividers in the top help out so much.</li>
            <li> The Shany Cosmetic case has really helped me stay organized with my gel nail polish, uv light and all of the extras!</li>
            <li> go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End and all, we returned for a full refund.</li>
            <li> bought for my nail polish which fits very well into the top compartments.</li>
            <li> It shuts securely and feels like it will last for many, many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good case (not Lucite) for several years.  </li>
            <li> But it is not bad.</li>
            <li> Bonus: The outside is smooth enough to apply your favorite brands&#x27; stickers!!!</li>
            <li> but this is what I was needing for all my nail polish other than the handle breaking and price great item</li>
            <li> but I have discovered how great this case is for containing other stuff and because it is so sturdy and will NEVER need replacing I am buying another here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> However, the case in general is pretty awesome, and having the bulk of your nail stuff in a single, easily transferrable location is really cool.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was bigger and would hold more bottles and the drawer was had more room.</li>
            <li> Fairly decent, I would like more storage for nail polishes.</li>
            <li> All of my current polishes fit nicely (OPI, Sephora, Nails Inc, China Glaze, Finger Paints)</li>
            <li> but I do have more polish than fits in the top, I am tempted to buy a second one.</li>
            <li> The bottom box is remove able and room enough for more nail essentials or whatever you need.  </li>
            <li> Acetone bottles will fit if they are the smaller size kind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d actually be better if the case was designed to have a smaller drawer and more slots to hold nail polish.</li>
            <li> make up holder/box because the nail box is super well made</li>
            <li> All but my Butter polishes fit nicely into the slots, but the slots can be adjusted to accommodate larger bottles if you want.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you tend to leave your nail polish bottles everywhere in the house and your boyfriend uses the bottle as a cat toy time to time. :)</li>
            <li> It can hold more then enough polishes and accessories to keep me happy, but not enough that my collection becomes unwieldy.  </li>
            <li> so I feel that they are pretty secure in the case.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy but the detail of the case and pink color of the interior are really what makes it the perfect solution to my dilemma.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried a new brand even though I had been using Caboodle&#x27;s for years.</li>
            <li> This thing is very well built, I looked at several for my girlfriend before ordering this and there was none that were this nice!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery with Amazon Prime!!</li>
            <li> I know the typical person doesn&#x27;t own more than 24</li>
            <li> I use the large drawer for the LED light that dries the gel polishes.</li>
            <li> The top of the box also has latches that lock, which is nice to keep little ones away from the e-liquid if they happen to get a hold of the box.  </li>
            <li> The bottom drawer closure looks more stylish as it is, but I do think Shany should put the same snap locks on this drawer so it lessens the possibility the drawer will certainly fall out and get ruined.</li>
            <li> High quality and exactly what I wanted:)  </li>
            <li> and although she is NOT a girly girl, the bright pink didn&#x27;t bother her because she was so enamored with the case.</li>
            <li> I have some very tall bottles of ManiPure vegan polish and didn&#x27;t think they would fit</li>
            <li> Fits my polish and is worth the price.</li>
            <li> The case is solid and looks nice.</li>
            <li> The needle tipped bottles will also fit in the top as there is enough height for the lid to close with them in there.  </li>
            <li> The drawer itself is a nice size and works well for storing extra tanks ect.  </li>
            <li> The outside of this looks like leather and the inside lining is nice.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> the entire kit fits nicely in the pull out drawer.</li>
            <li> If you get annoyed with nail polishes everywhere this is perfect to keep them in one place and out of the way.</li>
            <li> In doing my own nails for years and my mother&#x27;s nails, I had been keeping all of my polishes, and implements in a big plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not huge, but its a great size for a college dorm.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described,  quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The bottom is good for decals or other nail tools.</li>
            <li> then this is the right case for you.</li>
            <li> I think this case is just right.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be made of wood and covered inside with a strong vinyl/satin like fabric that appears to have been stitched around the edges and is  tightly attached by being nicely glued in place.</li>
            <li> I really liked the setup of the case and that it locked on top to keep out small prying hands.</li>
            <li> it is very sturdy, seems like it will last, I love it!</li>
            <li> Right away I can tell it is higher quality.  </li>
            <li> As far as getting me organized this has made it easy.  </li>
            <li> now I have an extremely full top compartment, and a bunch of loose, glass bottles rolling around in the bottom.</li>
            <li> so I was a little skittish</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;There is a variety of storage options (elastics in the lid, a pocket in the back, etc) without having so many that items could get lost or disorganized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I wish I spend $20 more for bigger case!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Fits her favorite nail polishes and essential nail accessories she uses when doing her nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pretty sturdy and compact to store all our polishes.</li>
            <li> Only had this product for a week and my girlfriend love it.  </li>
            <li> (*shoulder shrug*)</li>
            <li> so much !1</li>
            <li> The top is tall enough to accommodate Julep, China Glaze, and OPI for Sephora polishes.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s pretty pricey for what it is.</li>
            <li> I love this, you get to put everything for your nails all in one and it fits all different bottles of nail</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of make up you might want something bigger. :)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for to hold my gel nail polish kit.</li>
            <li> The top compartment is adjustable, so larger bottles of polish can be accommodated.</li>
            <li> Making some larger spaces also meant I could put nail sponges and wipes in the top.</li>
            <li> Feels very well made and sturdy!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The two locks for the top section are shiny, sturdy and snap open</li>
            <li> top drawer has 24 sections for nail polish and it definitely LOCKS, some reviews said it does not lock, but it does, however the bottom drawer does not lock.  </li>
            <li> everything is organized n ready to go !</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I like the individual compartments for nail polishes on the top compartment.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a bit bigger, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured, well crafted and put together.</li>
            <li> Then the bottom section had more than enough room for all my tools.</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t have the problems of it not closing correctly because the hinges and buckles are all higher quality.</li>
            <li> I needed something bigger because I have a LOT of nail polishes, i had to save the most part in the lower compartment wich</li>
            <li> is not what I wanted it for in the first place.</li>
            <li> Was great to start but very small for someone with a lot of nail art decorative products</li>
            <li> It is a very well made case and will do exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very well made, the latches are very sturdy!</li>
            <li> I really loved the look but had to return it because it was too small for all that I have.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, sturdy, rather small though for the price.</li>
            <li> I can easily find the polish that I&#x27;m looking for, not only that the bottom drawer holds the nail extras needed.  </li>
            <li> The dividers are customizable - you have to assemble them yourself, so you could easily leave one of the veritcal pieces off, thereby creating larger rectangles, rather than squares.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It also have a kaboodle for my regular non-gel manicure supplies and clasp on that broke very quickly.</li>
            <li> so you wind up with this section that is just kind of a black hole</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will keep it yet, will see if I can get most of my polish&#x27;s and accessories to fit in it?</li>
            <li> However, if you have a large collection of polish and tools, this case will not do.  </li>
            <li> The bottom has a large drawer that can hold almost anything.  </li>
            <li> The specifications state that the case is 12x10x10, but the shipping box is not even that large.  </li>
            <li> She keeps certain things in there</li>
            <li> so with that being said, i kept going to buy more and more stuff from this cosmetics line such as their nail polish, other brush sets (nail brushes), and i could continue to go on!</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> You also get little keys which are nice</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is really great for travel as it is a little big</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute with the pink interior and it is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> built.&lt;br /&gt;The front/top clasps feel very sturdy</li>
            <li> Is very well made and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, quality case.</li>
            <li> You are very organized with this</li>
            <li> And that extra inch or two in height and depth means that I can comfortably fit everything in this case.</li>
            <li> Very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> She ended up just tossing the key in one of the bottle dividers since she didn&#x27;t need to secure it</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t cost so much I would give it a 5.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;would reccommend to anyone who wants to keep their stuff all together in a nice/stylish way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The case is very well done.  </li>
            <li> but I do love it and it is what I expected</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and will hold up to a lot of use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> really, that&#x27;s nit picking.</li>
            <li> And it is really beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She LOVES this case, she can get so much into it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really well made</li>
            <li> She feels like a real cosmetologist with her kit.  </li>
            <li> The locks are also very well build</li>
            <li> The only thing is in the description it says it fit any and all size nail polish.</li>
            <li> that nail polish remover and toe separators don&#x27;t take up that much room in it.</li>
            <li> Keeps me very organized.</li>
            <li> We really help keeping our nail accessories organized.  </li>
            <li> High quality!Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I am really trying to organize myself this year..</li>
            <li> I like mine so much</li>
            <li> Very well-made.</li>
            <li> On the contrary, this is a well-made and seemingly durable case that holds way more nail polish than I expected.  </li>
            <li> The case is kind of heavy</li>
            <li> The quality is nice, but it&#x27;s MUCH smaller than it appears and smaller than measurements</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold all of my polish and tools, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much because I decided to use it for the items I use the most, and will continue to store other items as they were before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The latches are deterrent enough to keep my kids out, but super easy for me to open.</li>
            <li> Plus, you can fit two Julep polishes or two Super Black Laquers (or other polish in a tall rectangular bottle) in each of the top divider compartments.</li>
            <li> I love that it has dividers for all my nail polishes and storage for all my other miscellaneous nail tools and supplies.</li>
            <li> I love the pink inside of it too!</li>
            <li> I wish it held more bottles of polish and other nail products</li>
            <li> Feels nice and feels like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I just wish the box was a little bit bigger, because not all my nail polishes fit in the top compartment.  </li>
            <li> The elastics in the cover are nice to hold small containers like glitter.  </li>
            <li> It has really cool clips to open and close.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas, because her friends commented about her bag full of unorganized nail polish tubes.</li>
            <li> My first thought when I was opening the box for this was \\&quot;wow, it&#x27;s quite a bit heavier than I expected\\&quot;</li>
            <li> You can lock the top half, but not the bottom drawer.  </li>
            <li> The only way it could be better would be to include another drawer that is not so deep for tools like files and buffers.  </li>
            <li> Decent quality.</li>
            <li> I also inserted smaller nail files and nail clippers in the top holders, next to the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (The main reason I purchased this item)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t talk about everyday use but can say that this item arrived on time and looks like a good solid case upon inspection.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than expected,  but holds a nice amount of items.</li>
            <li> I would suggest carrying something a little smaller to travel with but overall this case is beautiful</li>
            <li> It holds at least 20 plus bottles of nail polish between the top and bottom compartments as well as all manicure and pedicure at home tools!</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> Quality is extremely high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> But I still highly recommend this organizer, it surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> It is made of high quality material and has ample space.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble fitting any of my other bottles of nail polish.</li>
            <li> I bought an LED kit to do my own gel nail polish and the LED lamp fits in the bottom &amp;#34;drawer&amp;#34; along with the power cord and plenty of space for other stuff left over.</li>
            <li> I accidentally got a little acetone on this fabric and was pleased that it did not leave a mark.</li>
            <li> The little compartments are great for my cosmetics, and the big drawer holds bigger things!  </li>
            <li> This case is very well made and classy.</li>
            <li> The case itself is very sturdy and professional looking.</li>
            <li> will not fit into the bottom because the top has a lid that flips up, and the bottom slides out, therefore</li>
            <li> I tried the SHANY case with the clear top first, but it was undersized for my small LED lamp and 4oz bottles of cleaner and remover.</li>
            <li> She intended to use the top part for hair clips, ties, cloth headbands and a few bows, hence the compartments.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom drawer was to keep  spray bottle, hairspray, mousse, brushes.</li>
            <li> If you have any separators in the top section, nail files or implements will not fit UNLESS YOU CUT the separators.</li>
            <li> If you have any separators in the top section, nail files or implements will not fit UNLESS YOU CUT the separators.</li>
            <li> Very nice, expensive looking nail accessory/makeup case.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently discovered a little obsession with gel nail polish and have purchased a kit to do my own.</li>
            <li> Maybe they will make a new one, that has turquoise, and I can get that just in time to start getting in to nail stamping ...</li>
            <li> to accompany her new gel manicure set.</li>
            <li> Colors are great as I&#x27;m a big pink and black lover.</li>
            <li> and while I am in no hurry to use up all the available space, if I ever do, I will definitely be buying a second case just like this.</li>
            <li> It is big enough to fit all kinds of nail polishes (some bottles are taller than others) and the drawer fits my 2 polish removers cotton balls</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough to fit the fat bottles of polish as others I found did not.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, the very popular Colossal Collection of Tropical nail files will not fit flat to one side in the bottom drawer (I have to put them in on the diagonal which wastes space), they would fit on the top section where polish iskept if you want to sacrifice AND ALTER some of the separators.  </li>
            <li> Loved the color pink and the black background!</li>
            <li> Nice moderate size, not too big or to small, just right</li>
            <li> There is more than enough room for my nail flies, clippers, and other supplies underneath.</li>
            <li> I waited a long time for this case, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter loves it!  </li>
            <li> but I feel that the quality is somewhat cheap and therefore, the price is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected with a full box of nail polishes.</li>
            <li> but it looks like it is, the top handle is very tough and fine unless you have a very large hand; it has two shiny bolts holding it on both sides, the case is small and not al all at as light as it looks, this must be because it is made of solid stuff.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is the bottom box is kind of small</li>
            <li> The black plastic squares in the top are removable, so you can make it into different configurations if you wanted to.  </li>
            <li> I really love this case, I use it for my Gel Polish kit, I do wish it was a little bigger</li>
            <li> Its sharp and glossy, and the clasps are shiny and easy to open.</li>
            <li> But so far everything is holding up</li>
            <li> There is a lot of room and potential but it is not used very well.</li>
            <li> It seems durable so far.</li>
            <li> i have never had organized nial polish , i am 32 years old and i am telling my husban</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this organizer.</li>
            <li> Well made and professional looking.</li>
            <li> I use this bag daily because its very easy&lt;br /&gt;I hold it to any place in the home to put the manicure</li>
            <li> , it looks so professional</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 13 year old granddaughter&#x27;s birthday.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived, I was incredibly surprised by the quality of the synthetic leather.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really really like this case.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I found this one.  </li>
            <li> and I completely agree.  </li>
            <li> it just made me throw out my old polishes.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t that surprised.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t really see what is back</li>
            <li> The top has individual compartments to hold compartments round polish bottles.</li>
            <li> worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> 2 not crazy on pink</li>
            <li> which was a good thing in my mind as it meant this wasn&#x27;t simply an expensive plastic Caboodle-style case.  </li>
            <li> It holds 24 polishes in large squares (which so far has fit all the different polishes I have), but the drawer is quite small.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> ONLY complaint is that it could be a little bit bigger and hold more polishes in the top compartment, but I have alot of polishes.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a case that would work to hold all of our nail necessities.  </li>
            <li> it measures 9 inches across, 6 inches deep, 9 inches high.  </li>
            <li> Now that I know this case is of such high quality</li>
            <li> and I have even purchased a second one for my 14 year old daughter!!</li>
            <li> I got the pink on black love the colors together.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to organize all of my nail products for quite a long time and this one really does the job.  </li>
            <li> The inside is lined in hot pink fabric.  </li>
            <li> I like the product, the only problem was that I bought it for my wife and on the picture it looks like a normal size, but when it arrived it was 60% smaller than normal....</li>
            <li> the hot pink lining</li>
            <li> /&gt;I ended up buying the Shany Cosmetic Matters Nail Organizer in black with a deep pink interior and would have returned it (with Amazon&#x27;s great return policy) had I not liked it so much.</li>
            <li> It fits most of my nail polishes except for the OPI brand ones are a little too wide for the slots.</li>
            <li> Unable to fit acetone bottle for example!!</li>
            <li> The clips don&#x27;t hurt my hands and are not sharp like others are.</li>
            <li> The edges where the fabric was glued were pretty sharp.</li>
            <li> Taking out a shoe box every time I did my nails (weekly) is not fun, pretty or practical.</li>
            <li> so far it seems well thought out but not entirely durable.</li>
            <li> No regrets on this one stop for all my tools and polish.</li>
            <li> I am currently using it for my Young Living oils....</li>
            <li> Very sturdy for when I need to cart them around, and stays closed when latched.</li>
            <li> I love the case, but am annoyed with the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad but too small</li>
            <li> Instead of 2 actions, they only require a quick and effortless flip up or down to open.</li>
            <li> I saw it fluctuate by as much as $20 higher over the black friday hoopla</li>
            <li> , the issue my wife had with it was that its super small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small to hold anything larger like a UV light, but it&#x27;s so big</li>
            <li> I was putting together a gift of several nail polish collections and looked high and low for a proper case to present them in.  </li>
            <li> Sections for nail polish are 3.25\\&quot; high (with lid closed).</li>
            <li> Honestly I felt a little ridiculous spending $40 on something just to hold my nail polish</li>
            <li> It looks bigger in the picture, and I did manage to get all of my fingernail polishes and tools in it, but just barely.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that my polishes can stand up now and aren&#x27;t so hard to open from laying down.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but when we got it, I got right back online and ordered myself one.</li>
            <li> Her brushes fit the brush holder next to the mirror and didn&#x27;t seem weak as the brushes didn&#x27;t dangle.  </li>
            <li> , the area inside the bottom is a little smaller (not by much though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nicole by OPI nail polish fit a little awkwardly in the slots, but they do fit.</li>
            <li> only  complaint is THE CASE SHOULD BE AT LEAST ONE INCH BIGGER IN EVERY DIRECTION, so it can hold a little more and hold the longer Colossal nail files in the bottom drawer(see</li>
            <li> There are a few drawbacks but they are pretty minor</li>
            <li> only real drawbacks in my opinion are that the case is heavy (due to the quality - an even trade IMO), the little pockets aren&#x27;t really useful for my supplies, and I&#x27;m not a fan of pink.  </li>
            <li> It is well made of high quality materials - one can tell from the weight that it&#x27;s not cheap junk.  </li>
            <li> Like another person said not sure why there is a mirror in it up doesn&#x27;t really take anything away from it.</li>
            <li> There is a mirror there although it&#x27;s too small to really be of much use.</li>
            <li> I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> and I was initially a little sceptical about the quality, but swayed by the positive reviews of other purchasers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that it makes my nail polish mess very organized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a whole lot bigger, but it is bigger.</li>
            <li> outside of the front case is 9.25\\&quot; wide x 9\\&quot; tall and from front to back</li>
            <li> Too much money for such a small suitcase!</li>
            <li> its smaller then expected but does the job.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It came a lot earlier than expected, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> and I have every confidence it will hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> If this product was less money i would have ordered a second or 3rd.</li>
            <li> The dividers can be taken off and they&#x27;re just basic black dividers going 3x5, contributing 24 total bottle holders.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that is smaller than I anticipated, but it&#x27;s my only fault for not double checking the dimensions.</li>
            <li> bottom drawer works well for all of the other items - my only wish is that it was a teeny bit deeper</li>
            <li> Fits all my nail polish, even the larger sized ones, and nail accessories too!...excited to see what other products SHANY has out.  </li>
            <li> The squares for the polishes are removable, but they interconnect upon each other so if you try to remove some of them the remaining ones wobble, so I left all of them in, but I am not a polish junkie</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t hold everything that I expected - because I expected it to be larger!  </li>
            <li> The bottom drawer was wide enough to put all her filers, cuticle cutters(?), and other accessories.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted to store approximately 45 bottles of eo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp looking overall!</li>
            <li> Its just an open space with elastic sewn in on both sides to hold items, and a small pocket on the back.  </li>
            <li> Inner color was dark pink (fuschia?)</li>
            <li> It works so well for transporting my nail gear that previously had been littered across various bathroom drawers and vanities.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not enough to make me like it less</li>
            <li> The case I received has one slight different than what is in the pictures.  </li>
            <li> It fits my gel polishes, base coat, top coat, LED gel polish lamp, and my nail shaping supplies!</li>
            <li> thought it would be a little bigger</li>
            <li> The bottom drawer also has elastic bands on the sides and  two little pockets on the back of the drawer.  </li>
            <li> I do wish it was just a little bit bigger</li>
            <li> Little slots next to the mirror are perifect for my nail clipper, cuticle cliper etc...</li>
            <li> [um, the nailpolish that you individually stick on each nail], removed from their silly large box, in the elastics in the drawer.)</li>
            <li> The other, that I bought at a makeup show several years ago at a slightly reduced price is still in fantabulous shape</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The spring moves inside the lower center clasp</li>
            <li> I think the box would be too big and heavy.  </li>
            <li> It will only hold a few files and/or brushes in the compartment  you see in the pic with drawer pulled out.  </li>
            <li> Got what I ordered and expected to receive..</li>
            <li> Not what I expected in organizing.  </li>
            <li> There are a few bands inside the lid, but not quite enough.  </li>
            <li> But is really not a problem.</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that fingernail polish remover in the old bottle does not fit standing up.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a few days but</li>
            <li> bottom section does not lock, instead a turning a metal tab opens the box, however forgetting to turn that tab to a closed position will result in the drawer falling out of the case when you pick up the case to carry it.</li>
            <li> The interior of the bottom drawer is  8.25\\&quot; wide x 3.75 tall and 5.25 deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it could have been a little bit bigger.  </li>
            <li> so you end up with polishes knocking around against each other and one broke in mine.</li>
            <li> The build is nothing at all like Caboodles or other drugstore finds.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> i have other polishes from OPI to Essie and</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t find any other case specifically made for nail polish and the like, so I will keep it.  </li>
            <li> I see some one with specific small amount of items using it.</li>
            <li> The mirror serves no purpose, other than dressing up the inside of the box, I would so</li>
            <li> rather there were a deep pouch like there is in the bottom drawer for small implements, acetone or alcohol squares</li>
            <li> I got this item to replace a Caboodle I had to store my nail polishes and other nail tools.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying the Shany makeup train case for all of my other cosmetics.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit expensive but it worth it to pay that money.</li>
            <li> A small bottle of nail polish remover(6 oz or 177 ml) will fit, but unfortunately you have to lay it on it&#x27;s side and keep the lid on very tight</li>
            <li> A small bottle of nail polish remover(6 oz or 177 ml) will fit, but unfortunately you have to lay it on it&#x27;s side and keep the lid on very tight</li>
            <li> The bottom part of the case can hold an average sized bottle of nail polish remover when laying horizontal.</li>
            <li> but still.. was the cheapest I could get this and usually takes that long anyways!&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li> but i put all those down on the bottom draw.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to checkout your other products!</li>
            <li> It is a little on the heavy side when it is empty</li>
            <li> My manicure bowl almost does not fit with all my other stuff.</li>
            <li> These will do, however I was spoiled by my previous nail polish organizer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret the price I am paying although I do wish it were less.</li>
            <li> There were black spots inside.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;PLUS ..you can take out black squarish dividers for nail polishes and use the box for anything else  jewlery, make up etc</li>
            <li> The price should slashed to half.</li>
            <li> do not know of its efficiency rating, since I&#x27;m not sure on what the minimal standards are for choosing a nail accessories organizer case.</li>
            <li> The round shaped bottle of Beauty Secrets Ridge Filler 18.5 ml will not fit, however if you put it in upside down (brush side down)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bottom storage is quite small.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of little elastic bands on the sides of the box, which will hold drip tips, ect.  </li>
            <li> Has little slots for nail care kits and tweezers.</li>
            <li> everything you need for your nails fits in this little box.</li>
            <li> I just stashed the Butter bottles in the neat little drawer compartment, which also holds files, cuticle pushers/trimmers, clippers, etc.</li>
            <li> A little on the heavy side</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Once you have everything in it, it&#x27;s quite heavy to lift.</li>
            <li> I go through my polishes once every few months to give away the ones I don&#x27;t use and to make room in here for the ones I want to keep.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty construction that I think will hold up for years.</li>
            <li> A few of these polishes need to stay standing up for them not to leak.</li>
            <li> so this space is a bit wasted for me.  </li>
            <li> But it is heavy, even by itself.</li>
            <li> I just received this case a few minutes ago from UPS.  </li>
            <li> It is way too heavy even if it&#x27;s empty, and is very small too.</li>
            <li> The lock for it is a bonus as I have two little boys that want to try to get into my stuff all the time, I keeps them from destroying my polish!</li>
            <li> The below storage is a little small for all my stuff</li>
            <li> In each little square of the divider we can put up to (at least) a 30ml bottle of liquid.  </li>
            <li> The interior of the bottom drawer is very small, so putting everything I want to put in it is pretty much impossible.</li>
            <li> The interior of the bottom drawer is very small, so putting everything I want to put in it is pretty much impossible.</li>
            <li> NO more having to decide what to pack in a small make-up bag -</li>
            <li> so I could take more polishes along and the price was completely outrageous with shipping and taxes.</li>
            <li> though the mirror inside is almost pointless, it&#x27;s so small.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure on durability.</li>
            <li> wont let the lid shut (not sure how lipstick in the pic would work either)</li>
            <li> And VERY heavy.</li>
            <li> Unless a nail drier is very small it will not fit in the lower drawer.</li>
            <li> Overall the quality was a bit disappointing too.</li>
            <li> lately ive been on a shany cosmetic \\&quot;kick\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The only two things that was a disappointment was 1.</li>
            <li> The drawer is too small!</li>
            <li> And i agree, its a very small make up box.</li>
            <li> I am seriously considering purchasing another one....</li>
            <li> Guess I was disappointed as I purchased two larger, lower cost ones from OPI years ago</li>
            <li> I responded and asked what they would do if my separator was broken.</li>
            <li> They responded and asked me to send them pictures of the broken separator, and they would take care of it.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t see myself secretly using up all her nail polish....</li>
            <li> I am so sad.</li>
            <li> I noticed some people were not impressed by the case.  </li>
            <li> but unhappy that it arrived that way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a slightly awkward size.</li>
            <li> The case arrived in one day and it looks expensive!</li>
            <li> Looks very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for, this to arrive because I have a lot of nail accessories, but I was disappointed in the size.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am however disappointed in the size.  </li>
            <li> If you crave organization like I do, use fingernail polish, and know how difficult it is to keep them upright and organized; this is a must have!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> great item. Fits my polish and is worth the price. Would recommend to a friend :)</li>
            <li> I just got this today and love it.  There are a few drawbacks but they are pretty minor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It feels very solidly built.&lt;br /&gt;The front/top clasps feel very sturdy&lt;br /&gt;There is a variety of storage options (elastics in the lid, a pocket in the back, etc) without having so many that items could get lost or disorganized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The spring moves inside the lower center clasp so it makes a metal scraping &amp;#34;sprong&amp;#34; sound when I turn it.&lt;br /&gt;The box locks at the top.  I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d lock the top of the box and not the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;The lock keys are just double prongs.  Again, I don&#x27;t know why the locks are there at all if they&#x27;re not proper locks or even cover both sides of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Middle of the Road:&lt;br /&gt;The bottom doesn&#x27;t fit all my items (nor the top all of my nail polish bottles), but I still like the size of it.  If it were any bigger I think the box would be too big and heavy.  If you&#x27;re looking for a nice solution for most of your home use nail supplies this is a well thought out and good looking option.</li>
            <li> Love this! Use it to store essential oil bottles and my creations in different sizes containers in the bottom portion.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my daughter.  Just as described.</li>
            <li> The case arrived in one day and it looks expensive! Very high quality. I also bought 24 Shany nail polishes to put in it. The case is kind of heavy but im not going to take it to anywhere, so i have no problem with that. The case also comes with 2 keys. No regret! highly recommended</li>
            <li> Much, much, much smaller than I thought.  The description makes it seem as if it will hold all of your nail/make up supplies.  It will only hold a few files and/or brushes in the compartment  you see in the pic with drawer pulled out.  I would not have bought had I know.  Very pretty but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Sturdy organizer and super cute. I love that it has dividers for all my nail polishes and storage for all my other miscellaneous nail tools and supplies. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to organize their nail supplies!</li>
            <li> Was great to start but very small for someone with a lot of nail art decorative products</li>
            <li> thought it would be a little bigger</li>
            <li> Holds all her polish but taller nail polish bottles dont fit.</li>
            <li> Is very well made and sturdy.  You can lock the top half, but not the bottom drawer.  Not a deal breaker.  Fits a lot of stuff and keeps it well organized.  The black plastic squares in the top are removable, so you can make it into different configurations if you wanted to.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I finally found a case to organize all my nail stuff. I just wish it was bigger and would hold more bottles and the drawer was had more room.</li>
            <li> Bought this to organize my nail polish and the handle broke within 6 weeks but this is what I was needing for all my nail polish other than the handle breaking and price great item</li>
            <li> This is a really cute case to hold your nail polish and tools!  However, if you have a large collection of polish and tools, this case will not do.  I was well aware of the dimensions before I purchased it, but it was such a great price, I decided to go for it anyway.  It doesn&#x27;t hold all of my polish and tools, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much because I decided to use it for the items I use the most, and will continue to store other items as they were before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, here is my experience with this case, so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top Compartment:  It contains sturdy plastic dividers to hold and separate 24 polish bottles.  If you leave the dividers out, you can get more in there.  I was able to fit 36 bottles (without the dividers) (various brands).  HOWEVER, it was more ideal for me to use this top compartment for my brushes/tools/jewels/other nail accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Compartment:  Its just an open space with elastic sewn in on both sides to hold items, and a small pocket on the back.  It is deeper than the top compartment, which is why I decided the brushes/tools/jewels/other nail accessories were more practical up top.  When I had these items in the bottom, there was just a lot of unused space.  Also--in case anyone is wondering--, the dividers that are designed for the top compartment will not fit into the bottom because the top has a lid that flips up, and the bottom slides out, therefore, the area inside the bottom is a little smaller (not by much though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this for all my daughter&#x27;s nail polish and accessories. It&#x27;s a great size and holds all her polish.</li>
            <li> Taking out a shoe box every time I did my nails (weekly) is not fun, pretty or practical. This case is! It&#x27;s very well made and I love the fact that my polishes can stand up now and aren&#x27;t so hard to open from laying down. The drawer fits all my nails stuff easily as well. The ONLY downside to this case is that it only has 24 nail polish spaces. If you&#x27;re like me, you need more. I know the typical person doesn&#x27;t own more than 24 but I do....I am already looking at bigger options....</li>
            <li> Well made, GF loves it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my friends birthday gift. She loves it. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Bought it as a birthday gift for my friend, she would love it!</li>
            <li> I love this case. I have filled it up and even bought another case. It is great for travel and the sides expand out so you can see exactly what you have in it. All I worry about are the sides breaking after a while. But so far everything is holding up and I would recommend this case!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, quality case. Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who was into this type of case.  Got what I ordered and expected to receive..</li>
            <li> Very nice, expensive looking nail accessory/makeup case.  The inside is lined in hot pink fabric.  Shipped promptly in nice packaging.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I like it so far it seems well thought out but not entirely durable. My nail polish bottles fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> perfect.&lt;br /&gt;This perfect was perfect for my wife ordered her things for nails</li>
            <li> Guess I was disappointed as I purchased two larger, lower cost ones from OPI years ago and they were awesome. This one is smaller, cheaper made and more expensive. I have looked everwhere for the similar ones from OPI but could not find them. These will do, however I was spoiled by my previous nail polish organizer.</li>
            <li> This is really nice and sturdy. The top part holds a lot, though not all styles bottles. I wish I could find cubes to fit in the bottom as there are no dividers. Still recommend.</li>
            <li> The drawer is too small! Unable to fit acetone bottle for example!! Too much money for such a small suitcase!</li>
            <li> The case is solid and looks nice. There is a lot of room and potential but it is not used very well. The plastic dividers don&#x27;t divide anything evenly on top so you end up with polishes knocking around against each other and one broke in mine. I now use it just at home and don&#x27;t put many polishes in it.</li>
            <li> I bought this case to use for vaping and vape storage when travelling. It works wonderfully! 15ml bottles fit perfectly in the top tray. 30ml fit, it&#x27;s a bit snug, but with the rubber dropper tips on top I consider it just another safety restraint to keep my bottles from jostling or spilling. The elastic loops in the lid (either side of the mirror) are great for holding spare batteries or tips, and the elastic bands in the drawer are great for hold mods and larger bottles. There&#x27;s also a pocket, I use it for my tweezers which, pre-case, I was constantly losing. Plenty of room in that drawer for four bags of wick &#x27;n vape cotton bacon, a spool of kanthal, scissors, tweezers, screwdrivers...yeah, you get  the point. Bonus: The outside is smooth enough to apply your favorite brands&#x27; stickers!!!</li>
            <li> This is just a fabulous case; I put it in my cart and waited for the price to drop but it did not for well over a month so I went ahead and purchased it.  No regrets on this one stop for all my tools and polish. This case is very well made and classy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice case to organize your nail polish but it&#x27;s way too heavy.  It doesn&#x27;t fit everything I have.  I wish I spend $20 more for bigger case!!</li>
            <li> I love the case, but am annoyed with the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to put my doTERRA essential oils in. Calculating the measurements prior to buying, I thought I would order a second set of &amp;#34;separators&amp;#34; and put it in the bottom drawer, doubling the number of oils I could carry. As soon as I placed my order, I contacted the company to inquire how to order spare parts. They said it wasn&#x27;t an option. I responded and asked what they would do if my separator was broken. They responded and asked me to send them pictures of the broken separator, and they would take care of it. I was practically begging them to take my money so I could get another set, and they simply weren&#x27;t interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I have an extremely full top compartment, and a bunch of loose, glass bottles rolling around in the bottom. Not thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a gorgeous case, though, and I&#x27;m not sorry I bought it. I just wish the company were more accommodating to their customers.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold my nail polish and it&#x27;s perfect.  The top has individual compartments to hold compartments round polish bottles. The bottom has a large drawer that can hold almost anything.  It&#x27;s a nice size and sturdy. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!! I&#x27;ve had it for quite a while now. It&#x27;s perfect for all my polish and other things. Its sturdy and hasn&#x27;t given me any problems what so ever.</li>
            <li> Okay, so first of all I want to say that we don&#x27;t use this box for cosmetics.  My husband and I use electronic cigarettes, and I wanted some place to store all of our stuff.  This box works awesome!! The top has all the dividers, which holds all of the e-liquid bottles. In each little square of the divider we can put up to (at least) a 30ml bottle of liquid.  The needle tipped bottles will also fit in the top as there is enough height for the lid to close with them in there.  There are a lot of little elastic bands on the sides of the box, which will hold drip tips, ect.  The top of the box also has latches that lock, which is nice to keep little ones away from the e-liquid if they happen to get a hold of the box.  The bottom drawer also has elastic bands on the sides and  two little pockets on the back of the drawer.  Perfect for storing the little odds and ends for vaping.  The drawer itself is a nice size and works well for storing extra tanks ect.  We are very happy with this purchase.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> This is our second case.  The other, that I bought at a makeup show several years ago at a slightly reduced price is still in fantabulous shape but I have discovered how great this case is for containing other stuff and because it is so sturdy and will NEVER need replacing I am buying another here at Amazon.  I don&#x27;t regret the price I am paying although I do wish it were less.</li>
            <li> If you have a big collection of nail polish or do this type of thing for a living, then don&#x27;t order. If you like to dabble here and there with cosmetics and nail polish then this is the right case for you. The bottom part of the case can hold an average sized bottle of nail polish remover when laying horizontal. Has little slots for nail care kits and tweezers.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!! I keep all my nail supplies in this. I do my own gel nails at home so it is nice that it all fits in this handy case. The lock for it is a bonus as I have two little boys that want to try to get into my stuff all the time, I keeps them from destroying my polish!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this so much.  You are very organized with this and it helps so you don&#x27;t over buy in nail polish.  It is the perfect size and great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I now have all my nail polishes organized! Very satisfied with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;I also love the interior color of my new case :).</li>
            <li> Happy with the professional look and plentiful storage this case provides for our essential oil collection.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mothers birthday and she loves it, she loves doing her nails and makeup, she is very happy</li>
            <li> I love the fact that i can keep lots of polish in one compartment.</li>
            <li> I do my own gel manicures and was looking for a case to store all the paraphernalia that comes with that. I tried the SHANY case with the clear top first, but it was undersized for my small LED lamp and 4oz bottles of cleaner and remover. So, I returned it and got this case instead. It&#x27;s not a whole lot bigger, but it is bigger. And that extra inch or two in height and depth means that I can comfortably fit everything in this case. Plus, I love the elastic  bands in the bottom drawer for keeping the bottles upright. No spillage when they fall over! Definitely get this one if you&#x27;re in a similar position.</li>
            <li> I can easily find the polish that I&#x27;m looking for, not only that the bottom drawer holds the nail extras needed.  Kind of wish I would of bought two during the lighting deal.</li>
            <li> I love this organizer! My nail polish fits in here perfectly. I only wish there were more compartments to fit more polish but other than that it is great! I would definitely recommend if you are looking for something to organize your collection of nail polish.</li>
            <li> Great case.  Perfect size.</li>
            <li> Perfect size to store essential oils!</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a case that would work to hold all of our nail necessities.  This case is perfect.  It is strong and sturdy and looks nice too.  It is big enough to hold all of my polish, files, nippers, etc.  The elastics in the cover are nice to hold small containers like glitter.  I will be purchasing another case when my daughter takes this one to college with her.  We love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently discovered a little obsession with gel nail polish and have purchased a kit to do my own. I bought this to store my polishes and some of the needed instruments &amp; liquids. And I&#x27;m sure happy I did. This is a great quality item. Very well made and sturdy. My only complaint is that is smaller than I anticipated, but it&#x27;s my only fault for not double checking the dimensions. It holds 24 polishes in large squares (which so far has fit all the different polishes I have), but the drawer is quite small. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase though.</li>
            <li> This case is everything I could have hoped for. When I first purchased this case I wasn&#x27;t really sure about it because what I wanted it for I had not seen any reviews on so I was a little skittish but I am here to tell you that it works wonderfully as a makeup case. I LOVE it. There is one thing I think everyone should also know. I don&#x27;t think it is really great for travel as it is a little big but I have it sitting on top of my dresser at home and it keeps my things organized and looking nice instead of having my makeup strewn all over my countertops. I would suggest carrying something a little smaller to travel with but overall this case is beautiful and I have even purchased a second one for my 14 year old daughter!!</li>
            <li> Incredibly gorgeous and the perfect  sir all my nail products and polishes. So divine my friends all want one too!</li>
            <li> Not bad but too small</li>
            <li> I choose this rating, because very happy with this product nail polishes fits perfectly plenty of space to put other things in it, easy to open perfect size and perfectly done product. It is a little bit expensive but it worth it to pay that money.</li>
            <li> its smaller then expected but does the job. I took the dividers out because it gives me 40% more room int he top. i have over 20 bottles and about 7-8 pens stored in the top. I ordered a tackle box for the rest of my supplied. If this product was less money i would have ordered a second or 3rd.</li>
            <li> Purchased for gf and she loves it. Fits her favorite nail polishes and essential nail accessories she uses when doing her nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree it looks great and is constructed with quality.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and it is great. It is a bit smaller than I had hoped but our daughter loves it. The quality is good.</li>
            <li> This is alright. The quality is that of what you would expect from &amp;#34;made in china&amp;#34;. But it is not bad. Has a lot of sorting options on the top and a good sized removable storage space on the bottom. I purchased this for my wife with a BlackFriday deal for $20. It is worth the $20, but I would hesitate to spend much more.</li>
            <li> I bought this to store my essential oils.  I just received my shipment today and it is PERFECT. It is exactly what I wanted to store approximately 45 bottles of eo. I know this is labeled as a nail polish case, but it can cross over for those essential oil enthusiasts!</li>
            <li> I really loved the look but had to return it because it was too small for all that I have.  Not what I expected in organizing.  Perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of accessories to organize.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. My wife&#x27;s polishes were annexing part of her closet. She&#x27;s got everything in one box now, and can easily take it to another room to &amp;#34;set up shop.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great my daughter tried to take it. Pretty sturdy and compact to store all our polishes. It would make a great gift for any young lady.</li>
            <li> It fits my needs and everything I need to put in it. It seems durable so far. It has really cool clips to open and close. The clips don&#x27;t hurt my hands and are not sharp like others are. Instead of 2 actions, they only require a quick and effortless flip up or down to open.</li>
            <li> Bought this case and added all the nail products I could think of for my granddaughter for christmas.  That was the best move I could have made.  She loves it and she will have her polish when and if she decides to go to the nail salon; or should she decide to do it herself she has everything that she will need to do her nails.</li>
            <li> Only had this product for a week and my girlfriend love it.  When she received it she tried fitting all her nail polish bottles and they all fit albeit varying in shapes and sizes.  The dividers can be taken off and they&#x27;re just basic black dividers going 3x5, contributing 24 total bottle holders.  The bottom drawer was wide enough to put all her filers, cuticle cutters(?), and other accessories.  Inner color was dark pink (fuschia?) as advertised and she likes the color.  I didn&#x27;t see the need for a mirror inside the case, but it adds to its aesthetics. Her brushes fit the brush holder next to the mirror and didn&#x27;t seem weak as the brushes didn&#x27;t dangle.  She ended up just tossing the key in one of the bottle dividers since she didn&#x27;t need to secure it (I don&#x27;t see myself secretly using up all her nail polish....teehee)  Price was perfect for quality since I got it during a Black Friday deal.  I highly recommend it if you tend to leave your nail polish bottles everywhere in the house and your boyfriend uses the bottle as a cat toy time to time. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a guy, the box was sturdy and all the components were securely affixed to the box.  A+&lt;br /&gt;5 stars because the price to product build quality ratio was phenomenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know of its efficiency rating, since I&#x27;m not sure on what the minimal standards are for choosing a nail accessories organizer case. (*shoulder shrug*)</li>
            <li> i have never had organized nial polish , i am 32 years old and i am telling my husban i don&#x27;t believe i have lived this long with out this adorable organizer !!! i am so glad i got it !!! i think all women / girls should have one , it&#x27;s a nessesity !!!! thank u so much !1</li>
            <li> It works for what I need</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful case! I am currently using it for my Young Living oils....The outside of this looks like leather and the inside lining is nice. It&#x27;s a well made case...worth the money spent. It will hold 30 bottles of oil and the bottom will hold even more. I am seriously considering purchasing another one....I have this one as full as I can get it!!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size for keeping my every day make-up - but also so quick and convenient just to grab and take along for weekend trips.  NO more having to decide what to pack in a small make-up bag - when I can just grab this and go.  I wanted something to organize my nail polish - and I got that, plus so much more!  This is awesome!  High quality, and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I love this case. I would recommend this over any kind of Caboodles case. It feels sturdy, it&#x27;s attractive, it&#x27;s well-made, and it holds lots of polish both in the top lidded area and in the drawer. The top is tall enough to accommodate Julep, China Glaze, and OPI for Sephora polishes. Anything taller could easily fit in the bottom drawer. Plus, you can fit two Julep polishes or two Super Black Laquers (or other polish in a tall rectangular bottle) in each of the top divider compartments. The bottom is good for decals or other nail tools. I&#x27;m really glad I bought this and while I am in no hurry to use up all the available space, if I ever do, I will definitely be buying a second case just like this.</li>
            <li> Fairly decent, I would like more storage for nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Purchased to carry my essential oils when I travel and it&#x27;s perfect!  I love it&#x27;s professional look and the Pink interior...lol</li>
            <li> Everything great except I wish the bottom compartment locked as well. Also, it&#x27;s pretty pricey for what it is.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for, this to arrive because I have a lot of nail accessories, but I was disappointed in the size. It looks bigger in the picture, and I did manage to get all of my fingernail polishes and tools in it, but just barely. Once you have everything in it, it&#x27;s quite heavy to lift. The elastic bands for nail files are JUST big enough for a nail file and I had to work a bit to get clippers into the bands. All said and done, I like it for now despite the size and weight.</li>
            <li> I am so sad. I was super excited. There were black spots inside. Also the bottom latch was already kinda crooked, I understand that this may have happened eventually but unhappy that it arrived that way. Overall the quality was a bit disappointing too. The edges where the fabric was glued were pretty sharp.</li>
            <li> i loved my makeup case</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, owing to the price. It&#x27;s actually AWESOME! :-) Hold all of my regular nail polishes, and gel colours. The elastic in the top is great for my tools, and the drawer even holds my Sephora/OPI UV gel nail light, along with all of my other goodies :-) (I put Sally Hansen individual nailpolish stickers [um, the nailpolish that you individually stick on each nail], removed from their silly large box, in the elastics in the drawer.)</li>
            <li> Very nice product.. I will buy from there, my wife loves ot</li>
            <li> I have had this case for a year and it&#x27;s holding up well. It&#x27;s the best makeup case I have ever had-- it fits nail polish in addition to my makeup. The compartments are fairly adjustable and customizable. No problems with seams or ripping of any sort. Still in good shape.</li>
            <li> Great price, great arrival time, &amp; great product! I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
            <li> I have an ever growing nail polish collection (because of monthly subscriptions) and this is a great case.  It can hold more then enough polishes and accessories to keep me happy, but not enough that my collection becomes unwieldy.  I go through my polishes once every few months to give away the ones I don&#x27;t use and to make room in here for the ones I want to keep.</li>
            <li> This is  a great case for  make up, nail polis and all other nice things that we use for beauty maintenance, Very well made as well excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found this! I love the color and how sturdy it is, and finally have something awesome to put my nail polish in!!</li>
            <li> My wife thought this would be a great idea as a hair accessory carrier for our daughters.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well built but not big enough to serve this purpose. She intended to use the top part for hair clips, ties, cloth headbands and a few bows, hence the compartments.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom drawer was to keep  spray bottle, hairspray, mousse, brushes.Was not big enough even for mini&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;A $3.00 Walmart plastic bathroom caddy ended up working better.</li>
            <li> My toddler kept getting into my gel polishes so I bought this box. It&#x27;s really nice and the best part is that everything I need is exactly where I left it.</li>
            <li> I love this carrying case. It is sturdy and holds all my gel nail polish stuff, even the LED lamp.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this organizer. Before she had all her nail stuff in a bag, but now she keeps it organized with this.  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This case is amazing! I love it so much! It holds 24 nail polishes in the top (any sizes) and you can add more polishes or tools, remover, etc. to the bottom. Now my nail polish is all organized in one case that I can take with me.</li>
            <li> I am not using this for a makeup case. I am using it for my gel polish. this makes it so easy to stay organized! this is a nicely made case and it has a good heft to it. I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a huge nail polish and accouterments collection.  fits it all and is easy to carry to the couch to use.</li>
            <li> This was just as awesome as I thought it would be :) I needed something to organize my nail polish and this was it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I just wish it had more slots since I keep on buying nail polish.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!  Perfect to hold a lot of nail polish &amp; some extras in the bottom drawer .</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t cost so much I would give it a 5.  It is a must for a college girl nail enthusiast bought one for both my daughter and her BFF..they love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a nail organizer for a while, and I am glad I went with this one.  Some of the highlights:&lt;br /&gt;- Quality is extremely high. The build is nothing at all like Caboodles or other drugstore finds.&lt;br /&gt;- The dividers are customizable - you have to assemble them yourself, so you could easily leave one of the veritcal pieces off, thereby creating larger rectangles, rather than squares.&lt;br /&gt;- All of my current polishes fit nicely (OPI, Sephora, Nails Inc, China Glaze, Finger Paints) but I don&#x27;t think that Butter London will.&lt;br /&gt;- The bottom section is nice and roomy, including room for my 16oz acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real drawbacks in my opinion are that the case is heavy (due to the quality - an even trade IMO), the little pockets aren&#x27;t really useful for my supplies, and I&#x27;m not a fan of pink.  If the lining had been turquoise, it would have been perfect.  Maybe they will make a new one, that has turquoise, and I can get that just in time to start getting in to nail stamping ...</li>
            <li> this thing is beyond amazing! lately ive been on a shany cosmetic \\&quot;kick\\&quot;. never heard of the brand before and it started with their makeup brush set. their brushes are great quality and in a lovely package and the price tag had me sold already! so with that being said, i kept going to buy more and more stuff from this cosmetics line such as their nail polish, other brush sets (nail brushes), and i could continue to go on! but enough about my shopping habits, the point im trying to make is that i knew it would come to no shock that this would be great to organize all the stuff ive bought for my nails and boy did it ever! this case has room and then some! i thought it was awefully cleaver of them to have a 24 slot nail polish slot on top for their nail polish set to go in. i put all those on the top in numberical order. granted i have other polishes from OPI to Essie and yes, those fit just nicely too on top but i put all those down on the bottom draw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line, this is an amazing case! i deff got the best bang for my buck and to make the situation better, my bf can stop \\&quot;yelling\\&quot; at me for leaving my cosmetics EVERYWHERE throughout the house and now all my stuff is in one beautiful case not scattered lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would reccommend to anyone who wants to keep their stuff all together in a nice/stylish way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- jill</li>
            <li> I love this organizer. All of my polish and accessories fit in it and I no longer have nail polish sitting all over the place &amp; I don&#x27;t have to hunt for my files.</li>
            <li> I dare you to buy this and try to not fall in love... It is a fantastic nail polish organizer,  and the construction is unparalleled. Combine that with the amazing construction and beautiful design,  this is totally a winner,  hands down. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this, you get to put everything for your nails all in one and it fits all different bottles of nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this. Easy to put away once your done and looks really good.Great way to organize your nail products. I think I might get another one.&lt;br /&gt;It came on time and I had no problems with this seller.</li>
            <li> Nice box, would like more nail polish cubes.  The drawer space is nice, bit I would have liked there to be more compartments.</li>
            <li> This is my third case, and it is perfect to carry my nail polish and accessories.  I have an OPI case, and could not find another one that didn&#x27;t cost a bundle.  This case by Shany is just like it, Now I have two to hold my regular nail polish, and one to hold my gel polishes. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely worth the $40, the quality is great and the size is perfect. If you have a lot of make up you might want something bigger. :)</li>
            <li> The case is very well done.  I have a lot of nail polishes and I love the fact that they all fit in the case.  Everything is so well organized that all my nail polishes are easy to get instead of being jumbled up together in a box.</li>
            <li> I love it. It is perfect in every way! I got nail polish and sunglasses as a gift for someone and everything fit perfect in this case. Super adorable, space conserving and styling. VERY HAPPY!</li>
            <li> it is very sturdy, seems like it will last, I love it! but I do have more polish than fits in the top, I am tempted to buy a second one. Also there isn&#x27;t a good place for the polish remover bottle. but I do love it and it is what I expected</li>
            <li> The perfect place to store all your nail stuff!  The top compartment has a lot of spaces for bottles of nail polish to be stored upright. I use the large drawer for the LED light that dries the gel polishes. The only way it could be better would be to include another drawer that is not so deep for tools like files and buffers.  There are a few bands inside the lid, but not quite enough.  Still, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I purchased one for my daughter as she needed something to keep all her nail polish and supplies in order. I was skeptical at first, but when we got it, I got right back online and ordered myself one. It&#x27;s well-made the dividers in the top help out so much. with the dividers the top holds 24 bottles of nail polish. You don&#x27;t need to use all of the dividers if you don&#x27;t want to. The bottom section is great for all the extras such as Emery boards, cuticle clippers, creams or whatever you need. I completely recommend this organizer.</li>
            <li> This is awesome. It&#x27;s pricey, but so worth it! The craftsmanship is great! Very nice bottom drawer. Bigger than I thought. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This thing is very well built, I looked at several for my girlfriend before ordering this and there was none that were this nice!</li>
            <li> Product was fine as per description.</li>
            <li> I bought this organizer because I had my make up kit everywhere so I needed an orgnizer. This make up case not just organize my make up kit, but also it keeps them ​in a beautiful shape.</li>
            <li> So happy I bought this. I use this for my gel manicure nail polishes and tools. It also have a kaboodle for my regular non-gel manicure supplies and clasp on that broke very quickly. The clasp on the SHANY is much stronger and the quality is great. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful. Perfect for nail supplies</li>
            <li> I hunted in stores and all over the internet to find this product. I was very pleased when I opened the box. It is a very well made case and will do exactly what I wanted it to do. The perfect size for someone who likes to have products on hand to keep their nails looking nice. It is very sturdy and will hold up to a lot of use. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my gel nail kit  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an organizer to hold all of my nail polish in and settled on this one. Glad I did, I love it. I had been looking in stores and couldn&#x27;t find anything similar to this in size. There&#x27;s room in the top tray for 24 bottles using the cardboard bottle divider that&#x27;s included. I wish there were a second divider to use for the bottom drawer in this orgnaizer. Includes 2 keys to lock it. Decent quality.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nailpolish holder/case for my sister for Christmas and I came across this case. From reading the reviews I ended up ordering 3 of them. I gave one to my sister and one to my son&#x27;s girlfriend as Christmas presents and kept one for myself. This was a fantastic purchase! They both loved the case and I do too. And I do mean they really loved it, the expressions on their faces when they saw what it was, was priceless! I was able to fit all my polishes in and the one bottle that didn&#x27;t fit (it&#x27;s to tall) I was able to put in the bottom drawer. My sister has so many bottles of nailpolish she needs another. I highly recommend this item! It&#x27;s really cute with the pink interior and it is very sturdy. Totally worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for to hold my gel nail polish kit. Everything fits perfectly with extra room for files, etc. Heavy duty construction that I think will hold up for years. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my Red Carpet LED manicure kit.  Plenty of room in the top shelf for polish and the entire kit fits nicely in the pull out drawer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas.  I have since filled it to the brim with designer nail polish and remover.  She is going to be thrilled!  It is a little on the heavy side when it is empty and it probably weighs 2 tons now that I filled it...I think it was worth it because it will be super durable!</li>
            <li> I love this case! It has a lot of space for nail polish, &amp; a big drawer on the bottom for remover &amp; nail files, clippers, etc. I will buy another one.</li>
            <li> The case is beautiful and sturdy, exactly as described. I do wish it was just a little bit bigger so I could take more polishes along and the price was completely outrageous with shipping and taxes. But still very happy with it as I couldn&#x27;t find anything else even remotely like it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this case from Sydney, Australia - it seemed very cheap and I was initially a little sceptical about the quality, but swayed by the positive reviews of other purchasers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is sturdily made and well finished. The top compartment is adjustable, so larger bottles of polish can be accommodated. Making some larger spaces also meant I could put nail sponges and wipes in the top. I also inserted smaller nail files and nail clippers in the top holders, next to the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom drawer works well for all of the other items - my only wish is that it was a teeny bit deeper so I could store nail polish remover in an upright position, rather than lying on its side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really, that&#x27;s nit picking. I love this case. It works so well for transporting my nail gear that previously had been littered across various bathroom drawers and vanities. Delivery was good value and prompt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great purchase, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. The nail polish section is genius. A good buy for the price, though the mirror inside is almost pointless, it&#x27;s so small. It&#x27;d be handy if it came with sectioning walls for the big compartment, but for what it is, it&#x27;s still wonderful. Sits proudly on my dressing table with the Shany Studio Quality Natural Cosmetic Brush Set with Leather Pouch.</li>
            <li> I use as my manicure set, everything fits in. Easy to take around, and really good material quality.</li>
            <li> I love this case. Im an an organizer freak and this case keeps my nail polishes just the way i like it. My only complaint is that it could have been a little bit bigger.  My manicure bowl almost does not fit with all my other stuff. But is really not a problem. It does help keep all my manicure stuff just in one place and I am pleased. Well made and professional looking.</li>
            <li> I have searched everywhere online for the perfect box to hold and organize my nail polishes and accessories.  This box is the perfect size to store my items and to then put away on a shelf or even keep it sitting out somewhere, as it is pleasing to look at.  I love the pink inside of it too!</li>
            <li> I am currently in cosmetology school and I purchased this product to store my Manicure products. I love the separator s in the top compartment which organizes and stores my nail polishes. (The main reason I purchased this item) My nail polishes fit nicely. I like the design and the colors. My only complaint is that the bottom storage is quite small. My finger bowl and reusable implements must be stored seperately, which defeats the purpose of keeping all of my supplies in one place. This is a great product for home use, but as a student or professional, I would look for something else. Shipping was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took the chance of this product. I recently started buying my own Harmony Gelish no chip polishes to do my own no chip manicures. A few of these polishes need to stay standing up for them not to leak. This cosmetic case works perfect for what I needed it for. Polishes stored on the top and everything else for manicuring fits nicely in the bottom. Easy to store in my bathroom closet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the solid construction and good looks of this organizer. There is more than enough room for my nail flies, clippers, and other supplies underneath. If you are storing polish remover, however, you will have to lay it on its side. Nicole by OPI nail polish fit a little awkwardly in the slots, but they do fit. I had no trouble fitting any of my other bottles of nail polish.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly! Looks awesome! Big enough without being too big. Fits all my nail polish. Feels very well made and sturdy!</li>
            <li> This item is great for someone who loves to paint their nails and does their nails at home! It holds at least 20 plus bottles of nail polish between the top and bottom compartments as well as all manicure and pedicure at home tools! It&#x27;s nice to have all of my things in a very well compartmentally designed case. Makes everything easy to find and easy to access. Worth it!</li>
            <li> I use this bag daily because its very easy&lt;br /&gt;I hold it to any place in the home to put the manicure</li>
            <li> amazing...my nailpolishs will not be all over the place any more. This box is perifect for me. It is big enough to fit all kinds of nail polishes (some bottles are taller than others) and the drawer fits my 2 polish removers cotton balls cutilce oil etc (def enough space). Little slots next to the mirror are perifect for my nail clipper, cuticle cliper etc...it AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;PLUS ..you can take out black squarish dividers for nail polishes and use the box for anything else  jewlery, make up etc</li>
            <li> Love it..hold a all my makeup to bottom and nail polishes to top no need to search far anymore :)</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my wife. SHE LOVES IT. i am glad that i did. the quality and the design is just perfect for my wife tools</li>
            <li> Since this was a gift for my niece I can&#x27;t talk about everyday use but can say that this item arrived on time and looks like a good solid case upon inspection.</li>
            <li> Love this case!! I recently invested in shellac so I could do my nails myself and this case is perfect for all the necessities and more.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality! Very impressed, I look forward to showing it off when doing family and friends nails :)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of this case.  It is well made of high quality materials - one can tell from the weight that it&#x27;s not cheap junk.  And it is really beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am however disappointed in the size.  The specifications state that the case is 12x10x10, but the shipping box is not even that large.  I measured the case - it measures 9 inches across, 6 inches deep, 9 inches high.  It won&#x27;t hold everything that I expected - because I expected it to be larger!  But I can&#x27;t find any other case specifically made for nail polish and the like, so I will keep it.  And I want to keep it just because it is so nice.  I&#x27;ll just store my alcohol and acetone elsewhere, which is probably a good idea anyway to prevent staining from leaks.</li>
            <li> Perfect for all your nail polish, keeping them organized.  I love the strong sturdy case.  I noticed some people were not impressed by the case.  What do they want a strong box to up hold the atomic bomb.  I think this case is just right.  I got the pink on black love the colors together.  The bottom box is remove able and room enough for more nail essentials or whatever you need.  I waited a long time for this case, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Awesome organizer! Love it so far :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product to hold my makeup and nail polish that I have and after reading the reviews I went ahead and bought the product.  When I received it in and opened the package the size was perfect, it looked amazing and fit everything I needed to put in it.  I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great organizer for all my nail care products.</li>
            <li> everything you need for your nails fits in this little box. my only complaint is that fingernail polish remover in the old bottle does not fit standing up. but they do have those things you just put your fingers in now that work better anyway. this is an easy case for travel to a friends or store in a closet.</li>
            <li> The Shany Cosmetic case has really helped me stay organized with my gel nail polish, uv light and all of the extras! There is plenty of space for all of the polish up top and a large compartment underneath that stores the light perfectly! I&#x27;m so happy with this product!</li>
            <li> My daughter has over 50 bottles of nail polish, and brushes and stuff.  She LOVES this case, she can get so much into it, it looks so professional and it has a sturdy handle that she can carry it around with.  It&#x27;s really well made and although she is NOT a girly girl, the bright pink didn&#x27;t bother her because she was so enamored with the case.</li>
            <li> I have officially organized all of my nail polishes in this lil container.  I am very happy with the quality and the amount of polishes I can fit in it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this item!!! If you crave organization like I do, use fingernail polish, and know how difficult it is to keep them upright and organized; this is a must have!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! This product should actually be rated 10 stars.  Besides it looking great (looks like real leather), its very functional.  Fits all my nail polish, even the larger sized ones, and nail accessories too!...excited to see what other products SHANY has out.  Will definately be buying from this company again!!</li>
            <li> This case is absolutely beautiful.  It is well made and will last for years.  I just wish the box was a little bit bigger, because not all my nail polishes fit in the top compartment.  But I still highly recommend this organizer, it surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully made nail polish case. Stylish and Cool. ONLY complaint is that it could be a little bit bigger and hold more polishes in the top compartment, but I have alot of polishes.</li>
            <li> Great for organizing nail polish and supplies.  Also for toting around.  I do my own gel nails with an LED lamp and this would just be able to hold the lamp, tools and many polishes.</li>
            <li> I need another one. I love it and can fit all my nail colors.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our daughter for her birthday to store the 24 pack of nail polish and design brushes we got her.  She feels like a real cosmetologist with her kit.  Any time a female comes to our house, she breaks out her kit and does their nails.  I like that it allows her to be creative and practice art.  Trust me, some of her designs are incredible!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a birthday gift.  It arrived on time and well-packaged.  I was able to see her open it and it has some great compartments for organizing nail polish.</li>
            <li> My father bought this for me and I love it I have only had it for a few days but everything I was looking for. It fits all my nail polishes on the top and files and creams on the bottom. If you get annoyed with nail polishes everywhere this is perfect to keep them in one place and out of the way. Like another person said not sure why there is a mirror in it up doesn&#x27;t really take anything away from it. You also get little keys which are nice just incase your worried about someone getting into it.</li>
            <li> First off, let me start by saying that the quality and build is very good. Feels nice and feels like it will last a long time. Material quality is also very good. No issues with that, the issue my wife had with it was that its super small. And i agree, its a very small make up box. I see some one with specific small amount of items using it. But to my wife it was a no go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End and all, we returned for a full refund. Thats the beauty about Amazon!</li>
            <li> The case stores a pretty good amount of nail polish and you are able to make the squares larger my removing the dividers.  If you don&#x27;t have a ton of nail polish this product is wonderful because you can store removers, files, etc. underneath.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to organize all of my nail products for quite a long time and this one really does the job.  There is room for everything!</li>
            <li> Great quality and again, lightening deals from Amazon for Christmas were perfect for additional ideas for the kids.  My 14 year old daughter loves it!  Nice moderate size, not too big or to small, just right to accompany her new gel manicure set.</li>
            <li> bought for my nail polish which fits very well into the top compartments. Very nice and sturdy feeling case. The locks are also very well build</li>
            <li> I purchased this case for my daughter&#x27;s nail polish and accessories.  She loves it.  It&#x27;s nicely built, great quality.  It shuts securely and feels like it will last for many, many years.</li>
            <li> I really liked the setup of the case and that it locked on top to keep out small prying hands. The only thing is in the description it says it fit any and all size nail polish. It fits most of my nail polishes except for the OPI brand ones are a little too wide for the slots.</li>
            <li> A little on the heavy side but that&#x27;s expected with a full box of nail polishes. It suits its purpose it even helps store my various nail art brushes and nail stickers and nail jewels along with my nail stamp kit from Konad. It&#x27;s durable and it looks like it could last for years to come. Love it. Only draw back...wish they had it in various colors or prints. Other than that it makes my nail polish mess very organized.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 13 year old granddaughter&#x27;s birthday.  She says she loves it and all of her nail polish fits in it perfectly.  I don&#x27;t know how many bottles she has though.</li>
            <li> As far as getting me organized this has made it easy.  I would have given it 5 stars if the bottom drawer was a bigger.  I think the quality of the material is also 4 star but for the price it is a five star.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted. It&#x27;s made very well, and all my nail products fit perfectly. It&#x27;s not a piece of garbage love love love❤️</li>
            <li> I like the product, the only problem was that I bought it for my wife and on the picture it looks like a normal size, but when it arrived it was 60% smaller than normal....</li>
            <li> In doing my own nails for years and my mother&#x27;s nails, I had been keeping all of my polishes, and implements in a big plastic bag.  I often wished for a better system as I was always dumping the bag and searching through everything to find what I needed. I wrestled with buying this case as I do think it is pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying the Shany Cosmetic Matters Nail Organizer in black with a deep pink interior and would have returned it (with Amazon&#x27;s great return policy) had I not liked it so much. It is very cute!  It seems to be made of wood and covered inside with a strong vinyl/satin like fabric that appears to have been stitched around the edges and is  tightly attached by being nicely glued in place. I accidentally got a little acetone on this fabric and was pleased that it did not leave a mark. The outside isn&#x27;t leather but it looks like it is, the top handle is very tough and fine unless you have a very large hand; it has two shiny bolts holding it on both sides, the case is small and not al all at as light as it looks, this must be because it is made of solid stuff.  The two locks for the top section are shiny, sturdy and snap open shut easily (two keys are included for this case);  everything about this case seems sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outside of the front case is 9.25\\&quot; wide x 9\\&quot; tall and from front to back it is 6 3/4\\&quot; deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top drawer has 24 sections for nail polish and it definitely LOCKS, some reviews said it does not lock, but it does, however the bottom drawer does not lock.  If you are a nail polish junkie, this organizer may not work for you. The round shaped bottle of Beauty Secrets Ridge Filler 18.5 ml will not fit, however if you put it in upside down (brush side down) it will fit (see photo).  The mirror serves no purpose, other than dressing up the inside of the box, I would so rather there were a deep pouch like there is in the bottom drawer for small implements, acetone or alcohol squares, I DO THINK SHANY SHOULD MAKE THIS CHANGE.  The squares for the polishes are removable, but they interconnect upon each other so if you try to remove some of them the remaining ones wobble, so I left all of them in, but I am not a polish junkie so this space is a bit wasted for me.  Otherwise, for the use they are intended for, these separators are very sturdy and look great.  Sections for nail polish are 3.25\\&quot; high (with lid closed). Be aware putting implements in the elastic holders in the lid top may keep the lid from closing if the nail polish bottles are too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom section does not lock, instead a turning a metal tab opens the box, however forgetting to turn that tab to a closed position will result in the drawer falling out of the case when you pick up the case to carry it. I don&#x27;t like this feature, there is nothing to stop the drawer form falling out.  Since the drawer is made of wood, IT SHOULD HAVE A STOP IN PLACE UNDER TO KEEP IT FROM SLIDING OUT as the drawer it could be damaged if this were to happen.  The bottom drawer closure looks more stylish as it is, but I do think Shany should put the same snap locks on this drawer so it lessens the possibility the drawer will certainly fall out and get ruined. I wish there were more room to put things in the bottom drawer for it to be more useful.  The interior of the bottom drawer is  8.25\\&quot; wide x 3.75 tall and 5.25 deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only  complaint is THE CASE SHOULD BE AT LEAST ONE INCH BIGGER IN EVERY DIRECTION, so it can hold a little more and hold the longer Colossal nail files in the bottom drawer(see in photo).  The Emjoi Micro Pedicure non electric unit and manicure kit will both fit nicely in this drawer. Unless a nail drier is very small it will not fit in the lower drawer. unfortunately, the very popular Colossal Collection of Tropical nail files will not fit flat to one side in the bottom drawer (I have to put them in on the diagonal which wastes space), they would fit on the top section where polish iskept if you want to sacrifice AND ALTER some of the separators.  If you have any separators in the top section, nail files or implements will not fit UNLESS YOU CUT the separators. If you remove all the separators these Colossal files would fit, but then you would not have the nice sections to hold polish bottles.  The interior of the bottom drawer is very small, so putting everything I want to put in it is pretty much impossible. A small bottle of nail polish remover(6 oz or 177 ml) will fit, but unfortunately you have to lay it on it&#x27;s side and keep the lid on very tight (I put mine in a zip lock bag in case it leaks) but I have since bought a dip and twist jar to soak off polish, it fits better. See two photos attached.  Happy Shopping!some of the separators.  If you have any separators in the top section, nail files or implements will not fit UNLESS YOU CUT the separators.

            <li> Love this makeup case!  The little compartments are great for my cosmetics, and the big drawer holds bigger things!  Love this!  Fast delivery with Amazon Prime!!</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s perfect...</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter inlaw. She was really happy with it and I was happy that it was such nice a quality and had lots of room for nail polish and all your nail accessories.</li>
            <li> I bought this to store all my gel polish, led light, files etc.  It is perfect, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> ADORABLE. HOLDS A TON OF POLISH AND ROOM FOR MORE IN THE BELOW AREA!</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than expected,  but holds a nice amount of items. Looks very nice!  I gave it as a gift,  so I&#x27;m not sure on durability. It came nicely packed  for shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this nail accessory box! It has great space inside and I was able to add all of my polishes and nail accessories to it!</li>
            <li> The quality is nice, but it&#x27;s MUCH smaller than it appears and smaller than measurements are saying. I&#x27;m keeping it only because I don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of sending it back. But I&#x27;ll have to buy another bigger one now.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect nail organizer. The bottom drawer pulls out easily and fits all my manicure tools. It looks nice on my dresser, handy to grab and go and have all my manicure products together. I recommend this product if you like to keep your things organized!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter to take off to college. I wish it held more bottles of polish and other nail products</li>
            <li> Love the item that I purchased!&lt;br /&gt;Love the hot pink lining&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for all my polishes &amp; tools&lt;br /&gt;So everything is organized n ready to go !</li>
            <li> bought it for daughter. four stars because she liked it, but would have preferred it to have more compartments.The case itself is very sturdy and professional looking.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas, because her friends commented about her bag full of unorganized nail polish tubes. When it arrived, I was incredibly surprised by the quality of the synthetic leather. Its sharp and glossy, and the clasps are shiny and easy to open. The case doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all. It&#x27;s not huge, but its a great size for a college dorm. For $39.95? I think she&#x27;ll love the gift as much as she&#x27;ll love the gesture of me listening to her friends&#x27; opinions. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a gift. It is really cute, and the quality on it is good. I would definately order this again or something similar.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My daughter keeps all of her nail care items in here nice and organized.  Has a key to lock it up...safe from sisters who borrow without asking. ;)</li>
            <li> Love it! Love the colors and design. The locks are sturdy. The top is great for OPI. The drawer on the bottom is spacious. I probably have about 30 bottles of Avon nail polish in the bottom drawer. I am thinking about buying another one soon.</li>
            <li> I got this for storing my essential oils. The top is perfect for holding 5ml and 15ml bottles, and I keep blends, rollerballs, my FCO and sprays (angled - they don&#x27;t stand upright,) and my little &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; notebook in the bottom drawer. Very sturdy for when I need to cart them around, and stays closed when latched. The latches are deterrent enough to keep my kids out, but super easy for me to open.</li>
            <li> I love it so much!!! Great for my starting nail art adventure. I may need a bigger one LOL! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like the individual compartments for nail polishes on the top compartment. It&#x27;s very sharp looking overall! But it is heavy, even by itself. I bought an LED kit to do my own gel nail polish and the LED lamp fits in the bottom &amp;#34;drawer&amp;#34; along with the power cord and plenty of space for other stuff left over. It helps keep all my nail stuff in one place. Way better than my purple plastic shower caddy i used to put all my nail stuff in. Acetone bottles will fit if they are the smaller size kind.</li>
            <li> This case is just what I needed for my nail polish and nail related items. I wish it were a bit bigger, but I still love it. It is at maximum capacity already.</li>
            <li> Love it but bottom drawer doesn&#x27;t slide as easily as I would like. Colors are great as I&#x27;m a big pink and black lover.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really really like this case. The upper portion of the case holds up to 24 bottles of nail polish. I am a fan of OPI and the bottles fit perfectly and don&#x27;t move around a lot so I feel that they are pretty secure in the case. The upper portion also includes slots to store some nail tools such as clippers, files, etc. There is a mirror there although it&#x27;s too small to really be of much use. The bottom part of the case comes out like a drawer and can hold a variety of items comfortably. I keep nail polish remover, toe separators, etc. in there. It&#x27;s actually a slightly awkward size. It&#x27;s too small to hold anything larger like a UV light, but it&#x27;s so big that nail polish remover and toe separators don&#x27;t take up that much room in it. It&#x27;d actually be better if the case was designed to have a smaller drawer and more slots to hold nail polish. However, the case in general is pretty awesome, and having the bulk of your nail stuff in a single, easily transferrable location is really cool.</li>
            <li> I am a proud owner of my first Shany Cosmetics product, The Shany Nail Polish Organizer Makeup Case... And I absolutely LOVE it!!! It fits everything I need to do my own gel polishes at home! It fits my gel polishes, base coat, top coat, LED gel polish lamp, and my nail shaping supplies! It fits everything in a space saving, compact, highly functional and good looking case. Thank you Shany Cosmetics... You have a fan for life!  I can&#x27;t wait to checkout your other products!</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured, well crafted and put together. Sturdy... very pleased with purchase, would recommend to others for their nail polish carrying case needs.</li>
            <li> Great quality!  So cute!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. It looks even nicer in person than in the photos.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to put my daughters nail polish and accessories in.  I was pleasantly surprised when I found this one.  High quality and exactly what I wanted:)  I will definately check with Shany when purchasing again!  I would also send to someone as a gift.  I know it would be loved!</li>
            <li> LOVE this makeup and nail polish storage. Two of my favorite colors. Very sturdy,  definitely not cheaply made. Item exactly as described,  quick delivery. So glad I made this purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Really nice sturdy case.</li>
            <li> I was putting together a gift of several nail polish collections and looked high and low for a proper case to present them in.  I was impressed when I came across this one.  It&#x27;s big enough to fit the fat bottles of polish as others I found did not. The review said the case was well made and I completely agree.  It is very sturdy but the detail of the case and pink color of the interior are really what makes it the perfect solution to my dilemma.  I would buy again at the regular price.  I saw it fluctuate by as much as $20 higher over the black friday hoopla but I purchased it before.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Could be bigger but it&#x27;s definitely nice. My wife loves it. She keeps certain things in there so she can take it with her if needed.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for all my gelish manicure supplies. Wasn&#x27;t cheap, but I feel like I will get my money&#x27;s worth! Keeps me very organized.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I expected. And VERY heavy. Wanted something to house my entire nail polish collection, but this just didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Very nice, great quality,</li>
            <li> Love this organizer. Holds a lot of nail poliches and organizes my nail tools.</li>
            <li> I love this case, first off you can tell it&#x27;s very well made, the latches are very sturdy! The top holds 24 nail polishes and yes the squares are adjustable.  I didn&#x27;t even think I had more than 24 but I did but that&#x27;s okay it just made me throw out my old polishes. The only thing is the bottom box is kind of small but it&#x27;s okay it holds all my smaller items such as buffer pads, cuticle remover set, nail file, etc.  I recommend getting it if you like to be organized and don&#x27;t mind spending $40. I was going to buy the Shany make up holder/box because the nail box is super well made but I heard it tips over so I just bought another brand.</li>
            <li> I am a mother of 2 girls 10 and 14 and we all love doing our nails.  We really help keeping our nail accessories organized.  My husband bought us this product as a christmas gift.  It has been a life saver.  It is now easy to find our favorite colors and nail art.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> High quality!Fast delivery! Just the right size! Thank You!</li>
            <li> I just received this case a few minutes ago from UPS.  I opened the box and could not believe how beautiful it is!!  Looks very expensive.  I got all my nail stuff from everywhere lol and put it right in the case.  Everything fit perfectly.  I have some very tall bottles of ManiPure vegan polish and didn&#x27;t think they would fit but they do!! :)  So happy with this purchase!  I am really trying to organize myself this year..this was a perfect way to start!</li>
            <li> Very good quality, as described and great for storing bigger makeup items and nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;Only downfall for me was that it cost $20 to ship to Australia and took 2 weeks to get here! but still.. was the cheapest I could get this and usually takes that long anyways!&lt;br /&gt;so thanks, very happy :)</li>
            <li> I really love this case, I use it for my Gel Polish kit, I do wish it was a little bigger (Taller and Wider) The below storage is a little small for all my stuff but it does a great job and keeps my nail polish up right</li>
            <li> Good quality, sturdy, rather small though for the price. It came a lot earlier than expected, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> And a great organizational box to corral all sorts of mani/pedi utensils in addition to polish.  Way better than kaboodles and unsightly plastic containers.</li>
            <li> I got this item to replace a Caboodle I had to store my nail polishes and other nail tools.  Right away I can tell it is higher quality.  I paid more for the Caboodle and when the snap on it broke after about a year I wasn&#x27;t that surprised. You could tell it was cheaply made.  I was able to fit all of my fill size nail polish bottles (OPI and Orly) in the top section.  Then the bottom section had more than enough room for all my tools. I like the elastic bands along the side of the bottom drawer. I put my various nail clippers in them and it makes it easier to see everything. I also like that I can pull the drawer all the way out.  In most Caboodle&#x27;s you can&#x27;t do that so you wind up with this section that is just kind of a black hole and you can&#x27;t really see what is back there.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product. I can tell it is going to last a lot longer and I won&#x27;t have the problems of it not closing correctly because the hinges and buckles are all higher quality. I&#x27;m so glad I tried a new brand even though I had been using Caboodle&#x27;s for years.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my daughter.  She got a lot of finger nail polish and this storage case works out well</li>
            <li> This thing is perfect if you have a lot of nail supplies.  It holds a lot but isn&#x27;t cumbersome in size.  It&#x27;s sturdy and I can tell it will hold up to a lot of use.  The only two things that was a disappointment was 1. i wanted to put finger nail clippers in the straps in the lid but with your polish in the slots wont let the lid shut (not sure how lipstick in the pic would work either) 2 not crazy on pink but that&#x27;s not enough to make me like it less</li>
            <li> This is a nice organizer but I feel that the quality is somewhat cheap and therefore, the price is not worth it.  The price should slashed to half.</li>
            <li> I use this for all my mani-pedi products.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good case (not Lucite) for several years.  I like mine so much, I bought one for my sister as a Christmas gift.  Very well-made.</li>
            <li> Honestly I felt a little ridiculous spending $40 on something just to hold my nail polish but I can now say with a straight face that this was a great investment.  My first thought when I was opening the box for this was \\&quot;wow, it&#x27;s quite a bit heavier than I expected\\&quot; which was a good thing in my mind as it meant this wasn&#x27;t simply an expensive plastic Caboodle-style case.  On the contrary, this is a well-made and seemingly durable case that holds way more nail polish than I expected.  All but my Butter polishes fit nicely into the slots, but the slots can be adjusted to accommodate larger bottles if you want.  I just stashed the Butter bottles in the neat little drawer compartment, which also holds files, cuticle pushers/trimmers, clippers, etc. very nicely with plenty of room to spare.  The case I received has one slight different than what is in the pictures.  The photos show lipsticks being held in the elastic bands next to the mirror but the elastics in my case were barely big enough to hold a sample size Clinique lip gloss.  No big deal to me though.  Now that I know this case is of such high quality I&#x27;ll be buying the Shany makeup train case for all of my other cosmetics. This is well worth the money and I have every confidence it will hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will keep it yet, will see if I can get most of my polish&#x27;s and accessories to fit in it?</li>
            <li> Great for stashing things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my granddaughter will love this.</li>
            <li> It is way too heavy even if it&#x27;s empty, and is very small too. I needed something bigger because I have a LOT of nail polishes, i had to save the most part in the lower compartment wich is not what I wanted it for in the first place.</li>
            <li> Finally, the perfect case to hold all those bottles of nail polish, files, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> it was the perfect gift.  it was just what she was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;this box fits just nail polish and thats all we wanted to put&lt;br /&gt;in it.  amazon was the only place to get it!</li>
            <li> Very good quality.  Perfect for putting nail polishes and organizing knick knacks.  Loved the color pink and the black background!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect case for the person who loves doing their own nails and wants to keep all of their nail accessories handy. It is made of high quality material and has ample space. I was able to fit all of my favorite polishes in the top (all sizes and brands) and put all my nail tools and extras in the drawer. I would highly recommend this product!!!!!</li>
