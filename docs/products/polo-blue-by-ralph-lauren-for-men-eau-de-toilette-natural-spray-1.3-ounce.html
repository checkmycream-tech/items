            <li>Designed for an older woman.</li>
            <li>I like the general woodsy notes, and the longevity.(Easily 5-6 hours.)</li>

            <li> Got this for my dad on Father&#x27;s day and he absolutely loved it! This perfume smells amazing! The packaging was great too!</li>
            <li> Great cologne!  It has a pleasant smell thats not overpowering.  My wife loves when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I smelled this cologne at saphora it smelled good but somehow this one didn&#x27;t! It had an expired more like a perfume that was made in the 1920s! Designed for an older woman.,again people from experience never order a cologne based on hyped reviews. Take into account that there&#x27;s different smells that people tolerate on them.</li>
            <li> Service good, arrive on time like the website said, great price, i will do business again with this company, i recommended</li>
            <li> Get a lot of compliments on this.  Has a nice scent, not too strong or overpowering</li>
            <li> My grandson loved the smell of Polo and wears it everyday.  He asked his grandpa what he was wearing and he liked the smell so much he wanted some too.</li>
            <li> I use to get this for my husband years ago and decided to buy it again. I love the scent on him.</li>
            <li> Awesome price and also fast shipping</li>
            <li> Pleasant but in an unusual manner</li>
            <li> Does not get any better than Polo Blue and the price is waaaaaay cheaper than department stores</li>
            <li> My husband loved this as a Christmas gift.  Would order again. Recommend this to friends.  Thank you so much. God bless America</li>
            <li> On time and what I expected.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift but I think it smells okay.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as part of his fathers day gift and we both love the sent! Sooooo fresh and yummy!</li>
            <li> Excelente producto ... llego a tiempo es muy buena la fragancia ... gracias . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> My wife  wanted this product in a smaller bottle for travel, so I found it online and purchased it.  She loves this, so in turn, I love it</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my dad, and he was impressed by it I would recommend this&lt;br /&gt;to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last year or so. Love the smell! Definately recomment it anyone looking for a nice perfume.</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume for men, my boyfriend likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> I would award 4.5 stars if I could. I like the general woodsy notes, and the longevity.(Easily 5-6 hours.) Only downside would be the projection in the 1st hour might be too strong for some. I find the 1.3 and 2.5 oz. sizes to be very useful for carry ons, the shape is easy to grab (and keep) a hold on. Yet I could see someone liking this enough for signature scent being happy with 4.2, even 6.7 sizes. This product is on my repeat order list.</li>
            <li> Excellent, just as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I had originally gotten a bottle of this over 10 years ago as a high school graduation present, and I fell in love with the smell immediately. While it smells almost completely different from the kind I got, it still has some of the same ideas. I love it and wear it every time an opportunity presents itself.</li>
            <li> Product size was larger than expected</li>
            <li> Smells wonderfully! I bought as a gift for my husband. It&#x27;s one of his favorites.</li>
