            <li>I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this for face creams</li>
            <li>This is a good size because it is easy to clean, it works well.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to make sure there aren&#x27;t air bubbles.</li>
            <li>Product leaks out of top.</li>
            <li>The company that ship it was great, the shipping was fast..</li>
            <li>but so far so good!</li>
            <li>The bottom comes off relatively easy, if you try, and that can make loading up more product easier.  </li>
            <li>You need to be careful, carrying it in your pocket like I do probably isn&#x27;t the best option.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a pain to transfer the product into the pump, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the pump, and the convenience of the pump is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to see what you have inside</li>
            <li>They were easy to fill and use.  </li>
            <li>Bottle does not feel or look cheap.</li>
            <li>and it has a cap/cover that snaps in place securely.</li>
            <li>fill almost all of the way full.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It pumped well, filled easily and was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good, too, but for me, it comes down to ease of use, storage and transport.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent pump, but the silver paint on the lid wears off pretty quick, and the cap can crack.</li>
            <li>This bottle is EXACTLY what I was looking for to bring some lotion in my carry-on luggage.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if that extra inch makes all the difference for you, then this option may be the better one.  </li>
            <li>Ingenious vacuum pump design.</li>
            <li>These airless pump bottles work extremely well with my body cream which I chose to use in a more convenient way than the original large tube from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>I got my pump extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I already have plenty of the 1 oz bottles Amazon has for sale, but I still end up using this one for moisturizer (which I don&#x27;t need as much of in my purse as lotion, which I put in the 1 oz bottle).</li>
            <li>It is a rather large bottle compared to how much it stores, but I like this over the pumps with the tube in the middle, so it&#x27;s worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>Easily clean and refill them by unscrewing the top and pushing the plunger back down.</li>
            <li>easy to pump out liquid, I like that it is wide</li>
            <li>and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only about 1 inch shorter than some of the 1 oz airless bottles out there, which of course whole twice as much lotion or whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wish it was more than 0.5 oz, if only because the contents of the bottle can occupy only around half the total size of the whole product.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely being purchasing a few more in the future</li>

            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t worth, tip it upside down, tap on hard surface (to get the air bubbles to the bottom), and take a paperclip to push the bottom up as far as it can go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have had no issues w/ pump failure, though once in a blue moon it squirts product across the bathroom onto the adjacent wall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that when it&#x27;s time to refill them after use, you must push the little round plate down to the bottom of the bottle.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I notice that the  little round plate moves up</li>
            <li> There will be some waste, but it will be quicker and cleaner.</li>
            <li> I got a few of these bottles to transfer some makeup foundation into to save space.  </li>
            <li> The item just did not fit my needs.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is a little thick</li>

            <li> These airless pump bottles work extremely well with my body cream which I chose to use in a more convenient way than the original large tube from the manufacturer.  Works effortlessly every time.  Also will be able to share products with friends in a more hygienic way too.</li>
            <li> I got my pump extremely fast. It was well packaged and arrived safely. It looks better than the picture. Holds a great amount of makeup. Great for blending two foundations to make one color. The pump works flawlessly and the price is unbeatable. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.</li>

            <li> I love this for face creams</li>
            <li> Bottle does not feel or look cheap. Prefect for traveling. I transfer my big bottle lotions &amp; foundation without pumps over to this bottle.</li>
            <li> Awesome bottle. Absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a good size because it is easy to clean, it works well.  Makes it easy to see what you have inside</li>
            <li> easy to pump out liquid, I like that it is wide and it has a cap/cover that snaps in place securely.</li>
            <li> I bought this airless pump bottle because I have some liquid foundation that didn&#x27;t have a pump and this works perfectly for it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. I read a lot online about the proper way to fill it, and had no problems. It is a rather large bottle compared to how much it stores, but I like this over the pumps with the tube in the middle, so it&#x27;s worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1) fill almost all of the way full. You&#x27;ll need to make sure there aren&#x27;t air bubbles. So order the smaller of the sizes that you want to store. Screw the cap on tightly.&lt;br /&gt;2) If it doesn&#x27;t worth, tip it upside down, tap on hard surface (to get the air bubbles to the bottom), and take a paperclip to push the bottom up as far as it can go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It pumped well, filled easily and was a reasonable price. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This worked well for about a month, then broke. I was using it for mineral oil to wash !y face with. Product leaks out of top. I chose to go with a glass bottle with glass dropper instead.</li>
            <li> perfect to use for travel  or sharing</li>
            <li> I use these for foundation and lotions that come in pots. For some it&#x27;s an issue of sanitary vs. unsanitary. That&#x27;s good, too, but for me, it comes down to ease of use, storage and transport. I have had no issues w/ pump failure, though once in a blue moon it squirts product across the bathroom onto the adjacent wall. Not fun, but not a big deal. It&#x27;s kind of a pain to transfer the product into the pump, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the pump, and the convenience of the pump is well worth it. For thinner consistency product I used a funnel. For thicker, it was quicker to use a little cosmetic spatula, but next time I&#x27;ll put it in a baggie, cut a small hole in the corner and pipe it in cake-boss style. There will be some waste, but it will be quicker and cleaner.</li>
            <li> Ordered this airless pump bottle from CosChemSupply and received a make-up brush instead. And now I have to go to the trouble of sending this item back and make sure I get a refund - what a ridiculous waste of time!</li>
            <li> I got a few of these bottles to transfer some makeup foundation into to save space.  They were easy to fill and use.  I notice that the  little round plate moves up and you pump, pushing the product out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that when it&#x27;s time to refill them after use, you must push the little round plate down to the bottom of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am very happy with these bottles.</li>
            <li> This bottle is EXACTLY what I was looking for to bring some lotion in my carry-on luggage.  Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Best travel pump bottles ever. Easily clean and refill them by unscrewing the top and pushing the plunger back down. Works great. No leaks. Ingenious vacuum pump design.</li>
            <li> I use this for fractionated coconut oil.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I just started using this and so far I really like it. I use it for my moisturizer since it came in a tub to avoid betting bacteria from my hands in it. The moisturizer is a little thick so I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t work but so far so good! I get great control with the pump. I will definitely being purchasing a few more in the future</li>
            <li> I just didnt like the item itself.. the company and shipping was great when delivering the items. The item just did not fit my needs. The item itself, i thought would work and just did not work for the way I want to use it. The product itself did not work for my needs. The company that ship it was great, the shipping was fast..</li>
            <li> This airless bottle works as advertised.  The bottom comes off relatively easy, if you try, and that can make loading up more product easier.  However, you could also just use a regular lotion pump to go in through the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was more than 0.5 oz, if only because the contents of the bottle can occupy only around half the total size of the whole product.  It&#x27;s only about 1 inch shorter than some of the 1 oz airless bottles out there, which of course whole twice as much lotion or whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if that extra inch makes all the difference for you, then this option may be the better one.  I already have plenty of the 1 oz bottles Amazon has for sale, but I still end up using this one for moisturizer (which I don&#x27;t need as much of in my purse as lotion, which I put in the 1 oz bottle).</li>
