            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love Aveda!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for people with fine hair that need a light mousse to help control their hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>I use phomollient to keep my hair smooth for straightening, even though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intended to be a straightening product - it works great for that.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s nice, considering the price</li>
            <li>but I am thrilled that I can get it here a bit cheaper and shipped to my house.</li>
            <li>The hold was great and the smell was clean.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a good store product in the stores to match its quality!  ; )</li>
            <li>I was looking for something more organic and liked that it used honey</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Love love love this product!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I found a product that lifts my fine hair!</li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>but it acted more like glue than a mousse in my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the Aveda line of products.</li>
            <li>This is a light foam that isn&#x27;t sticky nor clumpy!  </li>
            <li>I love this product, but use it sparingly, as it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>Love that I can get it on Amazon</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying this product</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love that I can order it on Amazon and not have to find a salon that carries it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>So glad I found on amazon.</li>
            <li>(or maybe I just don&#x27;t have that magic touch), but I don&#x27;t have the money or time or patience to go through so many steps in the morning.</li>
            <li>Love using this in my hair, and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, have used it for years.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love all Aveda products.</li>
            <li>Smells very clean, not sticky, gives me volume and shine, helps with frizz.</li>
            <li>I love the volume and lift it gives my fine hair.</li>
            <li>, I put a couple of pumps into my hair, twist in some fingers curls, and enjoy a cute beach style.  </li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t noted other reviewers mention this problem, best I can tell...</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>I keep that &amp;#34;just washed&amp;#34; freshness in my hair for 3-4 days easily.</li>
            <li>I find this product easy to use.  </li>
            <li>wonderful product makes your hair fuller without weighing it down and gives you lots of body.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair but allot of it.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>It helps my otherwise straight hair to have more volume!</li>
            <li>This is a light mousse that adds some volume to my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>Also, when combing and styling, I would find huge amounts of hair in the comb of my brush.</li>
            <li>However, it leaves my hair kind of dull-looking and sticky, and doesn&#x27;t add much volume.</li>
            <li>It is light and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li>Initially I was in love with this product and could see why people loved it.</li>
            <li>Completely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Works great when my hair is dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big product user, but I thought mousse should be in my hair care arsenal, the price seems good, and I like the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m giving 3 stars for an okay product that doesn&#x27;t add much to my &#x27;do&#x27;, and I think I&#x27;ll look elsewhere when I run out.</li>
            <li>I recently had six inches chopped off and am now wearing my baby fine hair in a Nicole Richie style bob with amazing results.  </li>
            <li>Light as air and lightly scented, this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>Super product for the hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this :)</li>
            <li>I like this product because it&#x27;s really light and does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it is great.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic and it works really well in my hair</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY styling product I use now and am THRILLED with the results.</li>
            <li>I want soft, clean-feeling hair more than I care about volume or style, and this mousse isn&#x27;t doing it for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for its versatility and easy of use.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair, and I wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and arrived on time and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and had been using the volumizing tonic (meh) and smooth infusion for body with mixed results.  </li>
            <li>Have used for many years and have tried others and always go back to Aveda.</li>
            <li>I examined my hair more closely and found chunks of shorter hairs which means that they weren&#x27;t all falling out, the hairs were actually breaking as well.</li>
            <li>This product does just what it&#x27;s says it will do - gives gentle hold, but has no film or stickiness!</li>
            <li>I first bought this product from my salon.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I expect it to do and allows me to style my hair with ease.  </li>
            <li>My local Aveda store just closed, so I was happy to find that I could purchase it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>This, however, makes my hair light, fluffy, full of body, and CLEAN~ for days.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I thought I may have used a bit too much because my hair ended up sticky</li>
            <li>I just let it dry, finger comb it a bit, and I can be out the door without spending more than 5 minutes doing my &#x27;do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used another product that had a large mascara like wand in the tube.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with a Veda&#x27;s pure abundance</li>
            <li>I stopped using this product and soon did not note as much breakage.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the product isn&#x27;t too sticky and didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference with my curls.</li>
            <li>and I can style it curly or straight with this one product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too much for hers.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it arrived to her house fast.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair so need to look for products that will not weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li>Yes I love the way my hair looks when I use it, but it is NOT worth having my hair break off.</li>
            <li>I have used many hair products over the years for my thin, fine hair and this product is the one i will never be without.  </li>
            <li>My hair, which is fine and fairly thin, has never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It is a bit high priced but all of Aveda products are.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and has a slight natural curl.  </li>
            <li>but I use it with an Aveda product that gives it a little more hold.</li>
            <li>, the instructions advise you to use it at the roots and style as normal.  </li>
            <li>To tame frizz, I just put 1/2 a pump in my hand and lightly brush it through my hair with my fingers, followed up by blow drying for a few seconds on warm.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I can live without this product anymore.</li>
            <li>I washed it out and tried again with a dime size drop and the exact same thing happened.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and takes little time in the morning.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s clearly the culprit.</li>
            <li>No heavy weighty goo.</li>
            <li>But this is way overpriced, and since AVEDA only distributes thru their stores and salons, there is NO way to know if this is really AVEDA products in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have natural curl/wave to my hair</li>
            <li>That definitely works, but I really like that I can &#x27;emergency style&#x27; my hair with this if I need to.  </li>
            <li>I have a LOT of FINE hair - and this product gives just enough volume and style-ability to my hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>I have very long (almost to my waist) straight hair with some natural wave.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected to receive</li>
            <li>For a clean, dry or wet look, this stuff just works.</li>
            <li>No other endorsement needed.</li>
            <li>A little high priced but worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done, so the bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Most straightening products are too heavy and weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>and this seems a little better but still feel like it dries my hair out a little.</li>
            <li>After using it on my slightly damp hair daily, about a month later I noticed that more hair was falling out in the shower than usual.</li>
            <li>The result is that a couple pumps of this product scrunched into my hair is all it takes to style it quickly if I&#x27;m running late.  </li>
            <li>I already have fine hair to begin with and this product just made it way worse.</li>

            <li> It does exactly what I expect it to do and allows me to style my hair with ease.  </li>
            <li> My local Aveda store just closed, so I was happy to find that I could purchase it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> This, however, makes my hair light, fluffy, full of body, and CLEAN~ for days.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I thought I may have used a bit too much because my hair ended up sticky</li>
            <li> I just let it dry, finger comb it a bit, and I can be out the door without spending more than 5 minutes doing my &#x27;do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used another product that had a large mascara like wand in the tube.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with a Veda&#x27;s pure abundance</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product and soon did not note as much breakage.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the product isn&#x27;t too sticky and didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference with my curls.</li>
            <li> and I can style it curly or straight with this one product.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too much for hers.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it arrived to her house fast.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair so need to look for products that will not weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> Yes I love the way my hair looks when I use it, but it is NOT worth having my hair break off.</li>
            <li> I have used many hair products over the years for my thin, fine hair and this product is the one i will never be without.  </li>
            <li> My hair, which is fine and fairly thin, has never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It is a bit high priced but all of Aveda products are.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and has a slight natural curl.  </li>
            <li> but I use it with an Aveda product that gives it a little more hold.</li>
            <li> , the instructions advise you to use it at the roots and style as normal.  </li>
            <li> To tame frizz, I just put 1/2 a pump in my hand and lightly brush it through my hair with my fingers, followed up by blow drying for a few seconds on warm.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can live without this product anymore.</li>
            <li> I washed it out and tried again with a dime size drop and the exact same thing happened.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and takes little time in the morning.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s clearly the culprit.</li>
            <li> No heavy weighty goo.</li>
            <li> But this is way overpriced, and since AVEDA only distributes thru their stores and salons, there is NO way to know if this is really AVEDA products in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have natural curl/wave to my hair</li>
            <li> That definitely works, but I really like that I can &#x27;emergency style&#x27; my hair with this if I need to.  </li>
            <li> I have a LOT of FINE hair - and this product gives just enough volume and style-ability to my hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> I have very long (almost to my waist) straight hair with some natural wave.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected to receive</li>
            <li> For a clean, dry or wet look, this stuff just works.</li>
            <li> No other endorsement needed.</li>
            <li> A little high priced but worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done, so the bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Most straightening products are too heavy and weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> and this seems a little better but still feel like it dries my hair out a little.</li>
            <li> After using it on my slightly damp hair daily, about a month later I noticed that more hair was falling out in the shower than usual.</li>
            <li> The result is that a couple pumps of this product scrunched into my hair is all it takes to style it quickly if I&#x27;m running late.  </li>
            <li> I already have fine hair to begin with and this product just made it way worse.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product as it adds thickness to my otherwise very thin and fragile hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thicker when I blow dry it after using the Phomollient and definitely softer!  </li>
            <li> The product was packaged to avoid any potential leakage and I received it in a timely manner, as expected.</li>
            <li> When hair dries, I air dry my hair, so after shaping it I am finished.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I have ever found that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my super-fine hair or make it look greasy.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to wait until my thick, silky, long asian hair grows back to its fullness again.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have time to get it wet.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair also felt thinner (about 1/8 felt missing overall).</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I use 1 pump on my short hair and I look like I have a thick hair now.</li>
            <li> Not sticky, does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down and yet adds bulk</li>
            <li> It gives it a bit of control and volume but without weighing it down or making it sticky.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shinny and not weighted down</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found a product that lifts my fine hair! No heavy weighty goo. I use 1 pump on my short hair and I look like I have a thick hair now. Ive been looking for this for fifty years! Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have used it for over a year every day. It&#x27;s the only hair product that I currently use. I have very fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stick-like or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any hair breakage or loss? I use a very small amount each day and this 6.7 pz bottle lasted over a year. I also have oily hair so maybe that kept the product from drying my hair out?</li>
            <li> I was looking for something more organic and liked that it used honey but it acted more like glue than a mousse in my hair.</li>
            <li> Gives volume to thin hair. Easy to use and you do  not need a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for people with fine hair that need a light mousse to help control their hairstyle.  I have used it for several years and am never dissappointed in it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> I love the Aveda line of products. The Phomollient does a great job of adding body to my hair. This product does not make my hair feel heavy or greasy. It is easy to use and takes little time in the morning. I use the phomollient in the front and the hair tonic at the crown.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this, won&#x27;t use anything else to control his thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product as it adds thickness to my otherwise very thin and fragile hair.  I started to use it regularly as a result, but began to notice my hair breaking...I mean breaking a lot.  One section of my head was really getting bad, and I didn&#x27;t know what to blame...hormone changes, product, or what.  I stopped using this product and soon did not note as much breakage.  I restarted use, and noticed regular breakage again.  Although I haven&#x27;t noted other reviewers mention this problem, best I can tell...this is the culprit for my hair breakage disaster.</li>
            <li> I love this product! But this is way overpriced, and since AVEDA only distributes thru their stores and salons, there is NO way to know if this is really AVEDA products in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the product isn&#x27;t too sticky and didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference with my curls.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair so need to look for products that will not weigh down my hair.  After washing and the towel drying, I use a small amount of this product squeezed onto my hand, I apply it to my hair and then I shape some poofiness and some curls into my with my fingers. When hair dries, I air dry my hair, so after shaping it I am finished.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  I have a LOT of FINE hair - and this product gives just enough volume and style-ability to my hair without weighing it down.  I have natural curl/wave to my hair and I can style it curly or straight with this one product.  If I had to choose one product to use with my hair (besides hairspray) - this would be it!  MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> This is a light foam that isn&#x27;t sticky nor clumpy!  My hair style stays during my work day with this hair care product.  A little high priced but worth it in the long run. I haven&#x27;t found a good store product in the stores to match its quality!  ; )</li>
            <li> I have fine hair but allot of it. This is always my go to for volume! Have used for many years and have tried others and always go back to Aveda. Not sticky, does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this product works wonderfully on it!  Holds my hair style without a heavy feeling.  A regular mouse doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair and when my hairdresser uses mouse I swear she uses half the can and I hate the way my hair feels afterwards!  I run home and redo my hair!  Would recommend this product to anyone.  Completely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but use it sparingly, as it&#x27;s a bit pricey. Love that I can get it on Amazon</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Doesn&#x27;t flake off, doesn&#x27;t mess up your car headrest or come off on a hat.  For a clean, dry or wet look, this stuff just works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 18 months along with the volumizing tonic by Aveda. I won&#x27;t consider changing products! It helps my otherwise straight hair to have more volume!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and had been using the volumizing tonic (meh) and smooth infusion for body with mixed results.  I recently had six inches chopped off and am now wearing my baby fine hair in a Nicole Richie style bob with amazing results.  This is the ONLY styling product I use now and am THRILLED with the results.</li>
            <li> Works great when my hair is dry and I don&#x27;t have time to get it wet.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair, and I wanted to love this product.  The first time I used it, I thought I may have used a bit too much because my hair ended up sticky and I could not brush it.  I washed it out and tried again with a dime size drop and the exact same thing happened.  It took forever to get all the knots out.  Kind of bummed, because otherwise this seemed like a great buy.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it everyday and it is great. It does not weigh my hair down and yet adds bulk and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells very clean, not sticky, gives me volume and shine, helps with frizz. I love Aveda! I&#x27;ve noticed my hair looks healthier now that I use aveda products! I highly recommend this :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the Aveda Phomollient!! I have been using it for a few years now and cannot imagine going without it. I have very long (almost to my waist) straight hair with some natural wave. I use this product as a mousse when I scrunch or curl my hair (followed up by hairspray) and I also use it to tame frizz. To tame frizz, I just put 1/2 a pump in my hand and lightly brush it through my hair with my fingers, followed up by blow drying for a few seconds on warm. Love love love this product! I highly recommend it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0007CXWXI Aveda Phomollient 6.7 Ounces]]</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it&#x27;s great.  My Sister&#x27;s hair is thicker&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s too much for hers.  I put a Keratin spray on first&lt;br /&gt;to keep my hair healthy and then the Phomollient to give me&lt;br /&gt;volume.</li>
            <li> I have used many hair products over the years for my thin, fine hair and this product is the one i will never be without.  It is not sticky and you can still comb through your hair unlike some gels.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something besides the foam mouse on the market and this seems a little better but still feel like it dries my hair out a little.</li>
            <li> Light as air and lightly scented, this stuff really works.  You don&#x27;t even feel it.  Great product!  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for one of my best friends and she loves it! Plus, it arrived to her house fast.</li>
            <li> Initially I was in love with this product and could see why people loved it. The hold was great and the smell was clean. Essentially, heaven in a bottle. That heaven soon turned into hell. After using it on my slightly damp hair daily, about a month later I noticed that more hair was falling out in the shower than usual. Also, when combing and styling, I would find huge amounts of hair in the comb of my brush. I noticed that my hair also felt thinner (about 1/8 felt missing overall). My husband even noticed all the hair that was left in the shower. I examined my hair more closely and found chunks of shorter hairs which means that they weren&#x27;t all falling out, the hairs were actually breaking as well. When I noticed how thin my hair was getting I stopped using the product immediately. As soon as I stopped using it, my hair stopped falling out. The Aveda Phomollient Stying Foam was the only thing that changed in my routine so it&#x27;s clearly the culprit. Another reviewer also commented on how she noticed her hair breaking also. Now I have to wait until my thick, silky, long asian hair grows back to its fullness again. Not happy, Aveda.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this product but I use it with an Aveda product that gives it a little more hold. Both together are terrific.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product for fine hair that needs more height and lift!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years.  The smell is fantastic and it works really well in my hair</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from frizzing.  No other endorsement needed.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a lighter hold or to pump on your comb or wand to get the frizzes to stay with an up-do. I used another product that had a large mascara like wand in the tube. I just saved that and use with this lighter mouse now. It&#x27;s on the expensive end but lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I use phomollient to keep my hair smooth for straightening, even though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intended to be a straightening product - it works great for that.  Most straightening products are too heavy and weigh my hair down.  This product smooths my hair but keeps the body.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It&#x27;s expensive but it last for a long time. It&#x27;s an especially good product for fine hair. It gives body and helps hold your hair in place.</li>
            <li> I really love this product for my hair. It gives it a bit of control and volume but without weighing it down or making it sticky. It is a bit high priced but all of Aveda products are. I love that I can order it on Amazon and not have to find a salon that carries it.</li>
            <li> This product does just what it&#x27;s says it will do - gives gentle hold, but has no film or stickiness!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I first bought this product from my salon. I will recommend to anyone. So glad I found on amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair, which is fine and fairly thin, has never looked or felt better.  I use this in conjunction with a Veda&#x27;s pure abundance and I actually don&#x27;t hate my hair anymore!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years.  It&#x27;s the only thing I have ever found that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my super-fine hair or make it look greasy.  Provides good hold and volume if used before blow drying.</li>
            <li> wonderful product makes your hair fuller without weighing it down and gives you lots of body. Would recommend a great product.</li>
            <li> I like the concept behind Aveda, but I&#x27;m not sure their products work for me. I&#x27;m not a big product user, but I thought mousse should be in my hair care arsenal, the price seems good, and I like the ingredient list. However, it leaves my hair kind of dull-looking and sticky, and doesn&#x27;t add much volume. I realize this could have a lot to do with me not buying the texturing and finishing products and not having the same styling equipment that they used on me in the salon (or maybe I just don&#x27;t have that magic touch), but I don&#x27;t have the money or time or patience to go through so many steps in the morning. I want soft, clean-feeling hair more than I care about volume or style, and this mousse isn&#x27;t doing it for me. So I&#x27;m giving 3 stars for an okay product that doesn&#x27;t add much to my &#x27;do&#x27;, and I think I&#x27;ll look elsewhere when I run out.</li>
            <li> Love using this in my hair, and have used it for years.  A little goes a long way.  The price was right and arrived on time and well packaged.  My hair is thicker when I blow dry it after using the Phomollient and definitely softer!  Aveda makes all good products in my opinion!</li>
            <li> The product works wonderfully but you can buy it for $19 from Aveda ! This is a rip-off, charging nearly double for it.</li>
            <li> Aveda Phomollient was recommended by my hair stylist and I&#x27;ve been using it now for several years. I love the volume and lift it gives my fine hair. It is light and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. My local Aveda store just closed, so I was happy to find that I could purchase it on Amazon.com.  The product was packaged to avoid any potential leakage and I received it in a timely manner, as expected.</li>
            <li> I love this product, have used it for years. Makes my hair shinny and not weighted down</li>
            <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s really light and does exactly what it says it will do.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done, so the bottle will last a long time.  That&#x27;s nice, considering the price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the instructions advise you to use it at the roots and style as normal.  That definitely works, but I really like that I can &#x27;emergency style&#x27; my hair with this if I need to.  My hair is very fine and has a slight natural curl.  I keep it cut shoulder-length and in layers.  The result is that a couple pumps of this product scrunched into my hair is all it takes to style it quickly if I&#x27;m running late.  I just let it dry, finger comb it a bit, and I can be out the door without spending more than 5 minutes doing my &#x27;do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a great product at the beach.  Post swim, I put a couple of pumps into my hair, twist in some fingers curls, and enjoy a cute beach style.  I highly recommend this product for its versatility and easy of use.</li>
            <li> I have unruly, curly hair.  I use this product in conjunction with [[ASIN:B002CMLS8M Aveda  Be Curly Enhancer, 6.7-Ounce Tube]] on a daily basis.  No more crazy random curls going off in some weird direction.  No more frizz.  No more crunchy, wet-looking curls.  Awesome. Just awesome.</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with using product because it seemed to weigh my hair down and make it feel dirty. This, however, makes my hair light, fluffy, full of body, and CLEAN~ for days. I don&#x27;t think I can live without this product anymore. I keep that &amp;#34;just washed&amp;#34; freshness in my hair for 3-4 days easily. I just cant believe it works so well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-ps, I have uncolored, untreated, long, thin hair that tends to be bodyless and slightly oily.</li>
            <li> Works well in my hair.  It is part of my daily hair routine.  I usually buy this at a salon but I am thrilled that I can get it here a bit cheaper and shipped to my house.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected to receive</li>
            <li> Does a great job with styling my hair.</li>
            <li> This product caused my hair to break off!!! I have a short layer of broken hairs all around my head!!!! I already have fine hair to begin with and this product just made it way worse. Yes I love the way my hair looks when I use it, but it is NOT worth having my hair break off. Pass on this product!</li>
            <li> Love this. It makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li> Once again -- another great Aveda product. This is a light mousse that adds some volume to my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Super product for the hair</li>
            <li> I find this product easy to use.  It does exactly what I expect it to do and allows me to style my hair with ease.  I&#x27;m happy I purchased this product and will plan to purchase more when needed!!</li>
            <li> Love all Aveda products. I use this product to mold my relaxed hair for a foe-hawk style since my hair is growing out of a short hair cut. Only gave it 4 stars because it stains towels especially white ones. So i now only use it with towels from the dollar store. Great for any climate weather.</li>
