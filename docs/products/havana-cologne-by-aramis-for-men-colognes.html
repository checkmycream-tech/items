            <li>Nice cologne</li>
            <li>My wife was delighted when I visited the US in 2010 and was able to find Havana for Men on sale again -</li>
            <li>So happy Aramis brought this wonderful men&#x27;s cologne back!</li>
            <li>Good stuff with respectable projection and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This fragrance is neither strong, nor obnoxious!  </li>
            <li>it is Havana that *always* receives the most compliments when I wear it.     </li>
            <li>love the smell, wish they had a stick deodorant available.i will buy more</li>
            <li>I love it for evening wear.</li>
            <li>I love woody, spicy, tobacco-based scents.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is for the grown and sexy.  </li>
            <li>It was taken off the shelves many years ago..  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They deserve better.</li>
            <li>great product super quick delivery</li>
            <li>It is great to find a new favorite at age 61,</li>
            <li>Good for a hot day by the beach with your vest on or summer shirt.</li>
            <li>Think of high end cigar smoke in a popular club on a warm summer night.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Havana since I was 16 and loved it back then and still love it!</li>
            <li>Havana is the most masculine scent ever, while smelling just so damn good.  </li>
            <li>Way to strong smells obnoxious..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fragrance Stays with you for a good while and is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Since most bay rums are really evanescent, if you enjoy the smell of the stuff you HAVE to own this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bold scent for sure.</li>
            <li>Best for Fall or Winter, too heavy for Spring or Summer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about time they made this available again....</li>
            <li>I too am happy that this scent is back in production.  </li>
            <li>a blessing to find it was available again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorites.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always asked myself: Why such a great smelling cologne would be discontinued?&lt;br</li>
            <li>Manly, rich scent with spice and rum accents.  </li>
            <li>Out of all of the colognes I have ever owned: Drakkar Noir, Nautica, Curve, Cool Water, Wings, Fahrenheit, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Dreamer by Versace, Millesime Imperial by Creed, and the original Polo .</li>
            <li>I feel classy AND sophisticated!  </li>
            <li>It is not too sweet or too \\&quot; citrusy\\&quot; - has a unique scent.</li>
            <li>For those who like to leave the house crisp, confident and \\&quot;boldly spiced\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It has it&#x27;s own unique masculine scent.</li>
            <li>But Thursday is special.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to spray on too much to have the desired affect.</li>
            <li>Warm, masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>Smell super and product as described</li>
            <li>My Husband uses it for special occassions - I wish he would use it every day as I love the fragrance on him, has a very masculine smell about it</li>
            <li>She says it smells like the cologne of an older gentleman; I think I smells spicy, fresh, and exotic.</li>
            <li>Bought this years ago when it first came out and loved it back then.</li>
            <li>strong and lasting but not my favorite</li>
            <li>Welcome back old friend!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m thrilled that it&#x27;s back on the market and hopefully will stick around this time!</li>
            <li>The aroma is powerful and assertive, yet sophisticated and classy.  </li>
            <li>Its different than currently trendy fresh scents.</li>
            <li>ok that is direct.</li>
            <li>Really nice and high/ lasting quality</li>
            <li>I have liked the fragrance for years and to get it for a third of the cost elsewhere was &amp;#34;icing on the cake&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that it&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell classy or sophisticated at all.</li>
            <li>Hard to find this one, great scent that lingers and very manly, if the lady wants to share this I don&#x27;t recommend, it&#x27;s very strong..</li>
            <li>Spicy, warm, invigorating, complex, sexy and refined, yet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably have a better sense of Havana in a few more weeks.  </li>
            <li>Lo and behold I searched through Amazon only to find out that it was put back on the market and at a great price.</li>
            <li>so I can buy as many bottles to last me a life time..</li>
            <li>Being down to my last drop of this favorite cologne, it was fantastic to be able to purchase it again..</li>
            <li>It is classic and fun.</li>
            <li>but I believe is the real one .</li>
            <li>The only remaining question is why Aramis has not made it available in Europe</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I enjoy this fragrance, the only problem is: My girlfriend does not.</li>
            <li>I am somewhat of a collector of colognes, and I think this one may very well become my signature scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a heavy, warm scent, so some guys won&#x27;t want to wear this at the office or during the day.</li>
            <li>This is close to the original Havana...not quite the same.</li>
            <li>The citrusy-spicy top end is positively explosive, and the near-eternal drydown of bay rum and tobacco reeks of masculinity -- it&#x27;ll make you grow about ten extra chest hairs per spray.</li>
            <li>At the bar, everyone is enjoying tropical inflected drinks with lots of dark spiced rum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended you to try it and you may find a new companion too!</li>
            <li>Wow, what a delight!  </li>
            <li>Definitely spicy and not a shy aroma.</li>
            <li>This is OLD school.</li>
            <li>I have to say I was still pleasantly surprised when I smelled it.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it.</li>
            <li>It maintains this lush, sultry vibe throughout its progression and into drydown.</li>
            <li>For a few years I was left without my favorite Cologne \\&quot;Havana\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>a nice spice fragrance, but not a great one.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see this offered for $15 when several other vendors were selling the same thing for $45 or more.  </li>
            <li>A bold scent which is long lasting and not over cloying.</li>
            <li>have had many other colognes,,,from expensive shops,, but this one, someohow , women love it.....</li>
            <li>This spray has always been the favourite of my wife (and she wears it more often than I do) and since the original product was discontinued (maybe 10 years ago) we have only managed to find a few bottles for sale - usually in small \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; perfumeries.  </li>
            <li>I had only a little bit of Havana left from a bottle I purchased back in the mid-90s, and I was absolutely delighted to find that it is now once again back on the market!     </li>
            <li>Still have some in the older nicer blue bottle.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s self is slightly spicey but fresh.</li>
            <li>I still had a few drops left in the bottle bought several years ago when, I decided to check and see if it was available again.  </li>
            <li>Other reviewers have done a better job describing the complex notes of Havana.</li>
            <li>It is the only cologne that I got compliments from both guys and ladies, which it is uncommon because Washingtonians (DC) are very cold.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it or head down to your local department store and pick up a sample!</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it or head down to your local department store and pick up a sample!</li>
            <li> Not too long ago the scent popped back into my senses  and</li>
            <li> This negative selling cannot have helped Aramis over the years as they withdrew and then, only relatively recently, reintroduced some of their classic scents like Tuscany.</li>
            <li> ; (I&#x27;m 47 by the way, so I can only assume that by older, they mean the 60+ demographic.)</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Discontinued for a long time.</li>
            <li> The other days of the week I switch off between various colognes.</li>
            <li> This cologne reminds me of a middle lower class man who is in his mid to late 50s who wears an Hawaiian shirt.</li>
            <li> Only a few sprays are needed.</li>
            <li> The spice is sharper and stronger with a bite at the opening but as it dries down the spiciness mellows but stays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife is telling me that is not original</li>
            <li> Ablast from the past, this item has been re-released and just in time.</li>
            <li> I always work hard all week and by Thursday I deserve to treat myself.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think of ocean and sand--the common &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; fragrance notes.</li>

            <li> Aramis gets something of a bad rap.</li>

            <li> My Husband uses it for special occassions - I wish he would use it every day as I love the fragrance on him, has a very masculine smell about it and I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to spray on too much to have the desired affect.</li>
            <li> Aramis, are you listening? PLEASE do not discontinue this fragrance ever again! I had only a little bit of Havana left from a bottle I purchased back in the mid-90s, and I was absolutely delighted to find that it is now once again back on the market!     Out of all of the colognes I have ever owned: Drakkar Noir, Nautica, Curve, Cool Water, Wings, Fahrenheit, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Dreamer by Versace, Millesime Imperial by Creed, and the original Polo . . . it is Havana that *always* receives the most compliments when I wear it.     Thank you Aramis for crafting this wonderful fragrance. Two thumbs, way up!!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original !! 1980&#x27;s Miami Papi chulo evening on South Beach.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Havana since I was 16 and loved it back then and still love it! I never understood why Aramis would discontinue this line but I&#x27;m thrilled that it&#x27;s back on the market and hopefully will stick around this time! The fragrance it&#x27;s self is slightly spicey but fresh. I always get compliments on it since nothing out there on the market spells quiet like Havana. I highly recommend it or head down to your local department store and pick up a sample!</li>
            <li> There is nothing like Havana.  Spicy, warm, invigorating, complex, sexy and refined, yet it has a dirty edge to it.  This cologne is not for the \\&quot;fresh/clean fruity\\&quot; or \\&quot;powdery-sweet vanilla\\&quot; crowd.  Havana is the most masculine scent ever, while smelling just so damn good.  The aroma is powerful and assertive, yet sophisticated and classy.  For those who like to leave the house crisp, confident and \\&quot;boldly spiced\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> a nice spice fragrance, but not a great one.  Good for the fall and winter</li>
            <li> Smell is great and NOT over powering!</li>
            <li> Nice Tobacco...i dont get great projection but love the scent. Its different than currently trendy fresh scents. good longevity though.</li>
            <li> like it, stays with me all day</li>
            <li> My wife is telling me that is not original but I believe is the real one . Smell super and product as described</li>
            <li> Smokey, mellow scent... jost like being in a cigar house...</li>
            <li> This is OLD school. The citrusy-spicy top end is positively explosive, and the near-eternal drydown of bay rum and tobacco reeks of masculinity -- it&#x27;ll make you grow about ten extra chest hairs per spray. Since most bay rums are really evanescent, if you enjoy the smell of the stuff you HAVE to own this.</li>
            <li> This has been my all time favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance Stays with you for a good while and is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is close to the original Havana...not quite the same. However, it is still a lasting fragrance. We both like it!</li>
            <li> ok that is direct. but seriously... this will do it.. .. not a girly smell.......different. manly and real...buy it. you wont be dissapointed.i have had many other colognes,,,from expensive shops,, but this one, someohow , women love it.....get comments all the time....,</li>
            <li> Nice cologne but it causes me to break out in a rash.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a delight!  I have used Tuscany since 1986,  but Havava is THE ONE for me from this point forward.  It is great to find a new favorite at age 61, Hawaiian shirts and all!  I feel classy AND sophisticated!  This fragrance is neither strong, nor obnoxious!  It is perfect!</li>
            <li> i used this years ago then couldn&#x27;t find it. love the smell, wish they had a stick deodorant available.i will buy more</li>
            <li> My wife was delighted when I visited the US in 2010 and was able to find Havana for Men on sale again - only the packaging has changed, the content is still the same.  This spray has always been the favourite of my wife (and she wears it more often than I do) and since the original product was discontinued (maybe 10 years ago) we have only managed to find a few bottles for sale - usually in small \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; perfumeries.  The only remaining question is why Aramis has not made it available in Europe</li>
            <li> Manly, rich scent with spice and rum accents.  Best for Fall or Winter, too heavy for Spring or Summer.  Only a few sprays are needed.</li>
            <li> strong and lasting but not my favorite</li>
            <li> Great buy! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> No problem transaction of pro-packed item as described&amp;#62; 5 stars *****</li>
            <li> I bought  this cologne for my nephew.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this fragrance, the only problem is: My girlfriend does not. She says it smells like the cologne of an older gentleman; I think I smells spicy, fresh, and exotic.</li>
            <li> Really nice and high/ lasting quality</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful cologne. Exceptional. It is a *spicy* tobacco cologne. The spice is sharper and stronger with a bite at the opening but as it dries down the spiciness mellows but stays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see this offered for $15 when several other vendors were selling the same thing for $45 or more.  But when I got it, it was the actual Havana cologne.  I have liked the fragrance for years and to get it for a third of the cost elsewhere was &amp;#34;icing on the cake&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> was disappointed with this product.....the fragrance didn&#x27;t last as does the regular Aramis...... I would not purchase this product again.....</li>
            <li> Havana is a very good cologne.I love it for evening wear. It has it&#x27;s own unique masculine scent. I hope aramis doesn&#x27;t discontinue this cologne again.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this one, great scent that lingers and very manly, if the lady wants to share this I don&#x27;t recommend, it&#x27;s very strong..</li>
            <li> The other days of the week I switch off between various colognes. Monday is my experiment day and Sunday I just let my mood pick what I wear. But Thursday is special. I always work hard all week and by Thursday I deserve to treat myself. That&#x27;s Havana. I&#x27;m thrilled that it&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> I love woody, spicy, tobacco-based scents. I blind bought this based on reviews around the internet. I have to say I was still pleasantly surprised when I smelled it. I am somewhat of a collector of colognes, and I think this one may very well become my signature scent. It&#x27;s a heavy, warm scent, so some guys won&#x27;t want to wear this at the office or during the day. Personally, that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I love it.</li>
            <li> bought this sight unseen after the reviews were great...This cologne reminds me of a middle lower class man who is in his mid to late 50s who wears an Hawaiian shirt. Doesn&#x27;t smell classy or sophisticated at all. Way to strong smells obnoxious..</li>
            <li> So happy Aramis brought this wonderful men&#x27;s cologne back! Love it! It is not too sweet or too \\&quot; citrusy\\&quot; - has a unique scent.</li>
            <li> Smells great all day.  This isn&#x27;t for someone that is in the age range of 18-24.  This is for the grown and sexy.  I am 32 and this is a great smell for me.  I would say that I am well versed in the cologne game so take my word for it buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E</li>
            <li> Not for the below 30. A bold scent which is long lasting and not over cloying. Good for a hot day by the beach with your vest on or summer shirt.</li>
            <li> Warm, masculine scent.  Probably best for fall and winter but also a good cologne for nights anytime.  A good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday. The seller was prompt and the bottle was well padded in the box. I&#x27;m still road-testing Havana. It&#x27;s a bold scent for sure. I keep smelling my arm to distinguish all the scents within this mix, and how it changes over time. So far, I like it. Just one spray is all I&#x27;ve needed. Definitely spicy and not a shy aroma. People will notice you as you wear this. Other reviewers have done a better job describing the complex notes of Havana. I can say that to me it smells manly, up front, has a presence about it. I&#x27;ll probably have a better sense of Havana in a few more weeks.  3 months later---I really love Havana! I use it several days a week. One squirt on an arm, the rub them together. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Discontinued for a long time. Still have some in the older nicer blue bottle. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This scent will get you laid..  It&#x27;s about time they made this available again.... It was taken off the shelves many years ago..  Hail to its return!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this years ago when it first came out and loved it back then. Not too long ago the scent popped back into my senses  and Havana immediately came to mind. Lo and behold I searched through Amazon only to find out that it was put back on the market and at a great price. Welcome back old friend!</li>
            <li> Havana is not what it used to be.  The scent changed within the last seven years, as has the packaging.</li>
            <li> I too am happy that this scent is back in production.  I still had a few drops left in the bottle bought several years ago when, I decided to check and see if it was available again.  What a surprise!</li>
            <li> One of the bedtime Cologne ever. It is classic and fun. It is the only cologne that I got compliments from both guys and ladies, which it is uncommon because Washingtonians (DC) are very cold.</li>
            <li> Aramis gets something of a bad rap. In visiting my local Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom&#x27;s and inquiring about the Aramis line, the salesperson invariably steered me away, telling me that Aramis scents are for &amp;#34;older men&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m 47 by the way, so I can only assume that by older, they mean the 60+ demographic.) I can understand why they might say this; Aramis had its heyday in the 70s with its eponymous fragrance, well known as being a powerhouse. This negative selling cannot have helped Aramis over the years as they withdrew and then, only relatively recently, reintroduced some of their classic scents like Tuscany. and Devin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They deserve better. With Havana, you get a boozy island party in a bottle. Don&#x27;t think of ocean and sand--the common &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; fragrance notes. Havana reflects its time, an age where people smoked and were proud of it too. Think of high end cigar smoke in a popular club on a warm summer night. At the bar, everyone is enjoying tropical inflected drinks with lots of dark spiced rum. It maintains this lush, sultry vibe throughout its progression and into drydown. The smoky feeling dominates start to finish overlaying the riot of notes at the start and blending together the leather, cedar, and so on in the drydown. Good stuff with respectable projection and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great buy at this price.</li>
            <li> great product super quick delivery</li>
            <li> Ablast from the past, this item has been re-released and just in time. Being down to my last drop of this favorite cologne, it was fantastic to be able to purchase it again..</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a blessing to find it was available again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended you to try it and you may find a new companion too!</li>
            <li> For a few years I was left without my favorite Cologne \\&quot;Havana\\&quot;. This morning I googled: \\&quot;Which cologne smells like Havana from Aramis\\&quot; and to my surprise I found out that Havana was back in the Market. I always asked myself: Why such a great smelling cologne would be discontinued?&lt;br /&gt;ARAMIS, Don&#x27;t do this again, and if you ever decide to do it, write a note in advance so I can buy as many bottles to last me a life time..&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for giving us Havana again...</li>
