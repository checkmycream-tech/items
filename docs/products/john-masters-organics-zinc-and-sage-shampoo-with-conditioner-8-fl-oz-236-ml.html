            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>They were raving about how wonderful the Blood Orange and Vanilla Body Milk was (and it is!)</li>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>This has a really awesome smell, but it&#x27;s too drying for me to use as a conditioner and shampoo in one--</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I was know very good</li>
            <li>good stuff!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, and smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It smells good emough to eat!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>My hair feels fuller and looks great.</li>
            <li>On in between days, I tend to lean toward the evening promrose shampoo and Lavendar and Avocado conditioner, which maintain my shiny, happy hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells great, cleans well, and replaces conditioner so you just need 1 product.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and non toxic!</li>
            <li>And as a bonus, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Also, I love the smell; delightful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that it was a good shampoo</li>
            <li>Possibly good for shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Feels good on my scalp too.</li>
            <li>All John Masters products are superior.</li>
            <li>This product smells outrageously good, and that lasts days for me after a wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprising that it has conditioner in it..</li>
            <li>Smells soooooo good and moisturizes my scalp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, no doubt, but it is what it is, and isn&#x27;t the comfort of knowing your hair and scalp is being treated with the best worth it?  </li>
            <li>Found out that they have been winning some prestigious awards year after year after year!</li>
            <li>I really liked everything else about this product.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice.</li>
            <li>Nice idea</li>
            <li>Has not been effective in controlling dandruff</li>
            <li>I liked the shampoo and the nice smell</li>
            <li>so I looked into the brand and liked that it was organic.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful aroma the whole time you&#x27;re using it.  </li>
            <li>Nice shampoo.  </li>
            <li>IT DOES HAVE A NICE SMELL</li>
            <li>all right, this sampoo is very good.</li>
            <li>This product smells good, but more importantly, it stops the itchiness of my scalp!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!  </li>
            <li>Both are outstanding products.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I will probably never use another shampoo ever again because it&#x27;s so fantastic!</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>love the smell.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love to have it also for your hair.</li>
            <li>I love this products since my hairstylist uses this product in his store.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through dozens of different hair brands, and this is hands-down the best.</li>
            <li>But probably better than just shampoo by itself.</li>
            <li>With Free Shipping!</li>
            <li>This is ok.</li>
            <li>This is much better than I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I also love the safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>I wish we had more options like this, and that healthy hair care was more affordable.</li>
            <li>Having discovered this, I shampoo, and leave in for 10-15 minutes to let the ingredients do their magic, then rinse.  </li>
            <li>, however, I think I&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>All certified organic products are interesting to me.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>So glad  to find  product  here.</li>
            <li>I know that others love the scent of this shampoo</li>
            <li>Makes hair feel very clean and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair full of body, no greasy but conditioned nicely.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working great.  </li>
            <li>So I searched for the best prices along with free shipping (Hawaii can be killer) and ordered this along with 8 other of his products for under 180!</li>
            <li>Smells awesome but will not clean my hair.</li>
            <li>I have trouble with fungal, and this works great!</li>
            <li>I am definitely not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Leaves scalp and hair clean.  </li>
            <li>I adore how clean this shampoo and conditioner in one makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s reassuring to know we&#x27;re washing our hair with a natural product that doesn&#x27;t have any of the harmful chemicals, and it smells amazing too (like a combination of vanilla and coconut).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, I expected it to be more conditioning than it is, but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I found this stuff to smell sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny, full of body, and frizz-free.</li>
            <li>It almost smells like a kid shampoo, as it is sweet and cakey smelling.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side, and the reasons for one star, I liked the organic ingredients, thought it lathered fine, and my hair was soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Did nothing to alleviate, but luckily I found an addition to my no-poo recipe that helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it might help if you have some *mild* itching, I would not recommend if you have persistent dandruff problems or scaly patches.</li>
            <li>It concerned me since my hair is long, has some mild damage from coloring and tends to get knotty if I don&#x27;t use a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>Hands down our favorite shampoo (husband and kid love it too!)</li>
            <li>It smelled pretty good which was its only perk.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore the smell of this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to dye more frequently after using this product.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are safe and natural, it smells amazing, it foams easily to lather all my hair with just a little product, and the zinc soothes my scalp while still softening and cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>I have squeaky clean, super high volume hair now.</li>
            <li>The more I used it, the more my hair would feel greasy and weighed down like it wasn&#x27;t cleansing.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I loved this shampoo when I received a sample at Whole Foods so being the thrifty person that I am I decided to order the full bottle on Amazon instead of paying WF excessive price.  </li>
            <li>I let  myself use the entire bottle before I reviewed, and I&#x27;m still pleased.</li>
            <li>I have tried many shampoos with organic ingredients and my hair becomes greasy or too frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li>I always follow with the Honey and Hibsicus treatment to make my colored hair super shiny and baby soft.  </li>
            <li>Still need conditional though or hair will be dry and static.</li>
            <li>it is just &#x27;ok&#x27; not worth the price - there are lots of better shampoos that are a third of the price</li>
            <li>It seems to smell like the sample I liked  but not quite as good--almost like its been diluted a little.  </li>
            <li>is much gentler.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It did NOT help at all, and does not even work as well as the Trader Joes Tea Tree Shampoo, which is just as organic and much much cheaper.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>It also tames my frizz very well.</li>
            <li>I think they have bigger bottles available at sears</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not going through it fast.</li>
            <li>Fresh out of the bottle, the nose is overwhelming - intensely sweet and cloying with very heavy notes of coconut that completely overpower the sage and lavender that I was looking forward to.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t have more shine or volume, it works like any other shampoo in my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am giving it two stars instead of one because my dandruff and itching might be more severe than other people to begin with.</li>
            <li>In case you&#x27;re wondering, this one does not have that lovely herbal smell that the other John Masters Shampoos and Conditioners have.</li>
            <li>The scent of this is fantastic, but I have very long hair and the conditioning element</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I like that JM uses high quality ingredients and no chemicals.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s high cost</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a little over a month now, and am in love with the results.</li>
            <li>Normally, I have to use some sort of heat treatment on it to get it to &#x27;behave&#x27; and have any sort of softness.</li>
            <li>Recommended by the food babe because it is all natural, but the conditioning agent is nothing to get excited about and it leave my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair type is fine and slightly wavy.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>First  used it  white dog sitting  for friends.</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself looks really rich and shimmery, a dark amber color.</li>
            <li>my hair is so soft it hasn&#x27;t felt like this since i was a child.  </li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair unbelievably soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make the hair as soft as if you used a separate conditioner.</li>
            <li>Tried this last night and the smell was really just heavenly.</li>
            <li>And my hair, wow, has never looked this wonderfully natural.</li>
            <li>This is a shampoo with conditioner, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel soft after it rinses out.</li>
            <li>So far so good..been using for about two weeks.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s no fluke; every single time I&#x27;ve washed with it, the results have been consistent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently purchased a different organic/ all natural shampoo for more than half the price.</li>
            <li>My husband and kid use the shampoo without a conditioner afterwards, and their hair is silky and soft; I tend to favor a conditioner or treatment after shampooing simply because I have super long hair that&#x27;s on the dry side.  </li>
            <li>Great organic shampoo, too bad</li>
            <li>I can barely brush my hair after.</li>
            <li>While this might be appealing to some, I found it really annoying as I would much prefer a floral smell or something less pungent as it was quite overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>This product does not condition your hair and left my scalp very irritated and dry</li>
            <li>- I haven&#x27;t found another product as high quality and searching endless bottles for parabans can be tiring.</li>
            <li>I have thick, but fine hair that tends to frizz and be quite dry.</li>

            <li> It also tames my frizz very well.</li>
            <li> I think they have bigger bottles available at sears</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not going through it fast.</li>
            <li> Fresh out of the bottle, the nose is overwhelming - intensely sweet and cloying with very heavy notes of coconut that completely overpower the sage and lavender that I was looking forward to.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t have more shine or volume, it works like any other shampoo in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am giving it two stars instead of one because my dandruff and itching might be more severe than other people to begin with.</li>
            <li> In case you&#x27;re wondering, this one does not have that lovely herbal smell that the other John Masters Shampoos and Conditioners have.</li>
            <li> The scent of this is fantastic, but I have very long hair and the conditioning element</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I like that JM uses high quality ingredients and no chemicals.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s high cost</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a little over a month now, and am in love with the results.</li>
            <li> Normally, I have to use some sort of heat treatment on it to get it to &#x27;behave&#x27; and have any sort of softness.</li>
            <li> Recommended by the food babe because it is all natural, but the conditioning agent is nothing to get excited about and it leave my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair type is fine and slightly wavy.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> First  used it  white dog sitting  for friends.</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself looks really rich and shimmery, a dark amber color.</li>
            <li> my hair is so soft it hasn&#x27;t felt like this since i was a child.  </li>
            <li> but I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair unbelievably soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the hair as soft as if you used a separate conditioner.</li>
            <li> Tried this last night and the smell was really just heavenly.</li>
            <li> And my hair, wow, has never looked this wonderfully natural.</li>
            <li> This is a shampoo with conditioner, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel soft after it rinses out.</li>
            <li> So far so good..been using for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s no fluke; every single time I&#x27;ve washed with it, the results have been consistent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased a different organic/ all natural shampoo for more than half the price.</li>
            <li> My husband and kid use the shampoo without a conditioner afterwards, and their hair is silky and soft; I tend to favor a conditioner or treatment after shampooing simply because I have super long hair that&#x27;s on the dry side.  </li>
            <li> Great organic shampoo, too bad</li>
            <li> I can barely brush my hair after.</li>
            <li> While this might be appealing to some, I found it really annoying as I would much prefer a floral smell or something less pungent as it was quite overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> This product does not condition your hair and left my scalp very irritated and dry</li>
            <li> - I haven&#x27;t found another product as high quality and searching endless bottles for parabans can be tiring.</li>
            <li> I have thick, but fine hair that tends to frizz and be quite dry.</li>
            <li> After my visit today to my regular stylist, she said my hair was falling out and becoming dry and thin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of the product as it didn&#x27;t last that long in my shower.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to odd smells and chemicals and like the smell of product as well.</li>
            <li> it leaves the hair so dry (and I have combination hair.)</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so thick, I sometimes have a hard time rinsing my hair, but this product rinsed out with minimal effort and rinsed clean.</li>
            <li> i have very dry hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Only possibly negative thing to note, if you have hair that tends to frizz, I&#x27;d definitely pair this product with an after shampoo frizz-ease type product.</li>
            <li> It dried out my scalp even though I only used a dime size amount.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair with no shine, no body, and limp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few daily luxuries we indulge in!</li>
            <li> Still have it months later, even though it was a small bottle, because I stopped using it all together.</li>
            <li> As for it blowing other shampoos out of the water because celebrity stylists use it on their clients &amp; it has that fancy organic word on it...</li>
            <li> Plus, I am accustomed to other organic products which are not overpowering in terms of scents.</li>
            <li> I also use JMO&#x27;S Green Tea &amp; Calendula Conditioning Spray afterwards on my hair while it&#x27;s damp, and then let it air dry.</li>
            <li> which was funny because my hair still felt dirty and oily after using it and allowing hair to dry.</li>
            <li> Probably not worth the money$,</li>
            <li> When am I going to learn that a pill will not get rid of belly fat even if you&#x27;re a size 10, that no cream will get rid of 80 year old wrinkles and that a $22.00 zinc and sage shampoo will not magically produce thick, lustrous hair.  </li>
            <li> but every day using sampoo capacity is so little.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that such a well-reputed brand smell likes cheap cotton candy and makes me scalp feel itchier than the day before I shampooed.</li>
            <li> The smell is intoxicating, like a really natural, almost carmel-y vanilla (which is weird, because it&#x27;s supposed to smell like sage??</li>
            <li> made my hair feel like straw and dried my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have received it a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I thought about rewashing with another shampoo, but then decided to see if the odor diminished when my hair dried.  </li>
            <li> did nothing to rid my hair of tangles and offered very little conditioning.</li>
            <li> Very harsh for hair.</li>
            <li> but I would not recommend for thick hair</li>
            <li> So I have somewhat oily, colored, extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li> Though it is expensive, I find myself needing to use less than it&#x27;s cheaper counterparts</li>
            <li> When I have my hair colored, I get a serious case of the itchies.  </li>
            <li> I have smelled the open bottle a few times since I used it just to see if it was an isolated incident, but I still hated it.</li>
            <li> Works on my daughters thin hair</li>
            <li> I thought that this shampoo could not also condition my hair too, but I was wrong, no conditioner needed!</li>
            <li> If anyone is also disappointed with this product, I&#x27;d recommend Jason Organics Dandruff Relief instead of this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> good stuff! I have trouble with fungal, and this works great!</li>
            <li> This product does not condition your hair and left my scalp very irritated and dry which was funny because my hair still felt dirty and oily after using it and allowing hair to dry. Still have it months later, even though it was a small bottle, because I stopped using it all together. It smelled pretty good which was its only perk.</li>
            <li> Whenever I showered and used this shampoo it would smell like cotton candy and baked goods.  While this might be appealing to some, I found it really annoying as I would much prefer a floral smell or something less pungent as it was quite overwhelming.  Can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of the product as it didn&#x27;t last that long in my shower.</li>
            <li> i use the zinc and sage shampoo and blonde color conditioner.  my hair is so soft it hasn&#x27;t felt like this since i was a child.  i have very dry hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Bought to assist with itchy scalp/dandruff issues I had while no-poo. Did nothing to alleviate, but luckily I found an addition to my no-poo recipe that helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it was a good shampoo</li>
            <li> The scent of this is fantastic, but I have very long hair and the conditioning element did nothing to rid my hair of tangles and offered very little conditioning. Possibly good for shorter hair. I wish it worked. I really liked everything else about this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I expected it to be more conditioning than it is, but it&#x27;s not horrible. The smell is nice. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again though.</li>
            <li> Does not cause skin dryness or irritation.  Leaves scalp and hair clean.  Best shampoo that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Nice idea but I have sensitive skin.  It dried out my scalp even though I only used a dime size amount.  Their evening primrose shampoo followed by their avacado conditioner is much gentler.  Both are outstanding products.  I recommend those 2 products, regardless of price or convenience.</li>
            <li> I was know very good famous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; all right, this sampoo is very good. but every day using sampoo capacity is so little.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore the smell of this stuff!! That is why I have it 5 stars. As for it blowing other shampoos out of the water because celebrity stylists use it on their clients &amp; it has that fancy organic word on it... meh I guess it&#x27;s good. My hair doesn&#x27;t have more shine or volume, it works like any other shampoo in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo. I will probably never use another shampoo ever again because it&#x27;s so fantastic! The ingredients are safe and natural, it smells amazing, it foams easily to lather all my hair with just a little product, and the zinc soothes my scalp while still softening and cleaning my hair. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> this is the best shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li> Just ok. Has not been effective in controlling dandruff</li>
            <li> Great product! Helps to control oil if you have oily hair. Makes hair feel very clean and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
            <li> While it might help if you have some *mild* itching, I would not recommend if you have persistent dandruff problems or scaly patches. It did NOT help at all, and does not even work as well as the Trader Joes Tea Tree Shampoo, which is just as organic and much much cheaper. Plus, I am accustomed to other organic products which are not overpowering in terms of scents. I have to say, I found this stuff to smell sickeningly sweet. I am very disappointed that such a well-reputed brand smell likes cheap cotton candy and makes me scalp feel itchier than the day before I shampooed. I am giving it two stars instead of one because my dandruff and itching might be more severe than other people to begin with. If anyone is also disappointed with this product, I&#x27;d recommend Jason Organics Dandruff Relief instead of this.</li>
            <li> Because I have a another stock shampoo, I can&#x27;t use one.&lt;br /&gt;But I look forward to use this item from now on.</li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this shampoo again. The more I used it, the more my hair would feel greasy and weighed down like it wasn&#x27;t cleansing. I&#x27;ve recently purchased a different organic/ all natural shampoo for more than half the price.</li>
            <li> love the smell.  shipping was fast.  It feels good on my hair.  You&#x27;ll love to have it also for your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this products since my hairstylist uses this product in his store. It makes my hair soft and smooth. I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to replace head and shoulders.  Smells amazing and non toxic!</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes my hair full of body, no greasy but conditioned nicely. I have tried many shampoos with organic ingredients and my hair becomes greasy or too frizzy and dry. Feels good on my scalp too. I am sensitive to odd smells and chemicals and like the smell of product as well. My hair type is fine and slightly wavy. I have organic low lights and it does not strip the color.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome but will not clean my hair. Was hoping it would work for me. Works on my daughters thin hair but I would not recommend for thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a little over a month now, and am in love with the results. I have thick, but fine hair that tends to frizz and be quite dry. This shampoo has done wonders. Normally, I have to use some sort of heat treatment on it to get it to &#x27;behave&#x27; and have any sort of softness. This shampoo makes my hair unbelievably soft and manageable. It also tames my frizz very well. I also use JMO&#x27;S Green Tea &amp; Calendula Conditioning Spray afterwards on my hair while it&#x27;s damp, and then let it air dry. The combination of this shampoo along with the conditioning mist have done wonders for the health of my hair. It&#x27;s shiny, full of body, and frizz-free. I&#x27;ve been through dozens of different hair brands, and this is hands-down the best. And it&#x27;s no fluke; every single time I&#x27;ve washed with it, the results have been consistent. Also, I love the smell; delightful. Definitely recommended product.</li>
            <li> I liked the shampoo and the nice smell</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the hair as soft as if you used a separate conditioner. But probably better than just shampoo by itself. I use this for my kids who don&#x27;t like to have their hair washed - it makes the process shorter - having a shampoo/conditioner combo. And as a bonus, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Wow! Where has this stuff been all my life? I recently stumbled across the name John Masters while reading reviews on lotions. They were raving about how wonderful the Blood Orange and Vanilla Body Milk was (and it is!) so I looked into the brand and liked that it was organic. Found out that they have been winning some prestigious awards year after year after year! So I searched for the best prices along with free shipping (Hawaii can be killer) and ordered this along with 8 other of his products for under 180! With Free Shipping! (I used a code, of course!) Tried this last night and the smell was really just heavenly. The shampoo itself looks really rich and shimmery, a dark amber color. And my hair, wow, has never looked this wonderfully natural. I thought that this shampoo could not also condition my hair too, but I was wrong, no conditioner needed! Great stuff! I think they have bigger bottles available at sears so off I go! Don&#x27;t hesitate to make this purchase, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This has a really awesome smell, but it&#x27;s too drying for me to use as a conditioner and shampoo in one-- I use conditioner afterwards. The smell is intoxicating, like a really natural, almost carmel-y vanilla (which is weird, because it&#x27;s supposed to smell like sage?? didn&#x27;t get that at all). I love that it&#x27;s natural. For me, though, it&#x27;s a shampoo only.</li>
            <li> This is ok. Probably not worth the money$, Recommended by the food babe because it is all natural, but the conditioning agent is nothing to get excited about and it leave my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I adore how clean this shampoo and conditioner in one makes my hair feel.  And it lasts for 2 days!!!  It has a wonderful aroma the whole time you&#x27;re using it.  I highly recommend it.  All John Masters products are superior.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and smells AMAZING! This is much better than I was hoping for. I also love the safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> made my hair feel like straw and dried my scalp.</li>
            <li> When am I going to learn that a pill will not get rid of belly fat even if you&#x27;re a size 10, that no cream will get rid of 80 year old wrinkles and that a $22.00 zinc and sage shampoo will not magically produce thick, lustrous hair.  There&#x27;s one born every minute and it was my turn to be taken in again.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try an organic shampoo, hoping it would be healthier for my hair. It left my hair with no shine, no body, and limp. After my visit today to my regular stylist, she said my hair was falling out and becoming dry and thin. Now I am stuck with a shampoo/conditioner that I will never use. Will try to get a refund.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is a shampoo with conditioner, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel soft after it rinses out. Rather, it feels kinda like straw. It concerned me since my hair is long, has some mild damage from coloring and tends to get knotty if I don&#x27;t use a good conditioner. I use a leave-in conditioner after using the JM product and I&#x27;ve had no problems with knots or tangles. My hair feels softer and stronger. This product smells outrageously good, and that lasts days for me after a wash. I like that JM uses high quality ingredients and no chemicals. That&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;ve splurged on it&#x27;s high cost - I haven&#x27;t found another product as high quality and searching endless bottles for parabans can be tiring. Though it is expensive, I find myself needing to use less than it&#x27;s cheaper counterparts so I&#x27;m not going through it fast. I wish we had more options like this, and that healthy hair care was more affordable.</li>
            <li> Hands down our favorite shampoo (husband and kid love it too!), it&#x27;s reassuring to know we&#x27;re washing our hair with a natural product that doesn&#x27;t have any of the harmful chemicals, and it smells amazing too (like a combination of vanilla and coconut).  My husband and kid use the shampoo without a conditioner afterwards, and their hair is silky and soft; I tend to favor a conditioner or treatment after shampooing simply because I have super long hair that&#x27;s on the dry side.  It&#x27;s pricey, no doubt, but it is what it is, and isn&#x27;t the comfort of knowing your hair and scalp is being treated with the best worth it?  It&#x27;s one of the few daily luxuries we indulge in!</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working great.  Time will tell.  My hair feels fuller and looks great.</li>
            <li> Very harsh for hair. I can barely brush my hair after. It&#x27;s surprising that it has conditioner in it..</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo when I received a sample at Whole Foods so being the thrifty person that I am I decided to order the full bottle on Amazon instead of paying WF excessive price.  It seems to smell like the sample I liked  but not quite as good--almost like its been diluted a little.  But I still like it.</li>
            <li> it is just &#x27;ok&#x27; not worth the price - there are lots of better shampoos that are a third of the price</li>
            <li> So I have somewhat oily, colored, extremely thick hair. I have NEVER been into using a 2in1 product before and purchased this after reading the reviews. I am definitely not disappointed. I let  myself use the entire bottle before I reviewed, and I&#x27;m still pleased. I have squeaky clean, super high volume hair now. I see a lot of color rinse out when using this product, but strangely enough, I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my hair color. I haven&#x27;t had to dye more frequently after using this product. Because my hair is so thick, I sometimes have a hard time rinsing my hair, but this product rinsed out with minimal effort and rinsed clean. There wasnt any residue and I don&#x27;t have any flaky build up. Only possibly negative thing to note, if you have hair that tends to frizz, I&#x27;d definitely pair this product with an after shampoo frizz-ease type product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!  When I have my hair colored, I get a serious case of the itchies.  Having discovered this, I shampoo, and leave in for 10-15 minutes to let the ingredients do their magic, then rinse.  I always follow with the Honey and Hibsicus treatment to make my colored hair super shiny and baby soft.  On in between days, I tend to lean toward the evening promrose shampoo and Lavendar and Avocado conditioner, which maintain my shiny, happy hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh!  In case you&#x27;re wondering, this one does not have that lovely herbal smell that the other John Masters Shampoos and Conditioners have. It almost smells like a kid shampoo, as it is sweet and cakey smelling.  Like vanilla, butter, and something else unidentifiable. It smells good emough to eat!</li>
            <li> Smells soooooo good and moisturizes my scalp.  I do need a conditioner after I use it though.</li>
            <li> Great organic shampoo, too bad it leaves the hair so dry (and I have combination hair.)</li>
            <li> I had itchy scalp and tried various shampoos. This product smells good, but more importantly, it stops the itchiness of my scalp!</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo.  Just not....thrilling.</li>
            <li> Smells great, cleans well, and replaces conditioner so you just need 1 product.</li>
            <li> IT DOES HAVE A NICE SMELL BUT I DID NOT OBSERVE ANY CONDITIONER EFFECT. SO I HAVE TO USE ANOTHER CONDITIONER WHEN I USE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I have received it a few weeks ago. I actually haven&#x27;t used it yet, however, I think I&#x27;ll love it. All certified organic products are interesting to me.</li>
            <li> Love this product. First  used it  white dog sitting  for friends. So glad  to find  product  here.</li>
            <li> So far so good..been using for about two weeks. Still need conditional though or hair will be dry and static.</li>
            <li> I know that others love the scent of this shampoo but I found it intolerable.  Fresh out of the bottle, the nose is overwhelming - intensely sweet and cloying with very heavy notes of coconut that completely overpower the sage and lavender that I was looking forward to.  It finishes with a whiff of eau de cat pee, possibly from the zinc.  I thought about rewashing with another shampoo, but then decided to see if the odor diminished when my hair dried.  It didn&#x27;t.  My pillowcase reeks too and I am hoping that I won&#x27;t have to wash the pillow as well.  On the positive side, and the reasons for one star, I liked the organic ingredients, thought it lathered fine, and my hair was soft afterwards.  I have smelled the open bottle a few times since I used it just to see if it was an isolated incident, but I still hated it.</li>
