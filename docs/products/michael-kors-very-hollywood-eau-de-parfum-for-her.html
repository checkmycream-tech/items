            <li>I love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>bottle is empty, it just smells too wonderful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this version is as good as the original bottle I bought from Sephora when this scent first came out.</li>
            <li>Very Hollywood is all that and so much more!  </li>
            <li>from reading all the reviews I thought this would be a light sent</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and the packaging is to die for, and the price was amazing.</li>
            <li>it is a light flower smell and a fresh smell.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now, while I love the smell of it, it seems that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last more than hour or so.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a soft, sexy fragrance.  </li>
            <li>~ it is better than many other perfumes...</li>

            <li>Now I cant use as a gift because I have no way to properly give it with a box to keep it secure.</li>
            <li>I suspect this is a knock off  (very well mind you)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very soft on the nose.</li>
            <li>but really its not smell like white diamond.</li>
            <li>Perfume is different for everyone, it is up to ones preference, but this is a nice subtle perfume that is not musky or over powering.</li>
            <li>This perfume is light and has a small hint of honeysuckle in it.  </li>
            <li>I was a Sweet Desires by Realities fan but its not available anymore.</li>

            <li> Very dissatistfied with this purchase. Thought it would be a great gift to buy my mother for christmas. When I recieved the perfume it came with a very random pouch that was unnecessary. Now I cant use as a gift because I have no way to properly give it with a box to keep it secure. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells great arrived on time .</li>
            <li> I just love the smell of this fragrance and im going to purchase more along with some of Michael kors fragrance.....</li>
            <li> Smells very good.  Received many compliments.  Will have to repurchase when this bottle goes empty.  Great purchase, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Arrived in time as described. Good product.</li>
            <li> the smell!! however does not last very long :( i wear it to work its perfect because, I work in medical field. the perfume is not strong at all and does not affect patients. I really do love it just wish scent lasted longer</li>

            <li> I love this. I wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued.</li>
            <li> ONE OF MY NEW FAVORITES!!! VERY EXCITED TO GIVE THIS AS A GIFT! WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE THIS AGAIN AND PROBABLY MORE!</li>
            <li> I smelled a sample at a store and sprayed it on my wrists, and I could not get it out of my mind! I had to buy it. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last long at all, but I will definitely be buying more when my 1oz. bottle is empty, it just smells too wonderful.</li>
            <li> i got this for my mom she was so happy i guesss then she got mad but still it was cool</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this version is as good as the original bottle I bought from Sephora when this scent first came out. I suspect this is a knock off  (very well mind you) but it is missing &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; in addition the scent does not last as long as when I first bought it from Sephora. Buy with caution.</li>
            <li> This perfume is light and has a small hint of honeysuckle in it.  It&#x27;s springy and great for the summer.  I have had 2 bottles of it now and love it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift requested by my daughter. She let me smell it though and I also think it is very nice.</li>
            <li> This is a very fine fragrance that lingers and it&#x27;s very soft on the nose. Shipping was super fast and the packaging is to die for, and the price was amazing. This is for the grown and sexy!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a soft, sexy fragrance.  I found it!!! Very Hollywood is all that and so much more!  I love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I was a Sweet Desires by Realities fan but its not available anymore. This is a wonderful replacement.</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff. Perfume is different for everyone, it is up to ones preference, but this is a nice subtle perfume that is not musky or over powering.</li>
            <li> Light and lovely, this perfume was just perfect.  I especially loved the bottle.  Too bad they decided to discontinue it.</li>
            <li> Did not like this fragrance at all. from reading all the reviews I thought this would be a light sent but really its not smell like white diamond.</li>
            <li> Shipped expediently!  Great quality for the price you pay!  Wish this scent was not discontinued ~ it is better than many other perfumes...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now, while I love the smell of it, it seems that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last more than hour or so. No sure if it&#x27;s designed  this way or what but I have to respray 3 to 4 times to keep the smell. I still like it.</li>
