            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is perfect combo, easy on,good hold.</li>
            <li>Best matte clay hair product out there - is like the old Bumble and Bumble matte clay before they changed it - wonderful product</li>
            <li>I have had every clay made in an attempt to find one that has good hold with a.matte finish.</li>
            <li>good smell holds well even in humidity</li>
            <li>It is great because it does add the volume he likes and it holds a nice texture.</li>
            <li>Good holding power.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a pretty neutral scent that is not too overbearing, which is perfect for men.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I love this product....</li>
            <li>nice stuff light but</li>
            <li>Will order again for sure.</li>
            <li>Better than gel</li>
            <li>Finish is mostly matte.</li>
            <li>Osmo has its own unique scent.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>I suggest the makers do a value pack for those who use it on a daily basis, Otherwise, great product.</li>
            <li>Great for short hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great value since it lasts forever.</li>
            <li>it dries-- great for a &amp;#34;beach look&amp;#34;, but not if you want a clean, dry look.</li>
            <li>Great product my boyfriend  loves and also don&#x27;t give the wet Look</li>
            <li>AND MAKES IT LOOK COOL</li>
            <li>and  I love the way Osmo Clay Wax styles without hardening too much or flaking.</li>
            <li>Good for my hair, the effect last like 5 hours</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>Great lasting hold for the spiky messed up look, doesn&#x27;t make your hair super shiny and If you don&#x27;t take a shower it can easily last two days.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable</li>
            <li>American Crew Fiber is much better for controlling hair.</li>
            <li>I am moderately happy with this, I have thick hair and need something to hold my front \\&quot;up\\&quot; style.</li>
            <li>Great for styling short hair, though you have to dry your hair first.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than a store</li>
            <li>So, the speed at which it runs out will really depend on how much you THINK you should use for the amount of hair you have.</li>
            <li>Made it very piecey and defined lines.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>If you are expecting Osmo to smell fruity or rosy or any other kind of delightful scent, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li>This does a decent job.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I love Osmo&#x27;s hard fibre wax; this is ok, but it&#x27;s still a little tacky when</li>
            <li>, this stuff is pretty tacky prior to application.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It stands up on its own (with the help of a blow dryer) and never looks like I have product in it, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Been using it for years and so far haven&#x27;t developed hairless...</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and natural when I use it and really holds it in place and also allows me to do different styles with ease.</li>
            <li>my hairdresser used something similar in her shop, with my new short style</li>
            <li>I have noticed that after I soften it up on my fingertips and begin applying it to my hair, it tends to clump a little bit in the first couple of places</li>

            <li> Smell is mostly neutral, which is a plus considering many other products I&#x27;ve tried have awful stenches.</li>
            <li> The seller was great, but the wax was not a good replacement for the Dirty Trix by Matrics</li>
            <li> Total control without a wet look.</li>
            <li> A good amount of hold without any annoying product clumping.</li>
            <li> Although, I did read other reviewers stating that it left your hair with a dry look (like you would expect from a clay product), but I have not had that result.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lasts a very long time and is quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use less than you think you would normally need just to add a little bit of control.</li>
            <li> I use just a little daily and it keeps my hair in place all day long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product was what I expected</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t flake like some other products.</li>

            <li> Smelled really odd.</li>
            <li> Thankful they ran out or I would have never tried this product for half price.</li>
            <li> However, as my hear gets longer, it becomes less reliable at an exponential rate.  </li>
            <li> I have short, dense, and thick hair, so I need very little of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few years now</li>
            <li> Quality clay wax, holds well &amp; if you do not go heavy with it it does not make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and this product holds my hair and isn&#x27;t stiff.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it matters, but my hair is dark and fairly thick.</li>
            <li> The downside, and the reason I do not give 5 stars, is that I find the clay a little expensive  for a hair product that is 3 ounces!</li>
            <li> The price was too expensive, I thought.</li>
            <li> The ones with hold are impossible to break down [ crude clay).</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells bad</li>

            <li> I love this product.... I&#x27;ve used it for a few years now and it&#x27;s perfect to give a lift without any greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have had every clay made in an attempt to find one that has good hold with a.matte finish. The ones with hold are impossible to break down [ crude clay). This is perfect combo, easy on,good hold. No shine</li>
            <li> Works well and does not leave a sticky film on my hands.  I simply just wipe my hands with my towel and its gone.</li>
            <li> I use just a little daily and it keeps my hair in place all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a very long time and is quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People ask me what I use in my hair daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stands up on its own (with the help of a blow dryer) and never looks like I have product in it, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> nice stuff light but good smell holds well even in humidity</li>
            <li> This is the only product my boyfriend has found to hold his &amp;#34;messy-modern-stylish&amp;#34; hair in place. It is great because it does add the volume he likes and it holds a nice texture. The downside, and the reason I do not give 5 stars, is that I find the clay a little expensive  for a hair product that is 3 ounces! I suggest the makers do a value pack for those who use it on a daily basis, Otherwise, great product.</li>
            <li> WORKS perfectly. So much cheaper than a store</li>
            <li> Smelled really odd. American Crew Fiber is much better for controlling hair.</li>
            <li> Best matte clay hair product out there - is like the old Bumble and Bumble matte clay before they changed it - wonderful product</li>
            <li> AND MAKES IT LOOK COOL</li>
            <li> Great lasting hold for the spiky messed up look, doesn&#x27;t make your hair super shiny and If you don&#x27;t take a shower it can easily last two days.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Been buying Baxter of California products for years at double the price. Thankful they ran out or I would have never tried this product for half price.</li>
            <li> Quality clay wax, holds well &amp; if you do not go heavy with it it does not make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> It just works! Great for short hair.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My boyfriend uses it all the time and  I love the way Osmo Clay Wax styles without hardening too much or flaking. Best used when hair is still damp. You don&#x27;t need a lot of this product to style your hair. So, the speed at which it runs out will really depend on how much you THINK you should use for the amount of hair you have. If you are expecting Osmo to smell fruity or rosy or any other kind of delightful scent, you will be disappointed. Osmo has its own unique scent. I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells bad but it also doesn&#x27;t smell like a bucket of roses were ground up and mixed in with this Clay Wax. I think it&#x27;s a pretty neutral scent that is not too overbearing, which is perfect for men. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Speedy delivery. Very satisfied. Will order again for sure.</li>
            <li> Great for styling short hair, though you have to dry your hair first. Total control without a wet look. However, as my hear gets longer, it becomes less reliable at an exponential rate.  Not sure if it matters, but my hair is dark and fairly thick.</li>
            <li> Greasy!! Doesn&#x27;t hold that well.</li>
            <li> Good for my hair, the effect last like 5 hours and I&#x27;m in my second purchase of it.... Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good holding power.  Better than gel</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> The product was what I expected</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t flake like some other products. Been using it for years and so far haven&#x27;t developed hairless...lets hope that continues.</li>
            <li> Great hair product to keep the shape you want, but without hardening or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me.  Not to greasy.  And not too matte.  A good amount of hold without any annoying product clumping.</li>
            <li> my hairdresser used something similar in her shop, with my new short style and I loved it. Made it very piecey and defined lines. The price was too expensive, I thought. So I looked on line and found this brand OSMO. Very reasonable and I really like it. Same outcome as with my hairdresser. I will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, has great pull and doesn&#x27;t leave one&#x27;s hair looking all shiny, great stuff!</li>
            <li> I am moderately happy with this, I have thick hair and need something to hold my front \\&quot;up\\&quot; style. This does a decent job. Finish is mostly matte. Smell is mostly neutral, which is a plus considering many other products I&#x27;ve tried have awful stenches. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick. 3 days I believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product works well. It has a nice scent. Although, I did read other reviewers stating that it left your hair with a dry look (like you would expect from a clay product), but I have not had that result. It could be dictated by the amount I am using or the dampness of my hair when I use it. This product, to me, behaves a lot like a pomade. It&#x27;s not EXACTLY what I wanted, but it does get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this stuff is pretty tacky prior to application. I have noticed that after I soften it up on my fingertips and begin applying it to my hair, it tends to clump a little bit in the first couple of places I touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well. Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> All hair products work differently for different hair types and lengths. I have short, dense, and thick hair, so I need very little of this product. I use less than you think you would normally need just to add a little bit of control.</li>
            <li> My Stylist recommended Osmo Clay Wax and I now use this every day.  It keeps your hair in place, without the sticky or gel look that other products have&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this now for several months and I still have 3/4 of the bottle left !  Overall, this is a great value since it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> The seller was great, but the wax was not a good replacement for the Dirty Trix by Matrics&lt;br /&gt;Not a great hold at all!</li>
            <li> Great product my boyfriend  loves and also don&#x27;t give the wet Look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair wax for almost 10 years and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  My hair is curly and this product holds my hair and isn&#x27;t stiff.  My hair feels soft and natural when I use it and really holds it in place and also allows me to do different styles with ease.</li>
            <li> I love Osmo&#x27;s hard fibre wax; this is ok, but it&#x27;s still a little tacky when it dries-- great for a &amp;#34;beach look&amp;#34;, but not if you want a clean, dry look.</li>
