            <li>The pigment in both pallets are really good they last all day which is surprising because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>i love the colors and nothing was damaged its gonna make a great Xmas present</li>
            <li>Love it fun to work with, and love the variety of colors you can choose to work with .</li>
            <li>Shipped Very Quickly...</li>
            <li>They go on easy</li>
            <li>Has easy tabs on the to seperate the plates.</li>
            <li>i felt that the colors were gonna be more full of glitter</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need more than just the 2 brushes that they put inside it so that you can keep the colors true and separated.</li>
            <li>love the colors and the pigment is really good better then urban decay even..</li>
            <li>Super impressed with the true to color pigments as well as the solid coverage in the pigment without having to apply a base/primer!</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much for having a great product and being very helpful.</li>
            <li>love this very pretty</li>
            <li>great cheap gift for a teen who likes eye make up.</li>
            <li>I thought the color palette was HUGE....</li>
            <li>A huge selection of colors for not a lot of money.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy about this purchase and would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li>The eye shadow applies so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Eyeshadow goes on smoothly with no creasing throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the variety and the price.</li>
            <li>There were a couple of repeated colors, but overall a really great range of colors and shades to choose from.</li>
            <li>Well, the eyeshades ended up looking fabulous.</li>
            <li>Great to use for daily use, or for parties.</li>
            <li>Smooth metallic pearl-like finish.  </li>
            <li>Very exciting</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t that cheap translucent look that pack on until you see something significant.</li>
            <li>Brilliant colors compliment each other and can make just about any look.</li>
            <li>The lighter colors come on nicely but the darker colors arent as vibrant as i would like when i apply it on to my eyes.</li>
            <li>This has a lot of nice glitzy shades and the color are vibrant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed with my order.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when i opened the package.</li>
            <li>but i am excited to.</li>
            <li>Totally worth ever penny!</li>
            <li>I love the label sheet for keeping track of exactly what color I used.</li>
            <li>so then i called Amazon right away and told them what happened, they contact the seller and requested a new palette Charter-Inc was right on it!!!!</li>
            <li>this is awesome, will add pics soon, I&#x27;m a dark skin girl and these colors go very well with me, it sparkles so it lives up to its name!</li>
            <li>The quality is very cheap and the they are very crumbly and chalky.  </li>
            <li>The size of them was what kind of through me off but other then that if you do not use so much makeup each day these are a great choice for anyone who likes colorful sparking colors.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great , and  it came  as expected.</li>
            <li>, this works just as well, if even better than the NYX because these eyeshadows dont crumble as much and dont fall as you apply as the NYX had when i used it.</li>
            <li>Everything is good, but I did think that it was going to be bigger.</li>
            <li>The colors are gorgeous, I would definitely get it again.</li>
            <li>You can go for.a real pop or a more subdued look.</li>
            <li>I really liked these had it not been for the mail service that broke nearly 20 of the shadows.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Check out the video to see the full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad for the money.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the color selection and boldness of the colors; bold but tasteful, a yound persons dream come true.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of these in the future for sure.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>That way the color looks more vibrant.</li>
            <li>BUT luckily they sent me</li>
            <li>Love the colors and they last and don&#x27;t wear off like most of the eye shadow do.</li>
            <li>The shadows arrived quickly and unbroken.  </li>
            <li>I wish they were more vibrant.</li>
            <li>love this case and the way it keeps everything closed and tidy in my makeup bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that to be accurate, but they still are pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty colors thank you.</li>
            <li>All the colors are very pretty.  </li>
            <li>but it is enough because have a nice and cute colors thanks on time</li>
            <li>I received these like 2 days after ordering so shipped very fast!</li>
            <li>Emori is a new brand I tried and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>but it is very shimmery and wet looking like a cream beautiful colors</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Eyeshadow Makeup did not have enough glitter but case was impressive and there were many colors but a small amount for each color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, that&#x27;s fine with me because I wouldn&#x27;t really wear it anyway.</li>
            <li>, This is an amazing set, the colors are vibrant, pretty, and really stand out, I get complemented all the time</li>
            <li>you would think it would be huge by the picture, but it really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>These are going to look amazing in my next photo</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Overall though its a nice set for the price i paid.</li>
            <li>Was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait</li>
            <li>Comes with very color glitter eyeshadow and lasted all day very neat has mostly all colors I needed</li>
            <li>, I think this was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Would make a nice gift for someone who likes makeup or who is just starting to use it.</li>
            <li>this is well worth the money</li>
            <li>The palette IS nice and I would have returned it except that I was planning on ordering a pearl eyeshadow kit at some point in the future.  </li>
            <li>The case comes with an inner mirror which is nice.</li>
            <li>Really fun to play with,</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth a try&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not thinking it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>There needs to be a better way to mail these as soft and brittle as they can be.</li>
            <li>but with so many colors you really should not run out fast unless you are always using 2-3 colors.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>Delivered super fast!  </li>
            <li>other then that it was good.</li>
            <li>The package came right on time.</li>
            <li>Very easy open box with a sheet of plastic between ea plate</li>
            <li>This is perfect to sample colors and experiment a little without having to buy bigger eyeshadow .</li>
            <li>my wife lived the prodyct quick service packaged very well.thx</li>
            <li>Also came super fast.</li>
            <li>My favorite makeup, I use it everyday and mix the colors :)</li>
            <li>They smell really perfume-y, though, and that is kind of offputting, especially when the compact is first opened.</li>
            <li>I would appreciate it very much if I can receive another one.</li>
            <li>would definitely buy it again and very cheap</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>Total in love with the colors.</li>
            <li>Really crappy quality!</li>
            <li>The product it self is nice, but the shipment took longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>I seen and ordered is Exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>Very Blendable!</li>
            <li>Love hwo it gives you the option to create different looks throughout the day .</li>
            <li>This was my first item ordered on amazon  .</li>
            <li>I ordered this set for my niece for Christmas because she loves mine so much!</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>But only the top layer is sparkly.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s pretty deceiving.</li>
            <li>i love this makeup case my daughter loves makeup so this is a christmas present for her of course</li>
            <li>I was a sceptic at first when ordering this product</li>
            <li>she uses many different makeups but this is one of her favorites</li>
            <li>It is exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li>Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>I hope more big the palette</li>
            <li>Next time I will be buying a better product.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>The shimmer or glitter is only on the top.</li>
            <li>but since this is a fragile item I felt more care should be taken.</li>
            <li>I love this pallette the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five is because it is no glitter at all</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty and pearlescent.</li>
            <li>i love them especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love the colors!</li>
            <li>i got the first palette and</li>
            <li>When I got it, it is not so pretty.</li>
            <li>They look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>I must say the palette itself is beautiful however, the eyeshadows in the palette are chalky and not a good look for the look I&#x27;m trying to create.</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really glittery, only on the outside layer but very nice quality and plenty of colors to choose from, suitable for every outfit in a wardrobe.</li>
            <li>The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because when I got it a couple of the eye-shadows had some minor chips in them but other than that they are beautiful and well worth the price. :)</li>
            <li>Basically its a good buy but its just plain glittery eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got it in the mail, but when I opened it one of the eye shadow&#x27;s were completely shattered</li>
            <li>but once you use the first half of the colors they seem to be more spearatic than full cover glitter.lol.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like buying this kit because I&#x27;ve noticed that many colors are the same or are very similar.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast shipment, exactly as described, shadows work well...</li>
            <li>so much already it was shipped fast!</li>
            <li>Had I known for sure it was going to take so long</li>
            <li>This is probably one of the most well put together pallets I have seen in a long while.</li>
            <li>This honestly puts up some competition with the other eye shadows!</li>
            <li>Prodct is fragile in regards to it can break aprt easy in you  </li>
            <li>The colors were very vibrant &amp; glittery .</li>
            <li>Easy to open.  </li>
            <li>then i expected n not really glittery but beautiful colors</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for beginners like me who want to be able to experiment on a limited budget.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite large and it didn&#x27;t cost a lot of money.</li>
            <li>The pallete itself was secured in a box, which was wrapped tightly in large bubble wrap, which was secured in the shipping box.</li>
            <li>so this will last me a very long time good buy for the price</li>
            <li>All of the other colors stick wonderfully, and they seem to be long lasting.</li>
            <li>Its comes with many colors, but there is not much of each, and they run out fast.  </li>
            <li>a lot it comes with all kinds of colors that u would really like it also comes with a primer</li>
            <li>nothing I think u would like as much as I do</li>
            <li>If not the colours probably wont show as much.  </li>
            <li>I really like the colors.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>i dont really use it at all.</li>
            <li>The Shadows are very pigmented ,so you dont have to use a lot.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>it came fast in the mail</li>
            <li>If you like getting crazy with your eye makeup this is absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li>It came fast from California to Illinois.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and my daughter absolutely loves the color pallet and case</li>
            <li>are 1) cosmetology trained and 2) very picky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my make up really beautiful,adds glitter and brightness to my eyes, item came on time and well packaged</li>
            <li>You really dont&#x27; need to put a lot on in order for the color to show</li>
            <li>The eye shadows work really well.</li>
            <li>I really recomed this</li>
            <li>Anyway i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Now, I will have to wait to find some REAL glitter eyeshadow palettes.</li>
            <li>I got this product really fast</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It goes on so silky smooth and last for hours and hours without needing a touch-up.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t broken so all in all still happy</li>
            <li>but... when I get something in the mail I expect user ready</li>
            <li>if the eyeshadows suck, it doesn&#x27;t cost that much anyway</li>
            <li>The packaging itself was very well done.</li>
            <li>A++ THANKS</li>
            <li>and we received it fast.</li>
            <li>recieved in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>I bought this palette thinking it would be very sparkly</li>
            <li>every color you could think about, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>i got a response from then really fast</li>
            <li>I bought this for prom makeup, its very chalky.</li>
            <li>but this company made sure it was safetly packaged to where it wouldnt get banged up,i would definitly order other items from this company</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty but it seems like there is only enough to use each shade maybe 3 times at the most.</li>
            <li>You can see the glitter in the product but it is just the right amount...not to little and not to much but just right!!</li>
            <li>That was my main concern this whole time</li>
            <li>The colors are even more different than the picture then to be expected, but the biggest issue is the fact that,even with primer, the color on my eyelids isn&#x27;t nearly as vibrant, or powerful as it is when it gets all over my under-eyes and cheeks.</li>
            <li>Nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li>but you must be careful cause they do break up easy.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s self was decent</li>
            <li>I use it mainly at night when I go out.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy another thing from this particular company ever again.</li>
            <li>It came with an eyeshadow primer which helps as some of the colors are not as vibrant as i would have wanted.</li>
            <li>The colors are wonderful, and I read in the other reviews that the palette arrived broken</li>
            <li>So many colors so little time.</li>
            <li>It took a little while to arrive but I am simply enjoying this.</li>
            <li>Colors are very true, even on my dark skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for me niece because she all grown up at like 8 years old and wanted REAL makeup not that kiddy stuff.</li>
            <li>I normally buy MAC, Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder, and Revlon products.</li>
            <li>The colors and quality of these eye shadows are just great!I have used many different brands trying to ind an alternative to the crazy expensive brands that a lot of people cant afford, and this is most def a great investment!!</li>
            <li>but other then that the eye shadow is pretty and goes on nicely iv read other review</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good other than that one of the colors were broken when I received it which is no problem because its cheap and things do happen</li>
            <li>I bought this on my brother&#x27;s account a few months ago, I&#x27;ve finally gotten around to actually review it properly, before i just used it, but now that i paid attention; i can honestly say I&#x27;ve spent my money wisely on this purchase.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to reapply for the entire day and the colors are just right for my wardrobe</li>
            <li>works sumwhat for how i wanted to use it for but to me it was cheap and shadow really does not last long</li>
            <li>a new one😆</li>
            <li>The color/product doesn&#x27;t last long either, and removes EASILY, even without being touched.</li>
            <li>I dot not own any other palletes at this point so for me this pallette is great.  </li>
            <li>I was so happily surprised to also recieve an eyeshadow primer with it!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeshadow kit and use it everyday!</li>
            <li>i just barely got it in the mail i haven&#x27;t used it yet, but the colors are just ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They came intact a bit small but what more can you ask for with the price.</li>
            <li>Once the top layer is rubbed off there is no more sparkle.</li>
            <li>;-) teehee I WILL buy from CHARTER-INC again no doubt, and i will definitely recommend them to friends and family.</li>
            <li>they do power up and blow away easily if it gets a little breaze from some one moving or blowing on it.</li>
            <li>an played with it for a few minutes to see if i could break it easily..</li>
            <li>Got these for a christmas gift for my daughter , they are very pretty colors and were as expected.</li>
            <li>i was pleasantly surprised on how fast they responded and mail me a new palette the NEXT DAY!!!</li>
            <li>the powder is a little bigger then a dime and the case even has a mirror at the top.</li>
            <li>Little small but nice item and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>But the packaging CLEARLY states it is PEARL eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>Not really what I was expecting and wasn&#x27;t happy with the way it came in with the eye shadow broken.</li>
            <li>Looks professional</li>
            <li>and i only had to apply it one time for the whole day</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised with this item I purchased from amazon.</li>
            <li>The colors on the other hand was just what I wanted and look very pretty on.</li>
            <li>Only the very surface of the shadow is glittery.</li>
            <li>I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li>they are fun and very easy to &amp;#34;mesh&amp;#34; the only downfall is the colors are a little to soft which makes it feel you might waste some if you tip it.</li>
            <li>same as the neon glitter and plain eyeshadows, you get 100 pieces of child coloring book colors, not even sure if it would work on  paper either</li>
            <li>i was so sad because i was waiting for them anxiously (couldn&#x27;t sleep just thinking about all those beautiful colors i was going to get in the mail ;-) )</li>
            <li>it is exactly what I expected..</li>
            <li>the case is hard and the clasp locks into place so easily and efficiently that i sat</li>
            <li>Only 2 of them were broken so other than that, I was happy.</li>
            <li>I live in a rural area, and sometimes my boxes get messed up, even if they&#x27;re not prone to it.</li>
            <li>This pallet have pretty colors, but, the colors don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I got my first palette and a lot of the colors had crumbled and mixed making a sort of grey dust</li>
            <li>I appreciated this but the second palette arrived jn the same condition.</li>
            <li>I really thought it was going to be better, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li>:) a little goes a long way with these!!!!</li>
            <li>She has to use them, no other option, but she would NEVER buy this again.  </li>
            <li>It Was The Only Shimmering And Exotic Colored Eyeshadow I Could Find, Its Very Small</li>
            <li>I really is what I expected</li>
            <li>I only Tried on one color so far</li>
            <li>I love the product but the mirror was broken when I received it..</li>
            <li>To Join a Large Makeup Kit And Other Stuff</li>
            <li>I have a rather large purse, and I carry it with all my other makeup.</li>
            <li>the neon green if used right under your bottom lashes makes your eyes POP</li>
            <li>there is only top glitter on the eye shaddow , lots of them were broken , but made them work no glitter on the bottom, the color wears off in a matter of hours</li>
            <li>These go on smoothly and are silky to touch, they last all day from what i have seen (i paired them with the primer) and the ONLY thing i could say bad about these is the smell when you first open them, its very powdery</li>
            <li>I had to have this sent to me twice because the first time it was packaged badly and most everything was broke</li>
            <li>I was very nervous about buying makeup online, but I needed a shimmer/sparkling eyeshadow to mess around with because I had never worn stuff like that and wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>I had to work to clean up the mess and repair what I could by pressing them back down with an eye shadow brush.</li>
            <li>and the colors are very vibrate and looks just as it does in the pictures it took a little while to get it</li>
            <li>The product arrived with several broken pallets, so many colors were mixed up from the beginning, but even with owning it, the eye shadow immediately turns to loose powder upon use.  </li>

            <li> I am a lover of eye shadow and was very excited about my order.</li>
            <li> It is very worth the price I paid for it!</li>
            <li> A gift for my daughter and she was very excited to recieve this gift.</li>
            <li> Love all nice color full colors</li>
            <li> The colors are great and vibrant..  </li>
            <li> Ordered 1 first and loved it then ordered 3 more for my girlfriends...</li>
            <li> luckily i have my own way of keeping the colors nice but other than that its awesome</li>
            <li> This item arrived in order no broken pieces and the colors are remarkable.</li>
            <li> Love It, the shadows are easy to blend, and are on the creamy side in texture.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it will be fine.</li>
            <li> All of the colors are so bright and vibrant!</li>
            <li> They need to wrap this idem more securely.</li>
            <li> so I could use that beautiful champagne color at the top on the left.</li>
            <li> ITS JUST LIKE IT WAS DESCRIBED, VERY PLEASED WITH THE WHOLE PROCESS!  </li>
            <li> Its a nice colorful set.</li>
            <li> The pigment in both pallets are really good they last all day which is surprising because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> i love the colors and nothing was damaged its gonna make a great Xmas present</li>
            <li> Love it fun to work with, and love the variety of colors you can choose to work with .</li>
            <li> Shipped Very Quickly...</li>
            <li> They go on easy</li>
            <li> Has easy tabs on the to seperate the plates.</li>
            <li> i felt that the colors were gonna be more full of glitter</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need more than just the 2 brushes that they put inside it so that you can keep the colors true and separated.</li>
            <li> love the colors and the pigment is really good better then urban decay even..</li>
            <li> Super impressed with the true to color pigments as well as the solid coverage in the pigment without having to apply a base/primer!</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much for having a great product and being very helpful.</li>
            <li> love this very pretty</li>
            <li> great cheap gift for a teen who likes eye make up.</li>
            <li> I thought the color palette was HUGE....</li>
            <li> A huge selection of colors for not a lot of money.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy about this purchase and would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> The eye shadow applies so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Eyeshadow goes on smoothly with no creasing throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the variety and the price.</li>
            <li> There were a couple of repeated colors, but overall a really great range of colors and shades to choose from.</li>
            <li> Well, the eyeshades ended up looking fabulous.</li>
            <li> Great to use for daily use, or for parties.</li>
            <li> Smooth metallic pearl-like finish.  </li>
            <li> Very exciting</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t that cheap translucent look that pack on until you see something significant.</li>
            <li> Brilliant colors compliment each other and can make just about any look.</li>
            <li> The lighter colors come on nicely but the darker colors arent as vibrant as i would like when i apply it on to my eyes.</li>
            <li> This has a lot of nice glitzy shades and the color are vibrant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed with my order.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when i opened the package.</li>
            <li> but i am excited to.</li>
            <li> Totally worth ever penny!</li>
            <li> I love the label sheet for keeping track of exactly what color I used.</li>
            <li> so then i called Amazon right away and told them what happened, they contact the seller and requested a new palette Charter-Inc was right on it!!!!</li>
            <li> this is awesome, will add pics soon, I&#x27;m a dark skin girl and these colors go very well with me, it sparkles so it lives up to its name!</li>
            <li> The quality is very cheap and the they are very crumbly and chalky.  </li>
            <li> The size of them was what kind of through me off but other then that if you do not use so much makeup each day these are a great choice for anyone who likes colorful sparking colors.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great , and  it came  as expected.</li>
            <li> , this works just as well, if even better than the NYX because these eyeshadows dont crumble as much and dont fall as you apply as the NYX had when i used it.</li>
            <li> Everything is good, but I did think that it was going to be bigger.</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous, I would definitely get it again.</li>
            <li> You can go for.a real pop or a more subdued look.</li>
            <li> I really liked these had it not been for the mail service that broke nearly 20 of the shadows.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Check out the video to see the full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad for the money.</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the color selection and boldness of the colors; bold but tasteful, a yound persons dream come true.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of these in the future for sure.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> That way the color looks more vibrant.</li>
            <li> BUT luckily they sent me</li>
            <li> Love the colors and they last and don&#x27;t wear off like most of the eye shadow do.</li>
            <li> The shadows arrived quickly and unbroken.  </li>
            <li> I wish they were more vibrant.</li>
            <li> love this case and the way it keeps everything closed and tidy in my makeup bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that to be accurate, but they still are pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors thank you.</li>
            <li> All the colors are very pretty.  </li>
            <li> but it is enough because have a nice and cute colors thanks on time</li>
            <li> I received these like 2 days after ordering so shipped very fast!</li>
            <li> Emori is a new brand I tried and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> but it is very shimmery and wet looking like a cream beautiful colors</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow Makeup did not have enough glitter but case was impressive and there were many colors but a small amount for each color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, that&#x27;s fine with me because I wouldn&#x27;t really wear it anyway.</li>
            <li> , This is an amazing set, the colors are vibrant, pretty, and really stand out, I get complemented all the time</li>
            <li> you would think it would be huge by the picture, but it really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> These are going to look amazing in my next photo</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Overall though its a nice set for the price i paid.</li>
            <li> Was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> but it was worth the wait</li>
            <li> Comes with very color glitter eyeshadow and lasted all day very neat has mostly all colors I needed</li>
            <li> , I think this was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Would make a nice gift for someone who likes makeup or who is just starting to use it.</li>
            <li> this is well worth the money</li>
            <li> The palette IS nice and I would have returned it except that I was planning on ordering a pearl eyeshadow kit at some point in the future.  </li>
            <li> The case comes with an inner mirror which is nice.</li>
            <li> Really fun to play with,</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth a try&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thinking it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> There needs to be a better way to mail these as soft and brittle as they can be.</li>
            <li> but with so many colors you really should not run out fast unless you are always using 2-3 colors.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Delivered super fast!  </li>
            <li> other then that it was good.</li>
            <li> The package came right on time.</li>
            <li> Very easy open box with a sheet of plastic between ea plate</li>
            <li> This is perfect to sample colors and experiment a little without having to buy bigger eyeshadow .</li>
            <li> my wife lived the prodyct quick service packaged very well.thx</li>
            <li> Also came super fast.</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup, I use it everyday and mix the colors :)</li>
            <li> They smell really perfume-y, though, and that is kind of offputting, especially when the compact is first opened.</li>
            <li> I would appreciate it very much if I can receive another one.</li>
            <li> would definitely buy it again and very cheap</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> Total in love with the colors.</li>
            <li> Really crappy quality!</li>
            <li> The product it self is nice, but the shipment took longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I seen and ordered is Exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> Very Blendable!</li>
            <li> Love hwo it gives you the option to create different looks throughout the day .</li>
            <li> This was my first item ordered on amazon  .</li>
            <li> I ordered this set for my niece for Christmas because she loves mine so much!</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.</li>
            <li> But only the top layer is sparkly.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s pretty deceiving.</li>
            <li> i love this makeup case my daughter loves makeup so this is a christmas present for her of course</li>
            <li> I was a sceptic at first when ordering this product</li>
            <li> she uses many different makeups but this is one of her favorites</li>
            <li> It is exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li> Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> I hope more big the palette</li>
            <li> Next time I will be buying a better product.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> The shimmer or glitter is only on the top.</li>
            <li> but since this is a fragile item I felt more care should be taken.</li>
            <li> I love this pallette the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five is because it is no glitter at all</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and pearlescent.</li>
            <li> i love them especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love the colors!</li>
            <li> i got the first palette and</li>
            <li> When I got it, it is not so pretty.</li>
            <li> They look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> I must say the palette itself is beautiful however, the eyeshadows in the palette are chalky and not a good look for the look I&#x27;m trying to create.</li>
            <li> Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really glittery, only on the outside layer but very nice quality and plenty of colors to choose from, suitable for every outfit in a wardrobe.</li>
            <li> The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because when I got it a couple of the eye-shadows had some minor chips in them but other than that they are beautiful and well worth the price. :)</li>
            <li> Basically its a good buy but its just plain glittery eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got it in the mail, but when I opened it one of the eye shadow&#x27;s were completely shattered</li>
            <li> but once you use the first half of the colors they seem to be more spearatic than full cover glitter.lol.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like buying this kit because I&#x27;ve noticed that many colors are the same or are very similar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fast shipment, exactly as described, shadows work well...</li>
            <li> so much already it was shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Had I known for sure it was going to take so long</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the most well put together pallets I have seen in a long while.</li>
            <li> This honestly puts up some competition with the other eye shadows!</li>
            <li> Prodct is fragile in regards to it can break aprt easy in you  </li>
            <li> The colors were very vibrant &amp; glittery .</li>
            <li> Easy to open.  </li>
            <li> then i expected n not really glittery but beautiful colors</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for beginners like me who want to be able to experiment on a limited budget.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite large and it didn&#x27;t cost a lot of money.</li>
            <li> The pallete itself was secured in a box, which was wrapped tightly in large bubble wrap, which was secured in the shipping box.</li>
            <li> so this will last me a very long time good buy for the price</li>
            <li> All of the other colors stick wonderfully, and they seem to be long lasting.</li>
            <li> Its comes with many colors, but there is not much of each, and they run out fast.  </li>
            <li> a lot it comes with all kinds of colors that u would really like it also comes with a primer</li>
            <li> nothing I think u would like as much as I do</li>
            <li> If not the colours probably wont show as much.  </li>
            <li> I really like the colors.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> i dont really use it at all.</li>
            <li> The Shadows are very pigmented ,so you dont have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> it came fast in the mail</li>
            <li> If you like getting crazy with your eye makeup this is absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> It came fast from California to Illinois.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and my daughter absolutely loves the color pallet and case</li>
            <li> are 1) cosmetology trained and 2) very picky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my make up really beautiful,adds glitter and brightness to my eyes, item came on time and well packaged</li>
            <li> You really dont&#x27; need to put a lot on in order for the color to show</li>
            <li> The eye shadows work really well.</li>
            <li> I really recomed this</li>
            <li> Anyway i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Now, I will have to wait to find some REAL glitter eyeshadow palettes.</li>
            <li> I got this product really fast</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It goes on so silky smooth and last for hours and hours without needing a touch-up.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t broken so all in all still happy</li>
            <li> but... when I get something in the mail I expect user ready</li>
            <li> if the eyeshadows suck, it doesn&#x27;t cost that much anyway</li>
            <li> The packaging itself was very well done.</li>
            <li> A++ THANKS</li>
            <li> and we received it fast.</li>
            <li> recieved in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette thinking it would be very sparkly</li>
            <li> every color you could think about, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> i got a response from then really fast</li>
            <li> I bought this for prom makeup, its very chalky.</li>
            <li> but this company made sure it was safetly packaged to where it wouldnt get banged up,i would definitly order other items from this company</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty but it seems like there is only enough to use each shade maybe 3 times at the most.</li>
            <li> You can see the glitter in the product but it is just the right amount...not to little and not to much but just right!!</li>
            <li> That was my main concern this whole time</li>
            <li> The colors are even more different than the picture then to be expected, but the biggest issue is the fact that,even with primer, the color on my eyelids isn&#x27;t nearly as vibrant, or powerful as it is when it gets all over my under-eyes and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li> but you must be careful cause they do break up easy.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s self was decent</li>
            <li> I use it mainly at night when I go out.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy another thing from this particular company ever again.</li>
            <li> It came with an eyeshadow primer which helps as some of the colors are not as vibrant as i would have wanted.</li>
            <li> The colors are wonderful, and I read in the other reviews that the palette arrived broken</li>
            <li> So many colors so little time.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to arrive but I am simply enjoying this.</li>
            <li> Colors are very true, even on my dark skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for me niece because she all grown up at like 8 years old and wanted REAL makeup not that kiddy stuff.</li>
            <li> I normally buy MAC, Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder, and Revlon products.</li>
            <li> The colors and quality of these eye shadows are just great!I have used many different brands trying to ind an alternative to the crazy expensive brands that a lot of people cant afford, and this is most def a great investment!!</li>
            <li> but other then that the eye shadow is pretty and goes on nicely iv read other review</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good other than that one of the colors were broken when I received it which is no problem because its cheap and things do happen</li>
            <li> I bought this on my brother&#x27;s account a few months ago, I&#x27;ve finally gotten around to actually review it properly, before i just used it, but now that i paid attention; i can honestly say I&#x27;ve spent my money wisely on this purchase.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to reapply for the entire day and the colors are just right for my wardrobe</li>
            <li> works sumwhat for how i wanted to use it for but to me it was cheap and shadow really does not last long</li>
            <li> a new one😆</li>
            <li> The color/product doesn&#x27;t last long either, and removes EASILY, even without being touched.</li>
            <li> I dot not own any other palletes at this point so for me this pallette is great.  </li>
            <li> I was so happily surprised to also recieve an eyeshadow primer with it!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow kit and use it everyday!</li>
            <li> i just barely got it in the mail i haven&#x27;t used it yet, but the colors are just ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They came intact a bit small but what more can you ask for with the price.</li>
            <li> Once the top layer is rubbed off there is no more sparkle.</li>
            <li> ;-) teehee I WILL buy from CHARTER-INC again no doubt, and i will definitely recommend them to friends and family.</li>
            <li> they do power up and blow away easily if it gets a little breaze from some one moving or blowing on it.</li>
            <li> an played with it for a few minutes to see if i could break it easily..</li>
            <li> Got these for a christmas gift for my daughter , they are very pretty colors and were as expected.</li>
            <li> i was pleasantly surprised on how fast they responded and mail me a new palette the NEXT DAY!!!</li>
            <li> the powder is a little bigger then a dime and the case even has a mirror at the top.</li>
            <li> Little small but nice item and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> But the packaging CLEARLY states it is PEARL eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> Not really what I was expecting and wasn&#x27;t happy with the way it came in with the eye shadow broken.</li>
            <li> Looks professional</li>
            <li> and i only had to apply it one time for the whole day</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised with this item I purchased from amazon.</li>
            <li> The colors on the other hand was just what I wanted and look very pretty on.</li>
            <li> Only the very surface of the shadow is glittery.</li>
            <li> I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li> they are fun and very easy to &amp;#34;mesh&amp;#34; the only downfall is the colors are a little to soft which makes it feel you might waste some if you tip it.</li>
            <li> same as the neon glitter and plain eyeshadows, you get 100 pieces of child coloring book colors, not even sure if it would work on  paper either</li>
            <li> i was so sad because i was waiting for them anxiously (couldn&#x27;t sleep just thinking about all those beautiful colors i was going to get in the mail ;-) )</li>
            <li> it is exactly what I expected..</li>
            <li> the case is hard and the clasp locks into place so easily and efficiently that i sat</li>
            <li> Only 2 of them were broken so other than that, I was happy.</li>
            <li> I live in a rural area, and sometimes my boxes get messed up, even if they&#x27;re not prone to it.</li>
            <li> This pallet have pretty colors, but, the colors don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I got my first palette and a lot of the colors had crumbled and mixed making a sort of grey dust</li>
            <li> I appreciated this but the second palette arrived jn the same condition.</li>
            <li> I really thought it was going to be better, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> :) a little goes a long way with these!!!!</li>
            <li> She has to use them, no other option, but she would NEVER buy this again.  </li>
            <li> It Was The Only Shimmering And Exotic Colored Eyeshadow I Could Find, Its Very Small</li>
            <li> I really is what I expected</li>
            <li> I only Tried on one color so far</li>
            <li> I love the product but the mirror was broken when I received it..</li>
            <li> To Join a Large Makeup Kit And Other Stuff</li>
            <li> I have a rather large purse, and I carry it with all my other makeup.</li>
            <li> the neon green if used right under your bottom lashes makes your eyes POP</li>
            <li> there is only top glitter on the eye shaddow , lots of them were broken , but made them work no glitter on the bottom, the color wears off in a matter of hours</li>
            <li> These go on smoothly and are silky to touch, they last all day from what i have seen (i paired them with the primer) and the ONLY thing i could say bad about these is the smell when you first open them, its very powdery</li>
            <li> I had to have this sent to me twice because the first time it was packaged badly and most everything was broke</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about buying makeup online, but I needed a shimmer/sparkling eyeshadow to mess around with because I had never worn stuff like that and wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> I had to work to clean up the mess and repair what I could by pressing them back down with an eye shadow brush.</li>
            <li> and the colors are very vibrate and looks just as it does in the pictures it took a little while to get it</li>
            <li> The product arrived with several broken pallets, so many colors were mixed up from the beginning, but even with owning it, the eye shadow immediately turns to loose powder upon use.  </li>
            <li> So vibrant, you can have any look you want, whether it&#x27;s subtle or all out hot pink, you&#x27;ve got it.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the only glitter in it is a very thin layer on the top.</li>
            <li> it comes off early dark.</li>
            <li> Long lasting colors, did not wear off or faded, eyeshadow stays in place until you remove it!</li>
            <li> that is actually long lasting.</li>
            <li> dont use it often, but it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> only tried a few so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are a little shallow, so I do not expect them to last a super long time.</li>
            <li> So, besides that it took long everything else</li>
            <li> so be extra careful.</li>
            <li> It takes several coats and careful application to achieve the desired color.</li>
            <li> so be careful and pay attention to which ones you used so you can avoid them in the future.</li>
            <li> It was way smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> , cheap garbage, save your money buy brand names, might be a bit more expensive but at least you can use it, this the worse I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> The only one I&#x27;ve had trouble with is the yellow one(s).</li>
            <li> Wear it every single day.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t buy it just for that simple reason for it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> First one I recieved was broken..</li>
            <li> I do not like how loose the eye shadow is.</li>
            <li> it breaks that is the only down fall</li>
            <li> Over all te product is ok not good not great</li>
            <li> thanks in part to the primer - Victoria Secret -Pro Primer.  </li>
            <li> came sooner then expected, I&#x27;m having a blast mixing and matching the colors</li>
            <li> lots of choices for not much money.  </li>
            <li> Spend the extra few dollars and do that,too.</li>
            <li> and i guess a few people got about the same thing</li>
            <li> I opened the order only to find the mirror cracked and a few of the colors were crumbled.</li>
            <li> Case was scratched a little on the outside but other that</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews on this before I purchased the item, and one review said that the further down you get into a color</li>
            <li> how small the actual colors are and how a brush can eaily dig into them but they are wonderfull!!!!</li>
            <li> Each square is small, but enough for the purpose I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy palettes because there are several colors I won&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> When I read some of the reviews about how when you receive them they are messed up due to shipping</li>
            <li> and it got all over the other eye shadows</li>
            <li> It gave me a very wide selection of colors</li>
            <li> Then the second one was also poorly wrapped but only a couple was broke</li>
            <li> One was slightly chipped , but other than that</li>
            <li> i bought it, and came as a broken box, much of dyes was broken, so i re send it back</li>
            <li> Five stars hands down.</li>
            <li> It came quicker than I expected!!</li>
            <li> All the colors on both sides of palette were in loose powder form and was messy messy.  </li>
            <li> but i use that when i have yellow and orange above, you may think that is crazy but the color makes my very dark blue eyes pop</li>
            <li> however I wasn&#x27;t expecting the eye shadow squares to be so small and to be so limited to</li>
            <li> It has every color in it that is missing in other ones.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this item all the stars is due to when I received the case the lid was broken off.</li>
            <li> but s few of the colors are a little irritating to skin and to eyes in general</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t the case came a little cracked</li>
            <li> The little make up squares are small.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It was a little powdery to use, but that happens with cheaper eye shadow.</li>
            <li> It is a really few pigmented.</li>
            <li> a few uses wouldn&#x27;t pay that price for it again but the eye shadow</li>
            <li> Even being affordable and quite a few colors...</li>
            <li> i use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Nothing is beneath but plain powder.  </li>
            <li> hard to wash off dark colors</li>
            <li> I was a little wary of ordering it in fear that some of the colors would be broken, but I am HIGHLY satissfied!</li>
            <li> and it came a little late</li>
            <li> just got it all in tact i dont wear makeup excessively</li>
            <li> its just a really small amount of makeup in the spaces.</li>
            <li> and I was not able to use it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> &gt;.&gt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard work to make myself.</li>
            <li> hard to tell, but there is glitter in them.  </li>
            <li> I guess it was too delicate for shipment.</li>
            <li> i mean the case sonstruction.</li>
            <li> Its Just The Case Was In Such Bad Shape</li>
            <li> unfortunately part of the eyeshadows set was worn out, completely damaged :(</li>
            <li> Case came broken off the hinges.its a judgement call.</li>
            <li> It was completely broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> The package it came in wasn&#x27;t broken but the product was.</li>
            <li> It came wrapped well, none of them were broken, some people had a problem with that.</li>
            <li> None of the eyeshadow was broken into pieces or scratched.</li>
            <li> I was worried the would came broken</li>
            <li> its broken palette when it shipped and its powder color .i</li>
            <li> I;ll be using the irritating ones for polymer clay coloring and shimmer.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my niece and when she received it the blush was broken.  </li>
            <li> Got mine broken</li>
            <li> when i got this in the mail the case was broken in two spots and one of the eye shadows was crumbled</li>
            <li> but when she took it out of the box, the shadows had all broken up in shipping.</li>
            <li> Some of my make up was broken....</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is poor.</li>
            <li> it came to me slightly broken and unable to close.</li>
            <li> but if any signs you dropped was a failure .. very sad with my wife when they opened not recommend</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY!</li>
            <li> so unhappy</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money!!!!!</li>
            <li> However when I received it I felt deceived and I was very angry.</li>
            <li> very sad</li>
            <li> I am very angry about this.</li>
            <li> I received my product on today and when I opened up the box my palette was destroyed because of bad shipping.</li>
            <li> It seems to be used before, and the colors açhave a bad quality</li>
            <li> BAD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come in any bad condition.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this item...</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Stupid.</li>
            <li> but i do recommend a primer and a base.  </li>
            <li> I do suggest putting on some sort of base underneath the eyeshadows though before.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s  good I like it a lot it comes with all kinds of colors that u would really like it also comes with a primer the primer last all day don&#x27;t come off or nothing I think u would like as much as I do</li>
            <li> Very vibrant colors shows up so good!</li>
            <li> I received my product on today and when I opened up the box my palette was destroyed because of bad shipping. Makeup was every where. I would appreciate it very much if I can receive another one. I am a lover of eye shadow and was very excited about my order. However when I received it I felt deceived and I was very angry. Please contact me..</li>
            <li> This 100 piece eyeshadow kit was a wonderful gift idea. The set was incredible. So many colors so little time.</li>
            <li> Already bought this item before and loved it so I purchased another one</li>
            <li> Loved It... BUUUUT i felt that the colors were gonna be more full of glitter but once you use the first half of the colors they seem to be more spearatic than full cover glitter.lol. Kisses</li>
            <li> i love the colors and nothing was damaged its gonna make a great Xmas present</li>
            <li> The colors are great and vibrant..  My daughter loves the make-up.  Great price and a great product.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars but there were 5 of the shadows that were crumbled. I do love the ones that I have been using. They are beautiful and you can see them really well. I also love the fact that you sent an eyelid primer with these so I should&#x27;ve given it 4 stars, but I just don&#x27;t like the fact some of them were crumbled.</li>
            <li> I like all the colors and I always wear them..</li>
            <li> The makeup came in good condition and in amazing time. It arrived a lot earlier than the estimated arrival time which was a plus. It is just so beautiful. Total in love with the colors. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Long lasting colors, did not wear off or faded, eyeshadow stays in place until you remove it! I would highly recommend this beautiful variety of all day wear!</li>
            <li> Did not like this. Really crappy quality! Do not recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, but she doesn&#x27;t seem to be very happy with this. It seems to be used before, and the colors açhave a bad quality (touch them, break them). I really thought it was going to be better, but I was wrong. She has to use them, no other option, but she would NEVER buy this again.  Think before you buy... this pictures lie!</li>
            <li> So much loving all colors. I purchased 4 more for family members</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat this item...fast shipment, exactly as described, shadows work well...you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this item...I hope to order more soon..</li>
            <li> The product it self is nice, but the shipment took longer than I expected. I&#x27;ll have to say that I like the colors. So, besides that it took long everything else went well.</li>
            <li> Great kit. It does all the colors you need to do anything you want. The colors are bright and stay wit you all day.</li>
            <li> I got for my aunts birthday and it came a little late but she still loved it</li>
            <li> I was shopping online for a product that contained all the eyeshadow color&#x27;s I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;What I seen and ordered is Exactly what I got. Im very happy with my new makeup!!! :D</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors thank you.</li>
            <li> Love the colors. Very beautiful. Best eye shadow pallet i have. And i have many. Five stars allll the wayy.</li>
            <li> great cheap gift for a teen who likes eye make up. Looks professional</li>
            <li> I dot not own any other palletes at this point so for me this pallette is great.  For the most part the colours do not show glitter but the the White definitely shows the glitter.  I do like it but i do recommend a primer and a base.  If not the colours probably wont show as much.  Its a profusion Palette and i personally do not mind the brand.  I used it for Carnival in Jamaica and it was able to survive the rain (thanks in part to the primer - Victoria Secret -Pro Primer.  I would recommend it for beginners like me who want to be able to experiment on a limited budget.</li>
            <li> I do recommend. The colors are bright, fun, and most importantly they stay on! Fast shipping, and arrived in excellent condition. Great for night clubs, dinner dates, fashion shows, etc.</li>
            <li> my wife lived the prodyct quick service packaged very well.thx</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow kit. It&#x27;s very nice I really like the colors. They are bright and true. Very nice buy.</li>
            <li> All the colors are amazing!! You&#x27;ll need more than just the 2 brushes that they put inside it so that you can keep the colors true and separated.</li>
            <li> works great colors kinda fade so you have to use quit a bit but works great I got lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Its a nice colorful set. The lighter colors come on nicely but the darker colors arent as vibrant as i would like when i apply it on to my eyes. Overall though its a nice set for the price i paid.</li>
            <li> I must say this is my favorite item I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon. My friends want to take mine and I&#x27;m not paying with it.</li>
            <li> The palette colours are tiny, they look like samples. The eyeshadow itself is flakey. I wasn&#x27;t happy about this because even the colours themselves are not shimmery which is in the description.</li>
            <li> Wonderful work. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice. Colors for whatever mode you are in, night or day. Great buy. Love it, love it.</li>
            <li> Was worth the purchase. My daughter loves it and all the wonderful colors to pick from. I couldn&#x27;t find a deal like this in stores.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter who is the time wanted to be a make up artist. She is now licensed and she loves it! The variety is amazing!</li>
            <li> the eye shadow was okay. i wouldnt purchase it again. i dont really use it at all. it comes off early dark.</li>
            <li> I recieved the eyeshadows very quickly! They were entact. The Shadows are very pigmented ,so you dont have to use a lot.Great Color! Very Blendable! As a pro makeup artist , I love and recommend this product!WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> These are amazing. So cute and lobe how it opens.. makes it easer to have access and not break or come apart</li>
            <li> OMG!!!! LOVE IT!!! Just got this in the mail! The case is SO BEAUTIFUL and the colors are SO pigmented and silky. I was so happily surprised to also recieve an eyeshadow primer with it! Had no idea it came with it. This is a MUST HAVE!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing but very light when used on your eyes. Case came broken off the hinges.its a judgement call.</li>
            <li> The Shipping Was Great, It Got Here Very Fast. However When I Opened To Case It Was All Scratched Up Dented The Makeup Itself Was Not Crumbeled Or Anything Its Just The Case Was In Such Bad Shape I Cant believe They Would Sell That In The Condition It Was In. I Bought It To Join a Large Makeup Kit And Other Stuff I Bought My Gf It Was The Only Shimmering And Exotic Colored Eyeshadow I Could Find, Its Very Small Also Im A Male But I Would Guess Maybe 5 Time Use Of Each Color. BAD PRODUCT I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO SOMEONE,</li>
            <li> my eyes loved emabracing the colors of the eeyshadow rainbow selection. Love it fun to work with, and love the variety of colors you can choose to work with . Love hwo it gives you the option to create different looks throughout the day . Prodct is fragile in regards to it can break aprt easy in you  so be extra careful. This was my first item ordered on amazon  .</li>
            <li> It was completely broken when I received it. But it was double bubble wrapped. The package it came in wasn&#x27;t broken but the product was. Waste of time and money!!!!!</li>
            <li> hard to wash off dark colors</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow kit and use it everyday! It&#x27;s not really glittery, only on the outside layer but very nice quality and plenty of colors to choose from, suitable for every outfit in a wardrobe. I&#x27;m very excited that I bought it, the price is very good as well. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> a very nice gift for women. it&#x27;s quite large and it didn&#x27;t cost a lot of money. it came fast in the mail</li>
            <li> loved this set alot to choose from and i only had to apply it one time for the whole day and i liked that alot i dont want to have to carry makeup around with me when i get up i want to do my makeup for the day and this worked out great,,,</li>
            <li> It is a really few pigmented. i dont like. It&#x27;s hard work to make myself. Spread a lot and does not set well on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is the second set I&#x27;ve ordered. I ordered this set for my niece for Christmas because she loves mine so much! She&#x27;s luckier than I am because this set came with eye shadow primer and mine didn&#x27;t! Now I&#x27;m jealous instead of her!! LoL</li>
            <li> i love it, the colors are nice and bright. It holds on the eyelids. It is not has glittery as I imagined but it has some glitter.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t pleased with it. Shadows reminded me of something from the dollar store and they were not very big at all!</li>
            <li> This works pretty well. Though I feel that some colors are repeated throughout the set. Basically its a good buy but its just plain glittery eye shadow. Nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of colors included in this set, some of which I would not wear but maybe someone else would. I read a few reviews on this before I purchased the item, and one review said that the further down you get into a color the more the glitter does not show up as well. I found that to be accurate, but they still are pretty. I&#x27;m not disappointed with my order. It gave me a very wide selection of colors al in one set, which is convenient. I have a rather large purse, and I carry it with all my other makeup. It came wrapped well, none of them were broken, some people had a problem with that. I would purchase them again, or as a gift for someone. I was pleased with the exception of the glitter factor that I mentioned.</li>
            <li> My son bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift last year. She loved it. He got her another one &amp; a set of makeup brushes this year. She&#x27;ll be thrilled.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be very sparkly and perfect for evening makeup. But only the top layer is sparkly. So it&#x27;s pretty deceiving. It&#x27;s still good for a matte look but if you want sparkle you won&#x27;t get that from this after the first top layer is take off. :(</li>
            <li> All of the colors are so bright and vibrant! They show up great, didn&#x27;t even know primer came with this, also awesome. If you like getting crazy with your eye makeup this is absolutely perfect! Also came super fast. I will be purchasing more of these in the future for sure. LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> It came quicker than I expected!! The pigment in both pallets are really good they last all day which is surprising because it was so cheap. I would reccommend this product to everyone</li>
            <li> LOVE ALL THE COLORS!!</li>
            <li> Love the colors they are all so bright. There is so many to wear and even the case is cute. It is very worth the price I paid for it!</li>
            <li> Love it. Recommended it to many friends, family members and co-workers. Wear it every single day. A &amp;#34;must buy&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow palette came in the mail looking perfect. It had no scratches, it was like I had bought it from the store. None of the eyeshadow was broken into pieces or scratched. Nothing! It was perfect.</li>
            <li> i love this makeup case my daughter loves makeup so this is a christmas present for her of course and the colors are very vibrate and looks just as it does in the pictures it took a little while to get it but it was worth the wait this would be a great gift for any girl or women who wears bright colors it was packaged very well and wasnt broke at all thankfully ive never had a good experiance with makeup coming thru the mail but this company made sure it was safetly packaged to where it wouldnt get banged up,i would definitly order other items from this company</li>
            <li> product is great worth the cash and the colors is remarkable, and i also love the stylish lock for the box.</li>
            <li> I just love these eyeshadow palettes where you get tons of colors to experiment with, there are many eye looks with this palette. Love It, the shadows are easy to blend, and are on the creamy side in texture.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with my order. It didn&#x27;t come in any bad condition. It was perfect. It came fast from California to Illinois. It&#x27;s the colors I was looking for. I am 18 and I love bright colors. It does come with eyeshadow primer but I never used it in my life. I don&#x27;t need to. Emori is a new brand I tried and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and my daughter absolutely loves the color pallet and case</li>
            <li> Bought this for sister for x mas. She loves it. She said its pro make up and it works great. Bought another for wife. Saved money and im out of the dawg house lol</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, an amazing amount to choose from, I bought this when I started working for festivals and faires so I could do my own fantasy make up, as well as for face painting and make up, This is an amazing set, the colors are vibrant, pretty, and really stand out, I get complemented all the time</li>
            <li> when i received this product all the palettes were broke and the lid was broke as well. i was able to use a couple of the colors but some i had to throw away.</li>
            <li> All I can say is this is a definite must have for anyone looking for glittery eyeshadow  I love it and plan on buying more</li>
            <li> I bought this palette for my daughter to use for her Color Guard makeup, but fell in love with it...I might still share.</li>
            <li> Everything from this product was amazing except for the packaging. well the box actually. the case it comes it came to me slightly broken and unable to close. luckily i have my own way of keeping the colors nice but other than that its awesome</li>
            <li> I love this product. the colors are great, and the price was great too.</li>
            <li> Little small but nice item and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Comes with very color glitter eyeshadow and lasted all day very neat has mostly all colors I needed so im pleased with this product</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m a guy, a dad and had NO CLUE whether this stuff would be any good or not.&lt;br /&gt;The ladies who received it are 1) cosmetology trained and 2) very picky.&lt;br /&gt;They love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks good on them.  I know nothing more about it than this: they seem pleased.</li>
            <li> love these glittery colors</li>
            <li> Shipped Very Quickly...Item Was Just As Described...Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Oh my my love my make up really beautiful,adds glitter and brightness to my eyes, item came on time and well packaged</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like buying this kit because I&#x27;ve noticed that many colors are the same or are very similar.&lt;br /&gt;So instead of getting 100 different colors, you&#x27;ll get something like 50-60.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy it just for that simple reason for it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> same as the neon glitter and plain eyeshadows, you get 100 pieces of child coloring book colors, not even sure if it would work on  paper either, cheap garbage, save your money buy brand names, might be a bit more expensive but at least you can use it, this the worse I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> my granddaughter just loved it.  it got here in plenty of time for Christmas and she still uses it.  the rage of colors and the price was very good</li>
            <li> I was a sceptic at first when ordering this product but when i recieved it and started using it, it was amazing color and great coverage that is actually long lasting.</li>
            <li> Got these for a christmas gift for my daughter , they are very pretty colors and were as expected. she uses many different makeups but this is one of her favorites</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the colors are very nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I got this palette as a gift from my mom for Christmas. It&#x27;s beauty! The colors are wonderful, and I read in the other reviews that the palette arrived broken but mine was in perfect condition. Plus when I opened the lid, I smelled this nice powdery scent that I love. This is an awesome palette!</li>
            <li> I sent all &amp;#34;DAMAGED ITEMS AND SHADOWS&amp;#34; were coming well sealed but if any signs you dropped was a failure .. very sad with my wife when they opened not recommend</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this make up set, these are colors I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else, I will be defiantly be buying more of this product, I have been looking for these colors at every store and couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere, I  love  this product</li>
            <li> Love all of the colors. You really dont&#x27; need to put a lot on in order for the color to show</li>
            <li> its only sparkly on the surface, dont buy it</li>
            <li> I really is what I expected</li>
            <li> The eye shadows work really well. The size of them was what kind of through me off but other then that if you do not use so much makeup each day these are a great choice for anyone who likes colorful sparking colors.</li>
            <li> I just received my eye shadows today! I was really excited when i opened the package. It is exactly what i ordered. I ordered this June 13, 2012 and it was here at my house already in two days and i had choose the standard shipping 5-9 days. So i was really impressed when it was here early. None of the eye shadows where cracked or anything either. That was my main concern this whole time but they where all in perfect condition.  I haven&#x27;t used my eye shadows yet but i am excited to. I would order these again in the future.</li>
            <li> Do not buy!! Terrible!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great , and  it came  as expected.</li>
            <li> omg!!!!! came sooner then expected, I&#x27;m having a blast mixing and matching the colors this is awesome, will add pics soon, I&#x27;m a dark skin girl and these colors go very well with me, it sparkles so it lives up to its name! very pleased!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice variety of well pigmented colors. One was slightly chipped , but other than that, I think this was well worth the price.This has a lot of nice glitzy shades and the color are vibrant. Would make a nice gift for someone who likes makeup or who is just starting to use it.Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this item all the stars is due to when I received the case the lid was broken off. After maybe one or two uses one of the tips of the brushes broke off. Yes, all colors are beautiful and popped and I have gotten tons of compliments on the colors of. This product over all was nice and came with a free tube of eye shadow primer.</li>
            <li> I was fascinated by the variety of colors and brightest of them just what they wanted.</li>
            <li> love this very pretty this is well worth the money I really recomed this it is sooooooooo nice all the color</li>
            <li> She had had this on her wishlist for well over a year...I had kept asking her for ideas....but they didn&#x27;t change.  So I went with this one and she was delighted.  I thought the color palette was HUGE....</li>
            <li> I love it SO much.&lt;br /&gt;It came in the mail rather quickly, which makes me super duper happy. One of my biggest concerns was having a cracked mirror, or cracked eye shadows. But it came in a super perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Since i just barely got it in the mail i haven&#x27;t used it yet, but the colors are just ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.&lt;br /&gt;I am so very happy that I ordered this product, to the point where I think I might cry.&lt;br /&gt;They are just so perfect. And I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> love the colors and the pigment is really good better then urban decay even..</li>
            <li> I loooooooveeeeee ittttttt. All color in one. It is just the type of color every woman should have.  It is just perfect also to Cary on a normal size bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this on my brother&#x27;s account a few months ago, I&#x27;ve finally gotten around to actually review it properly, before i just used it, but now that i paid attention; i can honestly say I&#x27;ve spent my money wisely on this purchase. I needed some pearl eye-shadows and was thinking about investing in the NYX pearl pigments, because a friend of mine had it and its amazing. But before i bought the NYX set for around $50, im so happy i came across this set, this works just as well, if even better than the NYX because these eyeshadows dont crumble as much and dont fall as you apply as the NYX had when i used it. Anyway i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This pallet have pretty colors, but, the colors don&#x27;t last long. Just a couple of hours of wear, it start to either run or fade.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I have made in makeup. This item arrived in order no broken pieces and the colors are remarkable. It took a little while to arrive but I am simply enjoying this. I have a color to match any outfit and any occasion. I love the fact that the manufacturer took time to package the item in order that it would not break or shift during shipping. I am so happy about this purchase and would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> dont use it often, but it will last a long time.  hard to tell, but there is glitter in them.  many color choices, almost every color.  would recomend!</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about buying makeup online, but I needed a shimmer/sparkling eyeshadow to mess around with because I had never worn stuff like that and wanted to try it. I have been doing makeup for about ten years. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot to try it. I normally buy MAC, Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder, and Revlon products. This honestly puts up some competition with the other eye shadows! It comes in gorgeous shades, great pigmentation, and no fallout. This is a wonderful product, and I will be purchasing from Emori again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for 12th birthday. She is just getting in to make up and loves trying all of the colors out. They are all very bright and sparkly which she loves, perfect for a pre-teen who is just starting out with make up!</li>
            <li> I love this thing. The colors are as solid as you want. There isn&#x27;t that cheap translucent look that pack on until you see something significant. This has the opaqueness of cream shadow but just a powder. It is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, absolutely loves it! thank you so much for everything, it looks awesome on A+! Woo hoo cant wait</li>
            <li> The picture LOOKS like it&#x27;d be a glitter palette.  But the packaging CLEARLY states it is PEARL eyeshadow.  DEFINITELY not my idea of glitter.  The seller would do well to change the product description.  The palette IS nice and I would have returned it except that I was planning on ordering a pearl eyeshadow kit at some point in the future.  Now, I will have to wait to find some REAL glitter eyeshadow palettes.</li>
            <li> I got this product really fast and I love it! love the colors and the shimmer... Case was scratched a little on the outside but other that then that love it..</li>
            <li> On opening package, everything was on me and everywhere, and I&#x27;m not exaggerating.  All the colors on both sides of palette were in loose powder form and was messy messy.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ahhh how i love this eyeshadow it is so bright ! I dont like it how small the actual colors are and how a brush can eaily dig into them but they are wonderfull!!!!</li>
            <li> All the colors are very pretty.  Love that you have a great variety to choose from.  They go on easy but you must be careful cause they do break up easy.  Not bad for the money. Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter as a gift, she loves the colors, they are really nice, bright and useful.</li>
            <li> Not bad however I wasn&#x27;t expecting the eye shadow squares to be so small and to be so limited to a few uses wouldn&#x27;t pay that price for it again but the eye shadow it&#x27;s self was decent</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye shadow palette!! The color&#x27;s are Beautiful and Vibrant!! If your looking for glitter eye shadow that is Not over bearing on the glitter then this would be a great buy for you.  The eye shadow applies so smoothly.  You can see the glitter in the product but it is just the right amount...not to little and not to much but just right!! If your trying to decide on purchasing this or not give it a try I think you will love it and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> With this you get what you pay for. All in all i love my purchase and have uses it every day since the arrival. the powder is a little bigger then a dime and the case even has a mirror at the top. recommended for any learning make up  and just really starting a collection.</li>
            <li> Love my eye shadows the colors are of really good quality. They came intact a bit small but what more can you ask for with the price. I love my eye shadows I was worried the would came broken but they didn&#x27;t the case came a little cracked but that&#x27;s ok... over all I would recommend this product definitely not for kids to play with .</li>
            <li> its broken palette when it shipped and its powder color .i dont like.when u see picture it looks nice.waste of money</li>
            <li> The case itself was a wee bit scratched and some of the colors were chipped but still very nice makeup!</li>
            <li> much smaller pallets then i expected n not really glittery but beautiful colors</li>
            <li> I hope more big the palette but it is enough because have a nice and cute colors thanks on time</li>
            <li> I loved the glitter eyeshadow because it has a variety of colors and look gorgeous.</li>
            <li> this is great. It has every color in it that is missing in other ones. I use it mainly at night when I go out.</li>
            <li> I have gotten my make up today. Everything is good, but I did think that it was going to be bigger. The little make up squares are small.&lt;br /&gt;But other then that it was good. The shipping was fast. I have not tried the makeup yet but I&#x27;m sure it will be fine.</li>
            <li> It is a really nice selection of eyeshadow colors. Eyeshadow goes on smoothly with no creasing throughout the day. It is a great value.</li>
            <li> I must rate this product with a 3/5 because it is literally just okay. I enjoy the variety and the price. I do not like how loose the eye shadow is. The product arrived with several broken pallets, so many colors were mixed up from the beginning, but even with owning it, the eye shadow immediately turns to loose powder upon use.  The product also doesn&#x27;t apply well: It takes several coats and careful application to achieve the desired color. The color/product doesn&#x27;t last long either, and removes EASILY, even without being touched. The case comes with an inner mirror which is nice.</li>
            <li> Eye shadows pigment is not all that great it fall off while u put it on n its not glittery its just the color u get!! Over all te product is ok not good not great</li>
            <li> I bought this for me niece because she all grown up at like 8 years old and wanted REAL makeup not that kiddy stuff.</li>
            <li> These are the most beautiful eyeshadow I have ever seen!!! They wear beautifully too. They arrived quickly. The customer service of this company is FABULOUS!!! Thank you so very much for having a great product and being very helpful.</li>
            <li> just got it all in tact i dont wear makeup excessively so this will last me a very long time good buy for the price thank you</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous. It goes on so silky smooth and last for hours and hours without needing a touch-up.</li>
            <li> love love love the colors are just as bright as shown they stay that bright when applied and the best part is it was only 10 bucks for all these colors</li>
            <li> BUENAS TARDES SRES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LA PRESENTE ES CON LA FINALIDAD DE INFORMARLE QUE ESTE PRODUCTOS LLEGO DAÑADO EN ALGUNAS DE LAS SOMBRAS, ES COMO SI NO FUE EMPAQUETADO CORRECTAMENTE Y RECIBIERA UN GOLPE Y LAS SOMBRAS SE VOLVIERON POLVO....</li>
            <li> This works great for costumes.  A huge selection of colors for not a lot of money.  you would think it would be huge by the picture, but it really isn&#x27;t.  Each square is small, but enough for the purpose I bought it for.</li>
            <li> alot of these colors are great.....only tried a few so far. lots of choices for not much money.  will play with it more.</li>
            <li> I just received it today and I ordered it on Wednesday great delivery the colors are wonderful also ...not to glittery and its sort of powdery but rather bright I only Tried on one color so far and it&#x27;s good other than that one of the colors were broken when I received it which is no problem because its cheap and things do happen buy can&#x27;t wait to try the others</li>
            <li> All the glitter is on the surface.  Nothing is beneath but plain powder.  I could have got this at the Dollar Store.</li>
            <li> there is only top glitter on the eye shaddow , lots of them were broken , but made them work no glitter on the bottom, the color wears off in a matter of hours</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister and when I seen it I feel in love with all the beautiful colors. I have to buy one for myself!!!</li>
            <li> this product was amazing i love it its have so many funky colors i would recomend this if you like to club</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow Makeup did not have enough glitter but case was impressive and there were many colors but a small amount for each color.&lt;br /&gt;would not order again.</li>
            <li> First one I recieved was broken.. very sad but they sent me another one and it wasn&#x27;t broken so all in all still happy but... when I get something in the mail I expect user ready</li>
            <li> as advertised very good product.</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this set. They are super bright and easy to apply. They also blend well and look great with or without a primer underneath. They smell really perfume-y, though, and that is kind of offputting, especially when the compact is first opened. There were a couple of repeated colors, but overall a really great range of colors and shades to choose from. Really fun to play with, but s few of the colors are a little irritating to skin and to eyes in general so be careful and pay attention to which ones you used so you can avoid them in the future. I;ll be using the irritating ones for polymer clay coloring and shimmer.</li>
            <li> This is perfect to sample colors and experiment a little without having to buy bigger eyeshadow . Perfect for trying new things out .</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty but it seems like there is only enough to use each shade maybe 3 times at the most.</li>
            <li> Exelente quality it was a i spected great color y nice case I loved definitely i ll buy again th</li>
            <li> My item came a lot sooner than I thought it would and was in great shape. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the only glitter in it is a very thin layer on the top.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised with this item I purchased from amazon. It was so inexpensive that I thought &amp;#34;who cares if the eyeshadows suck, it doesn&#x27;t cost that much anyway and it&#x27;s worth a try&amp;#34;. Well, the eyeshades ended up looking fabulous. I still can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it was considering the quality and amount you get. It is totally worth it. I do suggest putting on some sort of base underneath the eyeshadows though before. That way the color looks more vibrant. Totally worth ever penny!</li>
            <li> The colors and quality of these eye shadows are just great!I have used many different brands trying to ind an alternative to the crazy expensive brands that a lot of people cant afford, and this is most def a great investment!!</li>
            <li> The colors are even more different than the picture then to be expected, but the biggest issue is the fact that,even with primer, the color on my eyelids isn&#x27;t nearly as vibrant, or powerful as it is when it gets all over my under-eyes and cheeks. Even being affordable and quite a few colors...I&#x27;m not thinking it&#x27;s really worth it. Next time I will be buying a better product. Spend the extra few dollars and do that,too.</li>
            <li> I adore this palette. I usually don&#x27;t buy palettes because there are several colors I won&#x27;t use but I indeed use every color in this one. Lots of the colors go very well together and blend very nicely. I use it every day. Five stars hands down.</li>
            <li> Beautiful jewel colors lots to pick from they all go on really nice would definitely buy it again and very cheap others cost much more.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my niece and when she received it the blush was broken.  They need to wrap this idem more securely.</li>
            <li> THIS IS TOTALLY AWESOME I AM LOVING THIS EYESHADOW TO DEATH IT IS TOTALLY AWESOME AND CAME ON ATIME!LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift.  The person receiving it has used it every day and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Super impressed with the true to color pigments as well as the solid coverage in the pigment without having to apply a base/primer! Perfect for anyone looking for a variety, good quality, and an affordable price!</li>
            <li> I loved this eyeshadow palette.  The colors were very vibrant &amp; glittery . Great for club and party looks :-)</li>
            <li> Bought this for a Christmas present and it was a big hit!  All the colors are gorgeous and apply fairly well.</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous, I would definitely get it again.</li>
            <li> Got mine broken😯😢BUT luckily they sent me a new one😆 and i definitely loved it... its just a really small amount of makeup in the spaces.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow is wonderful. Brilliant colors compliment each other and can make just about any look. You can go for.a real pop or a more subdued look. The only problem is with the shipping. I got my first palette and a lot of the colors had crumbled and mixed making a sort of grey dust I had to blow off. I contacted the seller and they said to keep it and sent another. I appreciated this but the second palette arrived jn the same condition.</li>
            <li> Love love love all the colors!!!</li>
            <li> This pallette is amazing! The price is great and so is the quality. My package arrived unbroken and undamaged. The packaging itself was very well done. The pallete itself was secured in a box, which was wrapped tightly in large bubble wrap, which was secured in the shipping box. These are very beautifull colors and stay on great! I was a little wary of ordering it in fear that some of the colors would be broken, but I am HIGHLY satissfied! A++ THANKS SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> I just got this one and I love it so much already it was shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the others reviews. The shimmer or glitter is only on the top. Once the top layer is rubbed off there is no more sparkle.</li>
            <li> very much in love with all the colors! they are fun and very easy to &amp;#34;mesh&amp;#34; the only downfall is the colors are a little to soft which makes it feel you might waste some if you tip it. but the colors are amazing! the neon green if used right under your bottom lashes makes your eyes POP but i use that when i have yellow and orange above, you may think that is crazy but the color makes my very dark blue eyes pop and i have gotten a lot of compliments on all the colors :) a little goes a long way with these!!!!</li>
            <li> It is great many colors and shades the only thing is once you use a color it breaks that is the only down fall</li>
            <li> It was way smaller than I expected. It might be enough to wear twice then you would run out of the color.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and they last and don&#x27;t wear off like most of the eye shadow do. wish I had pallet 2  to see how they work on your eyes.  But this is a must get. You&#x27;ll love it like me.  :  )</li>
            <li> I really liked these had it not been for the mail service that broke nearly 20 of the shadows. I had to work to clean up the mess and repair what I could by pressing them back down with an eye shadow brush. There needs to be a better way to mail these as soft and brittle as they can be. Otherwise I loved the colors!</li>
            <li> muy bueno el producto me encanto los colores bellos demasiado rico tienen que comprar uno para que vean de que le hablo</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the product except I think they need to put more cushions around it. I understand things happen during shipment but since this is a fragile item I felt more care should be taken. Only 2 of them were broken so other than that, I was happy.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY! Bought this item for a friend for her birthday a month ago. It said it took up to 3-5 business days. It&#x27;s just now shipping. It&#x27;s supposed to be there by the end of this month. Had I known for sure it was going to take so long I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this. How does it change from 3-5 days to 2 months after purchasing? Stupid. I won&#x27;t buy another thing from this particular company ever again. I am very angry about this.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow came in one piece and was in good shape. It was a little powdery to use, but that happens with cheaper eye shadow.</li>
            <li> i bought it, and came as a broken box, much of dyes was broken, so i re send it back</li>
            <li> when i got this in the mail the case was broken in two spots and one of the eye shadows was crumbled but other then that the eye shadow is pretty and goes on nicely iv read other review and i guess a few people got about the same thing so id be carful ordering this item.</li>
            <li> Very easy open box with a sheet of plastic between ea plate and you can take out the plate also from the holding box. Has easy tabs on the to seperate the plates. Just would be nice if they came with applicators. Seems like when you get eye shadw you have to buy seperate applicators. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> It is amazing. the colors are bright and go on to lid well. would deffinatly buy again if i run out. they do power up and blow away easily if it gets a little breaze from some one moving or blowing on it.</li>
            <li> I love all the beautiful colors</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup, I use it everyday and mix the colors :) Great to use for daily use, or for parties.</li>
            <li> Play make up, good value.</li>
            <li> tis really great colors, it just tends to crumble</li>
            <li> i use them everyday. thank you very much</li>
            <li> I love it thats all i have to say</li>
            <li> I love this pallette the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five is because it is no glitter at all but it is very shimmery and wet looking like a cream beautiful colors</li>
            <li> works sumwhat for how i wanted to use it for but to me it was cheap and shadow really does not last long</li>
            <li> We got it and my daughter wrapped it up for a present for her friend. When her friend opened it up she loved it but when she took it out of the box, the shadows had all broken up in shipping. We had to go the store to buy her another one. I guess it was too delicate for shipment.</li>
            <li> Delivered super fast!  Thank you!  Delivered in great condition.  Easy to open.  Colors are very true, even on my dark skin.  Smooth metallic pearl-like finish.  Looks like a cream shadow!  Very happy with this purchase.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Again not for me, it was a gift but the person i gave it to said it was like velvet on her eyelids so that sounds good to me!</li>
            <li> When I read some of the reviews about how when you receive them they are messed up due to shipping, I was a bit worried. I live in a rural area, and sometimes my boxes get messed up, even if they&#x27;re not prone to it. However, when I received them this morning, they were perfect! So vibrant, you can have any look you want, whether it&#x27;s subtle or all out hot pink, you&#x27;ve got it. The only one I&#x27;ve had trouble with is the yellow one(s). They just don&#x27;t stick; they rub off at the lightest touch. But, that&#x27;s fine with me because I wouldn&#x27;t really wear it anyway. All of the other colors stick wonderfully, and they seem to be long lasting. I love them!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, product was great very pleased with it and we received it fast. Very exciting</li>
            <li> Its goes on with ease and last all day. I tried it loved it but there is just not enough of it</li>
            <li> I ordered glitter eye shadow. This is not what I wanted.... so unhappy</li>
            <li> Ordered 1 first and loved it then ordered 3 more for my girlfriends...the variety of colors is great and not too bright</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the most well put together pallets I have seen in a long while. when i say &#x27;put together&#x27; i mean the case sonstruction. the case is hard and the clasp locks into place so easily and efficiently that i sat an played with it for a few minutes to see if i could break it easily.. i could not. The pallet itself is very nice as well. The colors are pretty and pearlescent. These are smaller shadows then probably most are used to but with so many colors you really should not run out fast unless you are always using 2-3 colors. These go on smoothly and are silky to touch, they last all day from what i have seen (i paired them with the primer) and the ONLY thing i could say bad about these is the smell when you first open them, its very powdery and it made me wrinkle my nose up, this goes away after they air out a bit but it was a bit offensive at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> ok i love this but the eye shadow is kind of powdery when u put your brush to it. so u dont have to put alot on your brush. recieved in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> Love all the colors! And came before the date it say.was so happy.</li>
            <li> These eye shadows go on smooth and bright i love them especially for the price! I will buy again definetly</li>
            <li> I bought this palette thinking it would be very sparkly and it wasn&#x27;t.  The quality is very cheap and the they are very crumbly and chalky.  I don&#x27;t recommend spending the money on it</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the color selection and boldness of the colors; bold but tasteful, a yound persons dream come true.</li>
            <li> Some of my make up was broken.... Like it had been dropped. Other than that, I love the colors! I like trying it with different outfits!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made...  I had to have this sent to me twice because the first time it was packaged badly and most everything was broke and I was not able to use it. Then the second one was also poorly wrapped but only a couple was broke and I did not feel like dealing with it anymore so i just dealt with it. The colors on the other hand was just what I wanted and look very pretty on. Just wish that the seller would have put more into shipping the product.</li>
            <li> awesome range of colors, and apply smooth and even</li>
            <li> I loved the colors and sparkles!</li>
            <li> Great product. It came with an eyeshadow primer which helps as some of the colors are not as vibrant as i would have wanted.</li>
            <li> I am working so I need make -up that will last all day and that&#x27;s what this make- up does, I apply it in the morning and I don&#x27;t have to reapply for the entire day and the colors are just right for my wardrobe every color you could think about, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow! It has just a hint of sparkle and the colors are so bright! It lasts all day too!</li>
            <li> Good price and many bright colors</li>
            <li> The package came right on time. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try them yet but so far I&#x27;m pleased. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because when I got it a couple of the eye-shadows had some minor chips in them but other than that they are beautiful and well worth the price. :)</li>
            <li> Well, i had an issue with my 100 piece glitter eyeshadows. i got the first palette and unfortunately part of the eyeshadows set was worn out, completely damaged :( i was so sad because i was waiting for them anxiously (couldn&#x27;t sleep just thinking about all those beautiful colors i was going to get in the mail ;-) ) so then i called Amazon right away and told them what happened, they contact the seller and requested a new palette Charter-Inc was right on it!!!! i got a response from then really fast i was pleasantly surprised on how fast they responded and mail me a new palette the NEXT DAY!!! in no time i had my beautiful eyeshadows; i looooooove them. im so in love with them i wish i could sleep with them to use them as a pillow ;-) teehee I WILL buy from CHARTER-INC again no doubt, and i will definitely recommend them to friends and family. GREAT SELLER, FAST SERVICE!!! LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> Love all nice color full colors</li>
            <li> What a rip off! Ladies do not buy this product.  It is not glitter shadow, it&#x27;s a pearl shadow. Only the very surface of the shadow is glittery. Not only that but the actual colors are off from what you actually get. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this so I could use that beautiful champagne color at the top on the left. When I got it, it is not so pretty. None of them are. The pigmentation is poor. I didn&#x27;t listen to the reviews because I wanted to see it for myself, but please listen to me. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I received these like 2 days after ordering so shipped very fast! Only 2 eye shadows were messed up when it arrived so they are unusable which is why the 4 stars. However the eye shadow goes on smooth and is brite! They look exactly like the picture :) Stays on through out the day! Perfect if your looking for an arrangement of colors!</li>
            <li> Well I recieved my order on time, the packaging was great. I opened the order only to find the mirror cracked and a few of the colors were crumbled. I must say the palette itself is beautiful however, the eyeshadows in the palette are chalky and not a good look for the look I&#x27;m trying to create.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s colors you are looking for, this is the palette for you!  The shadows arrived quickly and unbroken.  I would recommend this palette!</li>
            <li> A gift for my daughter and she was very excited to recieve this gift. Beautiful and everything it said it was. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Its comes with many colors, but there is not much of each, and they run out fast.  Would probably buy again, just for the variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I love the product but the mirror was broken when I received it..I will not be using the mirror I guess..but it was shipped on time and it is exactly what I expected..I am still happy with the service..</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, thank you!!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. I bought this for prom makeup, its very chalky. They&#x27;re &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got it in the mail, but when I opened it one of the eye shadow&#x27;s were completely shattered and it got all over the other eye shadows, also I wish the colors showed up better. I wish they were more vibrant. Not really what I was expecting and wasn&#x27;t happy with the way it came in with the eye shadow broken. &gt;.&gt;</li>
            <li> PRODUCT ARRIVED ON TIME, ITS JUST LIKE IT WAS DESCRIBED, VERY PLEASED WITH THE WHOLE PROCESS!  MY DAUGHTER LOVED ALL THE COLORS!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:b6dd6601cc81c548d3faacba5a5a1729]] Love all the colors here!! Beautiful variety of shimmer eye shadows. These are going to look amazing in my next photo shoot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this case and the way it keeps everything closed and tidy in my makeup bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a little shallow, so I do not expect them to last a super long time. I love the label sheet for keeping track of exactly what color I used. Helps with consistency when you have to do touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the video to see the full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.
