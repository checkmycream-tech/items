            <li>I used this product one night and loved it immediately.</li>
            <li>You do not need to reapply but the stuff feels so good</li>
            <li>I tried it in my legs before bed and immediately loved it.</li>
            <li>(most perfumed moisturizer doesn&#x27;t agree with me, so this is a great solution)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the purchase and will buy it again!</li>
            <li>The scent was amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is really a nice moisturizer I ever had.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, \\&quot;lotiony\\&quot; scent, but it isn&#x27;t strong at all</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Best Body Lotion ever.&lt;br /&gt;I will go the extra mile to get my hands on this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>tried and used many others before, but this one delivers what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although its not my holy grail for hands, I love it as a body lotion.</li>
            <li>The BEST lotion for dry cracking skin, skin was smooth in morning after putting at night.  </li>
            <li>Although the scent is a bit strong, it doesn&#x27;t seem to clash with perfume</li>
            <li>The first time I applied the lotion it felt nice on my skin</li>
            <li>This is a light lotion which does the job of heavier lotions</li>
            <li>lightly scented, the cream applies smoothly</li>
            <li>I now feel comfortable in shorts.</li>
            <li>After 4 days of using this lotion, my crustyfeet ahve softened, my legs no longer look like croc skin, and is smooth and silky to the touch.</li>
            <li>This has not held true for the Nivea Body Extended Moisture Lotion.  </li>
            <li>If you really have ry skin you will love this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and feels good enough, but it&#x27;s not long before my skin feels like it did before I applied it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smooth and absorbs very fast.</li>
            <li>In general, I have liked Nivea products and found them to do what they claim.  </li>
            <li>I put this on right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>This lotion is sticky when first put on and has a medicine type smell.</li>
            <li>skin is soft and comfortable and not greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, without leaving any sticky residue, and my skin remains incredibly soft all day.</li>
            <li>Works like magic even on my dry, scaly, exzema skin.</li>
            <li>The scent actually gives me a headache, it&#x27;s that strong.</li>
            <li>I do not put lotion on a lot an needed to get my legs summer ready.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s done nothing to stop or minimize tiny white dryness lines, nor create greater smoothness.  </li>
            <li>I have eczema, and often it becomes exacerbated by lotions, particularly Nivea...</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviews that this lotion does absorb quickly and it keeps rough skin smooth longer than other lotions, but, the scent is too strong.</li>
            <li>my skin was still very soft, supple, and silky.</li>
            <li>My skin is normally dry to dry, and most of the lotions I had tried were too lightweight, too greasy, or so thick I could not get the pump to bring the lotion to the top of the bottle</li>
            <li>Back to slightly greasier stuff that lasts longer and makes my skin look and feel better.</li>
            <li>Dont confuse the fast absorbtion to your skin being dry again.</li>
            <li>your skin is dry and mature, like mine, you would use anything else....</li>

            <li> It seems to last a lot longer on the skin and has helped take away some rough dry spots I had.  </li>
            <li> But it does work well on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slathering my hands each night before bed, and waking up to still dry hands.  </li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few days now, thinking perhaps the effects would be cumulative, but no, it just doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>

            <li> I didnt need to wipe my palms down like I have had to with other lotions.</li>
            <li> My exzema usually flares up around this time of year</li>
            <li> From the first use, I knew I had found what I was looking for, and I have not been disappointed in my purchase at any time.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly, no strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> I was immediately skeptical when my skin felt dry 3 mins after applying it after my shower.</li>
            <li> Flakes mean your skin is dry and needs moisture, so your lotion has failed.</li>
            <li> comparable to an expensive moisturizer i was</li>
            <li> And not that expensive.</li>
            <li> so I stock up on my expensive $16 bottle lotion and Triamcinolone ointment, however, I was pressed for cash and tried this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This lotion is sticky when first put on and has a medicine type smell. But it does work well on dry skin. However I will be going back to Nivea Express Hydration lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a light lotion which does the job of heavier lotions well. I keep it at my desk at work to use throughout the day.</li>
            <li> comparable to an expensive moisturizer i was&lt;br /&gt;using!  lightly scented, the cream applies smoothly&lt;br /&gt;to the skin with no after effect feeling it sitting on your&lt;br /&gt;face.  cant beat the price as an amazon add on!</li>
            <li> In general, I have liked Nivea products and found them to do what they claim.  This has not held true for the Nivea Body Extended Moisture Lotion.  The label trumpets \\&quot;Non-stop -Hydra IQ-  48 hrs\\&quot;.  Not even close.  It goes on nicely and feels good enough, but it&#x27;s not long before my skin feels like it did before I applied it.  Yes, it&#x27;s non-greasy, but it&#x27;s sort of non-anything.  I&#x27;ve used it a few days now, thinking perhaps the effects would be cumulative, but no, it just doesn&#x27;t last.  I&#x27;ve been slathering my hands each night before bed, and waking up to still dry hands.  It&#x27;s done nothing to stop or minimize tiny white dryness lines, nor create greater smoothness.  Back to slightly greasier stuff that lasts longer and makes my skin look and feel better.</li>
            <li> This is really a nice moisturizer I ever had. Extended moisture - the name of the product - justifies the product! I am satisfied with the purchase and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 months and would not use anything else. The hand cream is great as well.</li>
            <li> Best lotion in the world...and I&#x27;ve tried them all because my daughter has eczema. This is her go-to lotion for that as well. I put this on right out of the shower. It dries quickly, without leaving any sticky residue, and my skin remains incredibly soft all day. It has a pleasant, \\&quot;lotiony\\&quot; scent, but it isn&#x27;t strong at all and it dissipates almost immediately. (Lots of scented lotions give me a headache; this one does not.) I have bottles of this in every bathroom, and in my car and at work.</li>
            <li> I used this product one night and loved it immediately. The scent was amazing.  I got a sample and buying a while bottle now. Love it. And not that expensive.</li>
            <li> The BEST lotion for dry cracking skin, skin was smooth in morning after putting at night.  Dries quickly, no strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> I do not put lotion on a lot an needed to get my legs summer ready. This stuff did the trick. I now feel comfortable in shorts. If you really have ry skin you will love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth and absorbs very fast. I didnt need to wipe my palms down like I have had to with other lotions. You do not need to reapply but the stuff feels so good you want to. Dont confuse the fast absorbtion to your skin being dry again. The test to see if your lotion is working is to apply lotion wait about 20- 30 mins and scratch your skin and see if it flakes. No flakes means your lotion is keeping your  skin moisturized. Flakes mean your skin is dry and needs moisture, so your lotion has failed.</li>
            <li> Nivea soaks into my skin and last especially on my feet and ankles as well as my elbows and hands</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY dry skin. My exzema usually flares up around this time of year so I stock up on my expensive $16 bottle lotion and Triamcinolone ointment, however, I was pressed for cash and tried this product.I was immediately skeptical when my skin felt dry 3 mins after applying it after my shower. I went to bed pissed. When I woke up the next morning my skin was still very soft, supple, and silky. After 4 days of using this lotion, my crustyfeet ahve softened, my legs no longer look like croc skin, and is smooth and silky to the touch. I have not even had to use any of my steriod cream for my exzema.  I LOVE this product.  Works like magic even on my dry, scaly, exzema skin.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that this lotion does absorb quickly and it keeps rough skin smooth longer than other lotions, but, the scent is too strong. The first time I applied the lotion it felt nice on my skin but I was overwhelmed by the scent and had to apply something else to mask the perfume of this lotion. The scent actually gives me a headache, it&#x27;s that strong. I wanted to like this product but the scent is too overpowering. I&#x27;m using this up and moving on to something else.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the brand name. I recommend this product for people that wash their hands regularly and have chopped up skin. My skin is healed after using this product for one week.</li>
            <li> This lotion went above and beyond my expectations!! It moisturized my skin and it stayed that way all day. Will be purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  It seems to last a lot longer on the skin and has helped take away some rough dry spots I had.  Only gripe I have is that it sort of leaves skin &#x27;sticky&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Best Body Lotion ever.&lt;br /&gt;I will go the extra mile to get my hands on this one.&lt;br /&gt;I tried and used many others before, but this one delivers what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;I your skin is dry and mature, like mine, you would use anything else....it is that good!</li>
            <li> My skin is normally dry to dry, and most of the lotions I had tried were too lightweight, too greasy, or so thick I could not get the pump to bring the lotion to the top of the bottle so it could be applied.  From the first use, I knew I had found what I was looking for, and I have not been disappointed in my purchase at any time.  And--for an extra hurrah, it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> I got this in a Target beauty bag... I tried it in my legs before bed and immediately loved it. I have eczema, and often it becomes exacerbated by lotions, particularly Nivea... Not so from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is soft and comfortable and not greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do often mix in my perfume when I use it, and it is a great way to layer scent. Although the scent is a bit strong, it doesn&#x27;t seem to clash with perfume (most perfumed moisturizer doesn&#x27;t agree with me, so this is a great solution)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although its not my holy grail for hands, I love it as a body lotion.</li>
