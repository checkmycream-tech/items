            <li>Ive incoporated biotin vitamins i must say my hair has never been this healthy.</li>
            <li>Many of you guys were not born when this smell was around...</li>
            <li>I am a Man, and now balding up top....</li>
            <li>I think that I am gonna totally satisfied with the product; because my three daughters and I have started to notice some changes to our hair.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>

            <li>i love it  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t listen.</li>
            <li>I love the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>use the oil in many ways.</li>
            <li>For overnight treatments, I use more amount of oil, apply both to my scalp and the length of my hair, don a shower cap and shampoo out in the morning.</li>
            <li>this helps someone :)</li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>Love using it on my hair.</li>
            <li>dabur amla hair oil is ok for me.  </li>
            <li>All I see difference on my hair is shining more.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair gets after more use.</li>
            <li>it it more tolerable.</li>
            <li>does not seem to help,maybe I need to use it more often</li>
            <li>Its worth it!!</li>
            <li>I would lightly apply to the top of my hair but not getting it on my roots or on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Works, but smell is to strong.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil over two months ago but was put off by the strong smell</li>
            <li>but the smell is strong</li>
            <li>The oil has a strong scent but after i kept using it i am already used to it</li>
            <li>I must say it has been about 2 yrs that i stopped using strong chemically hair products.</li>
            <li>I mix it with my conditioner so the scent isn&#x27;t too strong......</li>
            <li>think it is too strong to use by itself</li>
            <li>but this smells just like PURE AFRO SHEEN !!!...  </li>
            <li>My hair is really growing nicely.</li>
            <li>My hairline is great, and I don&#x27;t have to be ashamed of pulling all my hair back now!</li>
            <li>I could immediately feel my hair become smooth as I put it on.</li>
            <li>otherwise, wash out after an hour or so-will render same great results.</li>
            <li>but until then it will stay in my bathroom cabinet for only emergencies but GREAT product.</li>
            <li>Also, keep in mind that just because this product made my hair shiny and silky smooth</li>
            <li>And the price is really cheap for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>But for now don&#x27;t be turned away because of remarks about the smell because you will miss out on a great hair conditioner, that definitely doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li>This oil helps smooth it out and keep in moisture, so it shines healthfully.</li>
            <li>Rug cleaner for pet stains, maybe-- a cheap, chemical deodorant smell.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been told it smells like the inside of a Goodwill store), but overall works great.  </li>
            <li>I love that my hair looks healthy too, and feels much stronger.</li>
            <li>Amla oil is good for natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>A hot pressing comb and a stocking cap!!</li>
            <li>I mix this with my conditioner and deep condition for about 45 mins , my hair feels amazing after and super healthy !</li>
            <li>No wonder indian women has gorgeous long healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Ok first off this oil is stinky</li>
            <li>too soon to tell - need to use it more consistently</li>
            <li>My experience with Amla oils in general has been good.</li>
            <li>A LOT like the original Pine Sol floor cleaner.</li>
            <li>I will give update when I see significant hair growth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting softer and longer even ticker, specially for me.</li>
            <li>but this is special.  </li>
            <li>make me scratched all night, full of synthetic oil, got refund from amazon</li>
            <li>I have to turn on the room air filter at full blast just to eliminate the smell.</li>
            <li>I am still using it once a week but really wish my schedule would allow me to do it more.</li>
            <li>this is a good product to have the bottle is big and it norishes my hair</li>
            <li>I feel like my hair has more volume and actually feels healthy which is really important to me.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product doesn&#x27;t even bother me its not bad at all.</li>
            <li>and I can tell a tremendous difference from before.</li>
            <li>It gave it more shine as well, and a big thing that made me love this product</li>
            <li>but my hair was so soft and most importantly it stopped shedding.</li>
            <li>Oil, of course, can be beneficial, but I didn&#x27;t see extraordinary results.  </li>
            <li>I have trichotillomania and heard good things about this oil, and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>It is also  leave-in herbal treatment, but has a sweet, fresh scent.)</li>
            <li>and my hair feels more supple and better moisturized  now in spite of the dry weather than it did months ago in the summer.</li>
            <li>I think the smell is worth the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I would say it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft, moisturized, shiny, tangle-free, thick, beautiful, and healthy.</li>
            <li>It does help deep conditioning the hair, but there are number of other more pleasant choices.  </li>
            <li>Really,  the smell is not bad at all; however, it may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li>Turns out canola oil is rich in vitamin E as well as has high contents of Omega</li>
            <li>but I loved that I saw growth and less hair fall.</li>
            <li>So far I have not used it as a pre shampoo conditioner because the smell is a bit too strong</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably the only con :)</li>
            <li>First I want to start by saying this oil does not stink.</li>
            <li>It was my first time using this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update end of July: I am almost through my first bottle</li>
            <li>I use and enjoy all the natural oils for hair and body.</li>
            <li>If I had read the ingredients first, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Maybe greasy hair should avoid this product in the first place.</li>
            <li>I love learning hair tips and oil from different</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the cost was reasonable, thus making whatever the benefits are worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>So this product does exactly what it says...</li>
            <li>It actually reminds me of a hair grease when I was a kid &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love this deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>great thick oil</li>
            <li>but Im not too found of the smell although it is a great sealer for thick hair.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong floral scent that many will not enjoy.</li>
            <li>My hair was shedding so much and it stopped it from shedding and it does a good job with the color of my black hair.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far and love the results!</li>
            <li>Good conditioner, but not easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>This Hair oil is good for African American hair.</li>
            <li>The first ingredient is vegetable oil and does not, in my experience, have that much benefit for one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>What it did for me was that it made my hair thicker and super soft.</li>
            <li>love it helps a lot with my dry hair.</li>
            <li>I skipped doing this treatment one weekend out of pure laziness</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and the care this really provide just by following the simple steps.</li>
            <li>I am glad I was open to trying something totally new, it moistens and softens my hair while remaining lightweight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used twice, but it has tamed down my frizzy winter fly away hair and left it smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>Not only the ingrediences (as many said mineral oil and the colouring which can allegedly cause dermatitis - no proof there folks), but as I found out I am also strongly allergic to the product</li>
            <li>I have pin straight, fine hair that tends to be a bit frizzy ( my luck straight hair is rarely frizzy) after leaving the oil in my hair for about 2 hours, it left my hair incredibly soft, shiny &amp; frizz-free.</li>
            <li>I oil up my whole hair and scalp with this, massage it in, leave on for 2 hrs-overnight depending on the day, 3x per week.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li>Great product, especially for African American or thick/coarse hair (which I have).</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this oil.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, but my hair is not worse.</li>
            <li>This is really a miracle product and I will buy again.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very shiny and moisturized.</li>
            <li>After one application my hair sheen and shine and was very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I find it very soothing to my scalp.</li>
            <li>It is very stimulating to my scalp as well.</li>
            <li>I went to the salon because i wanted layers but didnt want my hair to be cut to much</li>
            <li>I was trying to use it really, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really help me with hair growth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Further, how much amla oil does it have in it anyway?</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m guessing not too much.</li>
            <li>He told me never put it in my hair again, it smelt up the whole house.  </li>
            <li>I have normal hair, its kind of wavy, and it made it less frizzy.</li>
            <li>With all its benefits I don&#x27;t mind the smell as long as my hair is strong and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I am so excited that I finally found something to balance out my protein/moisture level but</li>
            <li>This oil is not thick so be careful not to spill don&#x27;t lay the bottle on its side after opening, not that it leaks just to be safe of no spills.</li>
            <li>Keep on your hair all night if you can (it smells quite strong but not unbearable) or at least 2 hours before you wash it out, it makes your hair more manageable, soft, moisturized and even benefitted my scalp.</li>
            <li>Just a few drops serves as great after shampoo leave in for my tends to dry hair.</li>
            <li>+ years as I only needed to use a cap full in each of my treatments.</li>
            <li>The texture is nice and you just need a small amount for your hair.</li>
            <li>I dried my hair and it was incredibly soft and looked amazingly shiny.</li>
            <li>It made our hair grow healthy, it made it shiny and there was less breakage.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Ok first let me say, that if you remember Grandma using a Hot - Pressing Comb on the Flaming Wood stove in the South and a few paper towels, well this oil SMELLS LIKE THAT.!!!..</li>
            <li>and I really like how soft my hair feels after using this product.</li>
            <li>Amla oil really works and leaves your hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I love the size of the bottle, it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to learn about different culture and there secrets for growing hair and for me being a mix woman myself</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t bother to write reviews...</li>
            <li>I put it in a little spray bottle of an empty sample i had of a leave in condish and it is much more user friendly.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy and has a natural black shine.</li>
            <li>The smell no longer bothers me, especially since the shampoo I use takes the smell right away.</li>
            <li>it makes my curls like new.</li>
            <li>i am seeing new hairs pop up all over my head and my hair is very soft.</li>
            <li>was very soft</li>
            <li>My friend from High School used this stuff and her hair was gorgeous, thick, long and shiny.</li>
            <li>I had to shampoo my hair several times first just to rinse out the odor.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve had to comb it to the left and get bangs, but since I started using the amla oil, so much hair has grown!</li>
            <li>I am hoping to the see the same happy results as the reviewers who praised it, since I wish to add some shine to my thick and coarse African-American hair.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair incredibly soft!  </li>
            <li>From my first time trying this oil yesterday overall</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft!</li>
            <li>but it works... new growth forming, hair so incredibly soft..</li>
            <li>Leave in overnight if the scent is not too strong for you (cover pillows to protect from green oil)</li>
            <li>On the other hand the oil it self is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>but it is fine and limp.  </li>
            <li>great oil for deep conditioning treatments but does have a weird smell.</li>
            <li>I received this product believing that it would be a daily leave-in oil, and was surprised to read on the directions that it is a really a rinse-out medicinal treatment, to be used thrice weekly after leaving on the scalp for an hour.</li>
            <li>but I didnt want to risk using on my natural hair</li>
            <li>surprised at that.</li>
            <li>and I use heat frequently.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>and my hair feels so    soft.</li>
            <li>The loud &amp;#34;pine sol&amp;#34; smell is embarrassing.  </li>
            <li>To me it smells like a combination of industrial strength soap and old school petroleum hair grease.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why most of them complaint about the smell.</li>
            <li>I like it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>its a bit to soon to really rate the product because ive only used it 4 times</li>
            <li>So far I have used it twice</li>
            <li>It has darken my hair, leaves it soft and shinny and no frizz.</li>
            <li>I have been using natural oils like ajurvedic and herbal oil.</li>
            <li>Makes the hair soooo soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really soft</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I tried this product and the smell was way too much not only for me but also for my husband.  </li>
            <li>The only down side is that it has a strong odor.</li>
            <li>My favorite part was the grown, my hair grew faster than it usually did especially when I had braids.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and its not a stink smell, but a strong smell that does go away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty far down the ingredient list</li>
            <li>I went all natural last year.</li>
            <li>I use this product in my hair as a Pre Poo, makes my hair soft mixed with Giovanni Conditoner!</li>
            <li>In Uganda where I grew up, I used to use this oil on my hair and everyone who had natural coarse hair even treated hair, saw the difference.</li>
            <li>After following the directions, my hair was shiny, silky, and soft.</li>
            <li>There is no squirting mechanism or a small hole at the top, it literally would spill out like water if you&#x27;re not too careful.  </li>
            <li>As everyone knows oil is messy, but this is certainly worth it.</li>
            <li>I recently mixed in with one of my deep conditioning treatments and it made my hair feel very soft</li>
            <li>but if you have a weak stomach it will most likely make you queezy!</li>
            <li>Also I would&#x27;t worry about the mineral oil content because a little of this oil goes a long way and you won&#x27;t necessarily be depositing huge amounts of mineral oil on your hair if you are scared of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really works, big size bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I am an African American with a natural hair</li>
            <li>I add this to my conditioners and to my henna treatment, it leaves my hair so soft, and it tones down the red in henna and leaves the rest of my hair a rich black</li>
            <li>But it leaves my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t take too long to rinse out.</li>
            <li>The color was green and it smelled funny.</li>
            <li>3- and 6- fatty acids (way higher in Omega 3- than almond oil).</li>
            <li>I love this oil although some ladies think that this oil is not good due to the fact that it has mineral oil atleast for me it has done wonders.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li> Ive incoporated biotin vitamins i must say my hair has never been this healthy.</li>
            <li> Many of you guys were not born when this smell was around...</li>
            <li> I am a Man, and now balding up top....</li>
            <li> I think that I am gonna totally satisfied with the product; because my three daughters and I have started to notice some changes to our hair.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with this hair oil.  </li>
            <li> I put a turbie towel on top of that and sleep in it overnight.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.....</li>
            <li> i love it  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t listen.</li>
            <li> I love the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> use the oil in many ways.</li>
            <li> For overnight treatments, I use more amount of oil, apply both to my scalp and the length of my hair, don a shower cap and shampoo out in the morning.</li>
            <li> this helps someone :)</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  </li>
            <li> Will buy more.</li>
            <li> Love using it on my hair.</li>
            <li> dabur amla hair oil is ok for me.  </li>
            <li> All I see difference on my hair is shining more.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair gets after more use.</li>
            <li> it it more tolerable.</li>
            <li> does not seem to help,maybe I need to use it more often</li>
            <li> Its worth it!!</li>
            <li> I would lightly apply to the top of my hair but not getting it on my roots or on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Works, but smell is to strong.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil over two months ago but was put off by the strong smell</li>
            <li> but the smell is strong</li>
            <li> The oil has a strong scent but after i kept using it i am already used to it</li>
            <li> I must say it has been about 2 yrs that i stopped using strong chemically hair products.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my conditioner so the scent isn&#x27;t too strong......</li>
            <li> think it is too strong to use by itself</li>
            <li> but this smells just like PURE AFRO SHEEN !!!...  </li>
            <li> My hair is really growing nicely.</li>
            <li> My hairline is great, and I don&#x27;t have to be ashamed of pulling all my hair back now!</li>
            <li> I could immediately feel my hair become smooth as I put it on.</li>
            <li> otherwise, wash out after an hour or so-will render same great results.</li>
            <li> but until then it will stay in my bathroom cabinet for only emergencies but GREAT product.</li>
            <li> Also, keep in mind that just because this product made my hair shiny and silky smooth</li>
            <li> And the price is really cheap for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> But for now don&#x27;t be turned away because of remarks about the smell because you will miss out on a great hair conditioner, that definitely doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> This oil helps smooth it out and keep in moisture, so it shines healthfully.</li>
            <li> Rug cleaner for pet stains, maybe-- a cheap, chemical deodorant smell.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been told it smells like the inside of a Goodwill store), but overall works great.  </li>
            <li> I love that my hair looks healthy too, and feels much stronger.</li>
            <li> Amla oil is good for natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> A hot pressing comb and a stocking cap!!</li>
            <li> I mix this with my conditioner and deep condition for about 45 mins , my hair feels amazing after and super healthy !</li>
            <li> No wonder indian women has gorgeous long healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Ok first off this oil is stinky</li>
            <li> too soon to tell - need to use it more consistently</li>
            <li> My experience with Amla oils in general has been good.</li>
            <li> A LOT like the original Pine Sol floor cleaner.</li>
            <li> I will give update when I see significant hair growth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting softer and longer even ticker, specially for me.</li>
            <li> but this is special.  </li>
            <li> make me scratched all night, full of synthetic oil, got refund from amazon</li>
            <li> I have to turn on the room air filter at full blast just to eliminate the smell.</li>
            <li> I am still using it once a week but really wish my schedule would allow me to do it more.</li>
            <li> this is a good product to have the bottle is big and it norishes my hair</li>
            <li> I feel like my hair has more volume and actually feels healthy which is really important to me.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product doesn&#x27;t even bother me its not bad at all.</li>
            <li> and I can tell a tremendous difference from before.</li>
            <li> It gave it more shine as well, and a big thing that made me love this product</li>
            <li> but my hair was so soft and most importantly it stopped shedding.</li>
            <li> Oil, of course, can be beneficial, but I didn&#x27;t see extraordinary results.  </li>
            <li> I have trichotillomania and heard good things about this oil, and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> It is also  leave-in herbal treatment, but has a sweet, fresh scent.)</li>
            <li> and my hair feels more supple and better moisturized  now in spite of the dry weather than it did months ago in the summer.</li>
            <li> I think the smell is worth the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I would say it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft, moisturized, shiny, tangle-free, thick, beautiful, and healthy.</li>
            <li> It does help deep conditioning the hair, but there are number of other more pleasant choices.  </li>
            <li> Really,  the smell is not bad at all; however, it may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> Turns out canola oil is rich in vitamin E as well as has high contents of Omega</li>
            <li> but I loved that I saw growth and less hair fall.</li>
            <li> So far I have not used it as a pre shampoo conditioner because the smell is a bit too strong</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably the only con :)</li>
            <li> First I want to start by saying this oil does not stink.</li>
            <li> It was my first time using this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update end of July: I am almost through my first bottle</li>
            <li> I use and enjoy all the natural oils for hair and body.</li>
            <li> If I had read the ingredients first, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Maybe greasy hair should avoid this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> I love learning hair tips and oil from different</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the cost was reasonable, thus making whatever the benefits are worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> So this product does exactly what it says...</li>
            <li> It actually reminds me of a hair grease when I was a kid &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> great thick oil</li>
            <li> but Im not too found of the smell although it is a great sealer for thick hair.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong floral scent that many will not enjoy.</li>
            <li> My hair was shedding so much and it stopped it from shedding and it does a good job with the color of my black hair.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far and love the results!</li>
            <li> Good conditioner, but not easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> This Hair oil is good for African American hair.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient is vegetable oil and does not, in my experience, have that much benefit for one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> What it did for me was that it made my hair thicker and super soft.</li>
            <li> love it helps a lot with my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I skipped doing this treatment one weekend out of pure laziness</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and the care this really provide just by following the simple steps.</li>
            <li> I am glad I was open to trying something totally new, it moistens and softens my hair while remaining lightweight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used twice, but it has tamed down my frizzy winter fly away hair and left it smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> Not only the ingrediences (as many said mineral oil and the colouring which can allegedly cause dermatitis - no proof there folks), but as I found out I am also strongly allergic to the product</li>
            <li> I have pin straight, fine hair that tends to be a bit frizzy ( my luck straight hair is rarely frizzy) after leaving the oil in my hair for about 2 hours, it left my hair incredibly soft, shiny &amp; frizz-free.</li>
            <li> I oil up my whole hair and scalp with this, massage it in, leave on for 2 hrs-overnight depending on the day, 3x per week.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for African American or thick/coarse hair (which I have).</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this oil.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, but my hair is not worse.</li>
            <li> This is really a miracle product and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very shiny and moisturized.</li>
            <li> After one application my hair sheen and shine and was very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I find it very soothing to my scalp.</li>
            <li> It is very stimulating to my scalp as well.</li>
            <li> I went to the salon because i wanted layers but didnt want my hair to be cut to much</li>
            <li> I was trying to use it really, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really help me with hair growth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Further, how much amla oil does it have in it anyway?</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m guessing not too much.</li>
            <li> He told me never put it in my hair again, it smelt up the whole house.  </li>
            <li> I have normal hair, its kind of wavy, and it made it less frizzy.</li>
            <li> With all its benefits I don&#x27;t mind the smell as long as my hair is strong and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I am so excited that I finally found something to balance out my protein/moisture level but</li>
            <li> This oil is not thick so be careful not to spill don&#x27;t lay the bottle on its side after opening, not that it leaks just to be safe of no spills.</li>
            <li> Keep on your hair all night if you can (it smells quite strong but not unbearable) or at least 2 hours before you wash it out, it makes your hair more manageable, soft, moisturized and even benefitted my scalp.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops serves as great after shampoo leave in for my tends to dry hair.</li>
            <li> + years as I only needed to use a cap full in each of my treatments.</li>
            <li> The texture is nice and you just need a small amount for your hair.</li>
            <li> I dried my hair and it was incredibly soft and looked amazingly shiny.</li>
            <li> It made our hair grow healthy, it made it shiny and there was less breakage.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ok first let me say, that if you remember Grandma using a Hot - Pressing Comb on the Flaming Wood stove in the South and a few paper towels, well this oil SMELLS LIKE THAT.!!!..</li>
            <li> and I really like how soft my hair feels after using this product.</li>
            <li> Amla oil really works and leaves your hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I love the size of the bottle, it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to learn about different culture and there secrets for growing hair and for me being a mix woman myself</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t bother to write reviews...</li>
            <li> I put it in a little spray bottle of an empty sample i had of a leave in condish and it is much more user friendly.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy and has a natural black shine.</li>
            <li> The smell no longer bothers me, especially since the shampoo I use takes the smell right away.</li>
            <li> it makes my curls like new.</li>
            <li> i am seeing new hairs pop up all over my head and my hair is very soft.</li>
            <li> was very soft</li>
            <li> My friend from High School used this stuff and her hair was gorgeous, thick, long and shiny.</li>
            <li> I had to shampoo my hair several times first just to rinse out the odor.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had to comb it to the left and get bangs, but since I started using the amla oil, so much hair has grown!</li>
            <li> I am hoping to the see the same happy results as the reviewers who praised it, since I wish to add some shine to my thick and coarse African-American hair.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair incredibly soft!  </li>
            <li> From my first time trying this oil yesterday overall</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft!</li>
            <li> but it works... new growth forming, hair so incredibly soft..</li>
            <li> Leave in overnight if the scent is not too strong for you (cover pillows to protect from green oil)</li>
            <li> On the other hand the oil it self is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> but it is fine and limp.  </li>
            <li> great oil for deep conditioning treatments but does have a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I received this product believing that it would be a daily leave-in oil, and was surprised to read on the directions that it is a really a rinse-out medicinal treatment, to be used thrice weekly after leaving on the scalp for an hour.</li>
            <li> but I didnt want to risk using on my natural hair</li>
            <li> surprised at that.</li>
            <li> and I use heat frequently.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> and my hair feels so    soft.</li>
            <li> The loud &amp;#34;pine sol&amp;#34; smell is embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> To me it smells like a combination of industrial strength soap and old school petroleum hair grease.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why most of them complaint about the smell.</li>
            <li> I like it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li> its a bit to soon to really rate the product because ive only used it 4 times</li>
            <li> So far I have used it twice</li>
            <li> It has darken my hair, leaves it soft and shinny and no frizz.</li>
            <li> I have been using natural oils like ajurvedic and herbal oil.</li>
            <li> Makes the hair soooo soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really soft</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and the smell was way too much not only for me but also for my husband.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that it has a strong odor.</li>
            <li> My favorite part was the grown, my hair grew faster than it usually did especially when I had braids.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and its not a stink smell, but a strong smell that does go away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty far down the ingredient list</li>
            <li> I went all natural last year.</li>
            <li> I use this product in my hair as a Pre Poo, makes my hair soft mixed with Giovanni Conditoner!</li>
            <li> In Uganda where I grew up, I used to use this oil on my hair and everyone who had natural coarse hair even treated hair, saw the difference.</li>
            <li> After following the directions, my hair was shiny, silky, and soft.</li>
            <li> There is no squirting mechanism or a small hole at the top, it literally would spill out like water if you&#x27;re not too careful.  </li>
            <li> As everyone knows oil is messy, but this is certainly worth it.</li>
            <li> I recently mixed in with one of my deep conditioning treatments and it made my hair feel very soft</li>
            <li> but if you have a weak stomach it will most likely make you queezy!</li>
            <li> Also I would&#x27;t worry about the mineral oil content because a little of this oil goes a long way and you won&#x27;t necessarily be depositing huge amounts of mineral oil on your hair if you are scared of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really works, big size bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I am an African American with a natural hair</li>
            <li> I add this to my conditioners and to my henna treatment, it leaves my hair so soft, and it tones down the red in henna and leaves the rest of my hair a rich black</li>
            <li> But it leaves my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t take too long to rinse out.</li>
            <li> The color was green and it smelled funny.</li>
            <li> 3- and 6- fatty acids (way higher in Omega 3- than almond oil).</li>
            <li> I love this oil although some ladies think that this oil is not good due to the fact that it has mineral oil atleast for me it has done wonders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t listen to other reviews about it &amp;#34;stinking.&amp;#34; Yes, it has a distinct scent, but it didnt make me sick and after a couple of uses I got used to it.</li>
            <li> It is heavily scented with that older person perfume smell.</li>
            <li> Can get a little messy but the results are worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> so i have new growth as to say the hair strands with this oil is fluffy</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend for AA ladies with dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> instead it felt less soft after washing it out.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be dry and SO FRIZZY because the regrowth sits at all different lengths.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that was normal</li>
            <li> Strange how it worked wonders on others</li>
            <li> The OLD melted Green UltraSheen and AFRO SHEEN HAIR GREASE...</li>
            <li> I hate the way it smells and when you&#x27;re putting it on your hair, that&#x27;s pretty important.</li>
            <li> I am a black american female, and this oil loves my hair.</li>
            <li> I have also been using Aphoghee leave in protein treatment and it worked initially but not consistently.</li>
            <li> I have always had an issue with dry scalp and this oil eliminated that problem.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> It feels crispy and dry.</li>
            <li> , it made my hands feel dry.</li>
            <li> Any product that makes my hands feel dry</li>
            <li> I had to wash my hair at least 3 times for the smell to dissipate enough to not be self conscious of offending others.</li>
            <li> I have not really used this product a long time too soon to tell weather or not will work for me.</li>
            <li> Smells like TOILET BOWL cleaner !!!!</li>
            <li> Can get same product at Indian store for half the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s embarrassing as a 22 year old woman when on my hairline there was a spot with hardly any hair</li>
            <li> its okay, but there are some bad things in it that you should not put on your hair.</li>
            <li> Most hair oil smell terrible but Amla oil smell very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The opening is too wide and it need some sort of portion control (like some salad dressing tops).  </li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because the Amla oil does what it is expected.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way-</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The way I use it is that I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I oil my scalp with it every other day</li>
            <li> and I wash my hair every other week</li>
            <li> have long hair with a very slight wave.  </li>
            <li> Mineral oil is horrible for ethnic hair not the mention the bottle is so hard to open, but it&#x27;s a good thing because I probably would&#x27;ve never noticed the contents.</li>
            <li> I put a small palmful of this oil through the ends of my hair at night &amp; massage what&#x27;s left into my scalp, leave it overnight or during the day and shampoo/condition after letting it sit a few hours.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t always mean that everyone else will get the same results.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I can say about this product is that it stinks and that it left some of my hair a bit oily on top of my hair</li>
            <li> I started using it less than 2 weeks ago</li>
            <li> Being a black woman I am used to homemade experiments that did not always have a welcoming smell.</li>
            <li> The only problem is its hard to get past the smell.</li>
            <li> This oil smells like hair grease from when I was little, some may not enjoys the smell</li>
            <li> I rub a little amount in my scalp and massage.</li>
            <li> Smells a little funky</li>
            <li> So not easily breakable  </li>
            <li> Then i shampoo &amp; condition as usual.</li>
            <li> But it is a small price to pay for what I get.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t to any other oil before (thankfully no reaction on the skin, but I was scratching like mad for several hours).</li>
            <li> Hair turned into greasy strands after applying even a small amount and thorough rince.</li>
            <li> I usually use on weekend days</li>
            <li> Not totally sure though.</li>
            <li> I think one could get use to it if you use it in small quantity.  </li>
            <li> not sure yet</li>
            <li> The oil itself is neither thin nor thick, and is dark green.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this oil because of a lot of negative comments about the smell.</li>
            <li> I use it as a detangler and leave in for at least an hour.</li>
            <li> so after a few days of research, came across this ancient INDIAN secret of AMLA...</li>
            <li> my hair is thick</li>
            <li> I wonder how thick would it be after the bottle</li>
            <li> I have to say it&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> This hair oil is very hard to get washed out.  </li>
            <li> This product is a miracle in a bottle anyone with badly damage hair and over process please by this product you will be amazed of how much it repairs your badly damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin and oily hair, it&#x27;s run in my fammily.</li>
            <li> Other then the complaints about the way it smells (it&#x27;s not THAT bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses either)</li>
            <li> This oil smells so bad that I pour it down the drain.  </li>
            <li> Maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my nostrils</li>
            <li> Nothing was wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> Given that, my hair was in desperate need of protein and coconut oil does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I read that some people said this stuff stinks..</li>
            <li> &quot; it stinks</li>
            <li> will color blonde hair; hate it ths is the worst stuff ever to put on hair.  </li>
            <li> BUT I used applied it once and can&#x27;t get past the smell, it&#x27;s horrific.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s impossible to say if the Amla made a difference or not.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as people make it out to be.</li>
            <li> When i had a bad hair cut before i used this oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so bad it smells like pee</li>
            <li> My boyfriend tells me it smells like cinnamon though, so it can&#x27;t smell too bad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> mineral oil is one bad thing for your hair.</li>
            <li> It made me feel dizzy and sick and will not wash out.</li>
            <li> (I was skeptical for almost 9 months because I read lots of reviews about how horribly it smells).</li>
            <li> this version has the Extract added in a base of CANOLA OIL...</li>
            <li> I have had a horrible headache all day and have really bad nausea.</li>
            <li> Amla oil has the worst smell i ever smelled in my life!</li>
            <li> but it smells awful and the scent permeates the house.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible and the scent does not go away.</li>
            <li> smell is so very horrible!!</li>
            <li> Horrible experience</li>
            <li> Smell is terrible!</li>
            <li> However the smell is disguising it smells awful ...</li>
            <li> This product does nothing for my hair not to mention the awful smell of FECES.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didnt like it. The color was green and it smelled funny. Not sure if that was normal but I didnt want to risk using on my natural hair so I never used it. Will not purchase again😕</li>
            <li> Maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my nostrils but I think this product smells garden-y. Like plants and flowers. The smell does stick w ya though. Like if you use this as an overnight or pre-poo treatment and then shampoo you&#x27;ll still be smelling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I think this product is making a difference; I&#x27;m using it for hair growth and softness. I put it in a little spray bottle of an empty sample i had of a leave in condish and it is much more user friendly. I oil up my whole hair and scalp with this, massage it in, leave on for 2 hrs-overnight depending on the day, 3x per week. Then i shampoo &amp; condition as usual. i am seeing new hairs pop up all over my head and my hair is very soft. I recommend this inexpensive treatment. Oh although it IS based in mineral oil if this bothers you... My hair doesn&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li> I am an African American with a natural hair and I really like how soft my hair feels after using this product. It also gives a nice shine. The only down side is that it has a strong odor. But it is a small price to pay for what I get.</li>
            <li> great oil for deep conditioning treatments but does have a weird smell. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it. I would thoroughly rinse hair out after using for treatment. It leaves your hair it great condition and shine. I think its especially great for curly coils like mine it makes my curls like new. A little goes a long way- I have quite a lot of hair and this bottle lasted me 2+ years as I only needed to use a cap full in each of my treatments.</li>
            <li> surprised at that. perhaps some clarification would have permitted the customer to anticipate what would arrive. glad to have it though!</li>
            <li> Ok first off this oil is stinky so i just mix it with conditioner after i rinse my hair was very soft i cant say if it grows hair becuz it been only two days but i will update my comment</li>
            <li> Anna continues to use this, so it must be good.</li>
            <li> This hair oil is soooo great!!! Im glad I got on amazon one day and found this. This oil makes your hair softer and shinier and longer!!! It is really good for African-American hair. The smell of this product doesn&#x27;t even bother me its not bad at all. Don&#x27;t believe this product works?? Try it for yourself and see :-)</li>
            <li> I started using this Oil and I have been hooked. I have went to store after store looking for this oil, they don&#x27;t carry it. So I&#x27;m always beating it to the computer&lt;br /&gt; to order this good product.The only reason, I gave it four stars, it&#x27;s hard&lt;br /&gt; to find.My hair is really growing nicely.</li>
            <li> Its a good oil.  The price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li> make me scratched all night, full of synthetic oil, got refund from amazon</li>
            <li> After reading about the benefits of Indian hair care products I decided to purchase this oil.  Since using it, my hair has become stronger, more shiny, and thicker.  My best friend noticed the difference and asked me what I was using in my hair.  Since there were no Indian grocery stores where she lived I recommend she buy it on Amazon.  Great product, especially for African American or thick/coarse hair (which I have).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used twice, but it has tamed down my frizzy winter fly away hair and left it smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> This product greeeeaaat ! My cousins and I HAIR GOT BACK OUR THICKNESS . IT REJUVENATED OUR HAIR. And now It&#x27;s getting EVEN THICKER. I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this oil. It is way to pungent. I am sure some people will like it but if you have a weak stomach it will most likely make you queezy! I couldn&#x27;t go to bed after I used it. I had to shampoo my hair several times first just to rinse out the odor. On the other hand the oil it self is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Amla oil has the worst smell i ever smelled in my life! I had tried it ones and that was enough for me. I am blonde. Oil made my hair one shade darker and thats a no-no.</li>
            <li> I have African-American hair. I have only used it once, and I see no difference in softness. However, I will continue to use this product to see if there are any noticeable benefits after 3 months of use. It could be that it is one of those products that is working but doesn&#x27;t show obvious signs that it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 2 Months&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, but my hair is not worse.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and I can tell a tremendous difference from before. What it did for me was that it made my hair thicker and super soft. I have normal hair, its kind of wavy, and it made it less frizzy. It gave it more shine as well, and a big thing that made me love this product was that my hair did grow faster. I love that my hair looks healthy too, and feels much stronger. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t listen to other reviews about it &amp;#34;stinking.&amp;#34; Yes, it has a distinct scent, but it didnt make me sick and after a couple of uses I got used to it. The way I use it is that I use it every other day. I massage it on my scalp and get it on all my hair. Afterwards, I put on a plastic shower cap and leave it on overnight. On the instructions on the box it says that ideally an hour, but I do it overnight. If you leave it in overnight, just make sure that you place a towel where you sleep because this stuff can stain! I then wash it out when I wake up with sulfate-free shampoo and use coconut oil as a conditioner. People just can&#x27;t stop commenting on and touching my hair! That&#x27;s probably the only con :) but I loved that I saw growth and less hair fall. It&#x27;s embarrassing as a 22 year old woman when on my hairline there was a spot with hardly any hair so I&#x27;ve had to comb it to the left and get bangs, but since I started using the amla oil, so much hair has grown! My hairline is great, and I don&#x27;t have to be ashamed of pulling all my hair back now! This is really a miracle product and I will buy again. I would recommend this product to people with darker hair since it says on the box that its not for lighter shades.</li>
            <li> Amla oil really works and leaves your hair feeling soft. My hair is Dyed and I use heat frequently. This oil helps with the damage and it helps my hair grow.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!! Verygood and amazing in hair</li>
            <li> Love it but my husband complain that it smells like pee</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the intensity of the smell until one uses it. Wow the smell stays. I have to turn on the room air filter at full blast just to eliminate the smell. However, it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Works, but smell is to strong.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this oil a chance but it smells awful and the scent permeates the house. You also walk around smelling rotten, as it takes a while to dissipate.Ugh!</li>
            <li> My hair drinks it in and shines and bounces after washing. Just a few drops serves as great after shampoo leave in for my tends to dry hair.</li>
            <li> words cannot describe this oil, it does everthing it says. it stops any damage and breakage i have, i love it and i hope they never stop selling it. i will be a customer for life you can also buy it in the jasmine scent. i love it.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. Love it</li>
            <li> It smells horrible and the scent does not go away. It does help deep conditioning the hair, but there are number of other more pleasant choices.  I like the Dabur Vatika coconut oil much better</li>
            <li> Gives your hair a healthy look and feel.. I deep condition my hair with this product once a week. My hair is healthy and has a natural black shine.</li>
            <li> I am a black american female, and this oil loves my hair. I mix the oil with Alma Powder and it works wonderful.    I also add the oil to my hair after I wash and place a plastic bag on my hair for about 1 hour. and my hair feels so    soft. and by the way the smell does not bother me. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> The loud &amp;#34;pine sol&amp;#34; smell is embarrassing.  Its a lot of oil.  I hope it works</li>
            <li> too soon to tell - need to use it more consistently</li>
            <li> First I want to start by saying this oil does not stink. It does have a scent but it&#x27;s nothing to make you upchuck your dinner. Anyway, oil is great for hot oil treatments. It is absolutely not to be left on the hair for days at a time as it makes my scalp itch! It makes my hair very shiny and moisturized. I love the size of the bottle, it will last a long time. I definitely recommend for AA ladies with dry damaged hair. You will see results. I also recommend [[ASIN:B005DNUWIY Amla Hair Powder 3.5oz powder by Hesh Pharma]]</li>
            <li> I have always had an issue with dry scalp and this oil eliminated that problem. Once I heard about this I ordered it. After one application my hair sheen and shine and was very moisturized. I would recommend this product to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and the care this really provide just by following the simple steps. This size will last for a while and I will gladly add this item to my supply list.</li>
            <li> I was using Amla oil from different company, but I was given this one as a gift and... I have to say it&#x27;s not good. Not only the ingrediences (as many said mineral oil and the colouring which can allegedly cause dermatitis - no proof there folks), but as I found out I am also strongly allergic to the product and I wasn&#x27;t to any other oil before (thankfully no reaction on the skin, but I was scratching like mad for several hours). Would recommend to try before purchase that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> It was my first time using this product and I love the way it makes my hair feel. I went all natural last year. I&#x27;ve tried all typed of oils and they where great also.... Dabur Amla Hair Oil was the best of all.&lt;br /&gt;Dwan A.</li>
            <li> Still trying it.  I need another month so I can say for sure</li>
            <li> Great product! I mix this in my deep conditioner and it works wonder. Will purchase again. A little goes a long way, and its not a stink smell, but a strong smell that does go away.</li>
            <li> My experience with Amla oils in general has been good. Some people do not like the smell of amla oil but i don&#x27;t mind. The texture is nice and you just need a small amount for your hair. I use it at night leaving it all night and my hair feels great. For me is a great product</li>
            <li> I bought this oil over two months ago but was put off by the strong smell so I didn&#x27;t use it. To me it smells like a combination of industrial strength soap and old school petroleum hair grease. Given that, my hair was in desperate need of protein and coconut oil does not work for me. I have also been using Aphoghee leave in protein treatment and it worked initially but not consistently. So I decided to give this a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. I heated it up over a double boiler then put it on section by section and let it set for an hour. I could immediately feel my hair become smooth as I put it on. I had to rinse it out for a good 5 minutes before shampooing but my hair was so soft and most importantly it stopped shedding. I gave my daughter the same treatment the following day and she had the same results. I am so excited that I finally found something to balance out my protein/moisture level but the challenge will be to see how it does over time. The directions say to use it 2-3 times a week for best results but given the smell I think I will try once a week and see how it works. I think the smell is worth the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update end of July: I am almost through my first bottle and I still love this oil. I am still using it once a week but really wish my schedule would allow me to do it more. The smell no longer bothers me, especially since the shampoo I use takes the smell right away. I skipped doing this treatment one weekend out of pure laziness and I will never do that again. I could definitely tell the difference in my hair. Oh and my hair has been getting noticeably darker. Which I dont mind at all. I like it. From now on I will buy this oil in two&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Saw a difference in my hair with just 1 use</li>
            <li> this is the best oil I ever try. Most hair oil smell terrible but Amla oil smell very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why most of them complaint about the smell. there is a culture problem.</li>
            <li> I have this oil and it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as people make it out to be. It smells like hair grease. I like it makes my hair soft only been using for a couple weeks I hope to see a lot of growth soon... Oh and it says should be rinsed out I don&#x27;t rinse it out... I oil my scalp with it every other day and I wash my hair every other week</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how anyone has anything good to say about this product .The smell is so very horrible!! and it doesn&#x27;t come out!! Its not just a scent its a chemical like stench. It made me feel dizzy and sick and will not wash out. I have had a horrible headache all day and have really bad nausea.I haven never smelled anything so bad!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my hair didn&#x27;t feel any softer, instead it felt less soft after washing it out. It feels crispy and dry. It also felt moist when the oil was still in. I didn&#x27;t understand how this could be. Horrible experience</li>
            <li> Smells like TOILET BOWL cleaner !!!!</li>
            <li> Love this.. It&#x27;s been growing my hair</li>
            <li> I use and enjoy all the natural oils for hair and body. I have never seen any oil that made hair this shiny or strengthened the hair. This does both. It does have a strong floral scent that many will not enjoy. Its worth it!!</li>
            <li> I have thin and oily hair, it&#x27;s run in my fammily. I didn&#x27;t bought this product at amazon just bought at India grocery store. After using this product for one year  my hair it&#x27;s healthier and thicker not oily. I use this product twice a week. The smell not bothering me. Love love this product. U recommended this product to all of my fammily.</li>
            <li> Smell is terrible! But it leaves my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t take too long to rinse out.</li>
            <li> I use this product in my hair as a Pre Poo, makes my hair soft mixed with Giovanni Conditoner!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and hair feels great!</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Use once a week , to add moisture back to the hair , gives you that shine and bounce back.&lt;br /&gt;I love it helps a lot with my dry hair.</li>
            <li> my family has been using this for 2 generations now, best for hairfall,makes hair more darker, and prevents split ends from happening.</li>
            <li> If I had read the ingredients first, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I opened it and smelled it, it reminded me of  a toxic insecticide that was used when I was a child.&lt;br /&gt;I threw it away, anything that smells like that can not be safe to breath in or put on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Maybe greasy hair should avoid this product in the first place. Hair turned into greasy strands after applying even a small amount and thorough rince. Now in addition to hair loss it looks like i haven&#x27;t washed hair for days. Not the best look. Strange how it worked wonders on others</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to learn about different culture and there secrets for growing hair and for me being a mix woman myself I love learning hair tips and oil from different race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product.  Its one of my staples in my hair regimate journey.</li>
            <li> Good but the smell is strong</li>
            <li> its a bit to soon to really rate the product because ive only used it 4 times, however, others notice a difference in my hair already. ie..looks healthier looking  :) be interesting to see how it will look after many uses.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for allowing me the opportunity to rate this and have a great day&lt;br /&gt;ps.. hope this works for everyone out there</li>
            <li> I received this product believing that it would be a daily leave-in oil, and was surprised to read on the directions that it is a really a rinse-out medicinal treatment, to be used thrice weekly after leaving on the scalp for an hour. (This was also the case with the bhringraj oil that I bought. It is also  leave-in herbal treatment, but has a sweet, fresh scent.) The scent of the oil is medicinal and herbal, and the aroma lingers on the scalp for awhile. The oil itself is neither thin nor thick, and is dark green. I am hoping to the see the same happy results as the reviewers who praised it, since I wish to add some shine to my thick and coarse African-American hair. Only time will tell.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it twice and  I&#x27;m loving it. My hair is definitely stronger.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s wait and see for the growth...</li>
            <li> I like this product. I find it very soothing to my scalp. It is very stimulating to my scalp as well.</li>
            <li> I love this oil although some ladies think that this oil is not good due to the fact that it has mineral oil atleast for me it has done wonders. It has darken my hair, leaves it soft and shinny and no frizz. When i had a bad hair cut before i used this oil. I went to the salon because i wanted layers but didnt want my hair to be cut to much but the lady cut my hair to shoulder length when i had it backlength. It does help my hair grow and im still using it. The oil has a strong scent but after i kept using it i am already used to it and it doesnt bother me. I sometimes mix the amla oil with brahmi oil. I must say it has been about 2 yrs that i stopped using strong chemically hair products. I have been using natural oils like ajurvedic and herbal oil. Ive incoporated biotin vitamins i must say my hair has never been this healthy. No wonder indian women has gorgeous long healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I like how this oil feels on my hair I will order again.</li>
            <li> This is awesome.  My hair has never been stronger.  It also makes my hair incredibly soft!  I would definitely recommend this after you have a baby, helps repair your hair!</li>
            <li> This hair oil is very hard to get washed out.  I was hoping to rotate this with a coconut oil therapy but I am moving on to try emu oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so bad it smells like pee and it lasts and stays in your hair. I had to wash my hair 2 times to get the smell out plus it just coats your hair.</li>
            <li> This Hair oil is good for African American hair. In Uganda where I grew up, I used to use this oil on my hair and everyone who had natural coarse hair even treated hair, saw the difference. It made our hair grow healthy, it made it shiny and there was less breakage. My favorite part was the grown, my hair grew faster than it usually did especially when I had braids.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is what puts off a lot of people otherwise, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient is vegetable oil and does not, in my experience, have that much benefit for one&#x27;s hair.  Oil, of course, can be beneficial, but I didn&#x27;t see extraordinary results.  On the plus side, the cost was reasonable, thus making whatever the benefits are worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have not really used this product a long time too soon to tell weather or not will work for me. It does have a very strong odor.</li>
            <li> I did not shipped in Malaysia from my amazon customer were canceled place to order Dabur Amla Hair Oil.&lt;br /&gt;This Sunday 29th I start in Kota Kinabalu walks the street, there a shop of Indian Muslim they are stocking for ZAM-ZAM Amla Hair Oil - 100 ml at the same time I already buy 3-pack 1 set RM 39.00</li>
            <li> I mix this with my conditioner and deep condition for about 45 mins , my hair feels amazing after and super healthy !</li>
            <li> Nothing was wrong with this product. I just dont care for mineral oil. so I gave this product away, it made my hands feel dry. Any product that makes my hands feel dry I do not put in my hair.</li>
            <li> Ok first let me say, that if you remember Grandma using a Hot - Pressing Comb on the Flaming Wood stove in the South and a few paper towels, well this oil SMELLS LIKE THAT.!!!.. The OLD melted Green UltraSheen and AFRO SHEEN HAIR GREASE... Many of you guys were not born when this smell was around... but this smells just like PURE AFRO SHEEN !!!...  Brought tears of joy to my eyes, because I remember having the best WAVES in kindergarten... A hot pressing comb and a stocking cap!!... I was a WAVE KING... or Prince back then... Yes.. I am a Man, and now balding up top.... so after a few days of research, came across this ancient INDIAN secret of AMLA... mind you.... this version has the Extract added in a base of CANOLA OIL... yes CANOLA... but it works... new growth forming, hair so incredibly soft.. instantly brought my waves back..... Thank God for Ancient Indian Secrets.... brought back memories of Sunday Morning Church Hair with Granny in deep SC!!!</li>
            <li> This oil smells so bad that I pour it down the drain.  It is heavily scented with that older person perfume smell.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the mineral in it...</li>
            <li> Seems to moisturize and strengthen hair from the inside out.  Leave in overnight if the scent is not too strong for you (cover pillows to protect from green oil) otherwise, wash out after an hour or so-will render same great results.</li>
            <li> I think that I am gonna totally satisfied with the product; because my three daughters and I have started to notice some changes to our hair. It&#x27;s getting softer and longer even ticker, specially for me.</li>
            <li> From my first time trying this oil yesterday overall it is very nice. This oil smells like hair grease from when I was little, some may not enjoys the smell but I actually like it. This oil is not thick so be careful not to spill don&#x27;t lay the bottle on its side after opening, not that it leaks just to be safe of no spills. My hair seems to like it I will have to come back and rewrite another review once I can see how its benefiting my hair in time.</li>
            <li> excellent product-fast shipper</li>
            <li> The product has worked for me my hair it now looks fuller with lots of body just what I had been searching for.</li>
            <li> this is a good product to have the bottle is big and it norishes my hair so i have new growth as to say the hair strands with this oil is fluffy i leave it in my hair but can keep it in a hour or 2 then rinse then style growing hair takes time linger with this product use it as a conditioner as well</li>
            <li> I add this to my conditioners and to my henna treatment, it leaves my hair so soft, and it tones down the red in henna and leaves the rest of my hair a rich black</li>
            <li> Love the smell. And it conditions well.</li>
            <li> I always used to use it as a kid. Makes the hair soooo soft and shiny. Love it and have always loved it.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with this hair oil.  Other then the complaints about the way it smells (it&#x27;s not THAT bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses either) I am not a fan of the bottle. The opening is too wide and it need some sort of portion control (like some salad dressing tops).  Here are some details on how I use it:&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair with a very slight wave.  I comb this into my hair and then pull it up into a sock bun.  I put a turbie towel on top of that and sleep in it overnight. In the morning I wash my hair twice with shampoo and condition.  I try to do this once a week.  I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair getting any stronger or thicker, but it is smoother.  it&#x27;s only been a month so hopefully I&#x27;ll start noticing thicker hair eventually.</li>
            <li> I had contact dermatitis after using it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil..... I mix it with my conditioner so the scent isn&#x27;t too strong...... It makes my hair really soft</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to use as an add in to my henna mix. Because I mixed in a number of oils and conditioners it&#x27;s impossible to say if the Amla made a difference or not.  So far I have not used it as a pre shampoo conditioner because the smell is a bit too strong so I&#x27;ve added a bit of it to my coconut oil pre-poo and it seems to work just great.</li>
            <li> my sister turned me on to this stuff and it works. Keep on your hair all night if you can (it smells quite strong but not unbearable) or at least 2 hours before you wash it out, it makes your hair more manageable, soft, moisturized and even benefitted my scalp.</li>
            <li> This product works great for damage hair i love it  i would recomment it works wonders it has actually gotten my hair longer</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle in a bottle anyone with badly damage hair and over process please by this product you will be amazed of how much it repairs your badly damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because the Amla oil does what it is expected.  My hair was shedding so much and it stopped it from shedding and it does a good job with the color of my black hair.  However the smell is disguising it smells awful ...eww[...]  So I still have it and will use if I need too but until then it will stay in my bathroom cabinet for only emergencies but GREAT product.</li>
            <li> So this product does exactly what it says...it&#x27;s great and conditioning hair, aiding in growth, darkening,etc....The only problem is its hard to get past the smell. I&#x27;ve decided to use up the remainder of the bottle but probably wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this product out for YEARS. My friend from High School used this stuff and her hair was gorgeous, thick, long and shiny. I read that some people said this stuff stinks.. Yes, it kind of does stink but the smell goes away after you wash it out. After reading about how \\&quot;bad\\&quot; it stinks I could never find anyone to describe what it smelled like.. Well.. It smells A LOT like the original Pine Sol floor cleaner. It smells a bit funky to be putting in your hair but I would say it is totally worth it. Anyways. To apply, I put a generous amount (2-3 tablespoons) in my hands, using a tablespoon at a time, and worked it through the middle of my hair to the tips and whatever else I had on my hands I would lightly apply to the top of my hair but not getting it on my roots or on my scalp. Then I put my hair up in a towel for an hour. An hour passed and I washed my hair with shampoo and I used conditioner only on the tips and middle of my hair (my hair routine). I dried my hair and it was incredibly soft and looked amazingly shiny. The only bad thing I can say about this product is that it stinks and that it left some of my hair a bit oily on top of my hair but I think it was my mistake for putting it close to my roots. Overall, I really like this product. Also, keep in mind that just because this product made my hair shiny and silky smooth it doesn&#x27;t always mean that everyone else will get the same results.</li>
            <li> Mineral oil is horrible for ethnic hair not the mention the bottle is so hard to open, but it&#x27;s a good thing because I probably would&#x27;ve never noticed the contents.</li>
            <li> Amla oil is good for natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;Use it as a deep conditioner with coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this oil because of a lot of negative comments about the smell. I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t listen. I actually like the smell. And after only five treatments I can tell a big difference in the strength of my hair. As everyone knows oil is messy, but this is certainly worth it. And the price is really cheap for the size of the bottle. My hair has already shown some growth. I will give update when I see significant hair growth. But for now don&#x27;t be turned away because of remarks about the smell because you will miss out on a great hair conditioner, that definitely doesn&#x27;t stink. Here&#x27;s to longer hair!</li>
            <li> Good conditioner, but not easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> I love the size of the bottle. The 500 ml bottle will give you a lot for the money. I have used this product before and it does work well on the hair. I will purchase this product again and in the 500 ml size.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for sensitive scalp.  Can get a little messy but the results are worth the effort.  I usually use on weekend days</li>
            <li> I applied amla oil three times and yet the bottle didn&#x27;t yet finish it is awsome my hair is thick I wonder how thick would it be after the bottle 👌👌👌ends&lt;br /&gt;Mashalla it is perfect 😇&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why Indians have great beautiful hair 😳😳😃😃😃</li>
            <li> I got the product which I was looking for on different sites..!!</li>
            <li> I put a small palmful of this oil through the ends of my hair at night &amp; massage what&#x27;s left into my scalp, leave it overnight or during the day and shampoo/condition after letting it sit a few hours. I have trichotillomania and heard good things about this oil, and so far I really like it. I feel like my hair has more volume and actually feels healthy which is really important to me. My hair used to be dry and SO FRIZZY because the regrowth sits at all different lengths. This oil helps smooth it out and keep in moisture, so it shines healthfully. There is a lot of oil for the price which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the smell, it&#x27;s unmistakeably medicinal smelling if you get too close. My boyfriend tells me it smells like cinnamon though, so it can&#x27;t smell too bad.</li>
            <li> Really works, big size bottle will last a long time. Not too fond of the scent, but it does improve damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil. Keeps my hair soft, moisturized, shiny, tangle-free, thick, beautiful, and healthy. Just had to write a review for those who are hesitant about purchasing this oil (I was skeptical for almost 9 months because I read lots of reviews about how horribly it smells). You won&#x27;t go wrong with this. I started using it less than 2 weeks ago and my hair feels more supple and better moisturized  now in spite of the dry weather than it did months ago in the summer. It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. With all its benefits I don&#x27;t mind the smell as long as my hair is strong and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those complaining that the oil was extracted in canola oil, I looked up the nutritional contents of canola oil. Turns out canola oil is rich in vitamin E as well as has high contents of Omega 3- and 6- fatty acids (way higher in Omega 3- than almond oil). So I bet part of the hair growth promoting benefits of this oil may be attributable to the canola oil as well. Also I would&#x27;t worry about the mineral oil content because a little of this oil goes a long way and you won&#x27;t necessarily be depositing huge amounts of mineral oil on your hair if you are scared of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the oil in many ways. I rub a little amount in my scalp and massage. My scalp responds to this immediately and I can feel it stimulating my scalp. I just leave it on no rinsing (l don&#x27;t care for the smell). For overnight treatments, I use more amount of oil, apply both to my scalp and the length of my hair, don a shower cap and shampoo out in the morning. I also mix it in my deep conditioning treatment as well as my leave-in moisture sealing mix (a mixture of shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie, castor oil and amla oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone :)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft! I use it as a detangler and leave in for at least an hour. Wash and syle.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell. It actually reminds me of a hair grease when I was a kid &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this deep conditioning treatment. I recently mixed in with one of my deep conditioning treatments and it made my hair feel very soft and I could tell it was deep conditioned.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I am glad I was open to trying something totally new, it moistens and softens my hair while remaining lightweight. I immediately felt a difference.  Will buy more.</li>
            <li> it is  a good product</li>
            <li> Not a fan. Can get same product at Indian store for half the price.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair notices thickness in just a couple of weeks!!! I&#x27;m an AA I use this once a week!!!</li>
            <li> will color blonde hair; hate it ths is the worst stuff ever to put on hair.  Don&#x27;t put this on blonde hair</li>
            <li> Used this faithfully. All it gave me was a headache from the smell. It didn&#x27;t do anything for the texture or strength or growth of my hair. Not saying it doesn&#x27;t work at all, just saying it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Mineral oil and clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love using it on my hair. Seems to strengthen. Not totally sure though. But will continue to purchase when out.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I imagine it&#x27;s a great product. BUT I used applied it once and can&#x27;t get past the smell, it&#x27;s horrific. I had to wash my hair at least 3 times for the smell to dissipate enough to not be self conscious of offending others.</li>
            <li> This could be a hype.  I was trying to use it really, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  I think one could get use to it if you use it in small quantity.  There is no squirting mechanism or a small hole at the top, it literally would spill out like water if you&#x27;re not too careful.  Probably would be good if it included some kind of push to squirt top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t really help me with hair growth, I think it helped with darkening my hair and making it stronger.  So not easily breakable  This was for about a one month period.  Maybe if I use it for a longer period, it would be help with growth.</li>
            <li> dabur amla hair oil is ok for me.  All I see difference on my hair is shining more. thats it.</li>
            <li> This hair oil has stopped my hair from falling out.</li>
            <li> I just got this product this week and I LOVE it!! The smell does not bother me at all. Being a black woman I am used to homemade experiments that did not always have a welcoming smell. lol  Really,  the smell is not bad at all; however, it may not be for everyone. Nonetheless, there is no denying how wonderful the oil is. After following the directions, my hair was shiny, silky, and soft.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t bother to write reviews... but this is special.  This product does nothing for my hair not to mention the awful smell of FECES. This makes my hair smell like S***.... Like it was manufactured in a cesspit.  I had to wash my hair over and over and throw the towel to wash because the smell was in the towel. I can&#x27;t believe they sell this.</li>
            <li> great for hot oil treamts</li>
            <li> I would never buy this product again. I hate the way it smells and when you&#x27;re putting it on your hair, that&#x27;s pretty important. How would I describe the smell? Rug cleaner for pet stains, maybe-- a cheap, chemical deodorant smell. Not good.&lt;br /&gt;Further, how much amla oil does it have in it anyway? It&#x27;s pretty far down the ingredient list so I&#x27;m guessing not too much.</li>
            <li> this is just my second use . not sure yet</li>
            <li> its okay, but there are some bad things in it that you should not put on your hair. mineral oil is one bad thing for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair but it is fine and limp.  I heard about this oil on The Meredith Vieira Show and could not find it locally so I went to , who else , Amazon.  It is a good product and I definitely see a big difference in the texture of my hair.  I have recommended this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far and love the results! I have pin straight, fine hair that tends to be a bit frizzy ( my luck straight hair is rarely frizzy) after leaving the oil in my hair for about 2 hours, it left my hair incredibly soft, shiny &amp; frizz-free. Can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair gets after more use. As for the scent, I didn&#x27;t find it offensive, however my daughter did. Also, I had to shampoo my hair twice to get the oil out, then just applied my conditioner once.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and the smell was way too much not only for me but also for my husband.  He told me never put it in my hair again, it smelt up the whole house.  But after using it my hair looked and felt healthier.  The second time I used it I mixed one capful of the Dabur Amla Hair Oil into 3 tablespoons of Lustrasilk Placenta &amp; Jojoba Oil Cholesterol and put that on for 1 hour.  It works great and the smell was so much better.  My husband didn&#x27;t even know I had it on and the results was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is too strong to use by itself but if you mix it with something else it it more tolerable.</li>
            <li> great thick oil but Im not too found of the smell although it is a great sealer for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Smells a little funky (I&#x27;ve been told it smells like the inside of a Goodwill store), but overall works great.  Best of all, it arrived in just a couple days.</li>
            <li> does not seem to help,maybe I need to use it more often</li>
