            <li>this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Came as shown, works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>But this stuff is frickin amazing.  </li>
            <li>I used the chip skip and my Maybelline holographic nail color with a cheapie top coat.</li>
            <li>It is a primer, it&#x27;s watery, and basically what it does is it &#x27;dries&#x27; up the top layer of your nail</li>
            <li>It cleans the surface and removes all oil so your nail polish stays on better.</li>
            <li>(please do not skip this step to protect your nails), then your favorite nailn lqqcuer color, then your fave top</li>
            <li>Maybe works better over time...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>it dries very quickly</li>
            <li>Escepcially if you are wearing your more rare or precious colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Totally happy about this purchase... definitely delayed the chipping process!</li>
            <li>I can barely make my manicure last for a week, so this has been awesome!</li>
            <li>and i wish the brush was bigger but either than that it did good.</li>
            <li>This product makes your mani last much longer which is great.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to be any difference in how quickly the nail polish started to chip after applying this versus not using it at all.</li>

            <li>you want to do your mani the right way, this is a must-have for all polish-lovers girls.</li>
            <li>I just want to make very clear this is not a base coat or nail laqcuer.</li>
            <li>OPI Chip Skip really works!  </li>
            <li>Thanks OPI!</li>
            <li>Chipped first day.  </li>
            <li>After using it for the first time, my nails are the longest they have ever been.</li>
            <li>Product is ok, I don&#x27;t know if it really helps a lot like the products used on me in my nail salon, but then again I did a lot of cleaning last week...</li>
            <li>It really does extend the life of your manicure.</li>
            <li>Just went straight to the color.</li>
            <li>A woman who gave me a manicure used it and my polish stayed on much longer.</li>

            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>this stuff really works.</li>

            <li>I really can&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>I first heard about it when I had a manicure done at a beauty school where I live.</li>
            <li>This was super easy to apply and it definitely makes my manicure last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>only the tips were slightly chipped but still looks really good.</li>
            <li>My nails are often brittle, snag easily, and even when I file them, I some times have rough spots.  </li>
            <li>Using this product smooths out the rough places, and makes a smooth surface before applying polish.  </li>
            <li>It does dry quickly when I put it on before polishing</li>
            <li>It seems that it would be appropriate to be applied over the polish, and not appropriate without any nail polish?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The same exact polish from the same exact bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have to be honest, I was pretty skeptical of this before buying.  </li>
            <li>Well........ if you do your own nails make sure you use Chip Skip by OPI for the base coat.  </li>
            <li>you put your own favorite base coat</li>
            <li>This makes my nail polish last so much longer</li>
            <li>and I do like so far.</li>

            <li> Have you ever been to different nail salons where when you leave one it lasts a long time and you leave another one and</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t have pretty nails.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t worry it does not actually make your nails dry).</li>
            <li> When you are done, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it chipping for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Never have I had nails stay in shape as long as they have after using this product.</li>
            <li> My nail polish lasts for SO long now.</li>
            <li> The lacquer is very thin and will last you a long time and is well worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> When this stuff came, I used it under China Glaze Strong Adhesion Base coat and the same pricey nail polish that didn&#x27;t last before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on other  products.  </li>
            <li> i wish it lasted longer,it smelled pretty weird</li>
            <li> Use it after my nails are finished and they last for two weeks at least.</li>
            <li> Felt like I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> thought it would be a base, but it disappears when I apply nail clean, unpolished...</li>
            <li> My polish stays on at least two times longer than it did without this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not only does it do nothing to prevent chipping, but it is difficult to tell if any is going on your nail because of the weird applicator.</li>
            <li> If I dare say, I think it has even helped my usual brittle, weak, thin nails become stronger.</li>
            <li> I would spend an hour manicuring my nails and get so frustrated the next day when it would begin to chip, even if I used expensive polish.  </li>
            <li> and I was confused and asked her what it was.</li>
            <li> No regular base coat (she didn&#x27;t at the Mani)</li>
            <li> I was afraid I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> You just brush a thin layer on your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I got bored with the color and went out and purchased this at Ulta.</li>
            <li> so my hands are always getting dirty, beat up etc because of dealing with building supplies.</li>
            <li> think I bought the wrong product!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this chip preventor has been very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> so I was very sad.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use a base coat when using this.  </li>
            <li> If you get it, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in product.  </li>

            <li> Product is ok, I don&#x27;t know if it really helps a lot like the products used on me in my nail salon, but then again I did a lot of cleaning last week...We will see.  I did like that it dries very quickly so I did not have to wait like another coat of polish.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing. I first heard about it when I had a manicure done at a beauty school where I live. I saw her use the product and I was confused and asked her what it was. She told me about it and explain what it did and I was fascinated. A week lat my nails were barely chipped. I work at a home improvement store as a cashier so my hands are always getting dirty, beat up etc because of dealing with building supplies. after 1 week only the tips were slightly chipped but still looks really good. so I got bored with the color and went out and purchased this at Ulta. I used the chip skip and my Maybelline holographic nail color with a cheapie top coat. No regular base coat (she didn&#x27;t at the Mani) once again its been almost a week and my nails are barely chipped. From now on every time I do my nails, I have to use this product. Just BC I work at a home improvement store doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t have pretty nails. This makes it happen and I am so happy I found out about this!!!! I will gladly tell anyone of my friends to use it!</li>
            <li> OPI Chip Skip really works!  Have you ever been to different nail salons where when you leave one it lasts a long time and you leave another one and it chips the next day or two.  Well........ if you do your own nails make sure you use Chip Skip by OPI for the base coat.  When you are done, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it chipping for a long time.  The lacquer is very thin and will last you a long time and is well worth the extra money.  If you get it, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of applications claiming to prevent chipping and wearing on the tips of my nails but nothing has worked until now.  It really does extend the life of your manicure.</li>
            <li> Do you ever wonder how to get salon looking nails without going to the salon?  I would spend an hour manicuring my nails and get so frustrated the next day when it would begin to chip, even if I used expensive polish.  A sales person convinced me to try Chip Skip.  Why not?  I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on other  products.  Well...this one made a believer out of me.  It evaporates almost as soon as you apply it but it is a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, I was pretty skeptical of this before buying.  I was afraid I wasted my money.  I used it the day I received it and my nail polish has stayed on for a week.  No chips or any signs of chipping.  Works awesome.  I didn&#x27;t use a base coat when using this.  Just went straight to the color.</li>
            <li> LOVE Chip Skip! A woman who gave me a manicure used it and my polish stayed on much longer. I have kids so I am always washing dishes, giving baths, and using my hands, so I needed something to lessen the amount of times per week I was painting my nails. Thanks OPI!</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would work wonders but I don&#x27;t even notice a difference when I use it or not. It does dry quickly when I put it on before polishing but it seems like my polish cheaps just the same as when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> Never have I had nails stay in shape as long as they have after using this product.</li>
            <li> This really works. Before my polish was chippedat the tips by the next day. Now it last for over a week with no chips. Great product.</li>
            <li> This makes my nail polish last so much longer and it is the best. Use it after my nails are finished and they last for two weeks at least.</li>
            <li> Chip Skip is a great product</li>
            <li> Works well. I use it every time I do my nails. It does help them to last longer. They also use something similar in the nail shops .</li>
            <li> my favorite....will never be out of this</li>
            <li> Chipped first day.  I was very disappointed in product.  Felt like I wasted my money.  It did not perform as advertized.</li>
            <li> Not only does it do nothing to prevent chipping, but it is difficult to tell if any is going on your nail because of the weird applicator.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> My nails are often brittle, snag easily, and even when I file them, I some times have rough spots.  Using this product smooths out the rough places, and makes a smooth surface before applying polish.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hello!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product thinking in preventing or stopping the cracks of my nails, but do not know if it will work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be a base, but it disappears when I apply nail clean, unpolished...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I bought the wrong product! It seems that it would be appropriate to be applied over the polish, and not appropriate without any nail polish?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could someone help me what is the right way to use it?&lt;br /&gt;For example, can I go polish over this product? Or this only serves to pass over the polish?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I just want to make very clear this is not a base coat or nail laqcuer. It is a primer, it&#x27;s watery, and basically what it does is it &#x27;dries&#x27; up the top layer of your nail (don&#x27;t worry it does not actually make your nails dry). It cleans the surface and removes all oil so your nail polish stays on better. You don&#x27;t need to add a lot to have result. You just brush a thin layer on your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you put your own favorite base coat (please do not skip this step to protect your nails), then your favorite nailn lqqcuer color, then your fave top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear this works. My nails are very brittle and thin and chip so easily. This product makes your mani last much longer which is great. Escepcially if you are wearing your more rare or precious colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to do your mani the right way, this is a must-have for all polish-lovers girls.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see a significant difference in the length of wear in my manicures. I really didn&#x27;t care for how drying it was to my nail bed either-- my nails would feel brittle after taking off my polish. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> On time shipping.  Came as shown, works amazingly.  My polish stays on at least two times longer than it did without this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest paring it with opi nail envy. They work wonders together.</li>
            <li> Maybe works better over time...only used twice and I do like so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally post about beauty products because, let&#x27;s face it, most over promise and under deliver.  But this stuff is frickin amazing.  I tried a premium nail polish and it lasted 24 hours so I was very sad.  When this stuff came, I used it under China Glaze Strong Adhesion Base coat and the same pricey nail polish that didn&#x27;t last before.  It has lasted days.  The same exact polish from the same exact bottle.  Even though I just did some yard work.  I really can&#x27;t believe it.  Very happy.  I hope they never stop making this product.</li>
            <li> Usually very happy with OPI products.  Unfortunately, this chip preventor has been very disappointing.  Didn&#x27;t seem to be any difference in how quickly the nail polish started to chip after applying this versus not using it at all.</li>
            <li> it did a great job it lasted about 3 to 4 days i wish it lasted longer,it smelled pretty weird and i wish the brush was bigger but either than that it did good. the package arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I never knew such a product existed! This was super easy to apply and it definitely makes my manicure last a lot longer. I can barely make my manicure last for a week, so this has been awesome!</li>
            <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. My nail polish lasts for SO long now. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Totally happy about this purchase... definitely delayed the chipping process! If I dare say, I think it has even helped my usual brittle, weak, thin nails become stronger. After using it for the first time, my nails are the longest they have ever been. So happy!</li>
