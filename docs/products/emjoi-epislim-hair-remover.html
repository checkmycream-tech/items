    <ol>
            <li>You see an unwanted stray hair and it pulls it out perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great !  </li>
            <li>Awesome!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product for legs and arms and armpits.</li>
            <li>So now, I use it on my thighs, and it&#x27;s perfect for that.</li>
            <li>but if you read the instructions all the way through and follow the directions it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the purchase!</li>
            <li>it makes a great gift for your hairy girlfriend/wife/cousin/best friend etc.... who spends a lot of money on waxing their face.</li>
            <li>I have experienced no issues with ingrown hairs or irritated skin after using this.</li>
            <li>This is a gem - for a great price.</li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>it does a great job on the rest.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but eats batteries faster than it epilates hair.</li>
            <li>n was happy to find one 4</li>
            <li>a great</li>
            <li>Ive tried creams that were not all that successful and waxing.  </li>
            <li>fair skinned- hairs are unnoticeable to anyone but me)- it does not hurt there because I am use to plucking that area</li>
            <li>Very pleased,</li>
            <li>love and wholly endorse this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and light haired so that could be another reason it misses some.</li>
            <li>So much better than tweeing or waxing.</li>
            <li>I always used it for under my arms and it got MOST of it out.</li>
            <li>she love it</li>
            <li>Sincerely, Lynne K. Betzler</li>
            <li>it works like magic.</li>
            <li>Tweezy the competitor does a better job.</li>
            <li>The longer the hairs the more it hurts.</li>
            <li>This so much better than using face creams to remove hair</li>
            <li>It works, just not any better.</li>
            <li>I have ordered many of this product for my family and friends.</li>
            <li>all of them are satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Some areas hurt more-</li>
            <li>Sometimes if it feels like its not grabbing the hair properly, you should turn the epilator around to see what works best.</li>
            <li>more easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even with generic batteries the life is great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with it.</li>
            <li>It was okay, but didn&#x27;t grab a lot of the hair, so I prefer shaving.</li>
            <li>I really am glad that I bought it.  </li>
            <li>It s easy to use</li>
            <li>I find that mine works best if I hold it upside down.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, easy to clean, and the battery lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>it works great on coarse chin</li>
            <li>Too big for eyebrows, but great for underarms and the rest of the face.  </li>
            <li>and my face is smooth.</li>
            <li>It does sound like a shaver, but it works.</li>
            <li>Overall a great buy</li>
            <li>Does a great  job on facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to get this epilator</li>
            <li>they have been using this for more than 2 years and it still works like the first day.</li>
            <li>i was super excited to try this out.</li>
            <li>To me, it is NOT painful, but I&#x27;ve gotten my ankle tattooed so to compare this to my ankle tattoo would be a 2.5 on the pain scale.  </li>
            <li>I love that it was a fast shipment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much easier and better than tweezer&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much, I bought another one- just in case.  </li>
            <li>but you do get use to it fairly quick.</li>
            <li>but so worth it to not have ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I found this to be a wonderful little tool for removing facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to use as a more economical, travel-sized, quieter version of a larger Emjoi epilator</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t run super fast</li>
            <li>Overall, I was satisfied with its job, but I&#x27;m definitely on the look out for a better one.</li>
            <li>My friend has the same one from a couple of years ago and hers works MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as I hoped.  </li>
            <li>but when I first received it, it was broken!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Of course there&#x27;s pain when you first use it on your underarms</li>
            <li>sure you read the directions and maybe even do some additional research only before you use this product.</li>
            <li>Love that it gets the smaller areas easier.</li>
            <li>Just suck it up the first couple of times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll need to use quite often during the first month</li>
            <li>The first time it stung, but it was still tolerable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an okay epilator, especially for a beginner.</li>
            <li>I bought this when they first came out about 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li>My daughter took the first one I purchased.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The trouble is I needed to attend to the new growth quickly and having this EpiSlim remover is extremely handy.  </li>
            <li>This is the first Epilator I&#x27;ve ever tried, and so far I find this one useful.</li>
            <li>I used the tweezie single head, so thought this would be better, but it is not.  </li>
            <li>(it just feels like a quick pluck), the upper lip was considerably more sensitive, but not an intolerable pain, more like the feeling of a hard snap with a quick, fleeting burn.</li>
            <li>I purchased it mainly for my armpits and bikini line, I have not needed to shave since!</li>
            <li>Like the reviews say, works better on fine hairs than thick ones.</li>
            <li>I feel as if I have whiskers showing that&#x27;s very embarrassing.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi allows me to remove that hair for extended periods and much quicker than tweezing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really meant for more than a touch up on legs.</li>
            <li>If you are epilating areas which you have only shaved before (like armpits) you will be amazed by how smooth the skin feels when you are done.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t cost as much as waxing</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t read this right away and nearly pulled my eye lid off.  </li>
            <li>Hurts a little at first but gets better...</li>
            <li>If you want to epilate your bikini area this doesn&#x27;t work to well, or other areas that aren&#x27;t more &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really only gets bigger hairs, thicker hairs hurt a bit more but get pulled pretty well.</li>
            <li>Overall this epilator worked quickly and left my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;m not using it for long, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>A full facial wax can cost $35+&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made the whole process a little more time consuming.</li>
            <li>They claim that the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for 3-4 weeks, but it&#x27;s more like 5-6 days before the hair comes back.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend the Emoji EpiSlim Hair Remover as it is a much better method than tweezing each individual hair or shaving.</li>
            <li>even if it doesn&#x27;t grab all the hair, it does a decent job anyway.</li>
            <li>I just love this little hair removal tool.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this epilator.  </li>
            <li>Took over a week to return to normal.</li>
            <li>No lasting irritation (it does get red, but goes away pretty quickly), and</li>
            <li>This process feels basically similar to taking a pair of tweezers and pulling the hair out, however you are able to do multiple hairs at time and cover the area much quicker, saving the time consuming process of tweezing each individual hair.</li>
            <li>so Im not concerned about getting new ones continually.  </li>
            <li>She said it was painful but honestly, if you&#x27;ve been tattooed before, you will be able to tolerate this.</li>
            <li>Barely used it, hurt too much</li>
            <li>If your leg hair is pretty long, I suggest using a razor the first time and then using the epilator when your leg hair begins to come back.</li>
            <li>but now my armpit hair are invisible (when i&#x27;m not staring at them directly).</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t follow the directions your skin could get marked up</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to pull the hairs out very efficiently, so I have to go over the same section over and over again.</li>
            <li>so much I bought a second one for my travel bag.</li>
            <li>The emjoi takes care of that, leaving my thighs nearly hairless with no razor bumps or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>so now i have to waste more time and money in shipping it back!</li>
            <li>I use this for those unwanted dark (and light) hairs under my chin and on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest that if you plan to use this for under the arms, you get one with a larger head.</li>
            <li>Thin hairs don&#x27;t hurt much at all, and this gets rid of really easily.</li>
            <li>As for how long the hair stays gone, it really isn&#x27;t that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The emjoi fails to grab any of the coarse dark hairs, but easily grabs the fine light hair, which I have absolutely no problem with having.</li>
            <li>The batteries must be full in order for it to spin fast enough, which is a total waste of batteries.</li>
            <li>i tried on different batteries and even went to buy new batteries and still nothing.</li>
            <li>Much easier and gentler to use on smaller areas than the larger versions.</li>
            <li>I also use this on my legs now and although I have a hard time getting the fine hairs on my knees-</li>
            <li>Oh yes this is small, powerful and works!  </li>
            <li>No regrets!</li>
            <li>It says it can be used for facial hair, but I find that the pulling action at high speed is too rough for my face.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt on the chin, but the area of your lip just below your nose hurts (don&#x27;t skip that part or you will look like Hitler), but it&#x27;s over pretty fast and the hair grows back as slow as when you wax, but you do it at home</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about it, but it works for small jobs and on the face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this epilator for my legs doesn&#x27;t hurt after the first few times.</li>
            <li>It is relatively painless, and your skin will adjust to it after the first few times you do it.</li>
            <li>It does hurt a little bit, but it really isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>like very much that it&#x27;s cordless, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do the job as well, and sounds a bit like a lawnmower for such a small appliance.</li>

            <li> This process feels basically similar to taking a pair of tweezers and pulling the hair out, however you are able to do multiple hairs at time and cover the area much quicker, saving the time consuming process of tweezing each individual hair.</li>
            <li> so Im not concerned about getting new ones continually.  </li>
            <li> She said it was painful but honestly, if you&#x27;ve been tattooed before, you will be able to tolerate this.</li>
            <li> Barely used it, hurt too much</li>
            <li> If your leg hair is pretty long, I suggest using a razor the first time and then using the epilator when your leg hair begins to come back.</li>
            <li> but now my armpit hair are invisible (when i&#x27;m not staring at them directly).</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t follow the directions your skin could get marked up</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t seem to pull the hairs out very efficiently, so I have to go over the same section over and over again.</li>
            <li> so much I bought a second one for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> The emjoi takes care of that, leaving my thighs nearly hairless with no razor bumps or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> so now i have to waste more time and money in shipping it back!</li>
            <li> I use this for those unwanted dark (and light) hairs under my chin and on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest that if you plan to use this for under the arms, you get one with a larger head.</li>
            <li> Thin hairs don&#x27;t hurt much at all, and this gets rid of really easily.</li>
            <li> As for how long the hair stays gone, it really isn&#x27;t that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The emjoi fails to grab any of the coarse dark hairs, but easily grabs the fine light hair, which I have absolutely no problem with having.</li>
            <li> The batteries must be full in order for it to spin fast enough, which is a total waste of batteries.</li>
            <li> i tried on different batteries and even went to buy new batteries and still nothing.</li>
            <li> Much easier and gentler to use on smaller areas than the larger versions.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my legs now and although I have a hard time getting the fine hairs on my knees-</li>
            <li> Oh yes this is small, powerful and works!  </li>
            <li> No regrets!</li>
            <li> It says it can be used for facial hair, but I find that the pulling action at high speed is too rough for my face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt on the chin, but the area of your lip just below your nose hurts (don&#x27;t skip that part or you will look like Hitler), but it&#x27;s over pretty fast and the hair grows back as slow as when you wax, but you do it at home</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about it, but it works for small jobs and on the face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this epilator for my legs doesn&#x27;t hurt after the first few times.</li>
            <li> It is relatively painless, and your skin will adjust to it after the first few times you do it.</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little bit, but it really isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> like very much that it&#x27;s cordless, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do the job as well, and sounds a bit like a lawnmower for such a small appliance.</li>
            <li> I needed this for my irritating hair on my upper lip mostly and some other spots.  </li>
            <li> batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> I never shave above the knee anymore because I end up with razor bumps and ingrown hairs every single time I do it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the small fine hairs it has a hard time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud</li>
            <li> Major waste of money, I still ended up having to use my tweezers to pluck the hairs this contraption would not pull (long and short hairs).  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it would break the hair and not get the entire hair out from the root, and it is much harder for it to pick up on smaller/thinner hairs.</li>
            <li> IT IS A HELPFUL ITEM, A LOT LESS FACIAL TWEEZING BY HAND.</li>
            <li> The second use was WAY less pain.</li>
            <li> but, I do have a little extra &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; in areas that I&#x27;d rather not.  </li>
            <li> Oh, did I mention its more painful than plucking the hairs with tweezers?</li>
            <li> These things do not really work for any length of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very hairy,</li>
            <li> It removes hair from the face with minimal pain.  </li>
            <li> Just too much pain for the poor results.  </li>
            <li> This,,,the one I had 4 like 10 yrs finally went dead</li>
            <li> I am a young woman (under 25) with A LOT of dark, thick hair on her chin.</li>
            <li> But exfoliators will help the marks fade away after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Don&#x27;t use on long hairs.</li>
            <li> I have used this product every other morning</li>
            <li> Hair grows back slowly</li>
            <li> , I feel a slight stinging sensation that lasts for just a bit.</li>
            <li> Of course there is some pain as with any epilator, but over time, hair is finer and less of it, so you just need to be patient.</li>
            <li> And the shorter the hair is the less it hurts (also skin should be pulled taut).</li>
            <li> the pain was less than I anticipated, and you build a tolerance to it.</li>
            <li> Using this product on shorter hairs makes it hurt less (or not hurt at all once you get used to it</li>
            <li> I have black hair, so shaving still leaves a &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; under my arms.</li>
            <li> However, it was pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> I suppose there are probably some that work better than this, but this one isn&#x27;t bad!</li>
            <li> but it can hurt a little like plucking your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> armpits, it always stung a little</li>
            <li> I did end up finding a way to use this product that works for me, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve wasted money on it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not as messy as wax.  </li>
            <li> Van be painful at first</li>
            <li> It was painful the first time I used it and has become less painful with each subsequent use.</li>
            <li> It has a hard time getting all the hairs in some areas, and there is some skin redness (as with ANY hair removal process)</li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way when I used it on my belly area.</li>
            <li> I have to have my lip and chin waxed at least 1 to 2 times a month.</li>
            <li> You do have to pull your skin taunt and move slowly against the direction of the hair growth.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually not that bad.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t painful to me as others have reported and it nicely removes that nasty peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Maybe there is something wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely ADDICTED to this Emjoi!</li>
            <li> After trying this product out, for me, it fails to meet my expectations for the intended purpose I ordered it for.</li>
            <li> It is extremely embarrassing and horrifying to me.</li>
            <li> The irritation was so bad.</li>
            <li> And just a warning, it was quite painful when I tried using it on my face.</li>
            <li> Some have commented on &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34;, I don&#x27;t find it painful</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it painful at all to remove hair from under the chin</li>
            <li> Not unlike shaving, this item causes me to have some ingrown hairs, which I hate, but is unavoidable for some if you don&#x27;t want to have a furry face.</li>
            <li> Yeah, painful!</li>
            <li> Very painful.</li>
            <li> BUT once i received the package and put batteries in it i was so disappointed!!!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible, terrible idea.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So much better than tweeing or waxing. Hurts a little at first but gets better...batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a wonderful little tool for removing facial hair.  You do have to pull your skin taunt and move slowly against the direction of the hair growth.  It wasn&#x27;t painful to me as others have reported and it nicely removes that nasty peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> I always used it for under my arms and it got MOST of it out. Sometimes it would break the hair and not get the entire hair out from the root, and it is much harder for it to pick up on smaller/thinner hairs. It made the whole process a little more time consuming. Overall, I was satisfied with its job, but I&#x27;m definitely on the look out for a better one. I highly suggest that if you plan to use this for under the arms, you get one with a larger head. And just a warning, it was quite painful when I tried using it on my face. It felt like I was under attack. Ouch.</li>
            <li> I already hsd one i bought for my mom she love it</li>
            <li> It does not work as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> IMPROVES WITH USE....NOT ALL FACIAL HAIR IS REMOVED. HOWEVER. IT IS A HELPFUL ITEM, A LOT LESS FACIAL TWEEZING BY HAND.</li>
            <li> I should have learned my lesson by now!!  These things do not really work for any length of time.</li>
            <li> Barely used it, hurt too much</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the root out. I feel as if I have whiskers showing that&#x27;s very embarrassing. My friend has the same one from a couple of years ago and hers works MUCH BETTER. I would definitely want to try another of the same. Maybe there is something wrong with this one. I would appreciate hearing from you. Sincerely, Lynne K. Betzler</li>
            <li> Works exactly as I hoped.  You see an unwanted stray hair and it pulls it out perfectly.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this epilator but when I first received it, it was broken!!&lt;br /&gt;I put batteries in and it won&#x27;t start. Waste of money!! DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> This is my third unit. I have used this for years!</li>
            <li> I saw this girl on youtube remove her sideburns using this epilator. She said it was painful but honestly, if you&#x27;ve been tattooed before, you will be able to tolerate this. To me, it is NOT painful, but I&#x27;ve gotten my ankle tattooed so to compare this to my ankle tattoo would be a 2.5 on the pain scale.  The only time it hurts is the roof of my lip. Overall this epilator worked quickly and left my skin smooth. I love that it was a fast shipment.&lt;br /&gt;Product Recommendation: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;BUY DOUBLE AA Batteries, you need 2 of them since it doesn&#x27;t come with it.&lt;br /&gt;Also it makes a great gift for your hairy girlfriend/wife/cousin/best friend etc.... who spends a lot of money on waxing their face. A full facial wax can cost $35+&lt;br /&gt;It works!</li>
            <li> Did its job , I&#x27; m worried that upon multiple uses it will not be as efficient. I will have to stock up and buy a couple of these.&lt;br /&gt;Will I suggest this to anyone- It works and hair is gone!!! for weeks. It s easy to use and I use it for eye brows as well it works like magic.</li>
            <li> This is for me...I&#x27;m not very hairy, but, I do have a little extra &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; in areas that I&#x27;d rather not.  The Emjoi allows me to remove that hair for extended periods and much quicker than tweezing. Some have commented on &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34;, I don&#x27;t find it painful, I feel a slight stinging sensation that lasts for just a bit.</li>
            <li> I got this because of the price in case I couldn&#x27;t take the pain. It&#x27;s actually not that bad. I use it for my legs. The second use was WAY less pain. I only gave it four stars because it does miss hairs. But, that could be user malfunction! It&#x27;s not really meant for more than a touch up on legs. I&#x27;m fair skinned and light haired so that could be another reason it misses some.</li>
            <li> It is relatively painless, and your skin will adjust to it after the first few times you do it. It has a hard time getting all the hairs in some areas, and there is some skin redness (as with ANY hair removal process) but if you read the instructions all the way through and follow the directions it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> What I Like:  it works great on coarse chin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t Like: the instructions not to use it around your eye.  didn&#x27;t read this right away and nearly pulled my eye lid off.  read the directions before using it.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this epilator.  Too big for eyebrows, but great for underarms and the rest of the face.  Of course there is some pain as with any epilator, but over time, hair is finer and less of it, so you just need to be patient.</li>
            <li> Only removes longer hair.  Short hair needs to be removed with a tweezer.  Tweezy the competitor does a better job.</li>
            <li> Of course there&#x27;s pain when you first use it on your underarms but now my armpit hair are invisible (when i&#x27;m not staring at them directly). Works well on my legs. Hair grows back slowly&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you read the directions and maybe even do some additional research only before you use this product. If you don&#x27;t follow the directions your skin could get marked up and you will get ingrown hairs. I learned that the hard way when I used it on my belly area. But exfoliators will help the marks fade away after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Don&#x27;t use on long hairs. The longer the hairs the more it hurts.</li>
            <li> Great !  Much easier and better than tweezer&#x27;s.  Gave three for birthday gifts.  Very pleased,</li>
            <li> Item was not of the quality I was seeking. I return item, unused.</li>
            <li> i was super excited to try this out. BUT once i received the package and put batteries in it i was so disappointed!!!!! it did not work! i tried on different batteries and even went to buy new batteries and still nothing. so now i have to waste more time and money in shipping it back!</li>
            <li> This so much better than using face creams to remove hair but it can hurt a little like plucking your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the purchase!</li>
            <li> I used the tweezie single head, so thought this would be better, but it is not.  It works, just not any better.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a more economical, travel-sized, quieter version of a larger Emjoi epilator I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like very much that it&#x27;s cordless, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do the job as well, and sounds a bit like a lawnmower for such a small appliance. I&#x27;m not crazy about it, but it works for small jobs and on the face. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to pull the hairs out very efficiently, so I have to go over the same section over and over again.</li>
            <li> I have ordered many of this product for my family and friends. all of them are satisfied with the quality. they have been using this for more than 2 years and it still works like the first day.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and exactly as described. Much easier and gentler to use on smaller areas than the larger versions.</li>
            <li> I use this for those unwanted dark (and light) hairs under my chin and on my upper lip. This process feels basically similar to taking a pair of tweezers and pulling the hair out, however you are able to do multiple hairs at time and cover the area much quicker, saving the time consuming process of tweezing each individual hair. It removes the bulk of hair, however there is often a problem hair here or there that for some reason doesn&#x27;t get removed even if you go over it multiple times. I didn&#x27;t find it painful at all to remove hair from under the chin (it just feels like a quick pluck), the upper lip was considerably more sensitive, but not an intolerable pain, more like the feeling of a hard snap with a quick, fleeting burn. They claim that the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for 3-4 weeks, but it&#x27;s more like 5-6 days before the hair comes back. I have experienced no issues with ingrown hairs or irritated skin after using this. Overall, I would recommend the Emoji EpiSlim Hair Remover as it is a much better method than tweezing each individual hair or shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought one 3 years ago.  I love it so much, I bought another one- just in case.  It removes hair from the face with minimal pain.  It is easy to use, easy to clean, and the battery lasts forever.  This is a gem - for a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this. I have to have my lip and chin waxed at least 1 to 2 times a month. I have used this product every other morning and my face is smooth. It does sound like a shaver, but it works. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Not unlike shaving, this item causes me to have some ingrown hairs, which I hate, but is unavoidable for some if you don&#x27;t want to have a furry face. It was painful the first time I used it and has become less painful with each subsequent use. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!!!!!! Love that it gets the smaller areas easier. Van be painful at first but so worth it to not have ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely ADDICTED to this Emjoi! I purchased it mainly for my armpits and bikini line, I have not needed to shave since! Simply liberating! LOL!&lt;br /&gt;Does it hurt? Hell yeah- you are pulling hair from the roots! Some areas hurt more- but you do get use to it fairly quick. And the shorter the hair is the less it hurts (also skin should be pulled taut). I also use this on my legs now and although I have a hard time getting the fine hairs on my knees- it does a great job on the rest. It&#x27;s just the small fine hairs it has a hard time with.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this on my upper lip (and I am fair skinned- hairs are unnoticeable to anyone but me)- it does not hurt there because I am use to plucking that area anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So some tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st- if you are thinking about this- stop thinking and just buy- nobody ever misses shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd- the pain was less than I anticipated, and you build a tolerance to it. Just suck it up the first couple of times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd- you&#x27;ll need to use quite often during the first month or so b/c hair grows at different rates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4th- watch out b/c it is very addictive. If you are epilating areas which you have only shaved before (like armpits) you will be amazed by how smooth the skin feels when you are done. It truly is so amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love and wholly endorse this product!</li>
            <li> Oh yes this is small, powerful and works!  I needed this for my irritating hair on my upper lip mostly and some other spots.  Ive tried creams that were not all that successful and waxing.  The trouble is I needed to attend to the new growth quickly and having this EpiSlim remover is extremely handy.  I use rechargeable batteries for it so Im not concerned about getting new ones continually.  I just love this little hair removal tool.</li>
            <li> I like that the hair takes longer to grow back but it does not remove some of the stubborn hair, I have to remove those with a tweezer.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. It&#x27;s a little loud but since I&#x27;m not using it for long, it&#x27;s fine. Sometimes if it feels like its not grabbing the hair properly, you should turn the epilator around to see what works best. I find that mine works best if I hold it upside down. Overall a great buy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but eats batteries faster than it epilates hair. Like the reviews say, works better on fine hairs than thick ones.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for legs and arms and armpits. It says it can be used for facial hair, but I find that the pulling action at high speed is too rough for my face. I use a sugar wax for my face instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this epilator for my legs doesn&#x27;t hurt after the first few times. The first time it stung, but it was still tolerable. If your leg hair is pretty long, I suggest using a razor the first time and then using the epilator when your leg hair begins to come back. Using this product on shorter hairs makes it hurt less (or not hurt at all once you get used to it and your hair follicles let go of the hair more easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For armpits, it always stung a little and I never got used to it enough that it didn&#x27;t hurt a bit. If you stretch your armpit skin taut, that helps. I only use it for armpits if I know I am going to wear a lot of dresses. I have black hair, so shaving still leaves a &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; under my arms. This epilator makes that shadow go away,</li>
            <li> Even with generic batteries the life is great!  I like it so much I bought a second one for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Just too much pain for the poor results.  Give me waxing and plucking any day.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first Epilator I&#x27;ve ever tried, and so far I find this one useful. I suppose there are probably some that work better than this, but this one isn&#x27;t bad! It does hurt a little bit, but it really isn&#x27;t much. If you want to epilate your bikini area this doesn&#x27;t work to well, or other areas that aren&#x27;t more &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really only gets bigger hairs, thicker hairs hurt a bit more but get pulled pretty well. Thin hairs don&#x27;t hurt much at all, and this gets rid of really easily. As for how long the hair stays gone, it really isn&#x27;t that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an okay epilator, especially for a beginner. I&#x27;m glad I went with it. No regrets!</li>
            <li> This,,,the one I had 4 like 10 yrs finally went dead n was happy to find one 4 a great price,,,will go back 4 another jus in case,,,</li>
            <li> After trying this product out, for me, it fails to meet my expectations for the intended purpose I ordered it for. The batteries must be full in order for it to spin fast enough, which is a total waste of batteries. I am a young woman (under 25) with A LOT of dark, thick hair on her chin. It is extremely embarrassing and horrifying to me. The emjoi fails to grab any of the coarse dark hairs, but easily grabs the fine light hair, which I have absolutely no problem with having. I&#x27;ve ended up with a lot of irritation and ingrown hairs after using on my face, so instead of saving myself time from tweezing, I have to tweeze anyway whether I use the emjoi or not (I don&#x27;t use it on my face anymore). I tried using it on my underarms next. Terrible, terrible idea. The irritation was so bad. Took over a week to return to normal. Then I started using on my legs. It was okay, but didn&#x27;t grab a lot of the hair, so I prefer shaving. So now, I use it on my thighs, and it&#x27;s perfect for that. No lasting irritation (it does get red, but goes away pretty quickly), and even if it doesn&#x27;t grab all the hair, it does a decent job anyway. I never shave above the knee anymore because I end up with razor bumps and ingrown hairs every single time I do it. The emjoi takes care of that, leaving my thighs nearly hairless with no razor bumps or ingrown hairs. I did end up finding a way to use this product that works for me, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve wasted money on it. However, it was pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this when they first came out about 4 years ago.  I really like it.  Does it hurt?  Yeah!  Does it work? Yeah!  It doesn&#x27;t hurt on the chin, but the area of your lip just below your nose hurts (don&#x27;t skip that part or you will look like Hitler), but it&#x27;s over pretty fast and the hair grows back as slow as when you wax, but you do it at home and it doesn&#x27;t cost as much as waxing and it&#x27;s not as messy as wax.  I suggest that you buy some of the stuff that reduces any tiny itchy bumps that you may get after you use this product.  I really am glad that I bought it.  **If it doesn&#x27;t run super fast it&#x27;s time to change the batteries.</li>
            <li> Very painful. Major waste of money, I still ended up having to use my tweezers to pluck the hairs this contraption would not pull (long and short hairs).  It 5% hit and 95% miss with this thing!!! Oh, did I mention its more painful than plucking the hairs with tweezers? Yeah, painful!</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  My daughter took the first one I purchased.  Does a great  job on facial hair.  Would purchase again.</li>
