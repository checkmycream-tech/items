            <li>Tried it from another source and liked it.  </li>
            <li>My mom had tried it and liked it.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Great price for a great product and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>And from the first use, incredible as that sounds, I have noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Does feel good going on though, smooth feeling and did not sting.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my clean skin..before bed.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>My favorite night serum works miracle at night while sleeping goes on like water and immediately begins to work with no irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>, I have many products, believe me when I say this one is tops.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>I love this retinol product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products over the years, and this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>I was scared to use it, but gave it a shot and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Having just begun a retinol regimen at age 33, I was hoping for greater results.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it could be more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I use it nightly and love it.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the peter Thomas products and had not tried this..</li>
            <li>I purchased it about a month ago and am in love..</li>
            <li>I have been using for all most 2 months</li>
            <li>I think with continued use I will see more of a difference</li>
            <li>I have tried many over the counter or department store brands of retinol products.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many products to help reduce their apperance...</li>
            <li>Actually, the product is excellent.</li>
            <li>The dropper takes some getting used to, would be much more helpful/easy to use if it wasn&#x27;t a dropper.</li>
            <li>The breakouts did not diminish or get better while using this.  </li>
            <li>Skin looks better.</li>
            <li>I would give it MORE than 5 stars if I could!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mostly, they like it, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>and I have now used this for more than 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wear sun screen throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I immediately use this after I&#x27;ve washed my face with the PTR Glycolic Acid Facial Wash and my skin feel so great!</li>
            <li>It feels like I am putting baby oil on my face and nothing more.</li>
            <li>The review also suggested this was the best overall product to buy.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product, the results, and definitely the price I paid at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li>Love this, it&#x27;s not drying so</li>
            <li>I have used Peter Thomas Roth products for a couple of years and find that using the serum nightly helps my aging skin look smoother and gives it more color and life.</li>
            <li>This is a VERY light weight formula that is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I am consistently getting compliments on how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>Amazon provides a great price, cheapest I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>When I took the plastic off, the dropper top was cracked and would not close securely.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how good my skin looks after using this whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much!!!</li>
            <li>I liked it right away.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly into the skin and makes my skin feel like silk.</li>
            <li>but it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very light, absorbs quickly and makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li>My fine wrinkles are already disappearing.</li>
            <li>I am using it together with my night treatment Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment with Kojic Acid, Arbutin &amp; Vitamin C, 2oz, which is a brightening treatment</li>
            <li>Worth the investment :)</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Was using a couple of Paula&#x27;s Choice retinol serums and found them just okay, pleasant to use but performance less than outstanding.</li>
            <li>This product also seems to slide and drip out of the dropper very easily so make sure to use it properly so not to waste any and keep it away from your eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now &amp; the results are amazing, honestly!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this product I love love love this product again thank you so much</li>
            <li>The first two bottles arrived with a sealed top.....</li>
            <li>I originally bought the cream and found this product.</li>
            <li>This serum goes on smoothly &amp; absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this except that it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause my skin to peel or be radiant as much as compared to the retinol from my skin doc.</li>
            <li>Is the retinol concentration true?</li>
            <li>I have noticed that after a couple of days, my top layer begins to gently flake, which I want it to do.  </li>
            <li>It works but is gentle, love the consistency and the dropper.</li>
            <li>Others have stated there would be a peeling reaction, which I have experienced before with other retinol products.</li>
            <li>P.T.R. is, in my book, one of the ultimate best facial products I have ever used.</li>
            <li>High price , find ferulic acid or hyaluric acid products with argan oil a much better product for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Will be back for more!</li>
            <li>The only retinol serum approved by Environmental Working Group for having safe ingredients, yay!</li>
            <li>Goes on like a real serum, non oily but super smooth.</li>
            <li>and this is the first retinol product with a high percentage that I have been able to use with all the benefits and none of the irritation or drying effect.</li>
            <li>I also will drop the product on my middle and pointing finger and then apply the product, which works just as effectively.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money and</li>
            <li>I love this product because it is retinol but not harsh.  </li>
            <li>Just because it has 1.5% retinol and they are not afraid to say it.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten comments from numerous people about how nice my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>I had been going to my doctors office and purchasing the Retinol and feel that the solution from Peter Thomas is far better..</li>
            <li>I have since started using more natural products that help with resurfacing...</li>
            <li>All P.T.R. products are a bit pricey but your face is worth the quality and results, right??</li>
            <li>Leaves your face nice and smooth but haven&#x27;t noticed any other differences to date.</li>
            <li>makes my skin feel very clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought my skin looked a little bit better, and I kept waiting for more significant results to kick in.  </li>
            <li>I had heard good things about PTR&#x27;s other products on Dr. Oz&#x27;s program.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>NO REASON THAT IT WANT BE RIGHT FOR YOU.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but for the money,I much prefer the Roc Multi correxion.  </li>
            <li>I certainly would not be with out this product it a must have.!</li>
            <li>On my personal &amp;#34;spa facial nights&amp;#34;  I use the complete DDF system and follow it with this product and every time it leaves my face so very clean, soft and incredibly radiant.</li>
            <li>I have noticed the lines between my eyes and forehead becoming less prominent.</li>
            <li>, IT&#x27;S VERY GENTLE</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smooths out and wrinkles you might have and leaves your skin with soft, smooth matted look with out being greasy.</li>
            <li>of this type take some time to produce results, and you need to keep using the product consistently - just like brushing your teeth.-</li>
            <li>Give it a try, this price is phenomenal, I&#x27;ve seen this exact product for 20 bucks above what this seller asks!</li>
            <li>Thank you do much for getting it to my home!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I have used different Retinol products and have found that this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is out second bottle and we love the way our skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li>This product is my first line on aging.  </li>
            <li>Tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream Night and found it also pleasant but not impressive.</li>
            <li>The product may be fine but the way PTR packages it needs a major improvement.  </li>
            <li>However, if you are not using a high concentration retinol right now-you most likely will have issues.    </li>
            <li>I use the eyedropper to place the retinol liquid directly on my cheeks and neck and then rub in with clean fingers.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>My skin improved so much after the first bottle I had to keep going with this product.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t supposed to do this, but it also cleared up some large pores and blackheads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then, I use a gentle exfoliater and my skin looks radiantly fresh and new again.  </li>
            <li>How ever I do NOT get injections aroung my eyes and this product, used nightly has made a very big difference in those fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I feel it has helped with fine lines and the overall time of my skin.</li>
            <li>Reduces fine lines and makes pores smaller.</li>
            <li>I use it every night and in only 1 week I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks to PTR for making products we can believe in and work for all women.  </li>
            <li>This did absolutely NOTHING for me.</li>
            <li>I get Botox injections and this has really made a difference in the amount of time that I can go between injections.  </li>
            <li>My face is much smoother and has a radiant glow.</li>
            <li>It will last for months and make your face look fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle formulation, but seems to work well.  </li>
            <li>I really like how fast it seems to work.</li>
            <li>I used up the whole bottle without noticing a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I save so much money by buying it here than a brick and mortar store!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I THINK THAT IT COST TO MUCH.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very liquidly</li>
            <li>so it mixes readily.</li>
            <li>It was much softer and also the tone was lighter and smoother.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m alive and God is here in my heart!!!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, is scentless and does not dry my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Products</li>
            <li>As I said, it absorbs very quickly so you can use a decent night time moisturizer with it as long as it doesn&#x27;t have ingredients that will irritate your skin when used with retinol.     </li>
            <li>I know has mentioned they&#x27;re lighter, so not really sure how effective the product is.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>The product arrived fully sealed and looks new!</li>
            <li>Although it usually takes weeks or months to see a difference in your skin when using a new product-it really only took a few days for me to notice a more even skin tone, better texture and better smoothness when using Retinol Fusion PM.</li>
            <li>I believe expectations to look thirty when you are not are always going to be too high.  </li>
            <li>So I looked for a retinol product that has a fairly high concentration and doesn&#x27;t cost in the hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>Just as I was about giving up on the gold standard skin beneficial ingredient due to allergic to every one of them, (though many claimed they were very gentle on the skin,)</li>
            <li>I have used retinoids for a few years now, some with better results than others.</li>
            <li>I have trouble with so many products.</li>
            <li>This is not as strong percentage of retinol as other products, but I think going to high makes you too sensitive to sun and causes irritation.</li>
            <li>AND THIS TIME I DECIDED TO TRY SOMETHING NEW AND STRONGER,</li>
            <li>The feel of it very silky and a couple of drops is enough for the whole face.</li>
            <li>Still, it was a disappointing purchase from PTR because I am sure that the damage to the top did not come from shipping.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard enough raves about Peter Thomas products and this is the first one I got in Sephora.</li>
            <li>My skin is baby soft &amp; glows!  </li>
            <li>Far exceeds Str-Vectin!</li>
            <li>Very effective...pricey, but effective and a small amount goes a long way..  </li>
            <li>not sure how safe it is to use products w/o a safety seal...</li>
            <li>this stuff has helped more than any other topical cream or treatment I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>But as far as effectiveness on wrinkles, this product ROCKS!</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it very liquid, almost like water and when I take a few drops on my fingers for an application, some of it ultimately go through my fingers which is kind of wasteful.</li>
            <li>It diminishes any uneven skin tones and fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It has had a clear effect on my skin.</li>
            <li>and my skin began to clear up.  </li>
            <li>I believe it clearly has made a difference in my aging skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This makes your face so soft.</li>
            <li>It is so silky and soft on the skin.  </li>
            <li>My face is so much clearer and younger looking.  </li>
            <li>and I do like it because it is not harsh at all for me</li>
            <li>Just a few drops at night makes your face feel smooth.</li>
            <li>product works really well and shows a difference the next day.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for nearly a year now, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>AS I ALWAYS NOTICE A REAL IMPROVEMENT ON MY PORES, HYPERPIGMENTATION, SKIN TEXTURE AND OVERALL TONE.</li>
            <li>I still have most of the bottle left, so it was a waste of $$ for me.</li>
            <li>I understand that you don&#x27;t want the concentration so high that you cause redness or itching or quick sloughing of the skin, but if I can&#x27;t tell a difference after using this morning and evening for 3 weeks, it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li>The product sinks right into the skin</li>
            <li>It sinks right in</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t strong enough to correct melasma alone, but other than that it does it all!</li>
            <li>but my small wrinkles started to disappear very quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this for the high concentration of retinol to mix with my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Lasts quite a long time and is a real bargain on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My deep wrinkles are softening and becoming much less deep.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get instant gratification, but after a few months you&#x27;ll see huge improvement.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this I was using Replenix 10X smoothing serum, so the step up to 1.5% concentration of retinol was natural and did not leave my skin red and flakey like it normally would.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant decrease in small lines.</li>
            <li>As weeks turned to months, I became less and less sure that my skin had in fact improved.  </li>
            <li>The point of retinol is to help increase cellular turnover; this feels like just putting a very high grade oil on your face--not displeasing, but certainly no change whatsover is noted</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin got red in the beginning.</li>
            <li>So far, this is the only Peter Thomas Roth product that I can recommend using.</li>
            <li>The fluid is not heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out which can happen with heavier oils.  </li>
            <li>secret many people still do not know about.</li>
            <li>Not a cheap pleasure, but you have to start somewhere, right.</li>
            <li>This is a miracle worker; it helps with scarring, small wrinkles, skin tone, mild acne.</li>
            <li>My article also has a link to other beauty products that really work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s &amp; have combo skin that has lost its luster &amp; some age spots, crows feet &amp; other assorted lovely lines that come with age.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the right way to spell it</li>

            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> And from the first use, incredible as that sounds, I have noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Does feel good going on though, smooth feeling and did not sting.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my clean skin..before bed.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> My favorite night serum works miracle at night while sleeping goes on like water and immediately begins to work with no irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> , I have many products, believe me when I say this one is tops.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> I love this retinol product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products over the years, and this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> I was scared to use it, but gave it a shot and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Having just begun a retinol regimen at age 33, I was hoping for greater results.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it could be more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I use it nightly and love it.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I love all of the peter Thomas products and had not tried this..</li>
            <li> I purchased it about a month ago and am in love..</li>
            <li> I have been using for all most 2 months</li>
            <li> I think with continued use I will see more of a difference</li>
            <li> I have tried many over the counter or department store brands of retinol products.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many products to help reduce their apperance...</li>
            <li> Actually, the product is excellent.</li>
            <li> The dropper takes some getting used to, would be much more helpful/easy to use if it wasn&#x27;t a dropper.</li>
            <li> The breakouts did not diminish or get better while using this.  </li>
            <li> Skin looks better.</li>
            <li> I would give it MORE than 5 stars if I could!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mostly, they like it, so I tried it.</li>
            <li> and I have now used this for more than 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wear sun screen throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I immediately use this after I&#x27;ve washed my face with the PTR Glycolic Acid Facial Wash and my skin feel so great!</li>
            <li> It feels like I am putting baby oil on my face and nothing more.</li>
            <li> The review also suggested this was the best overall product to buy.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product, the results, and definitely the price I paid at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this, it&#x27;s not drying so</li>
            <li> I have used Peter Thomas Roth products for a couple of years and find that using the serum nightly helps my aging skin look smoother and gives it more color and life.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY light weight formula that is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I am consistently getting compliments on how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> Amazon provides a great price, cheapest I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> When I took the plastic off, the dropper top was cracked and would not close securely.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how good my skin looks after using this whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!!!</li>
            <li> I liked it right away.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly into the skin and makes my skin feel like silk.</li>
            <li> but it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is very light, absorbs quickly and makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li> My fine wrinkles are already disappearing.</li>
            <li> I am using it together with my night treatment Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment with Kojic Acid, Arbutin &amp; Vitamin C, 2oz, which is a brightening treatment</li>
            <li> Worth the investment :)</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Was using a couple of Paula&#x27;s Choice retinol serums and found them just okay, pleasant to use but performance less than outstanding.</li>
            <li> This product also seems to slide and drip out of the dropper very easily so make sure to use it properly so not to waste any and keep it away from your eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now &amp; the results are amazing, honestly!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this product I love love love this product again thank you so much</li>
            <li> The first two bottles arrived with a sealed top.....</li>
            <li> I originally bought the cream and found this product.</li>
            <li> This serum goes on smoothly &amp; absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this except that it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause my skin to peel or be radiant as much as compared to the retinol from my skin doc.</li>
            <li> Is the retinol concentration true?</li>
            <li> I have noticed that after a couple of days, my top layer begins to gently flake, which I want it to do.  </li>
            <li> It works but is gentle, love the consistency and the dropper.</li>
            <li> Others have stated there would be a peeling reaction, which I have experienced before with other retinol products.</li>
            <li> P.T.R. is, in my book, one of the ultimate best facial products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> High price , find ferulic acid or hyaluric acid products with argan oil a much better product for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Will be back for more!</li>
            <li> The only retinol serum approved by Environmental Working Group for having safe ingredients, yay!</li>
            <li> Goes on like a real serum, non oily but super smooth.</li>
            <li> and this is the first retinol product with a high percentage that I have been able to use with all the benefits and none of the irritation or drying effect.</li>
            <li> I also will drop the product on my middle and pointing finger and then apply the product, which works just as effectively.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money and</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is retinol but not harsh.  </li>
            <li> Just because it has 1.5% retinol and they are not afraid to say it.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten comments from numerous people about how nice my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> I had been going to my doctors office and purchasing the Retinol and feel that the solution from Peter Thomas is far better..</li>
            <li> I have since started using more natural products that help with resurfacing...</li>
            <li> All P.T.R. products are a bit pricey but your face is worth the quality and results, right??</li>
            <li> Leaves your face nice and smooth but haven&#x27;t noticed any other differences to date.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel very clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought my skin looked a little bit better, and I kept waiting for more significant results to kick in.  </li>
            <li> I had heard good things about PTR&#x27;s other products on Dr. Oz&#x27;s program.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> NO REASON THAT IT WANT BE RIGHT FOR YOU.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but for the money,I much prefer the Roc Multi correxion.  </li>
            <li> I certainly would not be with out this product it a must have.!</li>
            <li> On my personal &amp;#34;spa facial nights&amp;#34;  I use the complete DDF system and follow it with this product and every time it leaves my face so very clean, soft and incredibly radiant.</li>
            <li> I have noticed the lines between my eyes and forehead becoming less prominent.</li>
            <li> , IT&#x27;S VERY GENTLE</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smooths out and wrinkles you might have and leaves your skin with soft, smooth matted look with out being greasy.</li>
            <li> of this type take some time to produce results, and you need to keep using the product consistently - just like brushing your teeth.-</li>
            <li> Give it a try, this price is phenomenal, I&#x27;ve seen this exact product for 20 bucks above what this seller asks!</li>
            <li> Thank you do much for getting it to my home!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have used different Retinol products and have found that this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> This is out second bottle and we love the way our skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> This product is my first line on aging.  </li>
            <li> Tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream Night and found it also pleasant but not impressive.</li>
            <li> The product may be fine but the way PTR packages it needs a major improvement.  </li>
            <li> However, if you are not using a high concentration retinol right now-you most likely will have issues.    </li>
            <li> I use the eyedropper to place the retinol liquid directly on my cheeks and neck and then rub in with clean fingers.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> My skin improved so much after the first bottle I had to keep going with this product.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t supposed to do this, but it also cleared up some large pores and blackheads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then, I use a gentle exfoliater and my skin looks radiantly fresh and new again.  </li>
            <li> How ever I do NOT get injections aroung my eyes and this product, used nightly has made a very big difference in those fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I feel it has helped with fine lines and the overall time of my skin.</li>
            <li> Reduces fine lines and makes pores smaller.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and in only 1 week I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks to PTR for making products we can believe in and work for all women.  </li>
            <li> This did absolutely NOTHING for me.</li>
            <li> I get Botox injections and this has really made a difference in the amount of time that I can go between injections.  </li>
            <li> My face is much smoother and has a radiant glow.</li>
            <li> It will last for months and make your face look fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle formulation, but seems to work well.  </li>
            <li> I really like how fast it seems to work.</li>
            <li> I used up the whole bottle without noticing a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I save so much money by buying it here than a brick and mortar store!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I THINK THAT IT COST TO MUCH.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very liquidly</li>
            <li> so it mixes readily.</li>
            <li> It was much softer and also the tone was lighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m alive and God is here in my heart!!!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, is scentless and does not dry my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Products</li>
            <li> As I said, it absorbs very quickly so you can use a decent night time moisturizer with it as long as it doesn&#x27;t have ingredients that will irritate your skin when used with retinol.     </li>
            <li> I know has mentioned they&#x27;re lighter, so not really sure how effective the product is.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> The product arrived fully sealed and looks new!</li>
            <li> Although it usually takes weeks or months to see a difference in your skin when using a new product-it really only took a few days for me to notice a more even skin tone, better texture and better smoothness when using Retinol Fusion PM.</li>
            <li> I believe expectations to look thirty when you are not are always going to be too high.  </li>
            <li> So I looked for a retinol product that has a fairly high concentration and doesn&#x27;t cost in the hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> Just as I was about giving up on the gold standard skin beneficial ingredient due to allergic to every one of them, (though many claimed they were very gentle on the skin,)</li>
            <li> I have used retinoids for a few years now, some with better results than others.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with so many products.</li>
            <li> This is not as strong percentage of retinol as other products, but I think going to high makes you too sensitive to sun and causes irritation.</li>
            <li> AND THIS TIME I DECIDED TO TRY SOMETHING NEW AND STRONGER,</li>
            <li> The feel of it very silky and a couple of drops is enough for the whole face.</li>
            <li> Still, it was a disappointing purchase from PTR because I am sure that the damage to the top did not come from shipping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard enough raves about Peter Thomas products and this is the first one I got in Sephora.</li>
            <li> My skin is baby soft &amp; glows!  </li>
            <li> Far exceeds Str-Vectin!</li>
            <li> Very effective...pricey, but effective and a small amount goes a long way..  </li>
            <li> not sure how safe it is to use products w/o a safety seal...</li>
            <li> this stuff has helped more than any other topical cream or treatment I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> But as far as effectiveness on wrinkles, this product ROCKS!</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it very liquid, almost like water and when I take a few drops on my fingers for an application, some of it ultimately go through my fingers which is kind of wasteful.</li>
            <li> It diminishes any uneven skin tones and fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It has had a clear effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin began to clear up.  </li>
            <li> I believe it clearly has made a difference in my aging skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This makes your face so soft.</li>
            <li> It is so silky and soft on the skin.  </li>
            <li> My face is so much clearer and younger looking.  </li>
            <li> and I do like it because it is not harsh at all for me</li>
            <li> Just a few drops at night makes your face feel smooth.</li>
            <li> product works really well and shows a difference the next day.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for nearly a year now, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> AS I ALWAYS NOTICE A REAL IMPROVEMENT ON MY PORES, HYPERPIGMENTATION, SKIN TEXTURE AND OVERALL TONE.</li>
            <li> I still have most of the bottle left, so it was a waste of $$ for me.</li>
            <li> I understand that you don&#x27;t want the concentration so high that you cause redness or itching or quick sloughing of the skin, but if I can&#x27;t tell a difference after using this morning and evening for 3 weeks, it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The product sinks right into the skin</li>
            <li> It sinks right in</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t strong enough to correct melasma alone, but other than that it does it all!</li>
            <li> but my small wrinkles started to disappear very quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the high concentration of retinol to mix with my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Lasts quite a long time and is a real bargain on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My deep wrinkles are softening and becoming much less deep.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get instant gratification, but after a few months you&#x27;ll see huge improvement.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this I was using Replenix 10X smoothing serum, so the step up to 1.5% concentration of retinol was natural and did not leave my skin red and flakey like it normally would.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant decrease in small lines.</li>
            <li> As weeks turned to months, I became less and less sure that my skin had in fact improved.  </li>
            <li> The point of retinol is to help increase cellular turnover; this feels like just putting a very high grade oil on your face--not displeasing, but certainly no change whatsover is noted</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin got red in the beginning.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the only Peter Thomas Roth product that I can recommend using.</li>
            <li> The fluid is not heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out which can happen with heavier oils.  </li>
            <li> secret many people still do not know about.</li>
            <li> Not a cheap pleasure, but you have to start somewhere, right.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle worker; it helps with scarring, small wrinkles, skin tone, mild acne.</li>
            <li> My article also has a link to other beauty products that really work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s &amp; have combo skin that has lost its luster &amp; some age spots, crows feet &amp; other assorted lovely lines that come with age.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the right way to spell it</li>
            <li> A few complaints on the dropper are justified, but I&#x27;ve found if I only fill the dropper with a small amount and tip it sideways up to my face, I don&#x27;t have problems with losing any.  </li>
            <li> The first lasted at least 8 months.</li>
            <li> Maybe not the next day but a day after I started noticing less lines and generally softer condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> This radiance lasts all week long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn, does not make my skin dry out and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li> I have discovered that a little goes a long way, so I have to be careful not to  waste it, by dispensing too much with the eye dropper into my palm.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want the bottle to tip over and spill, so I never set it down when it&#x27;s open.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin so the thin formulation of this PTR Retinol Fusion PM works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I wish it were less money only because I&#x27;m not working due to a brain bleed and lost my job and home for a year now</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a high concentration retinol treatment at a decent price-give it a try you won&#x27;t be sorry!    </li>
            <li> I put some in the palm of my hand, rub for a sec, then put on my face.</li>
            <li> If there is any retinol in this product, it is so minimal that it serves no purpose whatever.  </li>
            <li> It is watery, clear-a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, at night as directed with my other skin care products, and what a difference it has already made, my skin is softer to the touch and it heals faster to.  </li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount anyhow, as it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have bought from other retailers.</li>
            <li> I broke out by day two but continued to try and use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> Tons of little pimples everywhere which is not normal for me.  </li>
            <li> But despite it still having a slight drying effect, I&#x27;ve noticed minimal wrinkle improvement in three months.</li>
            <li> It was based on the success of the Retinol Fusion PM that I started using other PTR products, but all others have been disappointing.  </li>
            <li> My crows feet are less visible &amp; so are the lines around my lips.</li>
            <li> Both wrinkles and discoloration are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> and I am seeing a slight difference.</li>
            <li> I didnt have any issues with over drying like some of the reviews I have seen, but i typically have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed results in less than a week of use.</li>
            <li> My skin sucks, seriously, but this stuff made it look somewhat normal in very little time.</li>
            <li> I wish they would make it a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind that it&#x27;s a little oily</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care) and the little bottle they gave me lasted for 2 months</li>
            <li> just a few days after I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> acne prone, somewhat pigmented, oily, a few lines</li>
            <li> This product is a fake im sure especially with the very low price and terrible packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting a few weeks to take comparison pictures to check for progress.</li>
            <li> Remember to shake it, then put a few drops in the palm of the hand, and spread it over face avoiding eye area.</li>
            <li> waste of money.  </li>
            <li> and then I use PTR&#x27;s Firm X serum , then Clinique moisture suge - this is twice a day.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was less expensive but does seem to last since you use very little at a time.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to get the last drops out of the bottle with the dropper.</li>
            <li> Came slick with oil on bottle and no protected wrapping whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Some wrinkles on my upper cheek that were looking frighteningly leathery showed immediate improvement.</li>
            <li> She sorts out the frauds from the effectives and has saved me a fortune that I might otherwise have spent on useless products.</li>
            <li> Wishing I bought it from Sephora so at least I could send it back :(</li>
            <li> This just seems way too weak.</li>
            <li> However, I feel that when I don&#x27;t use it, my skin gets worse.  </li>
            <li> It was the wrong consistency.</li>
            <li> (sorry</li>
            <li> It is very thin (watery)</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> This product is terrible for my skin.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thank you so much for this product I love love love this product again thank you so much and you have a wonderful day !!!!.😊😊😊😊😊😊</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> My favorite night serum works miracle at night while sleeping goes on like water and immediately begins to work with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;It smooths out and wrinkles you might have and leaves your skin with soft, smooth matted look with out being greasy. I look forward each night using my nightly routine. I find it to be a joy instead of a hassle. I certainly would not be with out this product it a must have.! Thanks to PTR for making products we can believe in and work for all women.  Please keep the kits coming at affordable prices.</li>
            <li> I do not feel this product has done anything for my skin. I have used retinal products and I know how they should feel. This did absolutely NOTHING for me. I wish I could get my money back!!!!</li>
            <li> The service was wonderful.  I got my item just a few days after I ordered it.  And it&#x27;s a great product.  Will be back for more!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is the first retinol product with a high percentage that I have been able to use with all the benefits and none of the irritation or drying effect. Amazon&#x27;s price is the best also.</li>
            <li> I am getting to the age when I think I have to open my option to stronger products. I&#x27;ve heard enough raves about Peter Thomas products and this is the first one I got in Sephora. Not a cheap pleasure, but you have to start somewhere, right. I liked it right away. I apply it at night underneath of my regular moisturizer. The feel of it very silky and a couple of drops is enough for the whole face. Maybe not the next day but a day after I started noticing less lines and generally softer condition of my skin. It was kind of glowing. I am using it together with my night treatment Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment with Kojic Acid, Arbutin &amp; Vitamin C, 2oz, which is a brightening treatment so I guess they worked wonders in synergy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only critics I would insert is that it is very liquidy and during application some of it goes between fingers and gets wasted. I wish they would make it a little thicker. I am a life time customer even with this formula.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle. The first lasted at least 8 months. I use it at night 3 times a week. I place a drop or two in each location on my face and immediately spread it and massage it in wiith two fingers. It absorbs quickly, is scentless and does not dry my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Products of this type take some time to produce results, and you need to keep using the product consistently - just like brushing your teeth.- but my small wrinkles started to disappear very quickly. It isn&#x27;t supposed to do this, but it also cleared up some large pores and blackheads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product, which I can&#x27;t say about most cosmetics!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy anything without consulting Paula Begoun&#x27;s Beautipedia web site. She sorts out the frauds from the effectives and has saved me a fortune that I might otherwise have spent on useless products. Use Retinol Fusion PM each night after you wash off your makeup. You won&#x27;t get instant gratification, but after a few months you&#x27;ll see huge improvement. Check out how I found self-acceptance at a med spa and didn&#x27;t spend a dime - [...]. My article also has a link to other beauty products that really work - I use them all and Paula Begoun blesses them on her list too.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, at night as directed with my other skin care products, and what a difference it has already made, my skin is softer to the touch and it heals faster to.  I even use it on the back of my hands at night before I put on my hand lotion.  The skin on my hands looks so much better!  I&#x27;ve been using PTR Retinol Fusion Pm for about a month and you can&#x27;t beat Amazons price!</li>
            <li> Love, love this product.  Tried it from another source and liked it.  Found it to be cheaper on Amazon.  Will continue to use and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome blossom! I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s &amp; have combo skin that has lost its luster &amp; some age spots, crows feet &amp; other assorted lovely lines that come with age. This serum goes on smoothly &amp; absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now &amp; the results are amazing, honestly! I cleanse with PTR cleansing gel &amp; apply this before bed. My crows feet are less visible &amp; so are the lines around my lips. My skin is baby soft &amp; glows!  I&#x27;m sort of a skin care junkie, I have many products, believe me when I say this one is tops. Far exceeds Str-Vectin! Give it a try, this price is phenomenal, I&#x27;ve seen this exact product for 20 bucks above what this seller asks! Try it, it works!</li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth Retinol is great.  I get Botox injections and this has really made a difference in the amount of time that I can go between injections.  How ever I do NOT get injections aroung my eyes and this product, used nightly has made a very big difference in those fine lines.  I love this stuff and will continue to use it.  My face is much smoother and has a radiant glow. LOVE IT!!!  I wish I had known about this product prior to wrinkles. So start using it NOW.</li>
            <li> I love this retinol product.  I&#x27;ve used many products over the years, and this is one of my favorites.  It is very light, absorbs quickly and makes my skin glow.  I have oily/acne prone skin and this DOES NOT make me break out.  I was scared to use it, but gave it a shot and am so glad I did.  A few complaints on the dropper are justified, but I&#x27;ve found if I only fill the dropper with a small amount and tip it sideways up to my face, I don&#x27;t have problems with losing any.  I also will drop the product on my middle and pointing finger and then apply the product, which works just as effectively.  You only need a very small amount anyhow, as it goes a long way.  It will last for months and make your face look fabulous.  Worth the money and Amazon provides a great price, cheapest I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is retinol but not harsh.  Lasts quite a long time and is a real bargain on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The only retinol serum approved by Environmental Working Group for having safe ingredients, yay! Having just begun a retinol regimen at age 33, I was hoping for greater results. My sensitive skin got red in the beginning. I definitely needed to build up to using it every night. But despite it still having a slight drying effect, I&#x27;ve noticed minimal wrinkle improvement in three months.</li>
            <li> I had used this product before and I am very satisfied with the results .</li>
            <li> Very effective...pricey, but effective and a small amount goes a long way..  It is difficult to get the last drops out of the bottle with the dropper.</li>
            <li> Like the retinol, get it from a different seller. Mine came open from this seller. I have bought from other retailers. It comes shrink wrapped. I believe this was tampered with. It was the wrong consistency. I should have sent it back. But things got in the way.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Just because it has 1.5% retinol and they are not afraid to say it. The highest percentage I have yet encountered.</li>
            <li> This retinol treatment is awesome. My mom had tried it and liked it. So, I decided to try it. I&#x27;m very happy I did!! It absorbs very quickly into the skin and makes my skin feel like silk. I feel it has helped with fine lines and the overall time of my skin. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This makes your face so soft. This is my second bottle and I can&#x27;t see any difference in the texture of my skin but retinol&lt;br /&gt;takes time. It is very thin (watery) but I put it in my left palm and distribute from there.</li>
            <li> I have used retinoids for a few years now, some with better results than others. Although it usually takes weeks or months to see a difference in your skin when using a new product-it really only took a few days for me to notice a more even skin tone, better texture and better smoothness when using Retinol Fusion PM. Prior to using this I was using Replenix 10X smoothing serum, so the step up to 1.5% concentration of retinol was natural and did not leave my skin red and flakey like it normally would. However, if you are not using a high concentration retinol right now-you most likely will have issues.    The consistency of this product is very different from anything else I have used. It is watery, clear-a little goes a long way but it absorbs very quickly. This product also seems to slide and drip out of the dropper very easily so make sure to use it properly so not to waste any and keep it away from your eyes. As I said, it absorbs very quickly so you can use a decent night time moisturizer with it as long as it doesn&#x27;t have ingredients that will irritate your skin when used with retinol.     If you are looking for a high concentration retinol treatment at a decent price-give it a try you won&#x27;t be sorry!    Skin type: 20-something, acne prone, somewhat pigmented, oily, a few lines</li>
            <li> Not bad, but for the money,I much prefer the Roc Multi correxion.  Won&#x27;t be buying this one again.  Just didn&#x27;t see the results on the  Roth that I did on the Roc</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been only just over a week and I already see some improvements in my skin. It&#x27;s smoother and younger looking. I like this serum quite a bit. The only problem is that it very liquid, almost like water and when I take a few drops on my fingers for an application, some of it ultimately go through my fingers which is kind of wasteful. I wish it was a bit thicker. That&#x27;s the only reason I am taking off one star. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT . IF YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION YOUR SKIN WILL IMPROVE A LOT AND YOU AVOID TO GO TO THE ESTHETIC  OR  MEDICAL CABINET. I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> So far, this is the only Peter Thomas Roth product that I can recommend using. It was based on the success of the Retinol Fusion PM that I started using other PTR products, but all others have been disappointing.  This stuff really works. It has had a clear effect on my skin. Both wrinkles and discoloration are less noticeable. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it could be more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every cent.  It is so silky and soft on the skin.  I have been using it for about 6 months now and my skin is glowing.  I have gotten comments from numerous people about how nice my skin looks.  It doesn&#x27;t burn, does not make my skin dry out and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  I use it nightly and love it.</li>
            <li> Love this.  My fave product line.  My face is so much clearer and younger looking.  This is my must have product.</li>
            <li> I love this except that it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause my skin to peel or be radiant as much as compared to the retinol from my skin doc. Is the retinol concentration true?</li>
            <li> I love all of the peter Thomas products and had not tried this.. I purchased it about a month ago and am in love.. I had been going to my doctors office and purchasing the Retinol and feel that the solution from Peter Thomas is far better.. I have noticed the lines between my eyes and forehead becoming less prominent. once again his products work so well with my skin type..</li>
            <li> All retinol is not created with the same quality standards. This retinol manages to work without irritation. No redness peeling or breakouts.</li>
            <li> I only use PTR products and this is one of the three I use. It is a &amp;#34;have to have&amp;#34; for me. Can&#x27;t live without it! Miracle serum!</li>
            <li> I sent this as a gift but I use it with the Peter Thomas Roth u wrinkle cream at night. Remember motto go in sun the next day.</li>
            <li> When I took the plastic off, the dropper top was cracked and would not close securely.  The product may be fine but the way PTR packages it needs a major improvement.  Amazon was great to deal with and gave me a credit immediately. Still, it was a disappointing purchase from PTR because I am sure that the damage to the top did not come from shipping.  They make great products.  They need to fix this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using for all most 2 months and I do like it because it is not harsh at all for me and I am seeing a slight difference. I think with continued use I will see more of a difference</li>
            <li> It feels good on my clean skin..before bed.  The first two bottles arrived with a sealed top.....the third one was not sealed in any way.....  I checked about returning the product..........but just will not purchase it again.  In this day and age.........(sorry to say).....not sure how safe it is to use products w/o a safety seal...p</li>
            <li> Seems to be working.  I use  Botanical Buffing Beads by Peter Thomas Roth as well as a Vitamin C serum during the day.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend this; just didnt seem to work for me, but may for others. I still have most of the bottle left, so it was a waste of $$ for me.</li>
            <li> Reliable services from sender.  I find the product to be ahopeful solution for the diminishing of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have tried many over the counter or department store brands of retinol products. Some are more expensive and have lower concentration of retinol. Just as I was about giving up on the gold standard skin beneficial ingredient due to allergic to every one of them, (though many claimed they were very gentle on the skin,) I found this one. I think this is the biggest skin care secret many people still do not know about.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I use it every night and in only 1 week I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement!!!&lt;br /&gt;I had really deep acne scars and I have tried many products to help reduce their apperance... this stuff has helped more than any other topical cream or treatment I&#x27;ve used. My skin looks vibrant and the marks seem to be much less noticable. Buy it on Amazon, at Sephora it sells for double!</li>
            <li> This is a gentle formulation, but seems to work well.  Now I still haven&#x27;t been carded for a drink, but people do take me for younger than I am.  The fluid is not heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out which can happen with heavier oils.  Smells good too.  Will re-order.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the cream and found this product. I really like how fast it seems to work. I wish it was less expensive but does seem to last since you use very little at a time.</li>
            <li> My third time buying this.  Best price, authentic product, and I can feel the burn after multiple uses.  Doesn&#x27;t take away my brown spots, and while I think it lightens them, no one I know has mentioned they&#x27;re lighter, so not really sure how effective the product is.  However, I feel that when I don&#x27;t use it, my skin gets worse.  Goes on like a real serum, non oily but super smooth.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product !!! Worth the investment :)</li>
            <li> High price , find ferulic acid or hyaluric acid products with argan oil a much better product for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Came slick with oil on bottle and no protected wrapping whatsoever. This product is a fake im sure especially with the very low price and terrible packaging. Stay away.</li>
            <li> P.T.R. is, in my book, one of the ultimate best facial products I have ever used. On my personal &amp;#34;spa facial nights&amp;#34;  I use the complete DDF system and follow it with this product and every time it leaves my face so very clean, soft and incredibly radiant. This radiance lasts all week long. All P.T.R. products are a bit pricey but your face is worth the quality and results, right??</li>
            <li> I used this product diligently for about 8 months.  At first I thought my skin looked a little bit better, and I kept waiting for more significant results to kick in.  As weeks turned to months, I became less and less sure that my skin had in fact improved.  Eventually, I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant decrease in small lines. My skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!!! I wish it were less money only because I&#x27;m not working due to a brain bleed and lost my job and home for a year now but I&#x27;m alive and God is here in my heart!!! I love the oil!! Thank you do much for getting it to my home! God bless, ,, Caroline himes</li>
            <li> Have switched to one with a lighter dose of retinol. Does feel good going on though, smooth feeling and did not sting. Nice product. Deduct a star because it is pricey.</li>
            <li> Actually, the product is excellent. I believe expectations to look thirty when you are not are always going to be too high.  I would continue to buy this product. Thank you,jj</li>
            <li> After using every night for about a month, I could not tell any difference in my skin tone.  And the wrinkles appear about the same as before using this product.  So, I can&#x27;t say that it has helped me.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops at night makes your face feel smooth. Reduces fine lines and makes pores smaller. Great price for a great product and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I used up the whole bottle without noticing a difference in my skin. I have since started using more natural products that help with resurfacing...like aha&#x27;s from fruit and such</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;m waiting a few weeks to take comparison pictures to check for progress. The dropper takes some getting used to, would be much more helpful/easy to use if it wasn&#x27;t a dropper. I put some in the palm of my hand, rub for a sec, then put on my face.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible for my skin.  I broke out by day two but continued to try and use it every other day.  Tons of little pimples everywhere which is not normal for me.  Stopped using it and my skin began to clear up.  Tried adding the product back into my routine for a couple weeks and broke out again.  The breakouts did not diminish or get better while using this.  After discontinuing use once again my skin has cleared up.  Wishing I bought it from Sephora so at least I could send it back :(</li>
            <li> Using it about a month and I am seeing results. Skin looks better. Also I rated the ingredients on the EWG (Environmental Working Group) and the ingredients and this product gets a great rating for non-toxic ingredients. This is not as strong percentage of retinol as other products, but I think going to high makes you too sensitive to sun and causes irritation.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Item just as described!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It goes on very smoothly. Remember to shake it, then put a few drops in the palm of the hand, and spread it over face avoiding eye area. For me, it faded brown spots almost immediately. I heard Peter Thomas Roth say on TV that if you see a big difference in someone&#x27;s skin, you can bet retinol is involved. He&#x27;s right. After using this, I add my serum and moisturizer. Great results!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: After only 2 1/2 weeks of use, I can see the improvements this PTR Retinol Fusion PM is making to my face. My deep wrinkles are softening and becoming much less deep. My fine wrinkles are already disappearing. I have not yet seen any change in a 1/3\\&quot; age spot on my temple. But as far as effectiveness on wrinkles, this product ROCKS! I would give it MORE than 5 stars if I could!&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have been using retinol products for years. Used Retin-A and tretinoin, both prescription products and was very satisfied with them. Ran out of those and decided to try over-the-counter retinols. Was using a couple of Paula&#x27;s Choice retinol serums and found them just okay, pleasant to use but performance less than outstanding. Tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream Night and found it also pleasant but not impressive. So I looked for a retinol product that has a fairly high concentration and doesn&#x27;t cost in the hundreds of dollars. I had heard good things about PTR&#x27;s other products on Dr. Oz&#x27;s program. The women at makeupalley often give great advice so I checked to see what they thought of this PTR. Mostly, they like it, so I tried it. And from the first use, incredible as that sounds, I have noticed a difference in my skin. Some wrinkles on my upper cheek that were looking frighteningly leathery showed immediate improvement. I have incredibly dry skin so the thin formulation of this PTR Retinol Fusion PM works very well for me. I don&#x27;t want the bottle to tip over and spill, so I never set it down when it&#x27;s open. I use the eyedropper to place the retinol liquid directly on my cheeks and neck and then rub in with clean fingers. So far, so good. I am 5-star-satisfied at this point.</li>
            <li> The point of retinol is to help increase cellular turnover; this feels like just putting a very high grade oil on your face--not displeasing, but certainly no change whatsover is noted and I have now used this for more than 3 weeks.  If there is any retinol in this product, it is so minimal that it serves no purpose whatever.  I understand that you don&#x27;t want the concentration so high that you cause redness or itching or quick sloughing of the skin, but if I can&#x27;t tell a difference after using this morning and evening for 3 weeks, it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The product arrived fully sealed and looks new! I save so much money by buying it here than a brick and mortar store!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works really well and shows a difference the next day.  I love this stuff. Works well with benzoyl peroxide acne medication topicals. Just make sure you wear sun screen throughout the day.</li>
            <li> MOST AMAZING stuff!  This is a VERY light weight formula that is easy to apply.  I have discovered that a little goes a long way, so I have to be careful not to  waste it, by dispensing too much with the eye dropper into my palm.  It works like Retin A, but with zero irritation.  I have experienced no burning or redness.  I have noticed that after a couple of days, my top layer begins to gently flake, which I want it to do.  Then, I use a gentle exfoliater and my skin looks radiantly fresh and new again.  I have used this for nearly a year now, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I believe it clearly has made a difference in my aging skin.  It diminishes any uneven skin tones and fine wrinkles.  This is an awesome alternative for those seeking a Retinol product from a physician.  I will continue to use this product, until I discover it no longer produces results for me.  So far....so good!</li>
            <li> I have used different Retinol products and have found that this one is my favorite.  It works but is gentle, love the consistency and the dropper.</li>
            <li> I immediately use this after I&#x27;ve washed my face with the PTR Glycolic Acid Facial Wash and my skin feel so great!</li>
            <li> This is out second bottle and we love the way our skin feels and looks. We use this every day.</li>
            <li> The product sinks right into the skin and I notice my skin looks smoother and tighter after using it. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I GAVE THIS A STAR THREE BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT FOR ME. IT DIDN;T DO ANY THING FOR MY FACE. AT ALL. BUT JUST BECAUSE I DIDN;T LIKE IT.THERE NO REASON THAT IT WANT BE RIGHT FOR YOU. I THINK THAT IT COST TO MUCH.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD AND EFFECTIVE...</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel very clean and soft.  Best to use at night.  I didnt have any issues with over drying like some of the reviews I have seen, but i typically have oily skin.  Definitely want to use this product at night.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the positive reviews. I don&#x27;t mind that it&#x27;s a little oily but I don&#x27;t think that it actually does anything. I feel nothing when I apply and have been using it nightly. Others have stated there would be a peeling reaction, which I have experienced before with other retinol products. This just seems way too weak.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face nice and smooth but haven&#x27;t noticed any other differences to date.</li>
            <li> I regularly use retinol products to keep the wrinkles away. I bought this for the high concentration of retinol to mix with my regular moisturizer. Because retinol is a part if my regular routine, I can&#x27;t say if this has immediate effects. It&#x27;s very liquidly so it mixes readily.</li>
            <li> Gotta rave about this retinol fusion pm liquid for my décolleté.  My wrinkling upper chest had not been receiving the TLC that my face had, but I chalked it up to aging only.  Wrong!  After about a month of retinol, my décolleté is noticeably smoother.  What a pleasant surprise!  Now, I am waiting for the miracle neck firmer!</li>
            <li> I have trouble with so many products. This is a miracle worker; it helps with scarring, small wrinkles, skin tone, mild acne. I can&#x27;t imagine my skin without it. Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my skin has done a total 180. People have no idea that I have problem skin. It isn&#x27;t strong enough to correct melasma alone, but other than that it does it all! It is even moisturizing with the retinol.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  I will check around to see if I could get the same product with a lower price in future.</li>
            <li> Have used a milder cream with retinol and loved how my skin looked. Decided to try a stronger dose with PTR. Perhaps my bottle has expired or the retinol deactivated by exposure to sun at some point. It feels like I am putting baby oil on my face and nothing more. May consider buying from Sephora and giving it another try.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Peter Thomas Roth Retinol Fusion PM.  My skin improved so much after the first bottle I had to keep going with this product.  I am consistently getting compliments on how good my skin looks.  An online comparison review read that this product with the ingredients and its price was an excellent buy for skin care.  The review also suggested this was the best overall product to buy.  It is.  I am very happy with the product, the results, and definitely the price I paid at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li> waste of money.  too oily.  does not absorb in the skin.  did not see any change in my skin&#x27;s appearance</li>
            <li> Love this, it&#x27;s not drying so I can use it every night.</li>
            <li> I have used Peter Thomas Roth products for a couple of years and find that using the serum nightly helps my aging skin look smoother and gives it more color and life. A very good price, too!</li>
            <li> I tried to use it couple of times at night. I was quite impressed by the feel of my skin in the morning. It was much softer and also the tone was lighter and smoother. I will deffinately buy another one when I am finished with this one. Good product that does what it promises to do.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this stuff from Sephora (I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the right way to spell it but I don&#x27;t care) and the little bottle they gave me lasted for 2 months and I noticed results in less than a week of use. My skin sucks, seriously, but this stuff made it look somewhat normal in very little time. I had no irritation at all and it feels like silk going on.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how good my skin looks after using this whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS BUY THE RETINOL 1.0 FROM SKINCEUTICAL AND THIS TIME I DECIDED TO TRY SOMETHING NEW AND STRONGER, WELL THIS PETER THOMAS ROTH RETINOL SUPPOSE TO BE STRONGER 1.5, IT&#x27;S LIQUID  NOT A CREAM LIKE SKINCEUTICALS RETINOL, I&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT FOR THE LAST 4 MONTHS AND I HAVEN&#x27;T NOTICED ANY IMPROVEMENT ON MY SKIN TEXTURE, NO PEELING, NO NOTHING, IT&#x27;S VERY GENTLE ON MY SKIN, I ALSO I APPLY IT ON MY NECK AND DECOLLETE AREA. I THINK I&#x27;M GONNA GO BACK TO MY SKINCEUTICAL 1.0 AS I ALWAYS NOTICE A REAL IMPROVEMENT ON MY PORES, HYPERPIGMENTATION, SKIN TEXTURE AND OVERALL TONE. ALSO IT&#x27;S CHEAPER THAN PRTHOMAS.</li>
            <li> This product is my first line on aging.  It sinks right in and then I use PTR&#x27;s Firm X serum , then Clinique moisture suge - this is twice a day.  My skin looks really good.  I&#x27;m convinced it works or helps</li>
