            <li>I received my package in good order.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>Must be good! :-)</li>
            <li>best results I&#x27;d recommend use generous amount once\twice a day, although it absorbs quickly its best to rub it until it gets absorbed</li>
            <li>WAS VERY PLEASED.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i am so hooked that i placed an order for two more!</li>
            <li>I am an avid user and this is the best deal I have found</li>
            <li>and I will always love Bio oil!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It is really amazing that I can put it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts (even though it is an oil).</li>
            <li>its amazing......</li>
            <li>Works great on keeping my skin ash free.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve bought this oil many times and I have nothing but good to say.</li>
            <li>and I really went all out to get the best deal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it as needed, but it also smell really nice.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is wonderful and very soothing.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>It was perfect thank you so much....  </li>
            <li>I am not quite sure if I would ever buy it again to be honest.</li>
            <li>The product got here very quickly!</li>
            <li>However, I do know that my skin feels much softer and looks bright and healthy with no makeup on!</li>
            <li>Many of these should NOT be used during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I was searching for something more affordable than the stretch mark creams sold at Ulta.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I use this all the time I love this product</li>
            <li>about to order 2 more bottles</li>
            <li>Olive oil better than this!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure yet</li>
            <li>and I love how it makes your skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I love it on my face.  </li>
            <li>and I am extremely satisfied</li>
            <li>However I defiantly plan to use it premantly as my skin is in such awesome shape.</li>
            <li>( I&#x27;m sure if i used it as directed results would have been noticed soner)</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>My daughter was extremely pleased to receive two bottles instead of one at the offered price.</li>
            <li>The Bio Oil I received from Pacifica World Corporation was authentic and well packaged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Facial moisturizer: My face has never looked better, even with the fluctuating hormones of pregnancy and post partum.</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff for about a year now and continue to use it not only for stretch marks, but because it is an excellent conditioner for your skin.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>However the pigmentation marks of my face seem to be a rigid , probably they would need more time to go away.</li>
            <li>more time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a nice smooth feel without being oily.</li>
            <li>but i love the smoothness and the smell.</li>
            <li>She love it..</li>
            <li>its not greasy it give&#x27;s you an adorable look.</li>
            <li>I love this oil and have rated it before.  </li>
            <li>Also, love the color (not that it matters).</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but I still use a drop now and then just to play it safe.</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I discovered that I could order this and have it delivered directly to me and not have to rely on my sister to send me more of this product.</li>
            <li>That is cool!</li>
            <li>it dries very quickly you don&#x27;t need a lot</li>
            <li>Everybody we have talked to have high reviews of the oil, so far my wife is impressed with it during the pregnancy.</li>
            <li>My face is not dry or irratated the tone is great.</li>
            <li>My daughter used it when she was pregnant five years ago and despite gaining 70 pounds, she doesn&#x27;t have one stretch mark!</li>
            <li>I noticed a HUGE difference in the appearance in the color of the stretch marks...........</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made a huge impact on me and my friend as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did not notice any huge difference on my skin...</li>
            <li>I always put a squirt in my bath water, as well as lightly cover my aging face and neck as soon as getting out of the bath or shower.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly on free shipping.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say that it has done anything for crows feet or wrinkles, but it just makes your skin feel so soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure it will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great on dry, peeling skin.  </li>
            <li>I do not know how much credit I can give to this product and how much to genetics and good living.</li>
            <li>The smell of the oil is really mild and pleasant, and it really soaks in fast.</li>
            <li>My wife purchased this oil and made me buy a second bottle because she loved it.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference on the lighter marks but not too much of a change in the somewhat deeper more persistence marks.</li>
            <li>I loved it then and now that I am pregnant again I will only use this!</li>
            <li>it works great with my other lotions and oil.</li>
            <li>i was pregnant (3 weeks)</li>
            <li>I wish I would&#x27;ve used it as soon as I got pregnant to avoid or even lessen these stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I started using this at 3 months pregnant.</li>
            <li>It has helped my surgery scar tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>burn scars the very first week.</li>
            <li>I used this product with my first pregnancy!</li>
            <li>I had no stretch marks from my first pregnancy because I used this on my belly once a day every day!</li>
            <li>It is especially good during the winter months for the entire body to alleviate problems with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I know a huge part of getting stretch-marks is hereditary and can depend on how quickly and responsibly you gain weight</li>
            <li>But the bottle does last a fairly good amount of time (about three months for me, just using it on certain areas after showering).</li>
            <li>that was worth it.</li>
            <li>ARRIVED MANY MORE DAYS AHEAD OF EXPECTED DELIVERY.  </li>
            <li>Too early to tell if it will soften and fade scars but love how my skin feels</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this for deep or very large scars, you wont see these kind of results.</li>
            <li>My wife started using this right when we found out she was preganant and still uses it after birth.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>Now that im expecting i started using right away to avoid those itching and unwanted scars.</li>
            <li>I am at 28th week right now and would probably need to buy another 3 or 4 bottles.</li>
            <li>Its is very soothing and smells so clean</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel after using it so soft and smooth and so far no stretch marks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to tell you they disappeared because that just won&#x27;t ever happen, but they certainly diminished in color!  </li>
            <li>This was by far the most reasonable price I saw online.  </li>
            <li>It does make your skin feel very soft and smooth though, and thats always a plus.</li>
            <li>AND LIKE IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li>This bio-oil was a great deal and hard to beat anywhere.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I would most definitely would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Better than applying lotion constantly.</li>
            <li>but I was hooked when I bought my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this definitely works for blemishes on the top of your skin and every woman&#x27;s nightmare-stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first order</li>
            <li>love this stuff, can&#x27;t get enough it</li>
            <li>I started using Bio Oil around 20 weeks, when my belly was starting to show more.</li>
            <li>I am now 32 weeks and have been using this product consistently.</li>
            <li>Now that baby is here and wifey is a few weeks into recovery we are pleased to say that wifey is stretch mark free.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s genetic, so you can&#x27;t really control getting them in the first</li>
            <li>Contains BHT and many other worrisome ingredients especially since so many people seem to use this obsessively during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Plus, her skin is super soft and primed for baby cuddles.</li>
            <li>I never believe that these types of products have the ability to change your skin and certainly would never used anything that is toxic on my skin.</li>
            <li>is of very high quality&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I only have a few very light, faded lines on my belly where it has expanded the most.</li>
            <li>It has been very helpful with the treatment and prevention of stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I can really know if it broke out from this stuff or not.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t grown all that much</li>
            <li>It really clears up scars and stretch-marks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a couple weeks/months in to using this product, I haven&#x27;t really noticed a change in my stretch marks</li>
            <li>I really like the smell and</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>Than you so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I am a week away from having my first child and although I did get some stretch marks this oil has definitely helped reduce how many and how red they are.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who claims that they didn&#x27;t develop any stretch marks from topical creams/oils during pregnancy most likely just have very elastic skin and is not prone to stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant and I started using this product on my second trimester</li>
            <li>Unless you have red scars or red stretch marks, you&#x27;re better off using your money on buying gym clothes and a membership.</li>
            <li>Her birthmarks are bit older but the oil seems to be helping.</li>
            <li>and I would have to say that I strongly believe that Bio Oil has helped with the minimal stretch marks I have.</li>
            <li>Although my tummy is huge because I am having twins, I haven&#x27;t got any single line of stretch mark yet.</li>
            <li>Only real way to prevent stretch marks is to excercise to eat right</li>
            <li>Going to stick with a high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>I was even more surprised to see that I received two large bottles of Bio oil instead of one large and one small</li>
            <li>I love how it smells , but I think I&#x27;m allergic as I broke out with an itchy rash a few days after using.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without biooil</li>
            <li>At age 62, I have minimal wrinkles and most people think I am much younger.</li>
            <li>My wife rubbed this on her pregnant belly every single night for 9 months.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, I do forget every once in a while to put it on, but I am definitely seeing results none the less!</li>
            <li>I was very surprised that my order was shipped as soon as it was.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed through the skin which moisturizes and for a long time.</li>
            <li>Parts of my skin where there were dark splotches became significantly lighter some even went a way.</li>
            <li>Maybe at a time when my face is completely clear that way</li>
            <li>the stretch marks on my knees and legs have nearly disappeared.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review again if they disappear completely.</li>
            <li>Soft skin hasn&#x27;t faded stretch marks tho</li>
            <li>it does make your skin feel really soft and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and it makes skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>AND OF COURSE LASTING MUCH LONGER</li>
            <li>But BIO Oil makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Makes the skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>I also think it helps fade scars and sunspots, but I don&#x27;t think it will remove them completely.</li>
            <li>smell is wonderful (reminds me of 90s women make up scents from my childhood, very nostalgic!), is not too oily and has changed the texture on my face.</li>
            <li>The consistency was not heavy like other oils and the smell was very light and didn&#x27;t make me nauseas like other creams and oils (cocoa butter).</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate rosecha and when my allergies act up my face gets dry and sensitive</li>
            <li>I had cherry red stretch marks along my abdomen due to my pregnancy...and now my stretch marks are a light peach color.</li>
            <li>This is my second order of this product and it certainly will not be the last.</li>
            <li>The smaller scars have basically disappeared, and the bigger ones, including the large one across my abdomen, are flat and the color seems to be fading quicker than normal.  </li>
            <li>Bio Oil makes my skin look young again and not dry as before Bio Oil.</li>
            <li>I discovered Bio Oil when I was a few months pregnant.</li>
            <li>Leaves a no- greasy or oily skin, yet is thick and absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li>After 2 weeks I started to see major improvements</li>
            <li>I had resorted to the fact that I have to live with stretch marks all my life , I have pretty bad ones on my hips, thighs and knees more than 5-6 years old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the oil on cuts and for general moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend Bio-oil for general skin care, for pregnancy, and for scar-reduction after injury or surgery.  </li>
            <li>It has a scent though , it smells like  faint rose &amp; sandalwood, but I like it and find it realaxing.</li>
            <li>I am currently dieting (heavily) and when I lose a lot of weight too quickly I notice stretch marks on my stomach</li>
            <li>I have  very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I started it when I first noticed the little stretch marks</li>
            <li>exact same as the one bought in store for half price</li>
            <li>This product reduced my red scar to where you can barely see it.</li>
            <li>My always dry elbows are soft.</li>
            <li>A little also goes a long way -- I&#x27;m still on the first bottle with 2x daily applications.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> This product came in a pack of two for a good price.</li>
            <li> I received my package in good order.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> Must be good! :-)</li>
            <li> best results I&#x27;d recommend use generous amount once\twice a day, although it absorbs quickly its best to rub it until it gets absorbed</li>
            <li> WAS VERY PLEASED.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i am so hooked that i placed an order for two more!</li>
            <li> I am an avid user and this is the best deal I have found</li>
            <li> and I will always love Bio oil!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It is really amazing that I can put it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts (even though it is an oil).</li>
            <li> its amazing......</li>
            <li> Works great on keeping my skin ash free.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought this oil many times and I have nothing but good to say.</li>
            <li> and I really went all out to get the best deal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it as needed, but it also smell really nice.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is wonderful and very soothing.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> It was perfect thank you so much....  </li>
            <li> I am not quite sure if I would ever buy it again to be honest.</li>
            <li> The product got here very quickly!</li>
            <li> However, I do know that my skin feels much softer and looks bright and healthy with no makeup on!</li>
            <li> Many of these should NOT be used during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I was searching for something more affordable than the stretch mark creams sold at Ulta.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time I love this product</li>
            <li> about to order 2 more bottles</li>
            <li> Olive oil better than this!&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say for sure yet</li>
            <li> and I love how it makes your skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I love it on my face.  </li>
            <li> and I am extremely satisfied</li>
            <li> However I defiantly plan to use it premantly as my skin is in such awesome shape.</li>
            <li> ( I&#x27;m sure if i used it as directed results would have been noticed soner)</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter was extremely pleased to receive two bottles instead of one at the offered price.</li>
            <li> The Bio Oil I received from Pacifica World Corporation was authentic and well packaged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Facial moisturizer: My face has never looked better, even with the fluctuating hormones of pregnancy and post partum.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for about a year now and continue to use it not only for stretch marks, but because it is an excellent conditioner for your skin.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> However the pigmentation marks of my face seem to be a rigid , probably they would need more time to go away.</li>
            <li> more time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a nice smooth feel without being oily.</li>
            <li> but i love the smoothness and the smell.</li>
            <li> She love it..</li>
            <li> its not greasy it give&#x27;s you an adorable look.</li>
            <li> I love this oil and have rated it before.  </li>
            <li> Also, love the color (not that it matters).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but I still use a drop now and then just to play it safe.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I discovered that I could order this and have it delivered directly to me and not have to rely on my sister to send me more of this product.</li>
            <li> That is cool!</li>
            <li> it dries very quickly you don&#x27;t need a lot</li>
            <li> Everybody we have talked to have high reviews of the oil, so far my wife is impressed with it during the pregnancy.</li>
            <li> My face is not dry or irratated the tone is great.</li>
            <li> My daughter used it when she was pregnant five years ago and despite gaining 70 pounds, she doesn&#x27;t have one stretch mark!</li>
            <li> I noticed a HUGE difference in the appearance in the color of the stretch marks...........</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made a huge impact on me and my friend as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did not notice any huge difference on my skin...</li>
            <li> I always put a squirt in my bath water, as well as lightly cover my aging face and neck as soon as getting out of the bath or shower.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly on free shipping.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly say that it has done anything for crows feet or wrinkles, but it just makes your skin feel so soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure it will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great on dry, peeling skin.  </li>
            <li> I do not know how much credit I can give to this product and how much to genetics and good living.</li>
            <li> The smell of the oil is really mild and pleasant, and it really soaks in fast.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this oil and made me buy a second bottle because she loved it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference on the lighter marks but not too much of a change in the somewhat deeper more persistence marks.</li>
            <li> I loved it then and now that I am pregnant again I will only use this!</li>
            <li> it works great with my other lotions and oil.</li>
            <li> i was pregnant (3 weeks)</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve used it as soon as I got pregnant to avoid or even lessen these stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I started using this at 3 months pregnant.</li>
            <li> It has helped my surgery scar tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> burn scars the very first week.</li>
            <li> I used this product with my first pregnancy!</li>
            <li> I had no stretch marks from my first pregnancy because I used this on my belly once a day every day!</li>
            <li> It is especially good during the winter months for the entire body to alleviate problems with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I know a huge part of getting stretch-marks is hereditary and can depend on how quickly and responsibly you gain weight</li>
            <li> But the bottle does last a fairly good amount of time (about three months for me, just using it on certain areas after showering).</li>
            <li> that was worth it.</li>
            <li> ARRIVED MANY MORE DAYS AHEAD OF EXPECTED DELIVERY.  </li>
            <li> Too early to tell if it will soften and fade scars but love how my skin feels</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this for deep or very large scars, you wont see these kind of results.</li>
            <li> My wife started using this right when we found out she was preganant and still uses it after birth.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> Now that im expecting i started using right away to avoid those itching and unwanted scars.</li>
            <li> I am at 28th week right now and would probably need to buy another 3 or 4 bottles.</li>
            <li> Its is very soothing and smells so clean</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel after using it so soft and smooth and so far no stretch marks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to tell you they disappeared because that just won&#x27;t ever happen, but they certainly diminished in color!  </li>
            <li> This was by far the most reasonable price I saw online.  </li>
            <li> It does make your skin feel very soft and smooth though, and thats always a plus.</li>
            <li> AND LIKE IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> This bio-oil was a great deal and hard to beat anywhere.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I would most definitely would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Better than applying lotion constantly.</li>
            <li> but I was hooked when I bought my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this definitely works for blemishes on the top of your skin and every woman&#x27;s nightmare-stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first order</li>
            <li> love this stuff, can&#x27;t get enough it</li>
            <li> I started using Bio Oil around 20 weeks, when my belly was starting to show more.</li>
            <li> I am now 32 weeks and have been using this product consistently.</li>
            <li> Now that baby is here and wifey is a few weeks into recovery we are pleased to say that wifey is stretch mark free.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s genetic, so you can&#x27;t really control getting them in the first</li>
            <li> Contains BHT and many other worrisome ingredients especially since so many people seem to use this obsessively during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Plus, her skin is super soft and primed for baby cuddles.</li>
            <li> I never believe that these types of products have the ability to change your skin and certainly would never used anything that is toxic on my skin.</li>
            <li> is of very high quality&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I only have a few very light, faded lines on my belly where it has expanded the most.</li>
            <li> It has been very helpful with the treatment and prevention of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I can really know if it broke out from this stuff or not.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t grown all that much</li>
            <li> It really clears up scars and stretch-marks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a couple weeks/months in to using this product, I haven&#x27;t really noticed a change in my stretch marks</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> Than you so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I am a week away from having my first child and although I did get some stretch marks this oil has definitely helped reduce how many and how red they are.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who claims that they didn&#x27;t develop any stretch marks from topical creams/oils during pregnancy most likely just have very elastic skin and is not prone to stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and I started using this product on my second trimester</li>
            <li> Unless you have red scars or red stretch marks, you&#x27;re better off using your money on buying gym clothes and a membership.</li>
            <li> Her birthmarks are bit older but the oil seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> and I would have to say that I strongly believe that Bio Oil has helped with the minimal stretch marks I have.</li>
            <li> Although my tummy is huge because I am having twins, I haven&#x27;t got any single line of stretch mark yet.</li>
            <li> Only real way to prevent stretch marks is to excercise to eat right</li>
            <li> Going to stick with a high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I was even more surprised to see that I received two large bottles of Bio oil instead of one large and one small</li>
            <li> I love how it smells , but I think I&#x27;m allergic as I broke out with an itchy rash a few days after using.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without biooil</li>
            <li> At age 62, I have minimal wrinkles and most people think I am much younger.</li>
            <li> My wife rubbed this on her pregnant belly every single night for 9 months.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, I do forget every once in a while to put it on, but I am definitely seeing results none the less!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that my order was shipped as soon as it was.</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed through the skin which moisturizes and for a long time.</li>
            <li> Parts of my skin where there were dark splotches became significantly lighter some even went a way.</li>
            <li> Maybe at a time when my face is completely clear that way</li>
            <li> the stretch marks on my knees and legs have nearly disappeared.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review again if they disappear completely.</li>
            <li> Soft skin hasn&#x27;t faded stretch marks tho</li>
            <li> it does make your skin feel really soft and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and it makes skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> AND OF COURSE LASTING MUCH LONGER</li>
            <li> But BIO Oil makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Makes the skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> I also think it helps fade scars and sunspots, but I don&#x27;t think it will remove them completely.</li>
            <li> smell is wonderful (reminds me of 90s women make up scents from my childhood, very nostalgic!), is not too oily and has changed the texture on my face.</li>
            <li> The consistency was not heavy like other oils and the smell was very light and didn&#x27;t make me nauseas like other creams and oils (cocoa butter).</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate rosecha and when my allergies act up my face gets dry and sensitive</li>
            <li> I had cherry red stretch marks along my abdomen due to my pregnancy...and now my stretch marks are a light peach color.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this product and it certainly will not be the last.</li>
            <li> The smaller scars have basically disappeared, and the bigger ones, including the large one across my abdomen, are flat and the color seems to be fading quicker than normal.  </li>
            <li> Bio Oil makes my skin look young again and not dry as before Bio Oil.</li>
            <li> I discovered Bio Oil when I was a few months pregnant.</li>
            <li> Leaves a no- greasy or oily skin, yet is thick and absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks I started to see major improvements</li>
            <li> I had resorted to the fact that I have to live with stretch marks all my life , I have pretty bad ones on my hips, thighs and knees more than 5-6 years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the oil on cuts and for general moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend Bio-oil for general skin care, for pregnancy, and for scar-reduction after injury or surgery.  </li>
            <li> It has a scent though , it smells like  faint rose &amp; sandalwood, but I like it and find it realaxing.</li>
            <li> I am currently dieting (heavily) and when I lose a lot of weight too quickly I notice stretch marks on my stomach</li>
            <li> I have  very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I started it when I first noticed the little stretch marks</li>
            <li> exact same as the one bought in store for half price</li>
            <li> This product reduced my red scar to where you can barely see it.</li>
            <li> My always dry elbows are soft.</li>
            <li> A little also goes a long way -- I&#x27;m still on the first bottle with 2x daily applications.</li>
            <li> I rubbed it on my belly at least once a day, usually right after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> really helped cut down the dry itchiness you get when your skin starts stretching.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers said that this doesn&#x27;t work on the old marks</li>
            <li> my skin looks young compare to other skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My dry skin parts where soft and stayed soft as if i was using lotion all day everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bio for several years now, prior nothing would repair several dry area&#x27;s on my face (and I tried everything) for years, BUT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used bio-oil religiously twice a day since my 2nd trimester began and have yet to get a single stretch mark.  </li>
            <li> With my first I used cocoa butter and it was not effective at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the Bio Oil on both and the scars became flat and did not produce a keloid.  </li>
            <li> I initially bought it for me, but I guess my skin is a little sensitive</li>
            <li> I use it religiously when the weather is dry to keep my body hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I heard of this product on a TV program and unfortunately found this product after I had used every stretch mark product on the market while pregnant and STILL got stretch marks!  </li>
            <li> Received package earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks have completely lightened up and are not as harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> long time on the body</li>
            <li> My surgery scar and also a scar I had on my heel where my storm door closed on the back of my foot was puffing up.  </li>
            <li> I defintely plan to continue using Bio Oil for the long run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year to try to get rid of some minor stretch marks from weight gain\loss.</li>
            <li> A&lt;br /&gt;good deal It took to long to arrive.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I grew a few stretch marks on my back side and those are much darker because I dont usually apply the oil on that area.</li>
            <li> Would recommend product to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> do you have dry skin?</li>
            <li> I touch a drop on my finger and place it on the spots and that&#x27;s it for the day, after two years the dry spots are not to be found</li>
            <li> Good deal for hard to find and expensive product I use every day!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and even though I put spf 50 sunscreen on when I am exposed to the sun - my skin still gets very dry.  </li>
            <li> already the stretch marks that I already have are not only less visible, but no new ones show up.  </li>
            <li> This is the oil for dry skin!  </li>
            <li> Have very dry skin all over my body at 71 years of age.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stop me from getting stretch marks, but I gained a ton of weight, so it was expected.</li>
            <li> There really is no cure or way to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> but I have been putting this on day and night for only a few weeks and</li>
            <li> using with derma rolling to keep the skin hydrated and healing works as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not as expensive as other products out there, so this is definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and we think it&#x27;s due to using this product diligently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And said it only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am Asian and usually scars fade easily on my skin but these ugly stretch marks were not diminishing even a bit without any help.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in Week 39 now), and started using it on a dark spot on my face, too.</li>
            <li> IT WAS LESS COSTLY</li>
            <li> I wish I used this product 6 years ago but with such sensitive skin I was afraid.</li>
            <li> I am now a month and a half into using this product and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> ( I was a little unclear from the description)</li>
            <li> People with stubborn skin may take a little longer</li>
            <li> bought a little one because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch on something that wasn&#x27;t going to work.</li>
            <li> but I figured every little bit helps.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for 1.5 months now once everyday and</li>
            <li> My wiFe uses it everyday</li>
            <li> i applied it to my belly and thighs once a day, everyday, from the day i found out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday since i got it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have dry, thin skin, and I use this after I shower.</li>
            <li> Usually results can be seen in 2 or 3 months.</li>

            <li> So they don&#x27;t look as bad but there still there.</li>
            <li> This product is made from petroleum, it clogs my pores, attracts dirt, and smells terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This bio-oil was a great deal and hard to beat anywhere. It has been very helpful with the treatment and prevention of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that my order was shipped as soon as it was. I was even more surprised to see that I received two large bottles of Bio oil instead of one large and one small ( I was a little unclear from the description)</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast. My mom LOVES this stuff. I initially bought it for me, but I guess my skin is a little sensitive and I started breaking out, so I gave it to my mom and she swears it works wonders for her.. Tempted to give it another try.. Maybe at a time when my face is completely clear that way I can really know if it broke out from this stuff or not.</li>
            <li> I even use it to save with.</li>
            <li> Contains BHT and many other worrisome ingredients especially since so many people seem to use this obsessively during pregnancy. Many of these should NOT be used during pregnancy. Should have read the ingredients before purchasing. Going to stick with a high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> I am almost 6 months along and use bio oil 2x a day. Although I haven&#x27;t grown all that much I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought this oil many times and I have nothing but good to say. I&#x27;ve used the oil on cuts and for general moisturizing.  It has helped a lot with my rosacea symptoms. I wish I had known about it 20 years ago!!! My daughter used it when she was pregnant five years ago and despite gaining 70 pounds, she doesn&#x27;t have one stretch mark! My belly looks like a road map.  I would recommend Bio-oil for general skin care, for pregnancy, and for scar-reduction after injury or surgery.  It really works!</li>
            <li> It worked for me. I was like &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; after giving birth. So was my bf and our friends.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Works great on dry, peeling skin.  Have been using it to prevent stretch marks, so we shall see.  Havent seen a reduction in already in place stretch marks or scars.</li>
            <li> My wife started using this right when we found out she was preganant and still uses it after birth.&lt;br /&gt;She hardly has any stretch marks and we think it&#x27;s due to using this product diligently.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I am a week away from having my first child and although I did get some stretch marks this oil has definitely helped reduce how many and how red they are.  I started it when I first noticed the little stretch marks and they have not gotten much worse in the past 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I was told this will help with pregnancy stretch marks......we will see, due date September 27!!!!</li>
            <li> I heard of this product on a TV program and unfortunately found this product after I had used every stretch mark product on the market while pregnant and STILL got stretch marks!  I started using this product about 3 weeks before I had my baby and continued after I had the baby and by about week 8  I noticed a HUGE difference in the appearance in the color of the stretch marks...........I&#x27;m not going to tell you they disappeared because that just won&#x27;t ever happen, but they certainly diminished in color!  I would most definitely would recommend this product.  I also bought it for my sister who had a surgery leaving a scar from her breastbone to her belly button and it drastically helped with her scar as well!</li>
            <li> I discovered Bio Oil when I was a few months pregnant. I was searching for something more affordable than the stretch mark creams sold at Ulta. I used it every day, all over and on my face. It didn&#x27;t stop me from getting stretch marks, but I gained a ton of weight, so it was expected. Also, it&#x27;s genetic, so you can&#x27;t really control getting them in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;After having baby, I continued to use Bio Oil and it seriously helped fade the stretch marks. I love this stuff. It makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Only real way to prevent stretch marks is to excercise to eat right</li>
            <li> I had resorted to the fact that I have to live with stretch marks all my life , I have pretty bad ones on my hips, thighs and knees more than 5-6 years old.Other reviewers said that this doesn&#x27;t work on the old marks but it did for me! I have been using this for 1.5 months now once everyday and the stretch marks on my knees and legs have nearly disappeared. I&#x27;d say gone 80% and this is with just 1.5 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not as expensive as other products out there, so this is definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results I&#x27;d recommend use generous amount once\twice a day, although it absorbs quickly its best to rub it until it gets absorbed completely.&lt;br /&gt;For me it worked best when applied before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian and usually scars fade easily on my skin but these ugly stretch marks were not diminishing even a bit without any help.This is a miraculous product and everyone should give it a try.Have patience and try a minimum of 2-3 months.People with stubborn skin may take a little longer but I&#x27;m pretty sure it will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review again if they disappear completely.</li>
            <li> Soft skin hasn&#x27;t faded stretch marks tho it does make your skin feel really soft and it dries very quickly you don&#x27;t need a lot</li>
            <li> worked great for my skin, but i of course still got stretch marks. bio oil takes away all the itch though and to me finding an oil to do that was worth it. ill take my tiger stripes just stop the itch!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 5 years. It really clears up scars and stretch-marks.  This product came in a pack of two for a good price. I plan to order my Bio Oil for this vender agin.</li>
            <li> My wiFe uses it everyday she is very happy with the prOduct</li>
            <li> 2nd baby no stretch marks unlike my sister ad mother</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and it makes skin feel soft. I&#x27;m pregnant and I started using this product on my second trimester and I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks on my belly.</li>
            <li> exact same as the one bought in store for half price, can&#x27;t beat this product for your skin. Very good for healing cracks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this since the 20th week of my pregnancy for stretch marks (haven&#x27;t had any and I&#x27;m in Week 39 now), and started using it on a dark spot on my face, too. That spot has all but disappeared now. The smell of the oil is really mild and pleasant, and it really soaks in fast. Great product!</li>
            <li> a very nice pleasant smell. not too oily. seems to be fading bad childhood marks on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;loved the price, can&#x27;t find it cheaper. would recommend</li>
            <li> Received package earlier than expected. Opened it and tried it. Works great! It gets absorbed through the skin which moisturizes and for a long time. Better than applying lotion constantly.</li>
            <li> This product is made from petroleum, it clogs my pores, attracts dirt, and smells terrible. I would never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Everybody we have talked to have high reviews of the oil, so far my wife is impressed with it during the pregnancy.</li>
            <li> ARRIVED MANY MORE DAYS AHEAD OF EXPECTED DELIVERY.  WAS VERY PLEASED. HAVE BEEN USING THE PRODUCT FOR SOME TIME AND LIKE IT VERY MUCH BUT BUYING IN LARGER QUANTITY IT WAS LESS COSTLY AND OF COURSE LASTING MUCH LONGER SO NOT HAVING TO ALWAYS BE BUYING IT.</li>
            <li> i applied it to my belly and thighs once a day, everyday, from the day i found out i was pregnant (3 weeks) till after i delivered. Very few stretchmarks are visible and they are fading. Happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a couple weeks/months in to using this product, I haven&#x27;t really noticed a change in my stretch marks but I am going to keep using it! I haven&#x27;t given up hope yet.</li>
            <li> Good deal for hard to find and expensive product I use every day!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time I love this product and I definitely recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping! Also a great product</li>
            <li> i used this during pregnancy. really helped cut down the dry itchiness you get when your skin starts stretching.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells , but I think I&#x27;m allergic as I broke out with an itchy rash a few days after using.</li>
            <li> I have bought this before and was very skeptical. I never believe that these types of products have the ability to change your skin and certainly would never used anything that is toxic on my skin. I can&#x27;t even remember to this day how i heard about this but I was hooked when I bought my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a little one because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch on something that wasn&#x27;t going to work. I don&#x27;t use lotions, perfumes, or any skin altering products such as face lift creams and all that bull. I&#x27;m a naturalist and believe things are the way  they are because that&#x27;s what happens in life. You scar up and stretch and basically &amp;#34;deal with it&amp;#34; was my philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Bio Oil and didn&#x27;t see any improvement for at least a week. I would put it on once a day after my shower and maybe even skipped sometimes so i told myself to keep trying it because of user error. After 2 weeks I started to see major improvements My dry skin parts where soft and stayed soft as if i was using lotion all day everyday. Parts of my skin where there were dark splotches became significantly lighter some even went a way. And the biggie; my stretch marks on my hips are vanishing before my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use anything else. I don&#x27;t recommend this for deep or very large scars, you wont see these kind of results. BUT! this definitely works for blemishes on the top of your skin and every woman&#x27;s nightmare-stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im about to order 2 more bottles</li>
            <li> I used this oil for about three months I haven&#x27;t noticed any changed. Olive oil better than this!&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work out with me sorry :(</li>
            <li> Works great for my skin</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars because it came on time and it does seem to be helping with my sunspots. I am still in the process of using it so I can&#x27;t say for sure yet but so far so good. It is really amazing that I can put it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts (even though it is an oil). That is cool!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday since i got it and the scars have definitely faded a lot since then. This product is really great.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before and I love how it makes your skin feel.  I have extremely dry skin and even though I put spf 50 sunscreen on when I am exposed to the sun - my skin still gets very dry.  But BIO Oil makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.  I love it on my face.  I can&#x27;t honestly say that it has done anything for crows feet or wrinkles, but it just makes your skin feel so soft and healthy.  I have not tried it on any scars or stretch marks, but I will.</li>
            <li> I used this oil on my body, my face, its great!  Makes the skin so soft.  Says its not greasy but it does take a while for it to soak in and will be a bit oily until it does.  Im 52 but have oily face and it works great on there as well.  Highly recommend.  My daughter and my grandson both had scars that they used it on and it has helped to all but diminish on him and helped hers to heal and not be quite so visible.</li>
            <li> This product is out of this world!! My stretch marks have completely lightened up and are not as harsh on my skin. I have only been using the product for 2 months and I am extremely satisfied</li>
            <li> Like my wife told me:&lt;br /&gt;It is of very high quality&lt;br /&gt;Good texture and very nice odor&lt;br /&gt;stays long time on the body</li>
            <li> I used this product with my first pregnancy! I loved it then and now that I am pregnant again I will only use this! I have seen the results and am happy with this product</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel after using it so soft and smooth and so far no stretch marks</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without biooil</li>
            <li> I got it at a great price.  Works as specified. and my wife loves it. And said it only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> I loooove this product. I wish I bought it sooner. I had lapband sugery 6 years ago and have had two pregnancy a in 2.5 years. I have a lot of stretch marks. The redness/ browness of the marks went away in a week. So they don&#x27;t look as bad but there still there. I have only been using product 2 weeks. However I defiantly plan to use it premantly as my skin is in such awesome shape. My always dry elbows are soft. I have mild to moderate rosecha and when my allergies act up my face gets dry and sensitive I have had ZERO reaction to this product. My face is not dry or irratated the tone is great. I wish I used this product 6 years ago but with such sensitive skin I was afraid. Than my DR told me it was hypoallergenic ! It&#x27;s awesome ! It has a scent though , it smells like  faint rose &amp; sandalwood, but I like it and find it realaxing. Great product and this is a awesome price !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy and so far so good. I really like the smell and how well it absorbs on my skin. A little also goes a long way -- I&#x27;m still on the first bottle with 2x daily applications.</li>
            <li> I am now a month and a half into using this product and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. I had cherry red stretch marks along my abdomen due to my pregnancy...and now my stretch marks are a light peach color. Let&#x27;s be honest, I do forget every once in a while to put it on, but I am definitely seeing results none the less! ( I&#x27;m sure if i used it as directed results would have been noticed soner) I wish I would&#x27;ve used it as soon as I got pregnant to avoid or even lessen these stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I have to start off by saying I only used this once a day when it says twice a day. I started using this at 3 months pregnant. I have no stretch marks on my stomach but I did get stretch marks on the sides of my hips.</li>
            <li> Love it, makes marks disappear over time &amp; skin feels amazing!!</li>
            <li> Bio Oil makes my skin look young again and not dry as before Bio Oil. Would recommend product to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the oil for dry skin!  It is wonderful.  Thank you for the bet product for your skin. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Its  not for persons expecting overnight results. I have been using bio oil for a year. it works great with my other lotions and oil. Now that im expecting i started using right away to avoid those itching and unwanted scars. i love it.</li>
            <li> i am using the fourth bottle of bio oil since 3rd month of my pregnancy. I am at 28th week right now and would probably need to buy another 3 or 4 bottles. I use this together with Clarins&#x27; stretch mark control. Although my tummy is huge because I am having twins, I haven&#x27;t got any single line of stretch mark yet. I am applying this twice a day.</li>
            <li> do you have dry skin? have issues with acne scaring? yes? well this oil is great for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the smell is wonderful (reminds me of 90s women make up scents from my childhood, very nostalgic!), is not too oily and has changed the texture on my face. i use it twice a day and it&#x27;s made a huge impact on me and my friend as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am so hooked that i placed an order for two more!</li>
            <li> I am an avid user and this is the best deal I have found and I will always love Bio oil!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Bio Oil for my daughter and I really went all out to get the best deal.  This was by far the most reasonable price I saw online.  Once again Amazon came to my rescue.  My daughter was extremely pleased to receive two bottles instead of one at the offered price.</li>
            <li> Well, it works... but you have to keep using it, it seems, in order to maintain the results.  I&#x27;ll use it as needed, but it also smell really nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in this stuff, but it works wonders on aging skin, including age spots. I use it on my hands, face, and body.</li>
            <li> I had read some reviewer&#x27;s complaints about knock-off Bio Oil.The Bio Oil I received from Pacifica World Corporation was authentic and well packaged.I also know I got a very good deal,two for almost the price of one.I&#x27;ve been using Bio Oil for two years and it works great.Scars start to vanish gradually.Usually results can be seen in 2 or 3 months.I would purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> I had a wart removed from a finger.  The scar tissue which remained was larger than the wart.  I applied Bio Oil as recommended and it removed the scar tissue.</li>
            <li> Stretch marks: Prevented stretch marks in my second pregnancy and prevented itchy belly. With my first I used cocoa butter and it was not effective at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial moisturizer: My face has never looked better, even with the fluctuating hormones of pregnancy and post partum.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It is especially good during the winter months for the entire body to alleviate problems with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect! This product is amazing! It began working on my daughter&#x27;s 3rd degree burn scars the very first week. Took the darker scar tissue color away and began smoothing the skin almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for about a year now and continue to use it not only for stretch marks, but because it is an excellent conditioner for your skin. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I know a huge part of getting stretch-marks is hereditary and can depend on how quickly and responsibly you gain weight but I figured every little bit helps.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; with a pre-pregnancy weight of 125, I&#x27;m now at 37 weeks with 22 pounds of weight gain.  I&#x27;ve used bio-oil religiously twice a day since my 2nd trimester began and have yet to get a single stretch mark.  So I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars and will definitely use it with my next pregnancy.</li>
            <li> My wife rubbed this on her pregnant belly every single night for 9 months. She was diligent, but only used it before bed each night. Now that baby is here and wifey is a few weeks into recovery we are pleased to say that wifey is stretch mark free. She&#x27;s a petite person and the baby was 8 lbs. so there was plenty of stretching to be had. Plus, her skin is super soft and primed for baby cuddles. This is definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Came in just in time n definitely reduces stretch mark appearance&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day</li>
            <li> I received my package in good order.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  This is my second order of this product and it certainly will not be the last.</li>
            <li> This is my first order and I really love it. I have  very sensitive and dry skin. I use it for my face and sometimes body after shower. It really works well.</li>
            <li> Seemed to have worked on my stomach. I am looking forward to the postpartum results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good. I will buy next time!</li>
            <li> This product reduced my red scar to where you can barely see it. I&#x27;ve been using it for three months already. However, my white stretch marks are no different than before I started using this product. Unless you have red scars or red stretch marks, you&#x27;re better off using your money on buying gym clothes and a membership.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if it will soften and fade scars but love how my skin feels</li>
            <li> Used it religiously all day, every day, ended up with no stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;On baby number 2, we&#x27;ll see if it works again...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just been 10 days since I started using it. The skin feels softer and healthier . However the pigmentation marks of my face seem to be a rigid , probably they would need more time to go away.</li>
            <li> A friend recommend this for my scare.&lt;br /&gt;I see no difference after over 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it is just that it needs more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> My sister, who lives in South Africa, sent this to me after I had surgery last year.  I have been using it ever since.  It has worked wonders on all of my scars - I had several procedures.  The smaller scars have basically disappeared, and the bigger ones, including the large one across my abdomen, are flat and the color seems to be fading quicker than normal.  I was so happy when I discovered that I could order this and have it delivered directly to me and not have to rely on my sister to send me more of this product.</li>
            <li> Have very dry skin all over my body at 71 years of age. Using this on my face and on my legs and arms. It gives a nice smooth feel without being oily. Than you so much.</li>
            <li> Use it on my body, as well as my face.  It has helped my surgery scar tremendously.  My surgery scar and also a scar I had on my heel where my storm door closed on the back of my foot was puffing up.  I used the Bio Oil on both and the scars became flat and did not produce a keloid.  I continue to use it and I do believe the scar on my heel may become unnoticeable in the future.  The surgery scar has flattened and I continue to use the oil.  I recommend it to all of my family and friends.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this oil and made me buy a second bottle because she loved it. Leaves a no- greasy or oily skin, yet is thick and absorbs easily.  Fragrance is wonderful and very soothing. She used it to help heal scaring from a recent foot surgery.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years. I always put a squirt in my bath water, as well as lightly cover my aging face and neck as soon as getting out of the bath or shower. At age 62, I have minimal wrinkles and most people think I am much younger. I do not know how much credit I can give to this product and how much to genetics and good living. However, I do know that my skin feels much softer and looks bright and healthy with no makeup on! It is not greasy and will soak into your skin. It also has a nice scent. I also think it helps fade scars and sunspots, but I don&#x27;t think it will remove them completely.</li>
            <li> I had no stretch marks from my first pregnancy because I used this on my belly once a day every day! It&#x27;s great and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes like baby oil does.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Used for both pregnancies</li>
            <li> love this stuff, can&#x27;t get enough it</li>
            <li> Did not notice any huge difference on my skin... but i love the smoothness and the smell.</li>
            <li> Mother-in-law have been using this for years. She love it..</li>
            <li> This product moisturizes your skin without the irritation because it&#x27;s  hypoallergenic so you can use all over your body. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I Just started using the product hopefully it works for me</li>
            <li> Two bottles of 125 ml (4.2 oz) size each in price. Priced competitively when ordered. Arrived quickly on free shipping. Works well as described.</li>
            <li> So this BioOil didnt necessarily do anything for my stretchmarks and I used it religiously 2-3 times a day. It did although soften my skin so I guess that would be a plus. I am not quite sure if I would ever buy it again to be honest.</li>
            <li> It was perfect thank you so much....  i used bio oil for almost 2 yrs. my skin looks young compare to other skin moisturizer. its not greasy it give&#x27;s you an adorable look. its amazing......</li>
            <li> I have dry, thin skin, and I use this after I shower. The oil absorbs and does not get everything else oily.</li>
            <li> I learned about this product at my surgeons office.  It works to reduce scaring and I like that.  I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> There really is no cure or way to prevent stretch marks. With that said, I didn&#x27;t purchase this product expecting to not see any stretch marks during pregnancy. I started using Bio Oil around 20 weeks, when my belly was starting to show more. I rubbed it on my belly at least once a day, usually right after getting out of the shower. The consistency was not heavy like other oils and the smell was very light and didn&#x27;t make me nauseas like other creams and oils (cocoa butter). I am now 32 weeks and have been using this product consistently. My belly is obviously much bigger now and I would have to say that I strongly believe that Bio Oil has helped with the minimal stretch marks I have. I only have a few very light, faded lines on my belly where it has expanded the most. I noticed that I grew a few stretch marks on my back side and those are much darker because I dont usually apply the oil on that area. I do now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bio Oil gets four stars from me because it didn&#x27;t help 100% but came close enough. Anyone who claims that they didn&#x27;t develop any stretch marks from topical creams/oils during pregnancy most likely just have very elastic skin and is not prone to stretch marks. I wish I knew about this product during my teen years because I would have used it after my growth spurt, yikes! I defintely plan to continue using Bio Oil for the long run.</li>
            <li> I am currently dieting (heavily) and when I lose a lot of weight too quickly I notice stretch marks on my stomach but I have been putting this on day and night for only a few weeks and already the stretch marks that I already have are not only less visible, but no new ones show up.  This is great.</li>
            <li> This is very good! The product got here very quickly!</li>
            <li> I love this oil and have rated it before.  I continue to buy.  Works great on keeping my skin ash free.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year to try to get rid of some minor stretch marks from weight gain\loss. I have noticed a difference on the lighter marks but not too much of a change in the somewhat deeper more persistence marks. I think over time it does do its job. Is it a miracle product? No. But the bottle does last a fairly good amount of time (about three months for me, just using it on certain areas after showering). It does make your skin feel very soft and smooth though, and thats always a plus. Also, love the color (not that it matters).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I use it religiously when the weather is dry to keep my body hydrated.  I just wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> My niece, for whom this was purchased, swears by this stuff for her stretch marks! Must be good! :-)</li>
            <li> I have been using Bio for several years now, prior nothing would repair several dry area&#x27;s on my face (and I tried everything) for years, BUT THIS STUFF WORKS! I touch a drop on my finger and place it on the spots and that&#x27;s it for the day, after two years the dry spots are not to be found but I still use a drop now and then just to play it safe. I also tried shaving with a drop rubbed in and found I do not nick myself as before. One bottle lasts me approx. two years. I bought another four just in case they stop making it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the item several times by now, my wife likes it and I can notice why. Her birthmarks are bit older but the oil seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> using with derma rolling to keep the skin hydrated and healing works as expected.</li>
            <li> Its is very soothing and smells so clean</li>
            <li> It took some time to receive otherwise it was what I thought it would be. A&lt;br /&gt;good deal It took to long to arrive.</li>
