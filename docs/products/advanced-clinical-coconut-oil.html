            <li>Super nice body creme.  </li>

            <li>i like the smell smells great an works very well for dry skin great product</li>
            <li>Easy to use and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Coconut fragrance is very mild.  </li>
            <li>I received this cream yesterday and it has a STRONG perfume smell.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong cocnut smell so if you dont like coocnut, you may not like the smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing and is really working on my skin!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, i work great for my acne prone dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels wonderful on, a little oily but</li>
            <li>Light coconut odor.</li>
            <li>but I overlooked this important info.  </li>
            <li>So happy with this product and will definitely keep buying it and using it with pleasure.  </li>
            <li>Great lotion have already bought a second jar.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH AND SILKY.</li>
            <li>I am on my second purchase and it is a great lotion.</li>
            <li>It feels cheap and greasy</li>
            <li>A yummy coconut fragrance, and soft lotion that feels so good on the face</li>
            <li>So far so good with this Coconut</li>
            <li>Creamy, goes on smooth and a nice soft scent.</li>
            <li>Stays on - feels good and light, but also enough coverage.</li>
            <li>Pure Organic coconut oil is much better.</li>
            <li>Love this so much.</li>
            <li>The lotion is okay, did not seem to hydrate my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face after I wash it and it absorbs fairly quick</li>
            <li>Smells nice but mineral oil is a major ingredient</li>
            <li>I love this lotion,so glad I tried it , I will be using this lotion for a long time, thank you Trish</li>
            <li>Smell is strong and just like coconut pie; too much, unless you like&lt;br /&gt;the coconut smell.</li>
            <li>IT FEELS VERY SMOOTH AND SOFT.  </li>
            <li>The advertising and the jar says in large letters, COCONUT OIL moisturizing cream, Organic, paraben free.</li>
            <li>You can use it on your face and a little in your hair after shampooing for a great conditioner.</li>
            <li>If I can&#x27;t pronounce the ingredients and coconut isn&#x27;t even near the top of the list I won&#x27;t be purchasing. ..</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need anymore chemicals in my body and it gets absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a buy</li>
            <li>The smell alone is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get the smell out of the house or off my skin, even after a fresh shower.  </li>
            <li>My skin does well with the ingredients of this product and it provides the right amount of hydration to my skin.</li>
            <li>The coconut smells nice and since I live near the beach</li>
            <li>Love love this gret for the skin I also put a little in my hair</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes ok enough</li>
            <li>Upon first use, I did not like this lotion.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight, but moisturizerizing and not in a greasy way!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absorbed quickly and leaves my shin feeling so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Not thick or greasy and absorbs really quickly....</li>
            <li>a long way!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is more &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; but I may be biased as someone who uses straight coconut oil on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>The coconut scent was just too strong and I felt it was not moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li>Also, the container is so easy to use, and large enough it does not need to be replaced often.</li>
            <li>I live in the very dry CO air and use straight coconut oil or almond oil with rose hip seed oil at night.</li>
            <li>This is a great product especially if you have acne prone skin but still get dried out.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Its non greasy, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a week and really like it.</li>
            <li>IT WAS DELIVERED VERY QUICKLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Since I just got it a couple of weeks ago I haven&#x27;t really felt the difference.  </li>
            <li>Very harmful to my breathing and vision.  </li>
            <li>but there are too many other ingredients.</li>
            <li>but I can tell you I don&#x27;t think I can live without it!</li>
            <li>Very creamy, leaves skin very silky soft.</li>
            <li>The baby had red bumps and this stuff took care of the problem quickly.  </li>
            <li>Was hoping the main ingredient was coconut</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I also started taking coconut soft gels but believe the cream is what has really helped my hands.</li>
            <li>This cream makes my face feel real soft.  </li>
            <li>This cream is not oily at all and not thick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and stays with me lightly thru my day!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s appropriate for year round.  </li>
            <li>Nice and thick.  </li>
            <li>wow how soft it made it!!!</li>
            <li>The price is right for a BIG tub!</li>
            <li>Like this more than plain coconut oil.</li>
            <li>and I think this will work well in the New England winters.</li>
            <li>and I bought myself a new jar of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but not pure enough for me.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive nose and don&#x27;t find the smell to be overbearing at all.</li>
            <li>So, I read the ingredients on the back, the largest quantity is always listed first</li>
            <li>I am disappointed because I thought this was all coconut, which in itself is one of the best moisturizers for anything</li>
            <li>and my face is completely clear</li>
            <li>I am 81 yrs old and after using the fragnant cream my skin is soft ans supple.</li>
            <li>Try it and be surprised at your youngerskin.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin silky soft and it stays that way all day.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>It claims to help with wrinkles, but I&#x27;m young and have sometimes severe acne</li>
            <li>the beach for a couple of days, and cream really feels cooling after showing after a day in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Should order another for myself before price goes back</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had near the dryness as I used to before I found</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and so hydrated...</li>
            <li>and I can buy Virgin Organic pure all coconut oil at my local health store for the same price.  </li>
            <li>So I like this product, smells great, my only disappointment, called coconut cream but</li>
            <li>The whole family uses this stuff in the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>My dry skin wants to thank you for the moisture your cream soothes away the winter dryness.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and not as thick as I thought &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; would be.  </li>
            <li>and I never expected anything but moisturizing</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it mildly stung  my sensitive face.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t powerful, it&#x27;s thick, and your skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>Very moisterizing, and a little bit goes</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Awesome for my dry dry skin - smells great too!</li>
            <li> Super nice body creme.  </li>
            <li> I have used it primarily on my 50 year old hands that looked 80 and the results are incredible.</li>

            <li> Easy to use and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Coconut fragrance is very mild.  </li>
            <li> I received this cream yesterday and it has a STRONG perfume smell.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong cocnut smell so if you dont like coocnut, you may not like the smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and is really working on my skin!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, i work great for my acne prone dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels wonderful on, a little oily but</li>
            <li> Light coconut odor.</li>
            <li> but I overlooked this important info.  </li>
            <li> So happy with this product and will definitely keep buying it and using it with pleasure.  </li>
            <li> Great lotion have already bought a second jar.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH AND SILKY.</li>
            <li> I am on my second purchase and it is a great lotion.</li>
            <li> It feels cheap and greasy</li>
            <li> A yummy coconut fragrance, and soft lotion that feels so good on the face</li>
            <li> So far so good with this Coconut</li>
            <li> Creamy, goes on smooth and a nice soft scent.</li>
            <li> Stays on - feels good and light, but also enough coverage.</li>
            <li> Pure Organic coconut oil is much better.</li>
            <li> Love this so much.</li>
            <li> The lotion is okay, did not seem to hydrate my skin very well.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face after I wash it and it absorbs fairly quick</li>
            <li> Smells nice but mineral oil is a major ingredient</li>
            <li> I love this lotion,so glad I tried it , I will be using this lotion for a long time, thank you Trish</li>
            <li> Smell is strong and just like coconut pie; too much, unless you like&lt;br /&gt;the coconut smell.</li>
            <li> IT FEELS VERY SMOOTH AND SOFT.  </li>
            <li> The advertising and the jar says in large letters, COCONUT OIL moisturizing cream, Organic, paraben free.</li>
            <li> You can use it on your face and a little in your hair after shampooing for a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> If I can&#x27;t pronounce the ingredients and coconut isn&#x27;t even near the top of the list I won&#x27;t be purchasing. ..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need anymore chemicals in my body and it gets absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a buy</li>
            <li> The smell alone is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get the smell out of the house or off my skin, even after a fresh shower.  </li>
            <li> My skin does well with the ingredients of this product and it provides the right amount of hydration to my skin.</li>
            <li> The coconut smells nice and since I live near the beach</li>
            <li> Love love this gret for the skin I also put a little in my hair</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes ok enough</li>
            <li> Upon first use, I did not like this lotion.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight, but moisturizerizing and not in a greasy way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absorbed quickly and leaves my shin feeling so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Not thick or greasy and absorbs really quickly....</li>
            <li> a long way!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is more &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; but I may be biased as someone who uses straight coconut oil on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> The coconut scent was just too strong and I felt it was not moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> Also, the container is so easy to use, and large enough it does not need to be replaced often.</li>
            <li> I live in the very dry CO air and use straight coconut oil or almond oil with rose hip seed oil at night.</li>
            <li> This is a great product especially if you have acne prone skin but still get dried out.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Its non greasy, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a week and really like it.</li>
            <li> IT WAS DELIVERED VERY QUICKLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Since I just got it a couple of weeks ago I haven&#x27;t really felt the difference.  </li>
            <li> Very harmful to my breathing and vision.  </li>
            <li> but there are too many other ingredients.</li>
            <li> but I can tell you I don&#x27;t think I can live without it!</li>
            <li> Very creamy, leaves skin very silky soft.</li>
            <li> The baby had red bumps and this stuff took care of the problem quickly.  </li>
            <li> Was hoping the main ingredient was coconut</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I also started taking coconut soft gels but believe the cream is what has really helped my hands.</li>
            <li> This cream makes my face feel real soft.  </li>
            <li> This cream is not oily at all and not thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and stays with me lightly thru my day!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s appropriate for year round.  </li>
            <li> Nice and thick.  </li>
            <li> wow how soft it made it!!!</li>
            <li> The price is right for a BIG tub!</li>
            <li> Like this more than plain coconut oil.</li>
            <li> and I think this will work well in the New England winters.</li>
            <li> and I bought myself a new jar of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not pure enough for me.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive nose and don&#x27;t find the smell to be overbearing at all.</li>
            <li> So, I read the ingredients on the back, the largest quantity is always listed first</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because I thought this was all coconut, which in itself is one of the best moisturizers for anything</li>
            <li> and my face is completely clear</li>
            <li> I am 81 yrs old and after using the fragnant cream my skin is soft ans supple.</li>
            <li> Try it and be surprised at your youngerskin.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin silky soft and it stays that way all day.  </li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> It claims to help with wrinkles, but I&#x27;m young and have sometimes severe acne</li>
            <li> the beach for a couple of days, and cream really feels cooling after showing after a day in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Should order another for myself before price goes back</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had near the dryness as I used to before I found</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and so hydrated...</li>
            <li> and I can buy Virgin Organic pure all coconut oil at my local health store for the same price.  </li>
            <li> So I like this product, smells great, my only disappointment, called coconut cream but</li>
            <li> The whole family uses this stuff in the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> My dry skin wants to thank you for the moisture your cream soothes away the winter dryness.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and not as thick as I thought &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; would be.  </li>
            <li> and I never expected anything but moisturizing</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it mildly stung  my sensitive face.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t powerful, it&#x27;s thick, and your skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> Very moisterizing, and a little bit goes</li>
            <li> Having dry skin I really dislike the feeling of tight drawn skin this product takes that feeling away immediately.</li>
            <li> but it does really work, especially on rough dry patches (like....feet and elbows).</li>
            <li> Not enough moisture for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not natural or organic.</li>
            <li> Fragrance lasts too long.</li>
            <li> on my dry skin</li>
            <li> My face gets dry and peel during the winter/ spring change and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Now that the weather has gotten colder it has helped my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> It fragrance is not overwhelming and the feel is soft and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Not happy about it being called coconut oil when there is a higher percentage of mineral oil.</li>
            <li> It works as described for very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Not much of a coconut smell to it</li>
            <li> Cream!!A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I just rec&#x27;d this the other day.  </li>
            <li> The product is good the smell is terrible.</li>
            <li> granddaughter spent the night a few nights ago, after her bath, where she shaved her legs,&lt;br /&gt;she</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who has troubled skin.</li>
            <li> I rubbed a little on my arm and it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> It does the job without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> For the few times I have used it</li>
            <li> I use this everyday after I shower.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday after I wash my face and it has done wonders!</li>
            <li> Not too oily or too thick.</li>
            <li> If you have asthma or allergies, not a good idea to use this.  </li>
            <li> And the artificial coconut fragrance smells of suntanning lotion.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this stuff like crazy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate, if you are in need of something like this go for it, you won&#x27;t be unhappy</li>
            <li> but I have noticed lines gone and wrinkles decreased!!  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t too bad kinda sits on your skin</li>
            <li> Caused an allergic reaction when applied, awful product!</li>
            <li> AWFUL.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My dry skin wants to thank you for the moisture your cream soothes away the winter dryness. I am 81 yrs old and after using the fragnant cream my skin is soft ans supple. Try it and be surprised at your youngerskin. IT&#x27;S MAGIC!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this so much. I now use it exclusively morning and night. It does the job without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> I received this cream yesterday and it has a STRONG perfume smell. I rubbed a little on my arm and it gave me a headache. After 3 washings with soap I can still smell it. AWFUL.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. The incredible scent... I constantly find myself sniffing my hands throughout the day. Cannot get enough!</li>
            <li> I have only been using for a week but I can tell you I don&#x27;t think I can live without it! I have used it primarily on my 50 year old hands that looked 80 and the results are incredible. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs great. The best part is even after washing my hands all day they still feel hydrated at the end of the day. Can&#x27;t wait to see how they look in another week. I also started taking coconut soft gels but believe the cream is what has really helped my hands.</li>
            <li> A yummy coconut fragrance, and soft lotion that feels so good on the face that I look forward to using every morning. My skin eagerly accepts lotion and feels instantly hydrated. Also, the container is so easy to use, and large enough it does not need to be replaced often. Yes I like it! I bought a second one. What more do you want to hear?</li>
            <li> Love the feel and the smell. Not too oily or too thick. Will buy this again</li>

            <li> I love it  this will be the only one I will buy.</li>
            <li> Bought it for someone who recently had surgery. She absolutely loved it I had to buy more</li>
            <li> I love this product&lt;br /&gt;Work on my dry skin</li>
            <li> I just rec&#x27;d this the other day.  For the few times I have used it I really like it. It fragrance is not overwhelming and the feel is soft and not greasy.  It makes your skin silky soft and it stays that way all day.  I have read about all the wonderful thing that coconut oil can do. As I have been using it for a short time it does what I hoped it would do. Having dry skin I really dislike the feeling of tight drawn skin this product takes that feeling away immediately. You can use it on your face and a little in your hair after shampooing for a great conditioner. I know as I keep using it my skin will keep on improving. I definitely would recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> The pump dispenser never would work.  I like the cream.</li>
            <li> Light coconut odor. Not greasy</li>
            <li> Smells nice but mineral oil is a major ingredient</li>
            <li> I love this and I am so glad I found it.  I use it on my face and everywhere else and my skin is so smooth!</li>
            <li> Love the smell! It&#x27;s not too heavy and stays with me lightly thru my day!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It does have a strong cocnut smell so if you dont like coocnut, you may not like the smell. Its non greasy, very moisturizing. Love it</li>
            <li> This is creamy and really smells good</li>
            <li> Not a cream, just a lotion. And the artificial coconut fragrance smells of suntanning lotion. It moisturizes ok enough but I would never get it again.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, i work great for my acne prone dry skin.  My face gets dry and peel during the winter/ spring change and this does the trick. It does smell good.</li>
            <li> You have to keep shaking it to get the cream to come out.</li>
            <li> Love how my skin feel. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this cream. Wish it were edible!</li>
            <li> Dispenser doesn&#x27;t work. Makes it a big pain to use</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT.  It feels wonderful on my face and softens the wrinkles.  A friend recommended it to me and, after using it one time at her house, I ordered it. I hope to never be without it.</li>
            <li> Just received mine.  The coconut smells nice and since I live near the beach it&#x27;s appropriate for year round.  My concern is that I that I didn&#x27;t read more.  The advertising and the jar says in large letters, COCONUT OIL moisturizing cream, Organic, paraben free. It feels wonderful on, a little oily but coconut oil is that way.  So, I read the ingredients on the back, the largest quantity is always listed first but I overlooked this important info.  It says, Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, etc.  The coconut oil is at the end of line 3 and 4.  I am disappointed because I thought this was all coconut, which in itself is one of the best moisturizers for anything and I can buy Virgin Organic pure all coconut oil at my local health store for the same price.  Just saying, this jar is inappropriately advertised, it should read mineral oil because that&#x27;s the largest quantity of oil in this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful creamy lotion!</li>
            <li> Smells yucky and leaves my face greasy.</li>
            <li> The lotion is okay, did not seem to hydrate my skin very well. It doesnt have a strong over powering Smell, which I liked.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion.  The coconut smell is nice but not overpowering.  It&#x27;s also not greasy and has a good texture.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> If I can&#x27;t pronounce the ingredients and coconut isn&#x27;t even near the top of the list I won&#x27;t be purchasing. .. Don&#x27;t need anymore chemicals in my body and it gets absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li> Great consistency and amazing smell. Definitely worth a buy</li>
            <li> It is an okay lotion, nothing spectacular. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before. Works for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Wonderful.  Nice, clean smelling, gentle scent, feels great, smooth and creamy, and soaks right in with no residual greasy or oily feeling which is great.  The only thing that makes no promises about reducing or getting rid of lines and wrinkles yet it does just that.  I have used many expensive creams and lotions who made promises of miracles and nothing, but this stuff didn&#x27;t do that and I never expected anything but moisturizing but I have noticed lines gone and wrinkles decreased!!  Love that.  So happy with this product and will definitely keep buying it and using it with pleasure.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it&#x27;s not greasy. Makes your skin feel soft. Great lotion have already bought a second jar.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product!!!!!! Love the way it moisturizes the skin. It is a big container and last for several weeks.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a week and really like it. The scent is nice and I think this will work well in the New England winters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this lotion from &amp;#34;Burlington Coat Factory&amp;#34; for about a year and I love it! So creamy and it smells heavenly. It even fits perfectly in the drink holder in my car, so when I&#x27;m waiting in traffic I just dispense a pump and I forget about the traffic because this lotion smells so good, and I always get compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my order despite the delay. I am hoping it does the work I am looking for.</li>
            <li> My favorite! I use this everyday after I shower. The smell isn&#x27;t powerful, it&#x27;s thick, and your skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product..</li>
            <li> The scent is perfect and the cream is just the right texture for a massage!&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing another one</li>
            <li> Love it. Feels so good.</li>
            <li> Smells great but there are too many other ingredients. Not natural or organic.</li>
            <li> love this  coconut oil</li>
            <li> Ordered from a PCH flyer, Loved it! So rich creamy with wonderful fresh coconut smell. Purchased some for stocking stuffers at Xmas. Amazon is now my go to shopping spot.</li>
            <li> coconut is the thing these days</li>
            <li> I love it! I have a very sensitive nose and don&#x27;t find the smell to be overbearing at all. Then again, I do like the smell of coconut.. As others have said, it is light and feels great! After a couple of weeks, I do feel my skin has gotten brighter and just looks and feels softer/better. I live in the very dry CO air and use straight coconut oil or almond oil with rose hip seed oil at night. Loving this as my daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH AND SILKY. NOT GREASY!</li>
            <li> So I like this product, smells great, my only disappointment, called coconut cream but coconut oil is the 7th ingredient of 15. Yes organic but.......</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about a year now. Best I have found. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I use this coconut cream all over, even on my face. It&#x27;s absorbed quickly and leaves my shin feeling so soft and silky. Good product.</li>
            <li> Great for the skin and keeps gnats and flies away</li>
            <li> I use this cream on my face, arms and legs, it works just awesome on the face,makes it so soft. It really is all u need, /this cream does wonders for your arms and legs great for dryness.It is not greasy</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing a good job, will review again soon.  Not happy about it being called coconut oil when there is a higher percentage of mineral oil.</li>
            <li> This is a great light weight lotion. I put it on my face after I wash it and it absorbs fairly quick and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. It claims to help with wrinkles, but I&#x27;m young and have sometimes severe acne and my face is completely clear and I&#x27;ve only used it for about 5 days now. I highly recommend this to anyone who has troubled skin. Oh and it has a wonderful coconuts smell!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this stuff like crazy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not pure enough for me.</li>
            <li> love the moisturzzer!!!</li>
            <li> Got compliments on how hydrated my skin looks at the doctors office</li>
            <li> Does not have any coconut smell whatsoever. Cream is ok - won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
            <li> Creamy, goes on smooth and a nice soft scent.</li>
            <li> Love my coconut Oil Moisturizing Cream.  Love the smell; lLike it even better in the pump jar.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion,so glad I tried it , I will be using this lotion for a long time, thank you Trish</li>
            <li> Now that the weather has gotten colder it has helped my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love this cream..best buy for the money!</li>
            <li> i like the smell smells great an works very well for dry skin great product</li>
            <li> It works as described for very dry skin but, I found that it smelled very strong like sun tan lotion.  The product is good the smell is terrible.</li>
            <li> smells awesome! doesnt leave you all greasy like oils do. I Love this product!</li>
            <li> THIS COCONUT CREAM I USE ON MY FACE, HANDS AND FEET, I LOVE IT.  IT FEELS VERY SMOOTH AND SOFT.  IT WAS DELIVERED VERY QUICKLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO MY FRIENDS TOO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not much of a coconut smell to it but it does really work, especially on rough dry patches (like....feet and elbows). I would buy this product again and recommend it to my friends and family. This product will work differently on each individuals.</li>
            <li> A good moist smells great</li>
            <li> Very creamy, leaves skin very silky soft.</li>
            <li> So happy with this product that I just now purchased another one. I call it my &amp;#34;back up plan&amp;#34;. Smells sooo delightful and makes my skin like velvet. Don&#x27;t hesitate, if you are in need of something like this go for it, you won&#x27;t be unhappy you did !!</li>
            <li> I wish it moisturizes as good as it smells</li>
            <li> The price is right for a BIG tub! The smell alone is worth the money. It really really smells good and it works on hands, elbows, heels, etc. I like this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful cream. Coconut smell is so pleasing and great on the skin.</li>
            <li> Very moisterizing, and a little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is more &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; but I may be biased as someone who uses straight coconut oil on my skin and hair. This lotion is a lot more convenient for application, though, so I recommend for when you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li> This cream is great.  Nice and thick.  The scent is wonderful.  My only complaint is that it mildly stung  my sensitive face.  Will purchase again as a body lotion.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t too bad kinda sits on your skin</li>
            <li> This cream makes my face feel real soft.  I use it under my make-up and before going to bed.  I would highly recommend it.  It has a very light coconut smell and my husband said it smelled really nice.</li>
            <li> Wonderful in my special cream for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Since I just got it a couple of weeks ago I haven&#x27;t really felt the difference.  It goes on easy and not as thick as I thought &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; would be.  It smells great.</li>
            <li> Smoothing of the skin is wonderful and feels silky smooth. Smell is strong and just like coconut pie; too much, unless you like&lt;br /&gt;the coconut smell. Reminds of summer at the beach slathered in coconut oil. Fragrance lasts too long. A shame because it&lt;br /&gt;smooths soooo nicely.</li>
            <li> Like this more than plain coconut oil. It is nice and creamy.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this Coconut Cream!!A little goes a long way.This cream is not oily at all and not thick.My skin does well with the ingredients of this product and it provides the right amount of hydration to my skin.</li>
            <li> some what watery, but all n all for the price it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Upon first use, I did not like this lotion. The coconut scent was just too strong and I felt it was not moisturizing enough. However, after a couple of uses, my crack feet is healing. The scent does eventually go away in 10 to 15 minutes.  Update: I am on my second purchase and it is a great lotion. Highly recommend. Very lightweight, but moisturizerizing and not in a greasy way!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself but ended up giving it to my daughter to use on her toddlers face.  The baby had red bumps and this stuff took care of the problem quickly.  It smells great, is creamy and I bought myself a new jar of it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this lotion.  It feels cheap and greasy and I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this lotion. Easy to use and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Delicious Coconut Scent but Not Overpowering - lovely, not greasy, light coconut scent, great overall product and size.</li>
            <li> Love love this gret for the skin I also put a little in my hair wow how soft it made it!!!</li>
            <li> This coconut fragrance is wonderful, and the lotion is very rich and creamy. Comes in a nice size container with pump for easy access......It is a great moisturizer. A good find!</li>
            <li> Love it. I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Awesome for my dry dry skin - smells great too!</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with this cream. It smells so good and it is not greasy at all. I use it as a face cream.The delivery was excellent, I give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a great product especially if you have acne prone skin but still get dried out. I use this everyday after I wash my face and it has done wonders!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I use it everywhere, and people always comment about how great it smells.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderfully! Stays on - feels good and light, but also enough coverage.</li>
            <li> Feels good on most of my skin, but some burning.  Really good on my hands.  BUT!!!! Very harmful to my breathing and vision.  Nose burns, runs, coughing, choking, sneezing, eyes watering and twitching!  If you have asthma or allergies, not a good idea to use this.  The product arrived at my front door this morning, went out the back door in a sealed plastic bag this afternoon.  Can&#x27;t get the smell out of the house or off my skin, even after a fresh shower.  Probably a good product for many people, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Super nice body creme.  Coconut fragrance is very mild.  Use after my shower daily.&lt;br /&gt;My granddaughter spent the night a few nights ago, after her bath, where she shaved her legs,&lt;br /&gt;she used the Coconut Cream and really like it on her legs!!!!  So I bought her a jar for her home.&lt;br /&gt;At the beach for a couple of days, and cream really feels cooling after showing after a day in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Should order another for myself before price goes back up!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Carol Wright Gifts</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and is really working on my skin! Good sized tub and I like how it has a pump. Not thick or greasy and absorbs really quickly....would definitely recommend it 😀</li>
            <li> Was hoping the main ingredient was coconut but it isn&#x27;t. Not enough moisture for my dry skin. Pure Organic coconut oil is much better.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this product is amazing. I haven&#x27;t had near the dryness as I used to before I found</li>
            <li> Great smell and texture. My skin is so soft. Love it.</li>
            <li> love it, smells so good.  It makes my skin so soft and so hydrated...</li>
            <li> Excellent..quick delivery!</li>
