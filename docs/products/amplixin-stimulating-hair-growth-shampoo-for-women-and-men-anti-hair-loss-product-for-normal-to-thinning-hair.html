    <ol>
            <li>but I was so happy I had to keep it going!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with alopecia and this brand has been wonderful on my hair.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with this brand</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like they hired a bunch of people to just write good reviews for the product.</li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>It smells so good that I wish I had a body lotion with this scent.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>The orange and lemon citrus scent is wonderful first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>It is unregulated shampoo and there is no way that there are this many good reviews about the product.</li>
            <li>Regardless, all opinions expressed are still 100% my own.</li>
            <li>This shampoo cleans my hair well and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I was not compensated for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I love that I got the opportunity to try this shampoo in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>can’t say that I am a huge fan of the smell of the shampoo; however, I am kind of “girlie girl” when it comes to my haircare products and tend to lean towards sweeter smells.</li>
            <li>As someone with thicker, longer hair, I imagine that I use more shampoo that someone who has thinner, shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone from using or buying this product, the brand is one that I have never heard of and seems to have too many &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; reviews.</li>
            <li>My hair feels more smoother, I like that feeling.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and she decided to try this as well to see how healthy it keeps her hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>, I am sure the product doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>It really lathers great.</li>
            <li>My roommate ordered this shampoo and was very excited waiting for it to arrive.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers nicely; however, the lather goes away rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is 100% Sulfate &amp; Paraben free.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it leaves my hair feeling relatively clean and strong.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it is sulfate free, free of synthetic color additives.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair feeling really strong.</li>
            <li>I have less breakage which is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Its cheap smelling too.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s too good to be true, then most likely it probably is.</li>
            <li>but now I don&#x27;t think I will have to because of the clean feeling that my hair has.</li>
            <li>one pet peeve is that the bottle states that you should use a fair amount; however, that is a double edged sword.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair smell nice and its so soft also gives the appearance of it being thicker.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t feel weighed down, it has a beautiful shine, and it looks and feels silky</li>
            <li>The shampoo (white in color) has a light almost citrus-y scent that smells really nice.  </li>
            <li>I personally think the shampoo is ok but it won’t take me away from my favorite shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I van finally tell that I&#x27;m using the perfect one,  it got rid of my excess of grease in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product after reading all the good reviews but the product isn&#x27;t as described in the reviews, the texture is slimy and the smell is way to powerful</li>
            <li>My fair is fuller, thicker, feels healthier and it doesn&#x27;t hurt or dry out my scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received complimentary product to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li>I thought she might have a delicate scalp, but when I applied this shampoo to my own head, I immediately felt my scalp feeling warm.</li>
            <li>the warm sensation is simply cooling and relaxing. ....</li>
            <li>For the wife, she likes it so far as it has helped with her scalp and her hair is softer, although she likes the conditioner better than the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair loss practially stopped completely and it&#x27;s waaaay more manageable.</li>
            <li>At first, I was pleased because I didn&#x27;t lose as much hair in the shower as before, but when I brushed my hair out, I lost a ton more hair than before so</li>
            <li>Definitely make sure Hair look full.</li>
            <li>but then really stopped working quite quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair is thicker and full of body while leaving a super soft, silky look and feel.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that the first time I used this product I did a double take and read the bottle not once but twice to make sure I wasn’t using a product that promotes hair loss.</li>
            <li>would love for the shampoo to smell a bit nicer and for the bottle to be a lot bigger.</li>
            <li>After the first use of this shampoo, I noticed my hair color had faded</li>
            <li>The shampoo is a pretty pearl color.</li>
            <li>I am very excited to see how this does over the next 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most products dry out may hair leaving frizzy.</li>
            <li>All the reviews on here are an absolute joke.</li>
            <li>I would imagine it takes longer than one week of use to really notice a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really made my hair grow .</li>
            <li>On the other hand, what I did notice after using this product is how healthy my hair felt and looked.</li>
            <li>My thicker, longer hair and a bottle that directs one to use a fair amount means that I am going through some serious shampoo each time I shower.</li>
            <li>Plus if you read them they definitely seem made up and aren&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly dissatisfied with this product and it does not deliver what it says.</li>
            <li>I had use it for three weeks and already noticed new hairs growing, I also take biotin pills and use Clair&#x27;s Hair tonic.</li>
            <li>I hope it helps with new growth as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I would love to have more product to continue the regimen and see if it works; unfortunately, $150 a month for shampoo is well outside my budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I am not 100% certain that I would be able to tell at this stage in the game.</li>
            <li>can’t say that I have noticed a change as far as hair regrowth is concerned but with my hair</li>
            <li>The difference being with this shampoo right here, although I didn&#x27;t see results as fast as the other ones this shampoo actually does continue to work.</li>
            <li>My better half has a dry itchy scalp</li>
            <li>For a product that only lasted me a week, $37.98 seems a bit high.  </li>
            <li>and so far this seems to be nice quality, although expensive, shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It not only helps with hair loss, but it leaves my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the shampoo and conditioner long enough (2 weeks) to know if it grows new hair</li>

            <li> I will continue using it as long as I can.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m now a long time customer.</li>
            <li> There is an alarming amount of 5 star reviews and clearly no middle ground</li>
            <li> So this product is cheap an the reviews are fake!</li>
            <li> the amount of hair loss was the same, if not more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy its a waste of money!</li>
            <li> With a small amount it lathers alot.</li>
            <li> Over the past 12-14 months I have tried just about every brand out there of hair loss creams, shampoo/conditioner combos, mousses etc..</li>
            <li> At the rate that I am going, that would mean $150 a month for shampoo alone.</li>
            <li> , I exhausted my supply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The amount of hair that I lost was rather frightening.</li>
            <li> It was delivered, and when she went to use it, she started saying her scalp felt weird.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical when it comes to product’s claims that it can regrow hair.  </li>
            <li> I also think this is a bit expensive per bottle.  </li>
            <li> and it made me sick and is the worst product i have ever used in my life.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> All the reviews on here are an absolute joke. They have to be made up because I tried this product and it made me sick and is the worst product i have ever used in my life. It is unregulated shampoo and there is no way that there are this many good reviews about the product. Plus if you read them they definitely seem made up and aren&#x27;t true. It&#x27;s like they hired a bunch of people to just write good reviews for the product.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that the first time I used this product I did a double take and read the bottle not once but twice to make sure I wasn’t using a product that promotes hair loss. The amount of hair that I lost was rather frightening. On the other hand, what I did notice after using this product is how healthy my hair felt and looked. It doesn’t feel weighed down, it has a beautiful shine, and it looks and feels silky soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t say that I am a huge fan of the smell of the shampoo; however, I am kind of “girlie girl” when it comes to my haircare products and tend to lean towards sweeter smells. The shampoo lathers nicely; however, the lather goes away rather quickly. I assume this is because it is soaking into the hair so it can get to work. You leave the product in for 3 to 5 minutes and then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one pet peeve is that the bottle states that you should use a fair amount; however, that is a double edged sword. As someone with thicker, longer hair, I imagine that I use more shampoo that someone who has thinner, shorter hair. My thicker, longer hair and a bottle that directs one to use a fair amount means that I am going through some serious shampoo each time I shower. This is an 8 oz bottle so what that means is after a week, I exhausted my supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t say that I have noticed a change as far as hair regrowth is concerned but with my hair, I am not 100% certain that I would be able to tell at this stage in the game. I would imagine it takes longer than one week of use to really notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love for the shampoo to smell a bit nicer and for the bottle to be a lot bigger.

Regardless, all opinions expressed are still 100% my own.</li>
            <li> My roommate ordered this shampoo and was very excited waiting for it to arrive. It was delivered, and when she went to use it, she started saying her scalp felt weird. After using it for about 4 days, she had visible redness on her scalp. I thought she might have a delicate scalp, but when I applied this shampoo to my own head, I immediately felt my scalp feeling warm. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone from using or buying this product, the brand is one that I have never heard of and seems to have too many &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; reviews.</li>
            <li> I had use it for three weeks and already noticed new hairs growing, I also take biotin pills and use Clair&#x27;s Hair tonic.</li>
            <li> Just a note to those with color-treated hair.  After the first use of this shampoo, I noticed my hair color had faded so I don&#x27;t think its truly color-safe.  As for thickening my hair, the jury is still out.</li>
            <li> While this definitely cleaned my scalp, it left my hair dry, frizzy and feeling like dog fur. At first, I was pleased because I didn&#x27;t lose as much hair in the shower as before, but when I brushed my hair out, I lost a ton more hair than before so the amount of hair loss was the same, if not more. I don&#x27;t like the way it made my hair feel and I used a ton of conditioner the second time.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleans my hair well and smells nice. I have noticed results recently. My hair feels more smoother, I like that feeling. I am satisfied with my purchase. I plan to buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the shampoo and conditioner long enough (2 weeks) to know if it grows new hair but it definitely slows the daily hair loss. I love this product. It makes your hair smell nice and its so soft also gives the appearance of it being thicker. I hope it helps with new growth as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was not compensated for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it leaves my hair feeling relatively clean and strong. the warm sensation is simply cooling and relaxing. .... It leaves the hair feeling really strong. Also since I started using it I have less breakage which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Definitely make sure Hair look full.</li>
            <li> We have been using this shampoo for a while now and so far this seems to be nice quality, although expensive, shampoo.  The shampoo (white in color) has a light almost citrus-y scent that smells really nice.  I am always skeptical when it comes to product’s claims that it can regrow hair.  I have thinning hair, so I keep my hair cut short but I still use shampoo and conditioner to help keep what I have and keep my scalp healthy as I tend to have issues with a dry scalp, especially after I started cutting my hair short.  My better half has a dry itchy scalp and she decided to try this as well to see how healthy it keeps her hair and scalp.  The shampoo lathers and cleans well and per the instructions, you leave it in for about 3 to 5 minutes before rinsing and then putting in the conditioner (reviewed separately) that they also make.  I can’t say that it has helped with hair loss or regrowth but my scalp has felt healthier and the individual hairs are thicker than before.  For the wife, she likes it so far as it has helped with her scalp and her hair is softer, although she likes the conditioner better than the shampoo.  I personally think the shampoo is ok but it won’t take me away from my favorite shampoo and conditioner.  I also think this is a bit expensive per bottle.  I will update my review with longer term results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It really made my hair grow . Get my cut every 3weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy its a waste of money! It didn&#x27;t help with my thinning hair, I bought two! Its cheap smelling too. I used it for about 8 weeks no difference in my hair. So this product is cheap an the reviews are fake! If I could give it a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; I would.</li>
            <li> I can feel the cleanse. With a small amount it lathers alot.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is sulfate free, free of synthetic color additives. I use to have to change my shampoo but now I don&#x27;t think I will have to because of the clean feeling that my hair has. My hair loss practially stopped completely and it&#x27;s waaaay more manageable. I will continue using it as long as I can. I got this product in exchange for my opinion but I&#x27;m now a long time customer.</li>
            <li> Over the past 12-14 months I have tried just about every brand out there of hair loss creams, shampoo/conditioner combos, mousses etc..Some seemed to work but then really stopped working quite quickly. The difference being with this shampoo right here, although I didn&#x27;t see results as fast as the other ones this shampoo actually does continue to work. I had contemplated going and having the hair surgery but thought I&#x27;d give it one last shot with Amplixin and I&#x27;m glad I did! If it continues to work this well I think I can avoid the surgery all together. My fair is fuller, thicker, feels healthier and it doesn&#x27;t hurt or dry out my scalp. I am very excited to see how this does over the next 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 2nd bottle, the 1st came to me as a promotional item but I was so happy I had to keep it going!</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too good to be true, then most likely it probably is. I&#x27;m highly dissatisfied with this product and it does not deliver what it says. There is an alarming amount of 5 star reviews and clearly no middle ground so this indicates that this product may be hyped by paid reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short amount of time so I haven&#x27;t seen any growth results but it makes my hair very soft. I love it</li>
            <li> After using tons of different shampoos I van finally tell that I&#x27;m using the perfect one,  it got rid of my excess of grease in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product after reading all the good reviews but the product isn&#x27;t as described in the reviews, the texture is slimy and the smell is way to powerful, I am sure the product doesn&#x27;t work and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing! The orange and lemon citrus scent is wonderful first thing in the morning. It smells so good that I wish I had a body lotion with this scent. The shampoo is a pretty pearl color. It really lathers great. I leave it in for approx 3 to 5 minutes before rinsing out. Then I use the matching conditioner to finish. I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with alopecia and this brand has been wonderful on my hair. It not only helps with hair loss, but it leaves my hair silky soft. Most products dry out may hair leaving frizzy. I love that this product is 100% Sulfate &amp; Paraben free. It&#x27;s also made in the USA. I love that I got the opportunity to try this shampoo in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. My hair is thicker and full of body while leaving a super soft, silky look and feel. I am really impressed with this brand and I would definitely recommend this.</li>
