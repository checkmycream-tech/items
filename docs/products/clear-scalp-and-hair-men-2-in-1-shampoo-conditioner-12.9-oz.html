            <li>Awesome product.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Best anti-dandruff shampoo that Ive tried in my 30+ years on Earth.</li>
            <li>For its price, it is beyond great!  </li>
            <li>This item certainly isn&#x27;t best for everyone with a dandruff issue.</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil in it has a delightful effect I did not anticipate.</li>
            <li>I was not so impressed with the almost-waterlike viscosity of the shampoo/conditioner (if you hold your hand at a 30-degree angle</li>
            <li>but my son&#x27;s hair has become truly impressive with increased body</li>
            <li>Works perfect, my dandruff has started disappearing after two wash.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best anti-dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>and I am very happy with this!</li>
            <li>and it continues to work beautifully.</li>
            <li>get 2 just in case to keep your scalp happy.</li>
            <li>This works great and smells great.</li>
            <li>They all work great for two weeks</li>
            <li>zinc works great to control the mild-medium dandruff of the people in my family who have it.</li>
            <li>He likes it too, and says it works well and doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;mediciney.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Definitely, great men&#x27;s shampoo and very effective at controlling the flakes.</li>
            <li>The very nice lady on the phone explained that there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem because it didn&#x27;t look like the ingredients changed.</li>
            <li>I have tried many dikfferent shampoos in my lifetime, and I do find this line of products among the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>One of the best traits of this is that it smells great even though it delivers a strong punch to dandruff.  </li>
            <li>The scent is also quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li>(The smell for both is just pleasant and clean.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smells great and has a nice tingle.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I used to use Axe anti-dandruff 2 in 1.</li>
            <li>It made good suds</li>
            <li>Feels great and smells nice without losing any man points.</li>
            <li>It is a good product that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The smell seems to go away after I am done washing my hair which is a good thing since I don&#x27;t want my hair smelling sweet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good shampoo for the price.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I love it a lot!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please believe me when I tell you the results have been ASTONISHING!  </li>
            <li>It has a light aroma of tea-tree oil and mint and is a great every-day shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>It is an effective medicine for controlling dandruff.  </li>
            <li>son really liked the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and he really liked the smell which he thought was &#x27;manly but not stinky&#x27;.</li>
            <li>But he did say that it made him smell nice like his Uncle Marker).</li>
            <li>My haired had a nice aroma but the flakes were still there.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo i have used.c</li>
            <li>and it smells nice too.......much better than Head and Shoulders.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo rinsed out clean and it seems to do a good job controlling dandruff.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice and also fades very quickly</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>Somewhat minty and leaves your scalp with this refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>I purchase this product is not for myself, and it&#x27;s for my boyfriend because he hates to use too many bottles of hair products during the shower,</li>
            <li>If I went 36 hours or more, my hair got dandruff that stayed with me for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>This shampoo seems okay</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t find anything to like better than H &amp; S</li>
            <li>once rinsed, however, the scalp feels much better and does not itch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better.</li>
            <li>&quot; is good at stopping dandruff and does leave our hair looking and feeling clean, but it also has a fairly strong odor that tends to linger.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Head and Shoulder\\&quot; users and have been pleased with how well it works on dandruff, but it does not provide the body this shampoo and conditioner combo does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is another winner, 2 in 1, conditions hair nicely, keeps it flake free.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this 2 in 1.</li>
            <li>I liked that it suds well and washed out cleanly without a lot of whining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing pretty good.  </li>
            <li>As for the anti-dandruff claim, it seems true and the product smells nice.</li>
            <li>Its very good priced and overall product quality.</li>
            <li>I am happy using clear men scalp therapy products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, judging by the fact that most people haven&#x27;t found this to be \\&quot;proof of God&#x27;s existence\\&quot;, I&#x27;m going to guess that I have somewhat unique hair needs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, judging by the fact that most people haven&#x27;t found this to be \\&quot;proof of God&#x27;s existence\\&quot;, I&#x27;m going to guess that I have somewhat unique hair needs.</li>
            <li>Better than the original Head &amp; Shoulders.  </li>
            <li>It does not have a strong cooling/burning feel like the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This shampoo is most loved by my pre-teen son, who prior to this had been using a more kid like version of a 2-in-1 shampoo.</li>
            <li>Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner is a fine choice for men who need a dandruff shampoo that works.  </li>
            <li>It feels fine on my scalp.</li>
            <li>This 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner has a great fresh scent and washes hair well, leaving it soft, but not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I told her I&#x27;d already tried it, and though I liked it better than most of the alternatives, it wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li>product has kept me dandruff free for 6 weeks now and is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>, they actually took the time to make it have a great impact on your hair too; others seemed to strip hair and leave it dry/frizzy--</li>
            <li>They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far.</li>
            <li>I think this offers good value</li>
            <li>Clear Men Scalp Therapy is the most effective shampoo we&#x27;ve yet tried for him.</li>
            <li>recommend this product for men who have contact dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis, as it does exactly what it says it&#x27;ll do -- it leaves the scalp and hair in better condition, and it doesn&#x27;t itch.  </li>
            <li>After using it, my scalp feels clean.</li>
            <li>My hair is more soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>The bottle says it is for men, anti-dandruff, shampoo and conditioner, clean and refresh.</li>
            <li>It lathers up well and washes out cleanly.</li>
            <li>but we still haven&#x27;t found a way to get it to close all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner are not bad</li>
            <li>The smell is not overly powerful and my hair felt clean for over 24 hours.</li>
            <li>This product leaves hair smelling clean and scalp feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells clean and fresh (not fruity or perfumey)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It does not have a powerful smell, but does make me smell clean.  </li>
            <li>This product was great from the start and quickly got my dandruff under control with flakes becoming a thing of past within a week or two.  </li>
            <li>in all, for less than seven bucks, this does a decent job, even if it&#x27;s not the best option out there.</li>
            <li>It works better, smells better, and is a tiny fraction of the price of the dermatologist prescribed medicated shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Because this shampoo&#x27;s fragrance was so mild I can stand to be around my husband after he shampoos.</li>
            <li>This is a shampoo/conditioner that is going to be good for someone who doesn&#x27;t want their shampoo to dry out their hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>scalp and dry hair condition were both fairly improved by the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It smells less like soap/shampoo and more like cologne, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>This is nice because this makes the bottle last longer.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and feeling of my hair after i use Clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d demand a refund, but it&#x27;s hardly worth</li>
            <li>He likes this Clear Men Scalp Therapy quite a bit better, and has claimed the remainder of the bottle as his.</li>
            <li>It has a classy and sophisticated smell.  </li>
            <li>I am still an old guy, but my hair looks and feels better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite of the Clear for Men anti-dandruff scents, but it&#x27;s close.</li>
            <li>The shampoo comes out white and it lathers and foams nicely.  </li>
            <li>Works really well at controlling my husband&#x27;s flakies and smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>After a particularly grueling day of sitting on a lounge chair watching me mow and then weed the garden, he said he had to wash through twice to get to the point where his hair felt super clean.  </li>
            <li>A very guy friendly scent, not feminine.</li>
            <li>I like the ability to use a moderate amount to clean thoroughly and it does have a mild soolthing effect along with a pleasant enough odor.  </li>
            <li>It is priced about right for the quality.</li>
            <li>It lathers VERY well and leaves my hair clean feeling, even a day after.</li>
            <li>I really like this product great for on the go or traveling when you want to pack less stuff.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning hair and holding down dandruff.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was not like that at all.&lt;br /&gt;Removed all of his hair product residue from his hair and left his hair soft, shiny and very clean looking and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having had good results with the [[ASIN:B007RTR8UC CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care</li>
            <li>Before using Clear, my husband had one brand of anti-dandruff shampoo he was very loyal to</li>
            <li>The low price made me sceptical but so far I have had good results keeping my seborrhoeic dermatitus under control.</li>
            <li>One use with the shampoo, and his hair is soft, smells nice and no little flakes.</li>
            <li>It is good to use with this price, the flavor is a little strong, but it is no difference with other product, so I think it is OK.</li>
            <li>The shampoo/conditioner, comes in a 12.9 ounce bottle with convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that when the bottle starts to empty, it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily.</li>
            <li>The flakes are very much reduced when he&#x27;s been using this product.  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I have no affiliation or relationship of any kind with this product other than the fact that I use it.  </li>
            <li>This saves showering time and hot water.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and soft, so that&#x27;s about all I need.</li>
            <li>Note: If you plan on ordering this on Amazon, be aware that it may leak in transit-Mine</li>
            <li>The uniqueness of the bottle first struck me then as I read the ingredients I knew that I had to try it.</li>
            <li>Worked pretty well, still have dandruff</li>
            <li>First, a setup about me.</li>
            <li>have also tried the 2 in 1 Dry Scalp Hydration anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner  and the Strong and Full anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>The Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoo leaves my hair/scalp clean without drying it out and without smelling like medicine.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and clean, plus I like that the conditioner is included in the product since it saves a step.</li>
            <li>Clear leaves it silky and full.</li>
            <li>B007JT7AGC CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]], and does not smell as strong as [[ASIN:B007K449CE</li>
            <li>CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong &amp; Full, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]].  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been plagued with seborrheic dermatitus most of my latter adult life (am now 62), and mostly scalp and facial.  </li>
            <li>As I rinsed it out, my hair brushed and controlled easily without the need for conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean and not weighed down, but still easy to comb out after a shower</li>
            <li>In other words, the first couple times I used this product, I got more than I needed because I&#x27;m used to the set amount of H and S that I need.</li>
            <li>shampoo/conditioner itself is a milky cream which emerges readily from the container.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much problems with dandruff so much as sometimes just having an itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>The lather is very dense, and the shampoo cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really... Devastated.</li>
            <li>It is not sudsy at all but does cover the hair very well.  </li>
            <li>To be frank, I tried all 3 of the 2-in-1 shampoos and had a real problem telling any difference between them.  </li>
            <li>To be frank, I tried all 3 of the 2-in-1 shampoos and had a real problem telling any difference between them.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dandruff problems, so I can&#x27;t really speak to its effectiveness in that respect.</li>
            <li>The herbal essence, that my whole family uses...</li>
            <li>Bought this for my son and he wants me to never buy it again.</li>
            <li>If you suffer with this condition as I have, then you have absolutely nothing to lose, and everything to gain by using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My son said he didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between the shampoo  and the combined shampoo and conditioner that he tried.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in the effectiveness or look of my hair</li>
            <li>very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always shampoo twice, and I don&#x27;t use much either time.</li>
            <li>and I think a woman could use this as well and not have to worry about the scent being too much.</li>
            <li>None of these smells are really noticeable, although the scent of the shampoo is a clean fresh one.&lt;br /&gt;One strange thing about this particular bottle of shampoo</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, my bottles of [[ASIN:B000GCUTKI Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean 2 in 1 Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner with pump 33.8 Fluid ounce]], [[ASIN:B0009KN8UA Neutrogena Therapeutic Shampoo, Original Formula, 16 Fluid Ounce (473 ml)]], and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>He used his specialized equipment to clean deep inside my ears, and said they were full of junk to the point where it impaired the hearing in my left ear</li>
            <li>This lathers up nicely, requiring a small amount for a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried Head n&#x27; Shoulders before, and liked that \\&quot;cooling sensation\\&quot; type when it came out, but it always seemed that no company could quite get enough moisture into their formulas (even T-Gel &amp; Selson Blue); but Clear have managed to!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need a separate conditioner because this particular shampoo is a 2-in-1.  </li>
            <li>in all it is a decent product.</li>
            <li>I have constant mild dandruff and this shampoo kept it at bay as efficiently as Head and Shoulders, which is the brand I normally use.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>stars, highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barb Caffrey</li>
            <li>Not to mention the super fresh sent which engulfs the bathroom and the tingle that you feel down to the roots.</li>
            <li>I also happen to be one of those people who are very hygiene conscious about myself and my appearance INCLUDING in my ears.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s top heavy and one of the two bottles I received had leaked even though the lid was taped shut.  </li>
            <li>I buy more every few months so that I&#x27;ll always stay a couple years ahead.</li>
            <li>I buy more every few months so that I&#x27;ll always stay a couple years ahead.</li>
            <li>My husband loves these 2-in-1 products and this one performs as well as his normal anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Normally I would use Head and Shoulders, but I thought I would try a change in shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It has such a fresh scent, but in a manly way.</li>
            <li>Normally my husband uses whatever shampoo that is within reach while in the shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a quick buy due to the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I viewed this new product on Amazon and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>After about a month the dandruff started to return and that is when I made the decision to try out this new product.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of fancy bath and hair products and am always looking for new to add to the repertoire.</li>
            <li>like the Clear Men&#x27;s line and would say that this particular one is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>like the Clear Men&#x27;s line and would say that this particular one is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>The Clear cleared up my condition for me within a week!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because for the first 40+ years of life, I had to shampoo my hair every 24 or so hours religiously.</li>
            <li>It appears to be soothing to the scalp, but you might find you need to use more shampoo if you have excessively greasy</li>
            <li>I had been using Nizoral for my scalp condition previously, but the price had gotten too high and was no longer carried by most local stores.</li>
            <li>I normally like my shampoo and conditioner separate, but since I have short hair now, I don&#x27;t really mind using a 2 in 1.  </li>
            <li>This really works, when my son comb his hair they is no more snowing.it work from the first time.try it for yourself !!</li>
            <li>(I actually went straight to the shampoo aisle in every new supermarket/drug store I visited).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had medium to mild dandruff and did not like the chemically smell of some of the other dandruff shampoos out there.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the [[ASIN:B007JT7ARQ Clear Men</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice that with the Clear brand.  </li>
            <li>of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy feature</li>
            <li>Clear Men brings the advertised \\&quot;bio nutrium 10\\&quot;, a self-proclaimed blend that includes ginseng, tea tree, and mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2-in-1</li>
            <li>This is another in the Clear line of shampoos.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using CLEAR the rash is resolved and my skin as well as scalp feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Clear \\&quot;Men Scalp Therapy\\</li>
            <li>Well the Clear Men Scalp Therapy works just as well</li>
            <li>This 2in1 from Clear seems to work rather well.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use Clear products, and would recommend you try it as well.</li>
            <li>So, it was a natural to try the Clear Anti-Dandruff Shampoo/Conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that fully clears up my dandruff, but i feel like it stops working with as much efficacy after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I looked for old stock everywhere.</li>
            <li>And boy was I pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>my girlfriend says my hair actually feels much softer and nicer.</li>
            <li>Bought this on a whim because someone commented that this worked like the old Axe shampoo formula.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to smell like an old medicine cabinet after I shower.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old son has seborrheic dermatitus.</li>
            <li>I have been on a mission lately to try and eliminate some of the many products that we have to keep in the shower, so I thought I&#x27;d try this to see if I can share with my husband.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t anything hugely wrong with it (except the faulty cap) but there isn&#x27;t anything good about it either.</li>
            <li>the plus side, I like the nice, thick lather this works up, and it does a pretty good job cleaning up even filthy hair</li>
            <li>shampoo color is white (not blue like H&amp;S), and is a little bit more runny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be more pleasantly thick than some 2-in-1 dandruff shampoos, which are very thin and kind of get all over the place as you squeeze them out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair tends to curl, especially in the rain-forest environment where I live.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself seems to be made so that you can leave it &#x60;upside down&#x27; in your shower so that it will dispense right away, but it leaks/</li>
            <li>I previously used Head and Shoulders and with-in the first two days my dandruff was suppressed and completely gone.</li>
            <li>Scent is the same as the other variety I tried - basically, a fresh apple sort of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband has a moderate to severe dandruff problem, and since he&#x27;s been using Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2 in 1, I haven&#x27;t noticed those telltale flakes on his shoulders or on the sofa upholstery where his head has rested.</li>
            <li>But she recommended the Clear brand because it was made by the same company.</li>
            <li>I realized that the Clear shampoo I tried was only shampoo and not the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have recently had the opportunity to try all 5 of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy varieties.  </li>
            <li>should mention I stopped using Head and Shoulders prior to ever using Clear Men Scalp Therapy.</li>
            <li>problem with the entire Clear brand lies in 2 factors.</li>
            <li>After receiving 4 bottles of Clear Scalp shampoo/conditioner, 2 our of the 4 bottles had leaked just a tiny bit during transport.</li>
            <li>This is the third of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy products that I have tried.</li>
            <li>and then the dandruff comes back and the product doesn&#x27;t clear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it does anything, it&#x27;s barely perceptible to me.  </li>
            <li>So, I continued trying different shampoos and continued hoping to find a stash of old stock somewhere</li>
            <li>The back also states that there is ginseng, tea tree and natural mint.</li>
            <li>I tried the Neutrogena T-Gel and T-Sal for several weeks with modest results.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much more to say about it other than it works just fine!</li>
            <li>Needless to say it&#x27;s been a huge lifesaver as dandruff is a pretty embarassing social problem.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a whole lot of difference between them other than</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft, but not lifeless or flat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also recently started trying to only wash every other day when possible (using Suave dry shampoo on the days off), and this works fine with that routine -</li>
            <li>During the entire month I only used Clear Men&#x27;s Scalp Therapy.</li>
            <li>While the conditioning was decent for me, my standards are pretty low, and I ended up using the above-mentioned conditioner a few times after this product so my hair doesn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li>No other dandruff treatment products or shampoos were used in order to prevent the issue of causing a potential interference of different products.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I would have is that the bottle is top heavy and seems to want to always fall over, but other than that it does what it is suppose to at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Pyrithione Zinc, the same active ingredient as the classic Head and Shoulders.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Best anti-dandruff shampoo that Ive tried in my 30+ years on Earth.</li>
            <li> For its price, it is beyond great!  </li>
            <li> This item certainly isn&#x27;t best for everyone with a dandruff issue.</li>
            <li> Great!</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil in it has a delightful effect I did not anticipate.</li>
            <li> I was not so impressed with the almost-waterlike viscosity of the shampoo/conditioner (if you hold your hand at a 30-degree angle</li>
            <li> but my son&#x27;s hair has become truly impressive with increased body</li>
            <li> Works perfect, my dandruff has started disappearing after two wash.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best anti-dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> and I am very happy with this!</li>
            <li> and it continues to work beautifully.</li>
            <li> get 2 just in case to keep your scalp happy.</li>
            <li> This works great and smells great.</li>
            <li> They all work great for two weeks</li>
            <li> zinc works great to control the mild-medium dandruff of the people in my family who have it.</li>
            <li> He likes it too, and says it works well and doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;mediciney.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Definitely, great men&#x27;s shampoo and very effective at controlling the flakes.</li>
            <li> The very nice lady on the phone explained that there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem because it didn&#x27;t look like the ingredients changed.</li>
            <li> I have tried many dikfferent shampoos in my lifetime, and I do find this line of products among the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> One of the best traits of this is that it smells great even though it delivers a strong punch to dandruff.  </li>
            <li> The scent is also quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li> (The smell for both is just pleasant and clean.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Smells great and has a nice tingle.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I used to use Axe anti-dandruff 2 in 1.</li>
            <li> It made good suds</li>
            <li> Feels great and smells nice without losing any man points.</li>
            <li> It is a good product that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The smell seems to go away after I am done washing my hair which is a good thing since I don&#x27;t want my hair smelling sweet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good shampoo for the price.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I love it a lot!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please believe me when I tell you the results have been ASTONISHING!  </li>
            <li> It has a light aroma of tea-tree oil and mint and is a great every-day shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was amazing.</li>
            <li> It is an effective medicine for controlling dandruff.  </li>
            <li> son really liked the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and he really liked the smell which he thought was &#x27;manly but not stinky&#x27;.</li>
            <li> But he did say that it made him smell nice like his Uncle Marker).</li>
            <li> My haired had a nice aroma but the flakes were still there.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo i have used.c</li>
            <li> and it smells nice too.......much better than Head and Shoulders.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo rinsed out clean and it seems to do a good job controlling dandruff.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice and also fades very quickly</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and rinses easily.</li>
            <li> Somewhat minty and leaves your scalp with this refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product is not for myself, and it&#x27;s for my boyfriend because he hates to use too many bottles of hair products during the shower,</li>
            <li> If I went 36 hours or more, my hair got dandruff that stayed with me for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems okay</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t find anything to like better than H &amp; S</li>
            <li> once rinsed, however, the scalp feels much better and does not itch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better.</li>
            <li> &quot; is good at stopping dandruff and does leave our hair looking and feeling clean, but it also has a fairly strong odor that tends to linger.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Head and Shoulder\\&quot; users and have been pleased with how well it works on dandruff, but it does not provide the body this shampoo and conditioner combo does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad I did.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is another winner, 2 in 1, conditions hair nicely, keeps it flake free.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this 2 in 1.</li>
            <li> I liked that it suds well and washed out cleanly without a lot of whining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing pretty good.  </li>
            <li> As for the anti-dandruff claim, it seems true and the product smells nice.</li>
            <li> Its very good priced and overall product quality.</li>
            <li> I am happy using clear men scalp therapy products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, judging by the fact that most people haven&#x27;t found this to be \\&quot;proof of God&#x27;s existence\\&quot;, I&#x27;m going to guess that I have somewhat unique hair needs.</li>

            <li> Better than the original Head &amp; Shoulders.  </li>
            <li> It does not have a strong cooling/burning feel like the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This shampoo is most loved by my pre-teen son, who prior to this had been using a more kid like version of a 2-in-1 shampoo.</li>
            <li> Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner is a fine choice for men who need a dandruff shampoo that works.  </li>
            <li> It feels fine on my scalp.</li>
            <li> This 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner has a great fresh scent and washes hair well, leaving it soft, but not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I told her I&#x27;d already tried it, and though I liked it better than most of the alternatives, it wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> product has kept me dandruff free for 6 weeks now and is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> , they actually took the time to make it have a great impact on your hair too; others seemed to strip hair and leave it dry/frizzy--</li>
            <li> They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far.</li>
            <li> I think this offers good value</li>
            <li> Clear Men Scalp Therapy is the most effective shampoo we&#x27;ve yet tried for him.</li>
            <li> recommend this product for men who have contact dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis, as it does exactly what it says it&#x27;ll do -- it leaves the scalp and hair in better condition, and it doesn&#x27;t itch.  </li>
            <li> After using it, my scalp feels clean.</li>
            <li> My hair is more soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> The bottle says it is for men, anti-dandruff, shampoo and conditioner, clean and refresh.</li>
            <li> It lathers up well and washes out cleanly.</li>
            <li> but we still haven&#x27;t found a way to get it to close all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner are not bad</li>
            <li> The smell is not overly powerful and my hair felt clean for over 24 hours.</li>
            <li> This product leaves hair smelling clean and scalp feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells clean and fresh (not fruity or perfumey)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It does not have a powerful smell, but does make me smell clean.  </li>
            <li> This product was great from the start and quickly got my dandruff under control with flakes becoming a thing of past within a week or two.  </li>
            <li> in all, for less than seven bucks, this does a decent job, even if it&#x27;s not the best option out there.</li>
            <li> It works better, smells better, and is a tiny fraction of the price of the dermatologist prescribed medicated shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Because this shampoo&#x27;s fragrance was so mild I can stand to be around my husband after he shampoos.</li>
            <li> This is a shampoo/conditioner that is going to be good for someone who doesn&#x27;t want their shampoo to dry out their hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> scalp and dry hair condition were both fairly improved by the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It smells less like soap/shampoo and more like cologne, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> This is nice because this makes the bottle last longer.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feeling of my hair after i use Clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d demand a refund, but it&#x27;s hardly worth</li>
            <li> He likes this Clear Men Scalp Therapy quite a bit better, and has claimed the remainder of the bottle as his.</li>
            <li> It has a classy and sophisticated smell.  </li>
            <li> I am still an old guy, but my hair looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite of the Clear for Men anti-dandruff scents, but it&#x27;s close.</li>
            <li> The shampoo comes out white and it lathers and foams nicely.  </li>
            <li> Works really well at controlling my husband&#x27;s flakies and smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> After a particularly grueling day of sitting on a lounge chair watching me mow and then weed the garden, he said he had to wash through twice to get to the point where his hair felt super clean.  </li>
            <li> A very guy friendly scent, not feminine.</li>
            <li> I like the ability to use a moderate amount to clean thoroughly and it does have a mild soolthing effect along with a pleasant enough odor.  </li>
            <li> It is priced about right for the quality.</li>
            <li> It lathers VERY well and leaves my hair clean feeling, even a day after.</li>
            <li> I really like this product great for on the go or traveling when you want to pack less stuff.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning hair and holding down dandruff.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was not like that at all.&lt;br /&gt;Removed all of his hair product residue from his hair and left his hair soft, shiny and very clean looking and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having had good results with the [[ASIN:B007RTR8UC CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care</li>
            <li> Before using Clear, my husband had one brand of anti-dandruff shampoo he was very loyal to</li>
            <li> The low price made me sceptical but so far I have had good results keeping my seborrhoeic dermatitus under control.</li>
            <li> One use with the shampoo, and his hair is soft, smells nice and no little flakes.</li>
            <li> It is good to use with this price, the flavor is a little strong, but it is no difference with other product, so I think it is OK.</li>
            <li> The shampoo/conditioner, comes in a 12.9 ounce bottle with convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that when the bottle starts to empty, it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily.</li>
            <li> The flakes are very much reduced when he&#x27;s been using this product.  </li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I have no affiliation or relationship of any kind with this product other than the fact that I use it.  </li>
            <li> This saves showering time and hot water.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and soft, so that&#x27;s about all I need.</li>
            <li> Note: If you plan on ordering this on Amazon, be aware that it may leak in transit-Mine</li>
            <li> The uniqueness of the bottle first struck me then as I read the ingredients I knew that I had to try it.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well, still have dandruff</li>
            <li> First, a setup about me.</li>
            <li> have also tried the 2 in 1 Dry Scalp Hydration anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner  and the Strong and Full anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> The Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoo leaves my hair/scalp clean without drying it out and without smelling like medicine.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and clean, plus I like that the conditioner is included in the product since it saves a step.</li>
            <li> Clear leaves it silky and full.</li>
            <li> B007JT7AGC CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]], and does not smell as strong as [[ASIN:B007K449CE</li>
            <li> CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong &amp; Full, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]].  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been plagued with seborrheic dermatitus most of my latter adult life (am now 62), and mostly scalp and facial.  </li>
            <li> As I rinsed it out, my hair brushed and controlled easily without the need for conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean and not weighed down, but still easy to comb out after a shower</li>
            <li> In other words, the first couple times I used this product, I got more than I needed because I&#x27;m used to the set amount of H and S that I need.</li>
            <li> shampoo/conditioner itself is a milky cream which emerges readily from the container.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much problems with dandruff so much as sometimes just having an itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> The lather is very dense, and the shampoo cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really... Devastated.</li>
            <li> It is not sudsy at all but does cover the hair very well.  </li>
            <li> To be frank, I tried all 3 of the 2-in-1 shampoos and had a real problem telling any difference between them.  </li>
            <li> To be frank, I tried all 3 of the 2-in-1 shampoos and had a real problem telling any difference between them.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff problems, so I can&#x27;t really speak to its effectiveness in that respect.</li>
            <li> The herbal essence, that my whole family uses...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son and he wants me to never buy it again.</li>
            <li> If you suffer with this condition as I have, then you have absolutely nothing to lose, and everything to gain by using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My son said he didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between the shampoo  and the combined shampoo and conditioner that he tried.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in the effectiveness or look of my hair</li>
            <li> very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always shampoo twice, and I don&#x27;t use much either time.</li>
            <li> and I think a woman could use this as well and not have to worry about the scent being too much.</li>
            <li> None of these smells are really noticeable, although the scent of the shampoo is a clean fresh one.&lt;br /&gt;One strange thing about this particular bottle of shampoo</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, my bottles of [[ASIN:B000GCUTKI Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean 2 in 1 Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner with pump 33.8 Fluid ounce]], [[ASIN:B0009KN8UA Neutrogena Therapeutic Shampoo, Original Formula, 16 Fluid Ounce (473 ml)]], and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> He used his specialized equipment to clean deep inside my ears, and said they were full of junk to the point where it impaired the hearing in my left ear</li>
            <li> This lathers up nicely, requiring a small amount for a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried Head n&#x27; Shoulders before, and liked that \\&quot;cooling sensation\\&quot; type when it came out, but it always seemed that no company could quite get enough moisture into their formulas (even T-Gel &amp; Selson Blue); but Clear have managed to!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a separate conditioner because this particular shampoo is a 2-in-1.  </li>
            <li> in all it is a decent product.</li>
            <li> I have constant mild dandruff and this shampoo kept it at bay as efficiently as Head and Shoulders, which is the brand I normally use.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> stars, highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barb Caffrey</li>
            <li> Not to mention the super fresh sent which engulfs the bathroom and the tingle that you feel down to the roots.</li>
            <li> I also happen to be one of those people who are very hygiene conscious about myself and my appearance INCLUDING in my ears.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s top heavy and one of the two bottles I received had leaked even though the lid was taped shut.  </li>
            <li> I buy more every few months so that I&#x27;ll always stay a couple years ahead.</li>
            <li> I buy more every few months so that I&#x27;ll always stay a couple years ahead.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these 2-in-1 products and this one performs as well as his normal anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Normally I would use Head and Shoulders, but I thought I would try a change in shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It has such a fresh scent, but in a manly way.</li>
            <li> Normally my husband uses whatever shampoo that is within reach while in the shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a quick buy due to the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I viewed this new product on Amazon and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> After about a month the dandruff started to return and that is when I made the decision to try out this new product.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of fancy bath and hair products and am always looking for new to add to the repertoire.</li>
            <li> like the Clear Men&#x27;s line and would say that this particular one is one of my favorites.  </li>

            <li> The Clear cleared up my condition for me within a week!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because for the first 40+ years of life, I had to shampoo my hair every 24 or so hours religiously.</li>
            <li> It appears to be soothing to the scalp, but you might find you need to use more shampoo if you have excessively greasy</li>
            <li> I had been using Nizoral for my scalp condition previously, but the price had gotten too high and was no longer carried by most local stores.</li>
            <li> I normally like my shampoo and conditioner separate, but since I have short hair now, I don&#x27;t really mind using a 2 in 1.  </li>
            <li> This really works, when my son comb his hair they is no more snowing.it work from the first time.try it for yourself !!</li>
            <li> (I actually went straight to the shampoo aisle in every new supermarket/drug store I visited).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had medium to mild dandruff and did not like the chemically smell of some of the other dandruff shampoos out there.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the [[ASIN:B007JT7ARQ Clear Men</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice that with the Clear brand.  </li>
            <li> of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy feature</li>
            <li> Clear Men brings the advertised \\&quot;bio nutrium 10\\&quot;, a self-proclaimed blend that includes ginseng, tea tree, and mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2-in-1</li>
            <li> This is another in the Clear line of shampoos.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using CLEAR the rash is resolved and my skin as well as scalp feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Clear \\&quot;Men Scalp Therapy\\</li>
            <li> Well the Clear Men Scalp Therapy works just as well</li>
            <li> This 2in1 from Clear seems to work rather well.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use Clear products, and would recommend you try it as well.</li>
            <li> So, it was a natural to try the Clear Anti-Dandruff Shampoo/Conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that fully clears up my dandruff, but i feel like it stops working with as much efficacy after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I looked for old stock everywhere.</li>
            <li> And boy was I pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend says my hair actually feels much softer and nicer.</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim because someone commented that this worked like the old Axe shampoo formula.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to smell like an old medicine cabinet after I shower.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old son has seborrheic dermatitus.</li>
            <li> I have been on a mission lately to try and eliminate some of the many products that we have to keep in the shower, so I thought I&#x27;d try this to see if I can share with my husband.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything hugely wrong with it (except the faulty cap) but there isn&#x27;t anything good about it either.</li>
            <li> the plus side, I like the nice, thick lather this works up, and it does a pretty good job cleaning up even filthy hair</li>
            <li> shampoo color is white (not blue like H&amp;S), and is a little bit more runny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be more pleasantly thick than some 2-in-1 dandruff shampoos, which are very thin and kind of get all over the place as you squeeze them out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair tends to curl, especially in the rain-forest environment where I live.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself seems to be made so that you can leave it &#x60;upside down&#x27; in your shower so that it will dispense right away, but it leaks/</li>
            <li> I previously used Head and Shoulders and with-in the first two days my dandruff was suppressed and completely gone.</li>
            <li> Scent is the same as the other variety I tried - basically, a fresh apple sort of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband has a moderate to severe dandruff problem, and since he&#x27;s been using Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2 in 1, I haven&#x27;t noticed those telltale flakes on his shoulders or on the sofa upholstery where his head has rested.</li>
            <li> But she recommended the Clear brand because it was made by the same company.</li>
            <li> I realized that the Clear shampoo I tried was only shampoo and not the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have recently had the opportunity to try all 5 of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy varieties.  </li>
            <li> should mention I stopped using Head and Shoulders prior to ever using Clear Men Scalp Therapy.</li>
            <li> problem with the entire Clear brand lies in 2 factors.</li>
            <li> After receiving 4 bottles of Clear Scalp shampoo/conditioner, 2 our of the 4 bottles had leaked just a tiny bit during transport.</li>
            <li> This is the third of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> and then the dandruff comes back and the product doesn&#x27;t clear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it does anything, it&#x27;s barely perceptible to me.  </li>
            <li> So, I continued trying different shampoos and continued hoping to find a stash of old stock somewhere</li>
            <li> The back also states that there is ginseng, tea tree and natural mint.</li>
            <li> I tried the Neutrogena T-Gel and T-Sal for several weeks with modest results.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much more to say about it other than it works just fine!</li>
            <li> Needless to say it&#x27;s been a huge lifesaver as dandruff is a pretty embarassing social problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a whole lot of difference between them other than</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft, but not lifeless or flat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also recently started trying to only wash every other day when possible (using Suave dry shampoo on the days off), and this works fine with that routine -</li>
            <li> During the entire month I only used Clear Men&#x27;s Scalp Therapy.</li>
            <li> While the conditioning was decent for me, my standards are pretty low, and I ended up using the above-mentioned conditioner a few times after this product so my hair doesn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> No other dandruff treatment products or shampoos were used in order to prevent the issue of causing a potential interference of different products.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I would have is that the bottle is top heavy and seems to want to always fall over, but other than that it does what it is suppose to at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Pyrithione Zinc, the same active ingredient as the classic Head and Shoulders.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo seems  be a general anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner rather than one geared toward dry or oily hair or scalps.</li>
            <li> A little high price for feeling like the Mal-Mart brand.  </li>
            <li> This is more or less the same comment he&#x27;s been making about every other shampoo that he&#x27;s tried lately:  Pantene, Aussie, and Suave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Any odor is not apparent to me.</li>
            <li> hair is buzz cut short and my son&#x27;s is over shoulder length long</li>
            <li> I just flat out like it.  </li>
            <li> particular variety is supposed to \\&quot;Refres\\&quot;, which I&#x27;m guessing is why the ingredients include menthol and one other incredient not found in some of the other variations.  </li>
            <li> From my point of the view the bonus is how both the men&#x27;s and the women&#x27;s Clear shampoos hold down the overpowering odor some health and beauty aids dump in their products because of fragrance allergies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male in his mid-20s, with hair that tends to the dry side and varies between 3/4\\&quot; and 2\\&quot; between haircuts.  </li>
            <li> I have relatively short hair (sometimes no hair), but my scalp gets itchy and dry.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy, but I now use it almost like a body wash on other areas where I&#x27;ve experienced flare ups in the past...</li>
            <li> Flake visibly reduced (if not zeroed), as long as I rinse well.</li>
            <li> Because the shelf life is about that long.</li>
            <li> Because the shelf life is about that long.</li>
            <li> (Pity this maker hasn&#x27;t yet put out a similar product for women as of yet.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a hair product wo well for so long.</li>
            <li> We are long time</li>
            <li> have long (well below my shoulders)</li>
            <li> son doesn&#x27;t have a dandruff problem, but both he and my husband, who occasionally has some flakes, were both suffering from itchy scalps due to all the swimming they&#x27;ve been doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This formulation advertises it is \\&quot;Dry Scalp Hydration\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the dry winter air</li>
            <li> I had a dry, flaky and peeling scalp.</li>
            <li> All use the same active ingredient, Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), to treat the dandruff.</li>
            <li> It also has the same active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I fail to see anything special about this product</li>
            <li> This seemed like a normal thick type shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like eczema on the scalp, with thick flakes well beyond normal dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the term loosely - will pour out of your hand).</li>
            <li> The only down side is that we don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> is especially since it says it has conditioner in it - it did not seem as thick as the other varieties of the Clear line that I have used.</li>
            <li> The other is that this seems a bit pricey for doing the same job that other shampoos do.</li>
            <li> , I currently keep about 2 year&#x27;s stock on hand - just in case they decide to mess with the formula.</li>
            <li> You might just end up having to fight me for the last bottle.t 2 year&#x27;s stock on hand - just in case they decide to mess with the formula.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need to use a little of this product to get your hair covered in soap.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, he also commented that he didn&#x27;t  think it cleaned to his complete satisfaction: at least not for Summer.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is well geared toward men - not much scent, lathers well, and works.  </li>
            <li> happened to be in the drug store a few months back and came across this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard before that adding conditioner to shampoo does not really work because the shampoo just washes it out.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;anti-dandruff\\&quot; on a product which doesn&#x27;t even remotely begin to do anything to fight dandruff.</li>
            <li> also tried another variety of this brand - just because I was curious of the difference between that and this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other anti dandruff shampoos like Head and Shoulders / Neutrogena T-Gel with moderate results that eventually wore off.</li>
            <li> Those of you with this affliction will understand these symptons; over production of sebum that cause irritation and flakiness across the eyebrows, nose, in the ears, behind the ears, and facial irritation in general, and yes, including the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried a couple of their other formulations, but they don&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself has a heavy scent to it while you are applying it, but does not remain long after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> It is thicker than Head and Shoulders, so I only had to use a small amount (about the size of a dime-</li>
            <li> Besides a comb, shampoo, and conditioner, I don&#x27;t use any other hair care</li>
            <li> have been using for the past several years.</li>
            <li> First of all, something is wrong with the lid, which prevents it from closing all the way.</li>
            <li> we stand it upside down on its wide lid and it has never leaked once.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s the active ingredient that I look for in anti-dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the bottle -</li>
            <li> No longer works well (just average).</li>
            <li> It also seems to help cut down on the psoriasis my son has on his scalp.</li>
            <li> This product contains ginseng, mint, and tea tree oil along with its active ingredient, pyrithione zinc, which means it may sting a little bit until it&#x27;s rinsed off</li>
            <li> Clears up dandruff&lt;br /&gt;Calms previously irritated scalp&lt;br</li>
            <li> did leak a little bit, it was wrapped in a plastic bag</li>
            <li> I could go on and on about this little bottle of heaven.</li>
            <li> After two days of using Clear Men&#x27;s Scalp Therapy it failed to have any effect on my scalp.</li>
            <li> It is only slightly irritating if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> This will be my everyday go to shampoo from here on out.</li>
            <li> (He used it by himself, and I washed his hair a few times myself to see what it was like.)  </li>
            <li> I never have to waste time going to Walmart again, just because I ran out of shampoo.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t get all over the box/other items, but it was still messy and needed some rinsing off when I took it out of the box.</li>
            <li> I had flakes, used this product for several weeks, and it just seemed to get worse, until I quit using it.</li>
            <li> The bottle ended up looking messy and being slippery to the touch.</li>
            <li> I continued using it for the entire month and unfortunately there has been no positive results.</li>
            <li> I can wear black shirts again!</li>
            <li> Makes his hair stiff and tangled.</li>
            <li> No other shampoo have ever given faster and wanted results, not even the expensive ones like Kerium.</li>
            <li> have excema (sp?), a dry skin condition, and am pre-diabetic, which makes my skin dryness even worse.</li>
            <li> thick, slightly wavy hair</li>
            <li> I usually use Suave&#x27;s 2-in-1</li>
            <li> I developed a scalp itch and it was driving me crazy.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry out or damage as bad as other anti-dandruff products.</li>
            <li> He has poor vision and hadn&#x27;t noticed the flakes over the past few years, but they were there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always tried to use some dandruff shampoo at least a couple times per week because it seems to help.  </li>
            <li> So, here is my story that I hope will help at least some of you..</li>
            <li> However, on applying it to my hair I found it was thick and felt almost like conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Wow, was I disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist prescribed a very expensive shampoo that came in a tiny bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used several different shampoos and while they all worked decently, I really hate the smell!</li>
            <li> I have annoying and frequently recurring dandruff.</li>
            <li> (some 2-in-1s make detangling tough).</li>
            <li> It leaves a terrible residue no matter how much you resinse.</li>
            <li> Problem is you should NOT use this on your face as it thin outs the skin where ever you use it.  </li>
            <li> seriously, this is a miracle!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little annoying to see the words</li>
            <li> I used it for about 2 years after randomly finding it on one of my travels.</li>
            <li> (I tested this myself, even though the scent is all wrong for a woman);</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it but the price.</li>
            <li> Crazy?</li>
            <li> Crazy?</li>
            <li> I have bad dandruff.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> the only shampoo over-the-counter product i&#x27;ve ever used that helped with itchy scalp and flaking. seriously, this is a miracle! get 2 just in case to keep your scalp happy.</li>
            <li> I have been using the [[ASIN:B007JT7ARQ Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo]] for several months. So, it was a natural to try the Clear Anti-Dandruff Shampoo/Conditioner. The shampoo/conditioner, comes in a 12.9 ounce bottle with convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that when the bottle starts to empty, it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily. The ingredients include: ginseng, mint, and tea tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo/conditioner itself is a milky cream which emerges readily from the container. It is not oily or greasy and appears not to leave residues. Any odor is not apparent to me. After using it, my scalp feels clean. My hair tends to curl, especially in the rain-forest environment where I live. However, this shampoo/conditioner seems to flatten my curls. You may or may not like that effect.  It is only slightly irritating if you get it in your eyes. Maybe this is caused by the mint. The big advantage is that instead of using a separate shampoo and a separate conditioner, you can do everything on one step. This saves showering time and hot water. Altogether, I like this shampoo/conditioner and plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. My hair is more soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have ever used! It is the only shampoo + conditioner that hasn&#x27;t given me dandruff!</li>
            <li> Somewhat minty and leaves your scalp with this refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> This really works, when my son comb his hair they is no more snowing.it work from the first time.try it for yourself !!</li>
            <li> I really like this product great for on the go or traveling when you want to pack less stuff. Smells great and has a nice tingle. It says for &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; but anyone can use it.</li>
            <li> I have constant mild dandruff and this shampoo kept it at bay as efficiently as Head and Shoulders, which is the brand I normally use. This lathers up nicely, requiring a small amount for a lot of hair. In other words, the first couple times I used this product, I got more than I needed because I&#x27;m used to the set amount of H and S that I need. This is nice because this makes the bottle last longer. The smell is not overly powerful and my hair felt clean for over 24 hours. I would purchase this item for continual dandruff control and I like how it cleans my hair as well. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much problems with dandruff so much as sometimes just having an itchy scalp.  I&#x27;ve always tried to use some dandruff shampoo at least a couple times per week because it seems to help.  This shampoo is well geared toward men - not much scent, lathers well, and works.  The lather is very dense, and the shampoo cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular variety is supposed to \\&quot;Refres\\&quot;, which I&#x27;m guessing is why the ingredients include menthol and one other incredient not found in some of the other variations.  Some shampoos with menthol have set my head tingling immediately - I don&#x27;t notice that with the Clear brand.  If it does anything, it&#x27;s barely perceptible to me.  Scent is the same as the other variety I tried - basically, a fresh apple sort of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the bottle - it&#x27;s top heavy and one of the two bottles I received had leaked even though the lid was taped shut.  Therefore, I wouldn&#x27;t throw this in a suitcase or gym bag.</li>
            <li> My husband has a moderate to severe dandruff problem, and since he&#x27;s been using Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2 in 1, I haven&#x27;t noticed those telltale flakes on his shoulders or on the sofa upholstery where his head has rested. I like it! He likes it too, and says it works well and doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;mediciney.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Definitely, great men&#x27;s shampoo and very effective at controlling the flakes.</li>
            <li> This is the shampoo I was looking for and it delivered.  I had medium to mild dandruff and did not like the chemically smell of some of the other dandruff shampoos out there.  This product was great from the start and quickly got my dandruff under control with flakes becoming a thing of past within a week or two.  One of the best traits of this is that it smells great even though it delivers a strong punch to dandruff.  This will be my everyday go to shampoo from here on out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other anti dandruff shampoos like Head and Shoulders / Neutrogena T-Gel with moderate results that eventually wore off. Once I began to use this brand the flakes stayed away and have yet to come back. Needless to say it&#x27;s been a huge lifesaver as dandruff is a pretty embarassing social problem. I can wear black shirts again!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I like it very much. Its very good priced and overall product quality.</li>
            <li> It is good to use with this price, the flavor is a little strong, but it is no difference with other product, so I think it is OK.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product is not for myself, and it&#x27;s for my boyfriend because he hates to use too many bottles of hair products during the shower,</li>
            <li> Works really well at controlling my husband&#x27;s flakies and smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feeling of my hair after i use Clear. I use to use head and shoulders and noticed i would have flakes. This is by far the best shampoo i have used.c</li>
            <li> Best anti-dandruff shampoo that Ive tried in my 30+ years on Earth. Flake visibly reduced (if not zeroed), as long as I rinse well. The conditioner component also is not the type that makes hair to bouncy and flying away all over (the state that when you, you will want to grab a hair gel). I like the firmer look on my hair, which all men should aim for, after washing,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that fully clears up my dandruff, but i feel like it stops working with as much efficacy after 2 weeks. This is why I switch between it and Head and Shoulders every couple of days; this combo seems to be the panacea for my dandruff and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> For its price, it is beyond great!  I love it a lot!</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;They changed the formula. No longer works well (just average). They did the same thing to the Axe shampoo (same manufacturer). Once I found out this worked well, I ordered 4 bottles just in case they decided to change this shampoo too. All four arrived with the \\&quot;new\\&quot; hydrating formula that leaves my hair greasy after 24 hours. I&#x27;d demand a refund, but it&#x27;s hardly worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;This has literally changed my life. To be fair, I used to use Axe anti-dandruff 2 in 1. It was the \\&quot;life changer\\&quot;. Then they changed the formula. I was devastated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No. Really... Devastated. Not exaggerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because for the first 40+ years of life, I had to shampoo my hair every 24 or so hours religiously. If I went 36 hours or more, my hair got dandruff that stayed with me for about 2 weeks. The Axe shampoo changed that. I used it for about 2 years after randomly finding it on one of my travels. Then they changed the formula and it stopped working. I looked for old stock everywhere. I tried a bunch of alternatives. Nothing worked. Then I called the company that makes Axe shampoos. The very nice lady on the phone explained that there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem because it didn&#x27;t look like the ingredients changed. But she recommended the Clear brand because it was made by the same company. I told her I&#x27;d already tried it, and though I liked it better than most of the alternatives, it wasn&#x27;t the same. So, I continued trying different shampoos and continued hoping to find a stash of old stock somewhere (I actually went straight to the shampoo aisle in every new supermarket/drug store I visited).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I realized that the Clear shampoo I tried was only shampoo and not the shampoo and conditioner. So I picked up a bottle of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out it&#x27;s about the same as the Axe that I had been using before. I&#x27;ve also tried a couple of their other formulations, but they don&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I currently keep about 2 year&#x27;s stock on hand - just in case they decide to mess with the formula. Why only 2 years? Because the shelf life is about that long. I buy more every few months so that I&#x27;ll always stay a couple years ahead. Crazy? Have I mentioned that this has CHANGED MY LIFE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, judging by the fact that most people haven&#x27;t found this to be \\&quot;proof of God&#x27;s existence\\&quot;, I&#x27;m going to guess that I have somewhat unique hair needs. But for those of you with chronic dandruff who haven&#x27;t found anything else that works, give this a try. You might just end up having to fight me for the last bottle.t 2 year&#x27;s stock on hand - just in case they decide to mess with the formula. Why only 2 years?

            <li> This product leaves hair smelling clean and scalp feeling fresh. Does not dry out or damage as bad as other anti-dandruff products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head &amp; Shoulders for forty years and every once in a while I try something different. This shampoo seems okay but I couldn&#x27;t find anything to like better than H &amp; S so I won&#x27;t be buying this one, again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does what it is suppose to, I did have a reduction in dandruff.  The shampoo itself has a heavy scent to it while you are applying it, but does not remain long after rinsing.  The only complaint I would have is that the bottle is top heavy and seems to want to always fall over, but other than that it does what it is suppose to at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have recently had the opportunity to try all 5 of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy varieties.  I had all 5 bottles lines up in my shower, but of course, I couldn&#x27;t try them all at once because some of the performance is based on cleaning ability, feel of hair afterwards, and lingering smell.  So over the course of a week, I tried each shampoo to rate them.  Meanwhile, my bottles of [[ASIN:B000GCUTKI Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean 2 in 1 Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner with pump 33.8 Fluid ounce]], [[ASIN:B0009KN8UA Neutrogena Therapeutic Shampoo, Original Formula, 16 Fluid Ounce (473 ml)]], and [[ASIN:B0043OYFJQ Head &amp; Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care with Eucalyptus Dandruff Shampoo 14.2 Fluid ounce (Pack of 2)]] watched in fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy feature Pyrithione Zinc, the same active ingredient as the classic Head and Shoulders.  It is an effective medicine for controlling dandruff.  Clear Men brings the advertised \\&quot;bio nutrium 10\\&quot;, a self-proclaimed blend that includes ginseng, tea tree, and mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo color is white (not blue like H&amp;S), and is a little bit more runny.  However, on applying it to my hair I found it was thick and felt almost like conditioner.  It is not sudsy at all but does cover the hair very well.  This formulation advertises it is \\&quot;Dry Scalp Hydration\\&quot;.  It does not have a strong cooling/burning feel like the [[ASIN:B007JT7AGC CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]], and does not smell as strong as [[ASIN:B007K449CE CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong &amp; Full, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]].  It has a light aroma of tea-tree oil and mint and is a great every-day shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo rinsed out clean and it seems to do a good job controlling dandruff.  There was no real lasting smell or feel to it.  I didn&#x27;t need a separate conditioner because this particular shampoo is a 2-in-1.  As I rinsed it out, my hair brushed and controlled easily without the need for conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Clear Men&#x27;s line and would say that this particular one is one of my favorites.  To be frank, I tried all 3 of the 2-in-1 shampoos and had a real problem telling any difference between them.  They are all recommended, or get whichever one is the cheapest at the time.e need for conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Clear Men&#x27;s line and would say that this particular one is one of my favorites.  To be frank, I tried all 3 of the 2-in-1 shampoos and had a real problem telling any difference between them.  They are all recommended, or get whichever one is the cheapest at the time.</li>
            <li> The Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2-in-1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner is a fine choice for men who need a dandruff shampoo that works.  This product contains ginseng, mint, and tea tree oil along with its active ingredient, pyrithione zinc, which means it may sting a little bit until it&#x27;s rinsed off (I tested this myself, even though the scent is all wrong for a woman); once rinsed, however, the scalp feels much better and does not itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product for men who have contact dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis, as it does exactly what it says it&#x27;ll do -- it leaves the scalp and hair in better condition, and it doesn&#x27;t itch.  (Pity this maker hasn&#x27;t yet put out a similar product for women as of yet.)  It should work well on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars, highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barb Caffrey</li>
            <li> I had the two men in my life try this one: my son (10) and my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son doesn&#x27;t have a dandruff problem, but both he and my husband, who occasionally has some flakes, were both suffering from itchy scalps due to all the swimming they&#x27;ve been doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son really liked the shampoo.  (He used it by himself, and I washed his hair a few times myself to see what it was like.)  It made good suds and he really liked the smell which he thought was &#x27;manly but not stinky&#x27;. (I had no idea he even noticed these sorts of things. But he did say that it made him smell nice like his Uncle Marker). I liked that it suds well and washed out cleanly without a lot of whining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband commented that it &#x27;soothed&#x27; his itchy scalp.  And neither of us us have seen any flakes.  HOWEVER, he also commented that he didn&#x27;t  think it cleaned to his complete satisfaction: at least not for Summer.  After a particularly grueling day of sitting on a lounge chair watching me mow and then weed the garden, he said he had to wash through twice to get to the point where his hair felt super clean.  This is more or less the same comment he&#x27;s been making about every other shampoo that he&#x27;s tried lately:  Pantene, Aussie, and Suave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So FIVE STARS.  This is a shampoo/conditioner that is going to be good for someone who doesn&#x27;t want their shampoo to dry out their hair and scalp.  It also smells night without being overly perfume-y.  It appears to be soothing to the scalp, but you might find you need to use more shampoo if you have excessively greasy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff problems, so I can&#x27;t really speak to its effectiveness in that respect. But I have always been a 2-in-1 user. This works great and smells great. I usually use Suave&#x27;s 2-in-1 and I don&#x27;t think this product is really much different for me. It leaves my hair smooth and soft, so that&#x27;s about all I need. And it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> I previously used Head and Shoulders and with-in the first two days my dandruff was suppressed and completely gone. I viewed this new product on Amazon and decided to try it out. After two days of using Clear Men&#x27;s Scalp Therapy it failed to have any effect on my scalp. My haired had a nice aroma but the flakes were still there. It did not remove any of the dandruff. I continued using it for the entire month and unfortunately there has been no positive results. The dandruff remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention I stopped using Head and Shoulders prior to ever using Clear Men Scalp Therapy. After about a month the dandruff started to return and that is when I made the decision to try out this new product. During the entire month I only used Clear Men&#x27;s Scalp Therapy. No other dandruff treatment products or shampoos were used in order to prevent the issue of causing a potential interference of different products. As of today my dandruff remains. This item certainly isn&#x27;t best for everyone with a dandruff issue.</li>
            <li> This is another in the Clear line of shampoos. The bottle says it is for men, anti-dandruff, shampoo and conditioner, clean and refresh. The back also states that there is ginseng, tea tree and natural mint. None of these smells are really noticeable, although the scent of the shampoo is a clean fresh one.&lt;br /&gt;One strange thing about this particular bottle of shampoo is especially since it says it has conditioner in it - it did not seem as thick as the other varieties of the Clear line that I have used. This seemed like a normal thick type shampoo. The conditioner seemed to work well and so did the anti-dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with the entire Clear brand lies in 2 factors. The bottle itself seems to be made so that you can leave it &#x60;upside down&#x27; in your shower so that it will dispense right away, but it leaks/seeps out of the opening as it stands. The herbal essence, that my whole family uses... we stand it upside down on its wide lid and it has never leaked once. The other is that this seems a bit pricey for doing the same job that other shampoos do.</li>
            <li> I signed up for subscribe and save with this and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I never have to waste time going to Walmart again, just because I ran out of shampoo. Feels great and smells nice without losing any man points.</li>
            <li> This was a quick buy due to the positive reviews.  I developed a scalp itch and it was driving me crazy.  After about 6-7 days of use I&#x27;m doing pretty good.  Not gone but not too noticable now.  I think it&#x27;s the dry winter air but anyway I like that it is all in one do you don&#x27;t have to fumble with 2 bottles and doesn&#x27;t smell perfumy.  It cleans and conditions like it should.  Will have to price check now and see what else is on the market thats similar because I just don&#x27;t know if this is a deal or not.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these 2-in-1 products and this one performs as well as his normal anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner.  The scent is also quite pleasant.  There&#x27;s not much more to say about it other than it works just fine!</li>
            <li> Great! No other shampoo have ever given faster and wanted results, not even the expensive ones like Kerium.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son and he wants me to never buy it again. It leaves a terrible residue no matter how much you resinse. Makes his hair stiff and tangled.</li>
            <li> This 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner has a great fresh scent and washes hair well, leaving it soft, but not greasy feeling. It lathers up well and washes out cleanly. A very guy friendly scent, not feminine. This shampoo is most loved by my pre-teen son, who prior to this had been using a more kid like version of a 2-in-1 shampoo. He likes this Clear Men Scalp Therapy quite a bit better, and has claimed the remainder of the bottle as his. The only issue I have with it is this brands bottles of shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t always ship well. After receiving 4 bottles of Clear Scalp shampoo/conditioner, 2 our of the 4 bottles had leaked just a tiny bit during transport. They are packaged in plastic bags to help in case leaking, but when it came to my orders, 50% of them were leaking in some way upon arrival.</li>
            <li> This is the third of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy products that I have tried. All use the same active ingredient, Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), to treat the dandruff. This shampoo seems  be a general anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner rather than one geared toward dry or oily hair or scalps.It is a good product that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the 2 in 1 Dry Scalp Hydration anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner  and the Strong and Full anti-dandruff shampoo. I don&#x27;t notice a whole lot of difference between them other than the perfume smell seems stronger in both shampoo and conditioners. The smell seems to go away after I am done washing my hair which is a good thing since I don&#x27;t want my hair smelling sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need to use a little of this product to get your hair covered in soap. It feels fine on my scalp. It is a daily shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a store brand anti-dandruff shampoo as well as a coal tar based brand name product.  I am happy using clear men scalp therapy products.  They seem to keep my dandruff under control.</li>
            <li> I have tried many dikfferent shampoos in my lifetime, and I do find this line of products among the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I like the ability to use a moderate amount to clean thoroughly and it does have a mild soolthing effect along with a pleasant enough odor.  jEnthusiastically recommended by yours truly.</li>
            <li> I use Head and Shoulders b/c I have moderate dandruff.  This 2-in-1 works just as well against the dandruff.  It is thicker than Head and Shoulders, so I only had to use a small amount (about the size of a dime-I have a short haircut).  It smells less like soap/shampoo and more like cologne, which is nice.  It lathers VERY well and leaves my hair clean feeling, even a day after. Overall, I think I am going to switch from Head and Shoulders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging Note: If you plan on ordering this on Amazon, be aware that it may leak in transit-Mine did leak a little bit, it was wrapped in a plastic bag so it didn&#x27;t get all over the box/other items, but it was still messy and needed some rinsing off when I took it out of the box.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of fancy bath and hair products and am always looking for new to add to the repertoire. Then I came across this shampoo at the bottom of a soap at that i was viewing. The uniqueness of the bottle first struck me then as I read the ingredients I knew that I had to try it. And boy was I pleasantly surprised. Often times these products don&#x27;t like up to the hype of the pitchmen who are eager to sell all forms of snake oil and to separate you from your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in this case, the verbiage is understated.......I could go on and on about this little bottle of heaven. As you massage it into your scalp you immediately notice how silky and creamy it feels. Not to mention the super fresh sent which engulfs the bathroom and the tingle that you feel down to the roots. It was amazing. I will be ordering a case to have on hand and to share with friends.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well, still have dandruff but deff helped, and my girlfriend says my hair actually feels much softer and nicer.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I have no affiliation or relationship of any kind with this product other than the fact that I use it.  So, here is my story that I hope will help at least some of you..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been plagued with seborrheic dermatitus most of my latter adult life (am now 62), and mostly scalp and facial.  Those of you with this affliction will understand these symptons; over production of sebum that cause irritation and flakiness across the eyebrows, nose, in the ears, behind the ears, and facial irritation in general, and yes, including the scalp.  I&#x27;ve been to numerous doctors and allergist&#x27;s over the years and nothing they prescribe would help, with the exception of Triamcinolone (steroid cream).  Problem is you should NOT use this on your face as it thin outs the skin where ever you use it.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of shampoo&#x27;s, up to and including &amp;#34;Head &amp; Shoulders Clinical strength shampoo.  I also happen to be one of those people who are very hygiene conscious about myself and my appearance INCLUDING in my ears.  Last year I had an episode of what the hearing doctor called &amp;#34;swimmers ear&amp;#34;.  He used his specialized equipment to clean deep inside my ears, and said they were full of junk to the point where it impaired the hearing in my left ear..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to be in the drug store a few months back and came across this product.  All I can tell you is O M G!!!  Within a week my facial and scalp Seborrheic was GONE, not only from my scalp, but my entire face, including all those areas I have mentioned.  I know it sounds crazy, but I now use it almost like a body wash on other areas where I&#x27;ve experienced flare ups in the past...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please believe me when I tell you the results have been ASTONISHING!  If you suffer with this condition as I have, then you have absolutely nothing to lose, and everything to gain by using this shampoo.  I only hope it works as well for you as it did me!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim because someone commented that this worked like the old Axe shampoo formula.  Wow, was I disappointed.  I don&#x27;t have dandruff nor flakes, so maybe I&#x27;m not the intended audience.  I feel I have sludge in my hair after use, maybe that is the conditioning working, but I don&#x27;t like the feeling of it.  My head itches mid day after use which doesn&#x27;t happen when I use Selsun Blue or another Axe shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like this combination shampoo and conditioner. It leaves my hair soft and clean, plus I like that the conditioner is included in the product since it saves a step. As for the anti-dandruff claim, it seems true and the product smells nice.</li>
            <li> I have annoying and frequently recurring dandruff. (It only appears when I dress up.)I&#x27;ve never used a prescription resolution. I&#x27;ve tried Head and Shoulders, Tegrin and Selsen Blue. They all work great for two weeks and then the dandruff comes back and the product doesn&#x27;t clear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has kept me dandruff free for 6 weeks now and is a pleasure to use. The tea tree oil in it has a delightful effect I did not anticipate. I have recurring skin rashes, probably fungal, that I treated as necessary with tea tree oil. Since I have been using CLEAR the rash is resolved and my skin as well as scalp feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for five months now and it continues to work beautifully. I&#x27;ve never had a hair product wo well for so long.</li>
            <li> Better than the original Head &amp; Shoulders.  If you have a re-occurring dandruff, then get this shampoo.  It has a classy and sophisticated smell.  Good shampoo for the price.</li>
            <li> First, a setup about me. I&#x27;m a male in his mid-20s, with hair that tends to the dry side and varies between 3/4\\&quot; and 2\\&quot; between haircuts.  Besides a comb, shampoo, and conditioner, I don&#x27;t use any other hair care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having had good results with the [[ASIN:B007RTR8UC CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]] I started using in May, I decided to give this a go. While this product did what it set out to do, it&#x27;s nothing extraordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I like the nice, thick lather this works up, and it does a pretty good job cleaning up even filthy hair (after a day of yardwork and woodworking in 95-degree heat, one wash got 95% of the gunk out and a second got the rest). I was not so impressed with the almost-waterlike viscosity of the shampoo/conditioner (if you hold your hand at a 30-degree angle the gel - I use the term loosely - will pour out of your hand). While the conditioning was decent for me, my standards are pretty low, and I ended up using the above-mentioned conditioner a few times after this product so my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for less than seven bucks, this does a decent job, even if it&#x27;s not the best option out there.</li>
            <li> This anti-dandruff shampoo contains Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), which is the same anti-dandruff ingredient found in Head and Shoulders shampoos. Head and Shoulders is the shampoo my family (husband and sons) have been using for the past several years. They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far. My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better. They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard before that adding conditioner to shampoo does not really work because the shampoo just washes it out. My son said he didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between the shampoo  and the combined shampoo and conditioner that he tried.</li>
            <li> This Clear \\&quot;Men Scalp Therapy\\&quot; is good at stopping dandruff and does leave our hair looking and feeling clean, but it also has a fairly strong odor that tends to linger. We are long time \\&quot;Head and Shoulder\\&quot; users and have been pleased with how well it works on dandruff, but it does not provide the body this shampoo and conditioner combo does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is buzz cut short and my son&#x27;s is over shoulder length long but we both tend to run to oilier side. I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in the effectiveness or look of my hair but my son&#x27;s hair has become truly impressive with increased body (my wife says he looks a bit like a Viking now). The only down side is that we don&#x27;t like the smell very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> Got this recently.  Normally I would use Head and Shoulders, but I thought I would try a change in shampoo.  Glad I did.  We all know Head and Shoulders works, but it has always smelled weird....like a hospital area.  Well the Clear Men Scalp Therapy works just as well and it smells nice too.......much better than Head and Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to switch to this shampoo/conditioner from now on.  I just flat out like it.  I am still an old guy, but my hair looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> I have relatively short hair (sometimes no hair), but my scalp gets itchy and dry. I have used several different shampoos and while they all worked decently, I really hate the smell! I don&#x27;t want to smell like an old medicine cabinet after I shower. The Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoo leaves my hair/scalp clean without drying it out and without smelling like medicine. I always shampoo twice, and I don&#x27;t use much either time. I think this offers good value and I would recommend this to anyone with an itch or flakes! Give it a try, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Works perfect, my dandruff has started disappearing after two wash.</li>
            <li> Before using Clear, my husband had one brand of anti-dandruff shampoo he was very loyal to, that&#x27;s changed.&lt;br /&gt;Pyrithione zinc works great to control the mild-medium dandruff of the people in my family who have it. It also seems to help cut down on the psoriasis my son has on his scalp. So it&#x27;s the active ingredient that I look for in anti-dandruff shampoos. My husband will use an anti-dandruff shampoo daily instead of switching back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another winner, 2 in 1, conditions hair nicely, keeps it flake free. The scent is nice and also fades very quickly so it&#x27;s not obtrusive, noticeable or clashing with cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this in the future. It&#x27;s not my favorite of the Clear for Men anti-dandruff scents, but it&#x27;s close.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best anti-dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have excema (sp?), a dry skin condition, and am pre-diabetic, which makes my skin dryness even worse. I&#x27;d tried Head n&#x27; Shoulders before, and liked that \\&quot;cooling sensation\\&quot; type when it came out, but it always seemed that no company could quite get enough moisture into their formulas (even T-Gel &amp; Selson Blue); but Clear have managed to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, they actually took the time to make it have a great impact on your hair too; others seemed to strip hair and leave it dry/frizzy--Clear leaves it silky and full.</li>
            <li> I had been using Nizoral for my scalp condition previously, but the price had gotten too high and was no longer carried by most local stores. I figured I would give this a try. The low price made me sceptical but so far I have had good results keeping my seborrhoeic dermatitus under control. Good product.</li>
            <li> I have bad dandruff.  My dermatologist prescribed a very expensive shampoo that came in a tiny bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I was laid off, and no longer had insurance to cover the $165, 3 ounce bottle anymore.&lt;br /&gt;My wife bought me this because it was on sale at the local store.  It works better, smells better, and is a tiny fraction of the price of the dermatologist prescribed medicated shampoo.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This 2in1 from Clear seems to work rather well. It has such a fresh scent, but in a manly way. It is not a lingering scent, but it&#x27;s there. It lathers nicely and rinses easily. There is no residue or buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry scalp and dry hair condition were both fairly improved by the end of the bottle. It makes your hair soft, but not lifeless or flat. It aso did not add to the issue of oily hair/scalp - It seemed to improve that, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it is a decent product. It is priced about right for the quality.</li>
            <li> I had a dry, flaky and peeling scalp. I tried the Neutrogena T-Gel and T-Sal for several weeks with modest results. The Clear cleared up my condition for me within a week!</li>
            <li> A little high price for feeling like the Mal-Mart brand.  Why pay over double for the same product?  Nothing wrong with it but the price.</li>
            <li> Clears up dandruff&lt;br /&gt;Calms previously irritated scalp&lt;br /&gt;Smells clean and fresh (not fruity or perfumey)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> I had flakes, used this product for several weeks, and it just seemed to get worse, until I quit using it.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning hair and holding down dandruff.  The aroma is pleasing.</li>
            <li> I got this for hubby to try and he loves it. He has poor vision and hadn&#x27;t noticed the flakes over the past few years, but they were there. One use with the shampoo, and his hair is soft, smells nice and no little flakes. From my point of the view the bonus is how both the men&#x27;s and the women&#x27;s Clear shampoos hold down the overpowering odor some health and beauty aids dump in their products because of fragrance allergies. Because this shampoo&#x27;s fragrance was so mild I can stand to be around my husband after he shampoos.</li>
            <li> Normally my husband uses whatever shampoo that is within reach while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;He tried this 2 in 1 Anti Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, it lathered up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Years back when I purchased 2 in 1 anti dandruff shampoo and conditioner, it did not lather and reminded me of like school glue (if that makes sense)&lt;br /&gt;This was not like that at all.&lt;br /&gt;Removed all of his hair product residue from his hair and left his hair soft, shiny and very clean looking and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;Like this product and the results.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not over powering in my opinion and I think a woman could use this as well and not have to worry about the scent being too much.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this 2 in 1. I normally like my shampoo and conditioner separate, but since I have short hair now, I don&#x27;t really mind using a 2 in 1.  The shampoo comes out white and it lathers and foams nicely.  It reminds me of Head and Shoulders.  It also has the same active ingredient.  It does not have a powerful smell, but does make me smell clean.  I always get a bit of flakes here and there, even when I use dandruff shampoo daily.  I also use hair gel, so that could contribute to it.  I will continue to use Clear products, and would recommend you try it as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m very impressed with this product. First of all, something is wrong with the lid, which prevents it from closing all the way. The bottle arrived in a plastic bag and about 20% of the bottle&#x27;s content spilled into the plastic bag on the way. The bottle ended up looking messy and being slippery to the touch. I had to wash it before using it and it was dripping all over the place. My husband has almost finished the bottle by now but we still haven&#x27;t found a way to get it to close all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner are not bad but they do nothing to eliminate dandruff. It&#x27;s a little annoying to see the words \\&quot;anti-dandruff\\&quot; on a product which doesn&#x27;t even remotely begin to do anything to fight dandruff. I fail to see anything special about this product and I don&#x27;t think we will be buying it in the future. There isn&#x27;t anything hugely wrong with it (except the faulty cap) but there isn&#x27;t anything good about it either.</li>
            <li> Its ok, makes my hair smell weird...</li>
            <li> My 10 year old son has seborrheic dermatitus. It&#x27;s like eczema on the scalp, with thick flakes well beyond normal dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clear Men Scalp Therapy is the most effective shampoo we&#x27;ve yet tried for him. The flakes are very much reduced when he&#x27;s been using this product.  It seems to have a soothing, moisturizing effect.  This is a product we will stick with!</li>
            <li> I have been on a mission lately to try and eliminate some of the many products that we have to keep in the shower, so I thought I&#x27;d try this to see if I can share with my husband. Currently, I use Aussie shampoo and conditioner and he uses a generic 2-in-1 dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long (well below my shoulders) thick, slightly wavy hair and I am very happy with this! I sometimes have itchy scalp/dandruff, and this has helped that. It leaves my hair feeling clean and not weighed down, but still easy to comb out after a shower (some 2-in-1s make detangling tough). I&#x27;ve also recently started trying to only wash every other day when possible (using Suave dry shampoo on the days off), and this works fine with that routine - I don&#x27;t feel greasy on day 2. I&#x27;ve found this to be more pleasantly thick than some 2-in-1 dandruff shampoos, which are very thin and kind of get all over the place as you squeeze them out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried another variety of this brand - just because I was curious of the difference between that and this. I thought one might have a \\&quot;manly\\&quot; fragrance, but neither I nor my husband can tell a difference in smell or anything else. (The smell for both is just pleasant and clean.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I might switch to this permanently - it eliminates some bottles AND a step in the AM!</li>
