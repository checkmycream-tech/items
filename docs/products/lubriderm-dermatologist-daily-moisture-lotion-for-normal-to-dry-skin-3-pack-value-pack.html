    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product and excellent quality ....</li>
            <li>The Perfect Body lotion.</li>
            <li>It is the best out there</li>
            <li>This lotion is the best on the market I believe</li>
            <li>Repeat customer, excellent product at a good price!</li>
            <li>and I have a very good sense of smell.</li>
            <li>Great product and price.</li>
            <li>Aveeno has some great products too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>A great product that works well on my elderly mother.</li>
            <li>It smells good and keep my skin moisture.</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion available.  </li>
            <li>Economy aside, it is an effective and pleasant product to use.</li>
            <li>I think people give this great reviews because it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>In terms of effective moisturization, this is top notch.  </li>
            <li>That reminds me, I need to do a review of a couple of their products because they have proven more effective than just about anything else out there.</li>
            <li>Great deal and the small bottle is perfect for my desk at work!</li>
            <li>Bigger than the ones we purchased at Costco and a great price!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m frugal and opposed to wasting anything if there&#x27;s a way to avoid it :)</li>
            <li>Marketing being what it is, this product is packaged well and looks sexy.</li>
            <li>Also, the cool label makes it look better than it is.</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on smoothly and leaves no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy, and has a light and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It is good for the whole family as the scent isn&#x27;t feminine or masculine.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and is never sticky.</li>
            <li>the lotion actually absorbs into my skin instead of sitting on top of it like a lot of the cheap lotions can do.  </li>
            <li>Your skin is probably worth it.</li>
            <li>All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li>and it becomes flaky and itchy if I don&#x27;t moisturize right away.</li>
            <li>I notice the smell right away</li>
            <li>Best lotion for my dry skin, not loud smelling!!!</li>
            <li>Sometimes you have to spend a little more for a better skin product.</li>
            <li>This formula may have been considered higher end some 60 years ago, but with today&#x27;s science there are much better products out there such as anything by Eucerin.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than purchasing in grocery store, plus larger bottles last longer, very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I live in dry desert heat, and this lotion is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Lubriderm for years, and though I occasionally try a different lotion (particularly if I get a free sample), I always come back to Lubriderm.</li>
            <li>Excellent lotion for these cold and dry winters.</li>
            <li>The heavy fragrance reminds me of something a woman in her 70s or 80s might think is pleasant, but to me it is comes across very synthetic with maybe a hint of rose, blech.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s somewhat personal taste, but if you buy this, try it up against the other 2 products I mentioned previously, and write your own review.</li>
            <li>The formula is the same old ineffective ingredients companies have been using for 70 years: water, mineral oil, glycerin, alcohols... of course it&#x27;s going to be drying.</li>
            <li>Lubriderm Dermatologist Daily Moisture Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin 3 Pack arrived on time and item as described with the bonus Listerine gift.  </li>
            <li>The price is too high in comparison to the Cosco and other warehouse stores.</li>

            <li> The price is too high in comparison to the Cosco and other warehouse stores.</li>
            <li> It feels like you can use just a small amount for a large area, and I keep the smaller bottle in my bookbag.</li>
            <li> We have a wood-burning stove and live in a cold climate, so this lotion is useful for hands, body and feet.</li>
            <li> I do like it and due to physical problems have to use Amazon.</li>
            <li> Once it does your hands will get dry again.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, you may wish to try this Lubriderm lotion.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that, when the supply runs low, the pump dispenser wastes quite a bit of lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 4 years now and haven&#x27;t wanted to change to any other lotion.  </li>
            <li> Second of all the greasy feeling is not pleasant, and it takes a long time to absorb or wear away.</li>
            <li> So I turn the container upside down for a week or two and just screw off the cap to dispense the remaining lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy, but what can I say -</li>
            <li> The pump dispenses just a small dab that I massage into my legs, arms and torso immediately after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> The faint scent is benign and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my perfume.</li>
            <li> I got this product and arrived on time, price, size and quality can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Got from Costco with a lower price. It smells good and keep my skin moisture. I also use it as a hand cream too.</li>
            <li> Great deal and the small bottle is perfect for my desk at work!</li>
            <li> Have used Lubrderm for years.</li>
            <li> The price is too high in comparison to the Cosco and other warehouse stores. I do like it and due to physical problems have to use Amazon.</li>
            <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li> Bigger than the ones we purchased at Costco and a great price!  Excellent lotion for these cold and dry winters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lubriderm for years, and though I occasionally try a different lotion (particularly if I get a free sample), I always come back to Lubriderm. The 3-pack is sold at Costco and probably lasts me a year. The smaller container goes in my travel kit. Economy aside, it is an effective and pleasant product to use. The pump dispenses just a small dab that I massage into my legs, arms and torso immediately after getting out of the shower. I have very dry skin and it becomes flaky and itchy if I don&#x27;t moisturize right away. The lotion goes on smoothly and leaves no greasy residue. The faint scent is benign and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my perfume. My only complaint is that, when the supply runs low, the pump dispenser wastes quite a bit of lotion.

It&#x27;s a little messy, but what can I say - I&#x27;m frugal and opposed to wasting anything if there&#x27;s a way to avoid it :)</li>
            <li> I have tried about every lotion under the sun.  In terms of effective moisturization, this is top notch.  It lasts and lasts, and it isn&#x27;t greasy at all. the lotion actually absorbs into my skin instead of sitting on top of it like a lot of the cheap lotions can do.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Best lotion for my dry skin, not loud smelling!!!</li>
            <li> I always get Lubriderm. It feels like you can use just a small amount for a large area, and I keep the smaller bottle in my bookbag.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than purchasing in grocery store, plus larger bottles last longer, very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> Repeat customer, excellent product at a good price!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent quality .... I&#x27;m looking forward to getting another package like this when I finish the one I just buy!</li>
            <li> The Perfect Body lotion.</li>
            <li> Great product and price. I have used this product for 4 years now and haven&#x27;t wanted to change to any other lotion.  It is the best out there</li>
            <li> Use this in our office for staff and patients.</li>
            <li> I notice the smell right away and I don&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;m a man age 49 and I have a very good sense of smell. The heavy fragrance reminds me of something a woman in her 70s or 80s might think is pleasant, but to me it is comes across very synthetic with maybe a hint of rose, blech. Second of all the greasy feeling is not pleasant, and it takes a long time to absorb or wear away. Once it does your hands will get dry again. The formula is the same old ineffective ingredients companies have been using for 70 years: water, mineral oil, glycerin, alcohols... of course it&#x27;s going to be drying. Also this product makes my skin burn. If you have any cuts on your hands, look out! This formula may have been considered higher end some 60 years ago, but with today&#x27;s science there are much better products out there such as anything by Eucerin. Their product has a cleaner feel with no smell whatsoever. That reminds me, I need to do a review of a couple of their products because they have proven more effective than just about anything else out there. Aveeno has some great products too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I think people give this great reviews because it&#x27;s cheap. You get a ton of product for a low cost. Also, the cool label makes it look better than it is. Marketing being what it is, this product is packaged well and looks sexy. Me, I&#x27;m still trying to find someone with whom to pawn these giant containers off. Maybe it&#x27;s somewhat personal taste, but if you buy this, try it up against the other 2 products I mentioned previously, and write your own review. Sometimes you have to spend a little more for a better skin product. Your skin is probably worth it.</li>
            <li> A great product that works well on my elderly mother.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best on the market I believe</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion available.  It is absorbed quickly and is never sticky.</li>
            <li> I got this product and arrived on time, price, size and quality can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Lubriderm Dermatologist Daily Moisture Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin 3 Pack arrived on time and item as described with the bonus Listerine gift.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I live in dry desert heat, and this lotion is fantastic!  I use it liberally without worrying that it will harm my clothing!</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, you may wish to try this Lubriderm lotion. It isn&#x27;t greasy, and has a light and fresh scent. We have a wood-burning stove and live in a cold climate, so this lotion is useful for hands, body and feet. The moisture lasts 24 hours says the company. It is good for the whole family as the scent isn&#x27;t feminine or masculine.</li>
