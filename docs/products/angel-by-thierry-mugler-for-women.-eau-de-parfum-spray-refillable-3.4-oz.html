            <li>Good price for my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the kind of off</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance, and it was a good price....</li>
            <li>And the bottle itself is very attractive too, I recomment it highly.</li>
            <li>My anty love love loved this perfume and delivery</li>

            <li>My favorite.</li>

            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Always get many compliments and inquiries about what I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
            <li>For people that don&#x27;t know, the codes under the top flap are required to be cut out by the company before being sold at a discount price.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, shipping time, price, and overall satisfaction.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting anyway.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I would expect it to be authentic.  </li>
            <li>Amazon provided me with a refund within 24 hours of contacting them, which is one of the many reasons I love shopping with them.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic price!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite on her.  </li>
            <li>My kids love how it smells on me.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance, but my code to join Thierry Mugler&#x27;s exclusive Circle was removed from the inside of the box.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scent and so does any one who passes by me.  </li>
            <li>Have purchased this many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this fragrance one day as I went into a mall in Florida.</li>
            <li>She seemed genuinely pleased that I had stopped her to ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not like many of the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>spritz in two places-my wrist and the nape of my neck, which makes my hair smell lovely all day.</li>
            <li>You might fall in love with it.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love,this perfume.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love this scent for years.</li>
            <li>and i love the smell of it .</li>
            <li>My husband, who rarely comments on perfume, loved this one on me.</li>
            <li>have worn Angel for years, it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li>and I love the prices and products.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Parfum now.</li>
            <li>So sexy smelling to him which I love.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of the Angle.</li>
            <li>Buy it now, you will love it.</li>
            <li>Everything ok, recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I have an authentic bottle of Thierry Mugler Angel at home.</li>
            <li>I have been using Angel for many years, and it is my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I received my favorite perfume  and love it.  </li>
            <li>Very unique.</li>
            <li>I have worn Angel for many years and have received many compliments, I would recommend it to anyone that likes a cologne that isn&#x27;t strong smelling.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume and with free shipping from amazon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a perfect blend of sweet and earthy.  </li>
            <li>It is if they used an authentic bottle, and filled it up with alcohol.</li>
            <li>The lesson here is don&#x27;t buy perfume on line unless it&#x27;s from the original company or a reputable department store or Sephora.</li>
            <li>After the strong alcohol smell wears off, I smell vanilla and baby powder.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal fan of Angel EDP for over 20 years &amp; converted many followers.</li>
            <li>To start off, Angel has always been my favorite perfume; when i received it in the mail, it was EXACTLY what i ordered!</li>
            <li>Light scent.  </li>
            <li>I also like lightly misting my pillowcases with the fragrance</li>
            <li>Others said it smelled like a cheap knock-off.</li>
            <li>can tell you this, if they don&#x27;t refund my money I will have a FIT...</li>
            <li>Even though I love the scent there is such a thing as too much of a good thing in this</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t spray right before a flight, more like 2 hours before.</li>
            <li>It is the first and only time, I turned around and ran after her to tell her how incredible she smelled and ask her what she was wearing.</li>
            <li>Some reviews wrote Angel didnt come as pictured in original packaging</li>
            <li>I noticed the special code in the box had been cut out</li>
            <li>If you are buying the large 3.4 ounce refillable bottle, it comes in a lovely tall bottle called Rising Star.</li>
            <li>They gave me a full refund on the return.</li>
            <li>My former girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to get a real bottle of it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Amazon gave me a full refund</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this perfume that it has become my very</li>
            <li>contacted Amazon and they provided a full refund including shipping &amp; tax.</li>
            <li>What we received was a tall bottle, while it has its own interesting shape it is not what we expected.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The opening gives a blast of chocolate, a mild tar note, sandalwood, and some florals.&lt;br /&gt;During</li>
            <li>Soft, feminine and lasting, with beautiful notes of patchouli and chocolate</li>
            <li>No idea how it would combine with other people&#x27;s arm pit aroma but for me it changes with my odor as it changes; always pleasant</li>
            <li>This is such a nice fragrance, I always have someone saying, what is that fragrance?  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Fresh and reminds me of my teens.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend going easy on the sprays though</li>
            <li>As soon as I got it and smelled it, I knew it wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t even feel right on the skin when you spray it....</li>
            <li>However, it wasn&#x27;t before long before my wife and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a very strong perfume and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It came as promised, brand new, in an original package, and on time.  </li>
            <li>The Angel fragrance is perfect as usual; however, the sprayer (atomizer) doesn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li>At first it smelled like i remembered it</li>
            <li>but after the first week i guess it lost its potency.</li>
            <li>The bottle looked authentic and the smell was similar, but it wasn&#x27;t Angel.</li>
            <li>This is the only perfume that I have worn for many years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like to know why!</li>
            <li>The plastic outer wrap had been taped shut at bottom (first clue) and it smells nothing like Angel which I&#x27;ve worn exclusively for years.  </li>
            <li>Amazon agreed to send replacement, but upon receipt it was evident that it too had been tampered with (now that I knew what to look for).  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing different Thierry Mugler Parfums for years, but &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I also love that I can still smell it on my wrist the next day when I wake up.</li>
            <li>This Scent is so singular and recognizable that people often say to my gf &#x27;</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews first and but having 4 stars threw me off.</li>
            <li>This bottle doesn&#x27;t come with a spray so need to be aware of that.</li>
            <li>When I saw this item - twice the ounces for only 50% more, I bought it.</li>
            <li>The unique product code is marked out.</li>
            <li>I will buy Angel again but probably give up the extra money and purchase straight from a reputable supplier like Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money, and even better that I can get it at nearly half price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I absolutely, would recommend this to everyone.  </li>
            <li>You don t need to put that much on.  </li>
            <li>I recommend the fragrance...not so much the bottle.</li>
            <li>This is not the real perfume.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very upset.</li>
            <li>but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It is the real deal.</li>
            <li>She is amazed how often people ask what she has on,how much thy like the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>but know I question if what I got was really some boot leg bottle of something else.  </li>
            <li>Very please.</li>
            <li>Almost got twice as much product instead of purchasing at the store.&lt;br /&gt;People compliment the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend !</li>
            <li>the colour was really off</li>
            <li>It came today.&lt;br /&gt;It looks real.</li>
            <li>so much saved myself $100 no longer have to purchase it from Macys</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>A lovely scent that is soft, angelic, and somewhat mysterious.</li>
            <li>The new order from Perfume World arrived and the first thing I noticed is that the smell was  not Angel.</li>
            <li>I get more queries about it than any other perfume I wear.  </li>
            <li>This is the second time this company has shipped a box with this code cut out of the original packaging.</li>
            <li>Once you try it you will never be satisfied with any other perfume again.</li>
            <li>I love Angel eau de toilette and when I saw the large bottle for half off the normal price, I immediately ordered it.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t live without this Angel!  </li>
            <li>the smell does not stay more than half an hour.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the company that sells this junk sends out an occasional bottle of the real Angel just to get a few good reviews or if the people who have reviewed it positively don&#x27;t know what the real Angel is like, OR most likely the company itself is having people review it positively for them.....</li>
            <li>I called a high end, dept store, and they charge a lot.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller and this product.</li>
            <li>I have bought and worn Angel for years, always paying the high prices at department stores.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Not only is it a big bottle but the scent lasts very long; if you&#x27;re on a budget yet want something good that lasts, then i HIGHLY recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li>The price was great, shipping fast, and I&#x27;ll have enough to last at least a year.</li>
            <li>Another strong, long lasting perfume.  </li>
            <li>However, the first bottle I received had the Angel club code cut out of the inside of the box (though it appeared to be a sealed package), and the liquid in the bottle was definitely not Angel.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Get positive comments on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>junk, pure and simple.....</li>
            <li>This is the genuine Eau De Parfum that I have paid at least twice as much for in high-end department stores.</li>
            <li>Becomes mellow with each passing hour, soft and un-intrusive.</li>
            <li>Amazon did completely refund my $, and stated they would pull the listing until the problem was resolved.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance drives me wild.</li>
            <li>Definitely the real thing.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t come from Amazon directly but rather from another source and so Amazon doesn&#x27;t test it OR guarantee it.</li>
            <li>Because I had a bottle of Angel that I was finishing up, I didn&#x27;t open the package straight away</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s a knockoff or just old Angel.</li>
            <li>Always compliments from strangers no less</li>
            <li>In the past many years I&#x27;ve only returned an ipad cover, so I&#x27;m not picky...</li>
            <li>I noticed that the little sticker on the top of the package was loose</li>
            <li>thanks T.Mugler from a die hard, true blue worshipper...DZ</li>
            <li>controversial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a frequent amazon buyer for a wide variety of products and purchased this larger bottle for my wife as she loves the scent the perfume has and when we received the product, the first thing I noticed was the plastic wrapper was ill-fitting and appears not factory applied.  </li>
            <li>The difference between this and cheaper perfumes is that one or two spritzes is enough to last the whole day and into the next.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first bottle of Angel ten years ago and even though I try other perfumes, I keep coming back to it.</li>
            <li>The new purchase from Perfume World through Amazon had a fake website and the unique code marked out.</li>
            <li>The initial application smells strongly of spices, musk and amber, and when it dries down after a few hours I begin to get the cocoa, vanilla, and pachouli</li>

            <li> my wife was very satisfied</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s own...</li>
            <li> Good price for my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the kind of off</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance, and it was a good price....</li>
            <li> And the bottle itself is very attractive too, I recomment it highly.</li>
            <li> My anty love love loved this perfume and delivery</li>
            <li> and I was happy that it arrived so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love the warm, inviting, sophisticated aura that envelopes me when I wear it.</li>

            <li> Got it quick, no problems!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seductive, sweet, and perfect for intimate wear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> I kept it on my bedside table, and it gave off such a delicious fragrance.</li>
            <li> Now I use it every day, although I have many perfumes.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Always get many compliments and inquiries about what I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
            <li> For people that don&#x27;t know, the codes under the top flap are required to be cut out by the company before being sold at a discount price.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, shipping time, price, and overall satisfaction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting anyway.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I would expect it to be authentic.  </li>
            <li> Amazon provided me with a refund within 24 hours of contacting them, which is one of the many reasons I love shopping with them.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic price!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite on her.  </li>
            <li> My kids love how it smells on me.  </li>
            <li> I love the fragrance, but my code to join Thierry Mugler&#x27;s exclusive Circle was removed from the inside of the box.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent and so does any one who passes by me.  </li>
            <li> Have purchased this many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this fragrance one day as I went into a mall in Florida.</li>
            <li> She seemed genuinely pleased that I had stopped her to ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not like many of the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> spritz in two places-my wrist and the nape of my neck, which makes my hair smell lovely all day.</li>
            <li> You might fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love,this perfume.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love this scent for years.</li>
            <li> and i love the smell of it .</li>
            <li> My husband, who rarely comments on perfume, loved this one on me.</li>
            <li> have worn Angel for years, it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li> and I love the prices and products.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Parfum now.</li>
            <li> So sexy smelling to him which I love.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the Angle.</li>
            <li> Buy it now, you will love it.</li>
            <li> Everything ok, recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I have an authentic bottle of Thierry Mugler Angel at home.</li>
            <li> I have been using Angel for many years, and it is my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I received my favorite perfume  and love it.  </li>
            <li> Very unique.</li>
            <li> I have worn Angel for many years and have received many compliments, I would recommend it to anyone that likes a cologne that isn&#x27;t strong smelling.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume and with free shipping from amazon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a perfect blend of sweet and earthy.  </li>
            <li> It is if they used an authentic bottle, and filled it up with alcohol.</li>
            <li> The lesson here is don&#x27;t buy perfume on line unless it&#x27;s from the original company or a reputable department store or Sephora.</li>
            <li> After the strong alcohol smell wears off, I smell vanilla and baby powder.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal fan of Angel EDP for over 20 years &amp; converted many followers.</li>
            <li> To start off, Angel has always been my favorite perfume; when i received it in the mail, it was EXACTLY what i ordered!</li>
            <li> Light scent.  </li>
            <li> I also like lightly misting my pillowcases with the fragrance</li>
            <li> Others said it smelled like a cheap knock-off.</li>
            <li> can tell you this, if they don&#x27;t refund my money I will have a FIT...</li>
            <li> Even though I love the scent there is such a thing as too much of a good thing in this</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t spray right before a flight, more like 2 hours before.</li>
            <li> It is the first and only time, I turned around and ran after her to tell her how incredible she smelled and ask her what she was wearing.</li>
            <li> Some reviews wrote Angel didnt come as pictured in original packaging</li>
            <li> I noticed the special code in the box had been cut out</li>
            <li> If you are buying the large 3.4 ounce refillable bottle, it comes in a lovely tall bottle called Rising Star.</li>
            <li> They gave me a full refund on the return.</li>
            <li> My former girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been able to get a real bottle of it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Amazon gave me a full refund</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this perfume that it has become my very</li>
            <li> contacted Amazon and they provided a full refund including shipping &amp; tax.</li>
            <li> What we received was a tall bottle, while it has its own interesting shape it is not what we expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The opening gives a blast of chocolate, a mild tar note, sandalwood, and some florals.&lt;br /&gt;During</li>
            <li> Soft, feminine and lasting, with beautiful notes of patchouli and chocolate</li>
            <li> No idea how it would combine with other people&#x27;s arm pit aroma but for me it changes with my odor as it changes; always pleasant</li>
            <li> This is such a nice fragrance, I always have someone saying, what is that fragrance?  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Fresh and reminds me of my teens.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend going easy on the sprays though</li>
            <li> As soon as I got it and smelled it, I knew it wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t even feel right on the skin when you spray it....</li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t before long before my wife and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a very strong perfume and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It came as promised, brand new, in an original package, and on time.  </li>
            <li> The Angel fragrance is perfect as usual; however, the sprayer (atomizer) doesn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li> At first it smelled like i remembered it</li>
            <li> but after the first week i guess it lost its potency.</li>
            <li> The bottle looked authentic and the smell was similar, but it wasn&#x27;t Angel.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume that I have worn for many years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to know why!</li>
            <li> The plastic outer wrap had been taped shut at bottom (first clue) and it smells nothing like Angel which I&#x27;ve worn exclusively for years.  </li>
            <li> Amazon agreed to send replacement, but upon receipt it was evident that it too had been tampered with (now that I knew what to look for).  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing different Thierry Mugler Parfums for years, but &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I also love that I can still smell it on my wrist the next day when I wake up.</li>
            <li> This Scent is so singular and recognizable that people often say to my gf &#x27;</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews first and but having 4 stars threw me off.</li>
            <li> This bottle doesn&#x27;t come with a spray so need to be aware of that.</li>
            <li> When I saw this item - twice the ounces for only 50% more, I bought it.</li>
            <li> The unique product code is marked out.</li>
            <li> I will buy Angel again but probably give up the extra money and purchase straight from a reputable supplier like Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money, and even better that I can get it at nearly half price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely, would recommend this to everyone.  </li>
            <li> You don t need to put that much on.  </li>
            <li> I recommend the fragrance...not so much the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is not the real perfume.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very upset.</li>
            <li> but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It is the real deal.</li>
            <li> She is amazed how often people ask what she has on,how much thy like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> but know I question if what I got was really some boot leg bottle of something else.  </li>
            <li> Very please.</li>
            <li> Almost got twice as much product instead of purchasing at the store.&lt;br /&gt;People compliment the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend !</li>
            <li> the colour was really off</li>
            <li> It came today.&lt;br /&gt;It looks real.</li>
            <li> so much saved myself $100 no longer have to purchase it from Macys</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> A lovely scent that is soft, angelic, and somewhat mysterious.</li>
            <li> The new order from Perfume World arrived and the first thing I noticed is that the smell was  not Angel.</li>
            <li> I get more queries about it than any other perfume I wear.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time this company has shipped a box with this code cut out of the original packaging.</li>
            <li> Once you try it you will never be satisfied with any other perfume again.</li>
            <li> I love Angel eau de toilette and when I saw the large bottle for half off the normal price, I immediately ordered it.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t live without this Angel!  </li>
            <li> the smell does not stay more than half an hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the company that sells this junk sends out an occasional bottle of the real Angel just to get a few good reviews or if the people who have reviewed it positively don&#x27;t know what the real Angel is like, OR most likely the company itself is having people review it positively for them.....</li>
            <li> I called a high end, dept store, and they charge a lot.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller and this product.</li>
            <li> I have bought and worn Angel for years, always paying the high prices at department stores.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not only is it a big bottle but the scent lasts very long; if you&#x27;re on a budget yet want something good that lasts, then i HIGHLY recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li> The price was great, shipping fast, and I&#x27;ll have enough to last at least a year.</li>
            <li> Another strong, long lasting perfume.  </li>
            <li> However, the first bottle I received had the Angel club code cut out of the inside of the box (though it appeared to be a sealed package), and the liquid in the bottle was definitely not Angel.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Get positive comments on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> junk, pure and simple.....</li>
            <li> This is the genuine Eau De Parfum that I have paid at least twice as much for in high-end department stores.</li>
            <li> Becomes mellow with each passing hour, soft and un-intrusive.</li>
            <li> Amazon did completely refund my $, and stated they would pull the listing until the problem was resolved.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance drives me wild.</li>
            <li> Definitely the real thing.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t come from Amazon directly but rather from another source and so Amazon doesn&#x27;t test it OR guarantee it.</li>
            <li> Because I had a bottle of Angel that I was finishing up, I didn&#x27;t open the package straight away</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s a knockoff or just old Angel.</li>
            <li> Always compliments from strangers no less</li>
            <li> In the past many years I&#x27;ve only returned an ipad cover, so I&#x27;m not picky...</li>
            <li> I noticed that the little sticker on the top of the package was loose</li>
            <li> thanks T.Mugler from a die hard, true blue worshipper...DZ</li>
            <li> controversial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a frequent amazon buyer for a wide variety of products and purchased this larger bottle for my wife as she loves the scent the perfume has and when we received the product, the first thing I noticed was the plastic wrapper was ill-fitting and appears not factory applied.  </li>
            <li> The difference between this and cheaper perfumes is that one or two spritzes is enough to last the whole day and into the next.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first bottle of Angel ten years ago and even though I try other perfumes, I keep coming back to it.</li>
            <li> The new purchase from Perfume World through Amazon had a fake website and the unique code marked out.</li>
            <li> The initial application smells strongly of spices, musk and amber, and when it dries down after a few hours I begin to get the cocoa, vanilla, and pachouli</li>
            <li> It was poor substitute of original item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many passengers go through duty free and spray themselves silly, then immediately board the plane only to make the whole plane sick from the smell.</li>
            <li> I had contemplated purchasing a refill bottle for her empty bottle but instead opted for buying the more expensive larger star shaped 3.4oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what others were receiving, but this arrived in an intact package, and this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> , long lasting, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> so I expected the same, just larger.  </li>
            <li> always limit myself to 2 spray per day because it can be too strong, especially in small spaces like an airplane.</li>
            <li> Not professional in my opinion.</li>
            <li> they have had this problem for a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is absolutely not the same.</li>
            <li> This a soft feminine sent that lasts a long time even on my skin which usually doesn&#x27;t .</li>
            <li> it looks ok in the package but believe you will be sorry if your try to save a few bucks and buy this.</li>
            <li> I have at least 20 bottles of perfume, but this is the one I normally reach for.</li>
            <li> Either this perfume is old or not authentic.</li>
            <li> The photograph for this item shows the same type of bottle which we had previously purchased</li>
            <li> It is similar to what is sold as a tester or refill on Amazon for about $20 less than what we paid.  </li>
            <li> I will use this one to refill her other bottle so it works out in the end, but wanted to let other buyers know before they make the same mistake.  </li>
            <li> Try something fresher &amp; lighter that reveals your personality rather than acting as an olfactory bullhorn forewarning your arrival a half mile in advance.</li>
            <li> and it seems to me if you get THIS MANY BAD REVIEWS, Amazon would discontinue their relationship with the seller.</li>
            <li> but this is an over the top bad product...</li>
            <li> NOT REAL.</li>
            <li> Does this mean the issue is fixed???</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, never get sick of it.</li>
            <li> the dry down, tongka bean, chocolate, sandalwood, and bergamont become present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nordstroms confirmed it&#x27;s fake!</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews</li>
            <li> Some of the UPC codes in the box were covered with other codes.  </li>
            <li> For that we are extremely grateful and will continue to use the service.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and cheaper than in store!</li>
            <li> I think it is watered down.</li>
            <li> Watered down.</li>
            <li> the product is watered down.  </li>
            <li> Too bad I spent that much money on her though, and she didn&#x27;t appreciate it!!</li>
            <li> Not very strong.  </li>
            <li> When I needed a refill, I priced it at Macys but decided to see if I could get it for less.</li>
            <li> but again, you don&#x27;t expect this kind of blatant bad buisness on Amazon and</li>
            <li> Smell like Angel but its disappear in few minutes.</li>
            <li> Amazon did refund our money, but PLEASE do not waste your time ordering this fake.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, and I can usually still smell it faintly the next day.</li>
            <li> can tell you this, if they don&#x27;t refund my money I will have a FIT...to save a few bucks and buy this.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed as I have purchased previously and was pleased.</li>
            <li> The bottle sprayer is very difficult and not sure it will last the entire bottle through.</li>
            <li> so you need very little.  </li>
            <li> Spraying unknown liquids of questionable origin seems a little too risky to me.  </li>
            <li> It was too late to return.</li>
            <li> Had I read the negative reviews, I would never have purchased the product because it appears to be too</li>
            <li> After a couple of days of using the product, my wife complained to me that  the scent disappears after 30 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li> Upon reading the reviews, this complaint has been a common theme and has gone on for quite some time with some of the writers surmising</li>
            <li> (Forced to give at least one star)</li>
            <li> At first when I smelled it hated it.</li>
            <li> When I try to press down, it is very difficult and then it streams out heavily spraying out a lot of perfume.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, I was a little skeptical ordering this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed that Amazon allows these folks to stay on their otherwise, terrific site.</li>
            <li> just weak and off the mark...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a youthfulul scent, very delicate.</li>
            <li> Angel is elderly &amp; invasive w/its powders &amp; patchouli driving caustic sugary mud.  </li>
            <li> t be unhappy with Alien either from Thierry Mugler.</li>
            <li> So very hard to explain!</li>
            <li> this fragrance was very weak , the scent doesn&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li> Lots of people complain and say they are fake, but TM does this.</li>
            <li> the atomizer is difficult to press and I have to use two hands.</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE</li>
            <li> I think it is very poor packaging.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, disappointed.</li>
            <li> I said before, every time I smell this off my girlfriend, I go crazy.</li>
            <li> My wife is crazy about ANGEL and she wears it day and night</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> and so I didn&#x27;t realize just how bad this stuff was until this morning</li>
            <li> stupid of me</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle had a very bad scratch on it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> i went to Macy&#x27;s to check out it and compared it no comparison , very disappointed</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I get the most compliments when I&#x27;m wearing angel!</li>
            <li> Good product.  Very good price.</li>
            <li> My wife loves Angel Perfume and the slanted star shaped bottle it comes in. I had contemplated purchasing a refill bottle for her empty bottle but instead opted for buying the more expensive larger star shaped 3.4oz bottle.  The photograph for this item shows the same type of bottle which we had previously purchased so I expected the same, just larger.  What we received was a tall bottle, while it has its own interesting shape it is not what we expected.  It is similar to what is sold as a tester or refill on Amazon for about $20 less than what we paid.  I will use this one to refill her other bottle so it works out in the end, but wanted to let other buyers know before they make the same mistake.  The add does state that the packaging may vary but I thought they meant the box the bottle comes in which was also shown in the product photo.</li>
            <li> My anty love love loved this perfume and delivery was quick!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. Great size - great price!</li>
            <li> I absolutely, would recommend this to everyone.  You don t need to put that much on.  It lasts all day.  You ll get complements.  Price is good.  I called a high end, dept store, and they charge a lot.  for the same size i paid on amazon.  you won t be unhappy with Alien either from Thierry Mugler.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Angel is elderly &amp; invasive w/its powders &amp; patchouli driving caustic sugary mud.  Try something fresher &amp; lighter that reveals your personality rather than acting as an olfactory bullhorn forewarning your arrival a half mile in advance.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume!  Becomes mellow with each passing hour, soft and un-intrusive.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent.  I get more queries about it than any other perfume I wear.  This was a gift for my mother, who will also have to field such comments.</li>
            <li> I just got this parfum for my mom, as a Christmas present.  It came as promised, brand new, in an original package, and on time.  My mom loved it!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> The Angel fragrance is perfect as usual; however, the sprayer (atomizer) doesn&#x27;t work properly. I recommend the fragrance...not so much the bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this as deodorant. No idea how it would combine with other people&#x27;s arm pit aroma but for me it changes with my odor as it changes; always pleasant</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume ever!!!!!!!  I honestly can&#x27;t live without this Angel!  I was out for almost 6 months until I bought this giant bottle!</li>
            <li> Awesome! !!! Delivered as promised...</li>
            <li> This is a great scent love smelling this on my wife. Second time I have purchased this product. The package that the perfume came in had a gift code inside the package, but it was cut out by someone before it was shipped. This is the second time this company has shipped a box with this code cut out of the original packaging. Not professional in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice fragrance, I always have someone saying, what is that fragrance?  Also, it is my nickname from my hubby!</li>
            <li> Best fragrance ever made!  I get lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> My favorite. Always compliments from strangers no less</li>
            <li> The bottle sprayer is very difficult and not sure it will last the entire bottle through. When I try to press down, it is very difficult and then it streams out heavily spraying out a lot of perfume.</li>
            <li> This is not the real perfume. Deceiving packaging. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Got it quick, no problems!!  Thanks</li>
            <li> FRAUD!  NOT Angel perfume.  Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I ripped the page off a magazine, that had the scent of Angel. I kept it on my bedside table, and it gave off such a delicious fragrance. I knew I HAD to buy it.  I started checking it on google and Amazon had the best price on it. Now I use it every day, although I have many perfumes. Since I received it, it&#x27;s the ONLY one I use on a daily basis. I love it. It&#x27;s a youthfulul scent, very delicate. And the bottle itself is very attractive too, I recomment it highly. It&#x27;s something I will definitely buy for gifts to my friends,</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. Always get many compliments and inquiries about what I&#x27;m wearing.  It is my go to fragrance.</li>
            <li> For people that don&#x27;t know, the codes under the top flap are required to be cut out by the company before being sold at a discount price.  Lots of people complain and say they are fake, but TM does this.</li>
            <li> There is no scent its like spraying water, it does not last.  I am very disappointed as I have purchased previously and was pleased.</li>
            <li> Smells good. At first it smelled like i remembered it but after the first week i guess it lost its potency. Now it smells different everytime I put it on. I still get compliments everywhere i go. I will buy Angel again but probably give up the extra money and purchase straight from a reputable supplier like Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my wife online. I didn&#x27;t smell it before. At first when I smelled it hated it. However, it wasn&#x27;t before long before my wife and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff.....Best place to get it...</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume!!</li>
            <li> Very upset. the smell does not stay more than half an hour. Nothing like the one I buy from the department store</li>
            <li> This was a great gift for my wife and the price was even better will always recommend this to my friends for a gift</li>
            <li> I ordered Angel and Estee Lauder at the same time.  These are two fragrances that I have worn and loved for years.  I loved the price; but I kind of believe both bottles were knock offs.</li>
            <li> I have worn Angel for many years and have received many compliments, I would recommend it to anyone that likes a cologne that isn&#x27;t strong smelling.</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume ever!!!! I don&#x27;t know what others have gotten but this is the real deal. I&#x27;ve been a loyal fan of Angel EDP for over 20 years &amp; converted many followers. Once you try it you will never be satisfied with any other perfume again. Excellent product, shipping time, price, and overall satisfaction. I highly recommend this seller and this product. ***Angel Forever***...thanks T.Mugler from a die hard, true blue worshipper...DZ</li>
            <li> Another strong, long lasting perfume.  Always catches my attention when someone walks by wearing it.</li>
            <li> I have at least 20 bottles of perfume, but this is the one I normally reach for.</li>
            <li> This smells like spicy honey to me.  It&#x27;s interesting anyway.  Not what I was expecting.  Not very strong.  Light scent.  I like it.</li>
            <li> This is the &amp;#34;Big Bottle&amp;#34; that stands on it&#x27;s own...PERFECT.  This is a gift and I was happy that it arrived so quickly.  Great price and it smells great.  I recommend this seller and this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased through amazon prime. Sold by Amazon and shipped by Amazon. Box opened and resealed from bottom. Serial number at the bottom cut out and replaced with tacky bar-code. Smell like Angel but its disappear in few minutes. It&#x27;s already given to someone but I peak to box before pack it. It was too late to return. Lesson learn NEVER buy fragrance from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Angel and although I don&#x27;t wear it every day, I like having some around for times I need a dose.  I also like lightly misting my pillowcases with the fragrance so I smell it while going to sleep and waking up!</li>
            <li> Love this!  So happy to be able to find it online.  Saves me a trip to the mall!</li>
            <li> When I received my Angel perfume, it was perfectly sealed in the box. I noticed the special code in the box had been cut out so I suspected it was counterfit. For the price, I would expect it to be authentic.  Amazon provided me with a refund within 24 hours of contacting them, which is one of the many reasons I love shopping with them.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It is a great scent, lasts all day!  I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This a soft feminine sent that lasts a long time even on my skin which usually doesn&#x27;t .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this on Amazon! I love Angel eau de toilette and when I saw the large bottle for half off the normal price, I immediately ordered it. As soon as I got it and smelled it, I knew it wasn&#x27;t right. The bottle looked authentic and the smell was similar, but it wasn&#x27;t Angel. The smell was almost nauseating. I called Amazon and they were wonderful. They gave me a full refund on the return. The lesson here is don&#x27;t buy perfume on line unless it&#x27;s from the original company or a reputable department store or Sephora. There are a lot of counterfeit perfume makers out there. If the price looks too good to be true- it probably is.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for almost 20 years...I love it.  I am complimented on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, I was a little skeptical ordering this. I have bought and worn Angel for years, always paying the high prices at department stores. I am not sure what others were receiving, but this arrived in an intact package, and this is the real thing. Others said it smelled like a cheap knock-off. I am telling you, this was no knock-off. This is the genuine Eau De Parfum that I have paid at least twice as much for in high-end department stores. VERY satisfied customer. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This perfume was a gift for my wife. It is the real deal. Saved a lot of money over buying it at a department store.</li>
            <li> Thankfully received and wearing - always get compliments on this scent!</li>
            <li> This is not Angel..  At all this is counterfeit</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume and with free shipping from amazon I could not pass it up</li>
            <li> My signature perfume. Fantastic price! Great size. Way cheaper than macys for the same thing.</li>
            <li> my wife loves the smell</li>
            <li> This was a Mother&#x27;s Day gift to her.  Scent is awesome., long lasting, and lasts all day. I will be re-ordering in the future.</li>
            <li> My wife likes to wear a lot of different perfumes.  This is my favorite on her.  I buy refills happily.</li>
            <li> I use Angel perfume daily but the bottle I ordered does not smell like what I buy from Macy&#x27;s. I think it is watered down.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, never get sick of it. This is the only perfume that I have worn for many years.  My kids love how it smells on me.  I get compliments daily.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this perfum for seven years ! She is amazed how often people ask what she has on,how much thy like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance, but my code to join Thierry Mugler&#x27;s exclusive Circle was removed from the inside of the box. I&#x27;d really like to know why!</li>
            <li> The plastic outer wrap had been taped shut at bottom (first clue) and it smells nothing like Angel which I&#x27;ve worn exclusively for years.  Amazon did refund our money, but PLEASE do not waste your time ordering this fake. (Forced to give at least one star)</li>
            <li> Good price for my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Great scent at a great price, my wife wears nothing else.  However, the first bottle I received had the Angel club code cut out of the inside of the box (though it appeared to be a sealed package), and the liquid in the bottle was definitely not Angel.  Amazon agreed to send replacement, but upon receipt it was evident that it too had been tampered with (now that I knew what to look for).  The code inside the second had been removed and the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; in that bottle was also nothing like Angel.  Amazon did completely refund my $, and stated they would pull the listing until the problem was resolved.  Does this mean the issue is fixed??? I won&#x27;t try again (despite the great price).  Spraying unknown liquids of questionable origin seems a little too risky to me.  I&#x27;d rather spend the extra $ to ensure quality product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent and so does any one who passes by me.  I&#x27;m always stopped and askedwhat I&#x27;m wearing.  I have been wearing different Thierry Mugler Parfums for years, but &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; is my favorite.  And Amazon&#x27;s price was amazing!</li>
            <li> Excellent !! Fast service. A+++</li>
            <li> Some reviews wrote Angel didnt come as pictured in original packaging was not so here my wife was very satisfied</li>
            <li> My former girlfriend loved it. Too bad I spent that much money on her though, and she didn&#x27;t appreciate it!!</li>
            <li> Have purchased this many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this fragrance one day as I went into a mall in Florida. A woman passed me and I smelled her perfume. I could not believe how good it smelled. It is the first and only time, I turned around and ran after her to tell her how incredible she smelled and ask her what she was wearing. She seemed genuinely pleased that I had stopped her to ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I went to the nearest store in the mall that sold it and bought it for my wife. And it still has the same effect on me. It is a most incredible smell. Very unique. Not like many of the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel the same about the Angel for men. Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I think I like Angel but I haven&#x27;t been able to get a real bottle of it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Watered down. I have used Angel for years...... and this is not Angel. Going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first bottle of Angel ten years ago and even though I try other perfumes, I keep coming back to it. I love the warm, inviting, sophisticated aura that envelopes me when I wear it. I also love that I can still smell it on my wrist the next day when I wake up. It is definitely worth the money. My last 3.4oz bottle lasted me almost 2 years with nearly daily use. The difference between this and cheaper perfumes is that one or two spritzes is enough to last the whole day and into the next. The initial application smells strongly of spices, musk and amber, and when it dries down after a few hours I begin to get the cocoa, vanilla, and pachouli notes.&lt;br /&gt;I always limit myself to 2 spray per day because it can be too strong, especially in small spaces like an airplane. And I don&#x27;t spray right before a flight, more like 2 hours before. I&#x27;ve had many passengers go through duty free and spray themselves silly, then immediately board the plane only to make the whole plane sick from the smell. Even though I love the scent there is such a thing as too much of a good thing in this case.&lt;br /&gt;I spritz in two places-my wrist and the nape of my neck, which makes my hair smell lovely all day. It is well worth the money, and even better that I can get it at nearly half price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the only fragrance I wear.  I get compliments all the time.  It has become my signature scent.  It&#x27;s such a perfect blend of sweet and earthy.  So very hard to explain!</li>
            <li> Great and fast delivery!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> YOU CAN&#x27;T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!</li>
            <li> This fragrance drives me wild. It&#x27;s seductive, sweet, and perfect for intimate wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening gives a blast of chocolate, a mild tar note, sandalwood, and some florals.&lt;br /&gt;During the dry down, tongka bean, chocolate, sandalwood, and bergamont become present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said before, every time I smell this off my girlfriend, I go crazy. I highly recommend going easy on the sprays though, it&#x27;s a very strong perfume and lasts a long time. 2 sprays would suffice - 3 the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great fragrance to wear during the Fall and Winter seasons, try this fragrance on your skin. You might fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume and it is always a home run when I give it to her. I like the fragrance as well. Fresh and reminds me of my teens.</li>
            <li> My package of woman&#x27;s and men&#x27;s was opened and revealed.  Amazon gave me a full refund but know I question if what I got was really some boot leg bottle of something else.  Very disappointed.  Based on other reviews they have had this problem for a LONG time.  Come on amazon, you just lost my business on this product forever and I will be cautious of anything you sell going forward.  They said they were going to pull this product but it is still here.</li>
            <li> It was a birthday gift for my daughter-in-law, and Amazon got it to me in time for the big day.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love,this perfume. I cannot say more, It is incredible! My husband cannot get enough of me when I wear it!</li>
            <li> Ohhh I smell so wonderful.  Great buy.  Very please.</li>
            <li> Fabulous! Definitely the real thing. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Either this perfume is old or not authentic. Poor quality, disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this scent for years. Keep buying.</li>
            <li> Almost got twice as much product instead of purchasing at the store.&lt;br /&gt;People compliment the fragrance. Would highly recommend !</li>
            <li> To start off, Angel has always been my favorite perfume; when i received it in the mail, it was EXACTLY what i ordered! The smell was AMAZINNGG! Not only is it a big bottle but the scent lasts very long; if you&#x27;re on a budget yet want something good that lasts, then i HIGHLY recommend this product to you. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT! (:</li>
            <li> Awesome.  My f&amp;agrave;vorite scent for 15 years.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this perfume that it has become my very&lt;br /&gt;favorite scent. Try it and you&#x27;ll love it !!!</li>
            <li> My wife is crazy about ANGEL and she wears it day and night and i love the smell of it .</li>
            <li> A lovely scent that is soft, angelic, and somewhat mysterious. It lasts a long time, and I can usually still smell it faintly the next day. My husband, who rarely comments on perfume, loved this one on me. If you are buying the large 3.4 ounce refillable bottle, it comes in a lovely tall bottle called Rising Star. If you want the star-shaped bottle, (Shooting Star), go with the smaller 1.7 ounce bottle. Whatever bottle you choose, this perfume is beautiful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake don&#x27;t buy it! Nordstroms confirmed it&#x27;s fake!</li>
            <li> This Scent is so singular and recognizable that people often say to my gf &#x27;that&#x27;s Angel you&#x27;re wearing, isn&#x27;t it?&#x27;</li>
            <li> This is a 100% counterfeit product! Even if you buy it from Amazon, LLC. I have been using Thierry Mugler Angel for years,and this is not the same smell and the packaging is totally different. The unique product code is marked out. It is if they used an authentic bottle, and filled it up with alcohol. Also, the bottle had a very bad scratch on it. I have pictures as well. You can&#x27;t even ask for money back because it is flammable liquid..! Please avoid ordering this one online!</li>
            <li> Everyone....Please listen to me!&lt;br /&gt;I have worn Angel for years, it&#x27;s my favorite and I know the fragrance well. This is ABSOLUTLEY NOT Angel. This product doesn&#x27;t come from Amazon directly but rather from another source and so Amazon doesn&#x27;t test it OR guarantee it. I&#x27;m not sure if the company that sells this junk sends out an occasional bottle of the real Angel just to get a few good reviews or if the people who have reviewed it positively don&#x27;t know what the real Angel is like, OR most likely the company itself is having people review it positively for them.....in either case, this stuff is junk and who knows &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34;!!!! Lord only knows what the heck is in it....&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m so disappointed that Amazon allows these folks to stay on their otherwise, terrific site. I should have read the reviews....stupid of me but again, you don&#x27;t expect this kind of blatant bad buisness on Amazon and when I saw the product had four star, I fell for it...This morning I&#x27;ve gone back and looked at the reviews and it seems to me if you get THIS MANY BAD REVIEWS, Amazon would discontinue their relationship with the seller. I&#x27;ve been buying from Amazon almost since the day they started and I love the prices and products. In the past many years I&#x27;ve only returned an ipad cover, so I&#x27;m not picky...but this is an over the top bad product...junk, pure and simple.....&lt;br /&gt;When the package arrived I noticed that the little sticker on the top of the package was loose but I didn&#x27;t think anything of it. Because I had a bottle of Angel that I was finishing up, I didn&#x27;t open the package straight away and so I didn&#x27;t realize just how bad this stuff was until this morning and I&#x27;m LIVID.&lt;br /&gt;What I think this product is a knock off perfume that you can buy in drugstores for $10 a bottle....that&#x27;s the kind of off brand smell it has.....just weak and off the mark...it doesn&#x27;t even feel right on the skin when you spray it....it looks ok in the package but believe you will be sorry if your try to save a few bucks and buy this. I Promise you.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you this, if they don&#x27;t refund my money I will have a FIT...to save a few bucks and buy this. I Promise you.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you this, if they don&#x27;t refund my money I will have a FIT...</li>
            <li> NOT REAL. Do not bother buying this junk.</li>
            <li> the atomizer is difficult to press and I have to use two hands. Often nothing comes out. I think it is very poor packaging. I stopped using the star bottle also. I may have to switch to another perfume because of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It was poor substitute of original item.</li>
            <li> this fragrance was very weak , the scent doesn&#x27;t hold. i went to Macy&#x27;s to check out it and compared it no comparison , very disappointed</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when wearing this perfume! When I needed a refill, I priced it at Macys but decided to see if I could get it for less. The price was great, shipping fast, and I&#x27;ll have enough to last at least a year.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Get positive comments on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Parfum now. My husband suggested it and he made a wise choice. So sexy smelling to him which I love.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Loved it.was for my son&#x27;s girl friend</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews first and but having 4 stars threw me off. Had I read the negative reviews, I would never have purchased the product because it appears to be too controversial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a frequent amazon buyer for a wide variety of products and purchased this larger bottle for my wife as she loves the scent the perfume has and when we received the product, the first thing I noticed was the plastic wrapper was ill-fitting and appears not factory applied.  After a couple of days of using the product, my wife complained to me that  the scent disappears after 30 minutes or so.  She told me that good perfume remains on her skin for hours.  Upon reading the reviews, this complaint has been a common theme and has gone on for quite some time with some of the writers surmising the product is watered down.  Some of the UPC codes in the box were covered with other codes.  The primary UPC still functions but the bottom line is my wife is not happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon and they provided a full refund including shipping &amp; tax. For that we are extremely grateful and will continue to use the service.</li>
            <li> I received this within 2 days of ordering!  Wow!</li>
            <li> the colour was really off</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance, and it was a good price.... ...... ........ ........ ....... .... .... ...... ...... ...... ... ..</li>
            <li> Excellent product,..!!! cheers..!!</li>
            <li> Angel has been &#x27;my&#x27; fragrance for years, and still, to me, nothing comes close.  Soft, feminine and lasting, with beautiful notes of patchouli and chocolate, Angel is an addiction that I&#x27;m proud to have.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the Angle. You can not go wrong with this one. Buy it now, you will love it.</li>
            <li> Everything ok, recommend this seller. Tks!</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and cheaper than in store!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance.  I&#x27;ve used it for years .  It is my favorite.  This bottle doesn&#x27;t come with a spray so need to be aware of that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this perfume before and my opinion hasn&#x27;t changed.  This scent is heavenly.  People will stop you and repeatedly ask what you are wearing, and it lasts all day into the evening so you need very little.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have an authentic bottle of Thierry Mugler Angel at home. The new order from Perfume World arrived and the first thing I noticed is that the smell was  not Angel. Then I compared the boxes. The new purchase from Perfume World through Amazon had a fake website and the unique code marked out. I want my money back and I want others to know that they can be duped also - even if Amazon sells the product. I can supply image documentation. The fragrance is absolutely not the same.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, great bottle, and you can get it refilled and save money.  Refillable in some department stores like N&lt;br /&gt;Bloomingdales, but cheaper to get the starter here</li>
            <li> This is packaged as Angel, but does not smell like Angel.  After the strong alcohol smell wears off, I smell vanilla and baby powder.  I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s a knockoff or just old Angel.</li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE</li>
            <li> I have been using Angel for many years, and it is my favorite fragrance. When I saw this item - twice the ounces for only 50% more, I bought it. It came today.&lt;br /&gt;It looks real. But whatever is in the bottle does not smell like Angel. I am very disappointed. I wonder if it is counterfeit or something.</li>
            <li> I received my favorite perfume  and love it.  thank you so much saved myself $100 no longer have to purchase it from Macys can you please send me a email or phone number for future purchase. thank you so much</li>
