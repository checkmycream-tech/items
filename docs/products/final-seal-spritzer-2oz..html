    <ol>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with container as the spray doesnt distribute evenly</li>
            <li>Used this for my wedding and LOVED IT!!!</li>
            <li>but this has helped me a GREAT deal!</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly</li>
            <li>Has a very pleasant mint smell that disappears as soon as it dries.</li>
            <li>This stuff is incredible.</li>
            <li>Great sealer.  </li>
            <li>I had read so many wonderful things about this product that I thought it must be great.</li>
            <li>This product is the best, I am glad a made this purchase.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t  smell good</li>
            <li>Hopefully it works as good as people say, thne</li>
            <li>I applied my makeup at 7 am and at 10pm, it still looked good.</li>
            <li>Used it for an outdoor event at work and loved it.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t perfect at the end of the day, but if I had freshened it up maybe once in the middle of the day, it would have been flawless.</li>
            <li>wonderful smell and works all day in hot humid conditions.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Has a refreshing minty scent when you spray, and works fairly good at keeping make up in place.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely perfect for parties or anything where you absolutely need your make up to stay put.</li>
            <li>This is a great makeup setting spray, the first thing I noticed when I used it is that it smells like mouth wash.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite setting spray.</li>
            <li>I thought it would work a lot better than it did</li>
            <li>Make sure to close your mouth and eyes before spraying :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>It works well if you will be sweaty or touching faces with others like hugging.</li>
            <li>Does it&#x27;s job for the most part.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products like this</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
            <li>So...while I love the product, I would add this improvement - seal the mascara, quick before it bleeds!</li>
            <li>Its quick drying and washes off very easily with an exfoliating body wash and sponge.</li>
            <li>Came off easy with makeup remover wipes.  </li>
            <li>One of those things was that the princesses at Disney World use it to keep their makeup intact, and since it&#x27;s so hot and humid most of the time there, I hoped the product would be as magical as the reviews said it is.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it will spray finely</li>
            <li>My face is a little bit shiny now at the end of the day but the makeup still looks awesome.</li>
            <li>and it definitely kept my makeup looking great</li>
            <li>This was originally bought for my wedding day makeup, but I find myself using it all the time.</li>
            <li>It keeps your makeup on your face and off of your shirt collar, your significant others clothes and anything else that your face my come in contact with.</li>
            <li>fabulous product, can&#x27;t say enough good about it.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>was gone pretty quickly!</li>
            <li>after a long walk outside in the heat, it still looked good!!</li>
            <li>I wish I  could give it a higher rating that 5 stars!</li>
            <li>This spray does exactly what it claims to do!</li>
            <li>and I recommend it to people living in hot climates!</li>
            <li>My only problems with it is the strong minty smell (which I enjoyed</li>
            <li>I used an urban decay product and it was fine, but this is WAY BETTER.</li>
            <li>My make-up stayed fresh and in place throughout the day of my wedding.</li>
            <li>It kept my makeup looking fresh all day</li>
            <li>It is very minty!</li>
            <li>Probably hot water would take care of that.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I accidentally sprayed some in my eye and it hurt.</li>
            <li>I noticed that this does help hold my makeup better but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day or through sweating.</li>
            <li>arrived fast!</li>
            <li>It is very sticky when you first spay it</li>
            <li>I purchased this sealer to use with my Purgatori cosplay this past weekend at Wizard World Chicago Comic Con, I use TAG stage paint, which is fantastic but rubs off easily when I  move and pose for photos after an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>But it goes away fast.</li>
            <li>but I found it made me really oily and didn&#x27;t really help my makeup stay on.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would keep my makeup from smudging as much, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help at all.</li>
            <li>This stuff really helped the makeup stay on for my daughter&#x27;s cosplay that lasted for around 10 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>Worked very well for my rainy wedding day.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for a cosplay and my makeup stayed very well intact for 12+ hours.</li>
            <li>which also means if you rub your face on anything, your makeup will chip/flake off much like hairspray instead of gently rub off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s partially my own fault too because I didn&#x27;t notice in the product description that it&#x27;s only the one, smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>I felt like I had to use more and half the bottle</li>
            <li>Not only did my body paint stay totally intact, but it also seemed to set the paint, making it richer and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Only useful in avoiding transfer of make up.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my graduation day because I did not know what the weather in New England would be like that day</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry!  </li>
            <li>The spritzer on these bottles does not create a fine enough mist, and it can sometimes dry in these patches/blobs that leave a shiny residue on your skin.</li>
            <li>It COMPLETELY waterproofs your makeup-- including sweat.</li>
            <li>It kept my make up in place, but I believe this spritzer should be used for heavy make up not for light coverage.</li>
            <li>But it really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal</li>
            <li>I used it on a day that I knew would be extremely hot and where I would be outdoors for a long period of time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sweater and with this summer heat I don&#x27;t think anything will keep my make-up on completely</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see any different in my make up not coming off</li>
            <li>Once I got caught in a summer storm with a full face including eyeshadow and winged liner, and while my paper grocery bag broke down and spilled my stuff all over the street, my makeup stayed put.</li>
            <li>It is a MATTE face spray, and if your face is dry/powdery/cakey it will dry and set that way, so make sure your makeup is slightly dewy before using this product.</li>
            <li>And waiting for the sealer to dry, then applying the mascara and curling the lashes adds time to the whole process.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that the product would be better off in aerosol bottle.</li>
            <li>Even after being completely submerged multiple times in water, my make up was still in place!</li>
            <li>Burns a little when I spray it on my face, but it does keep the make up in place much longer.</li>

            <li> It does dry matte and it has totally extended the life of my makeup.</li>
            <li> You spray your face after you&#x27;ve completed your entire face of makeup and allow it to dry.</li>
            <li> I will say, when you spray it on and you are waiting on it to dry, you should constantly move your face around or this stuff feels like it&#x27;s gluing your face in a permanent position.</li>
            <li> It doesnt make my face feel dry or as if I sprayed hairspray.</li>
            <li> but it does dry</li>
            <li> If you keep your face still while it&#x27;s drying, after it&#x27;s dry, your face will feel like it&#x27;s going to crack!</li>
            <li> Then spray (with your eyes closed, of course.)</li>
            <li> It can be a little drying, but if you have oily skin and are sweating it won&#x27;t be noticeable.</li>
            <li> It worked for a little bit, but not all day.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the mascara bleeds a little.</li>
            <li> Have had it for a little over a month</li>
            <li> Wait a few seconds before opening your eyes.</li>
            <li> The bottle was small and it stung a little, but it did the job it was supposed to do - keep that makeup on the face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do besides smell like minty mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I guess I could spray before applying the mascara, but I&#x27;m a No More Than 5 Minutes for Make-Up Application kinda person.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wedding since it was an outdoor wedding in late July.</li>
            <li> And as others have mentioned, the sprayer is not great, although I think it&#x27;s not the sprayer itself but that the product builds up on the nozzle.</li>
            <li> The product did seal in my makeup and make it last along with a base primer.  </li>
            <li> but others may find annoying), and the fact that because it&#x27;s so sticky, it drys stiff your face feels like it has a layer of hairspray on it;</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t be so bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a great makeup setting spray, the first thing I noticed when I used it is that it smells like mouth wash. But it goes away fast. It does dry matte and it has totally extended the life of my makeup. It doesnt make my face feel dry or as if I sprayed hairspray. Will repurchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. I used to act in plays, but I didn&#x27;t come upon this until I was looking for the ultimate setting spray for summer. I used an urban decay product and it was fine, but this is WAY BETTER. It COMPLETELY waterproofs your makeup-- including sweat. I wore it basically every day last summer and while you still sweat, the makeup stays put through it. Once I got caught in a summer storm with a full face including eyeshadow and winged liner, and while my paper grocery bag broke down and spilled my stuff all over the street, my makeup stayed put. It can be a little drying, but if you have oily skin and are sweating it won&#x27;t be noticeable. I would recommend putting on lip balm before spraying this, though, if you&#x27;re not wearing lipcolor (I often don&#x27;t) or if your lipcolor is drying itself. It is very minty! Would definitely sting eyes, so close your eyes when spraying if that&#x27;s not obvious. And as others have mentioned, the sprayer is not great, although I think it&#x27;s not the sprayer itself but that the product builds up on the nozzle. Probably hot water would take care of that. But if you need to be waterproof or sweatproof, this is the stuff.</li>
            <li> fabulous product, can&#x27;t say enough good about it. wonderful smell and works all day in hot humid conditions. -Mrs Boothe</li>
            <li> Not my favorite setting spray. I&#x27;ve read a lot of hype about it but I found it made me really oily and didn&#x27;t really help my makeup stay on.</li>
            <li> I thought it would work a lot better than it did</li>
            <li> I tried this spritzer and I&#x27;m on the fence with this product.  It kept my make up in place, but I believe this spritzer should be used for heavy make up not for light coverage.</li>
            <li> I had read so many wonderful things about this product that I thought it must be great. One of those things was that the princesses at Disney World use it to keep their makeup intact, and since it&#x27;s so hot and humid most of the time there, I hoped the product would be as magical as the reviews said it is. It wasn&#x27;t. The first time I used this, I accidentally sprayed some in my eye and it hurt. My eyeball felt like it had just been dunked in mouthwash! I was looking for something that would keep my makeup from smudging as much, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help at all. I&#x27;m not exactly sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do besides smell like minty mouthwash. I had to wash my hands after every use because it&#x27;s sticky, and after several months of using it I know I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Burns a little when I spray it on my face, but it does keep the make up in place much longer.</li>
            <li> It keeps make up in place but it&#x27;s spotty...</li>
            <li> Has a refreshing minty scent when you spray, and works fairly good at keeping make up in place. Make sure to close your mouth and eyes before spraying :)</li>
            <li> Feels cake on the face and adds to shine. Only useful in avoiding transfer of make up. Doesn&#x27;t  smell good</li>
            <li> The picture is misleading. It&#x27;s partially my own fault too because I didn&#x27;t notice in the product description that it&#x27;s only the one, smaller bottle. Otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this, not for this price. Hopefully it works as good as people say, thne it won&#x27;t be so bad.</li>
            <li> I noticed that this does help hold my makeup better but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day or through sweating.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my graduation day because I did not know what the weather in New England would be like that day and it&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry!  I didn&#x27;t want to look like I was melting in pictures later in the day as it was an entire day of multiple events.  The product did seal in my makeup and make it last along with a base primer.  It did not cause my makeup to appear blotchy, overly dewy or matte.  The only thing that I wish was slightly different is how the bottle sprays.  Sometimes it will spray finely but you will get a few spots on your face with too much product.  But it really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal I just pat it off.</li>
            <li> The bottle was small and it stung a little, but it did the job it was supposed to do - keep that makeup on the face!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff... I bought it for my wedding since it was an outdoor wedding in late July. I tested it out one day when I had to be in a dunking booth... Even after being completely submerged multiple times in water, my make up was still in place! I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This stuff really helped the makeup stay on for my daughter&#x27;s cosplay that lasted for around 10 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;Even after a long walk outside in the heat, it still looked good!!</li>
            <li> This was originally bought for my wedding day makeup, but I find myself using it all the time. It works well if you will be sweaty or touching faces with others like hugging. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with container as the spray doesnt distribute evenly but I think the product in itsel works well. I used it on a day that I knew would be extremely hot and where I would be outdoors for a long period of time and it definitely kept my makeup looking great and I didnt sweat. I applied my makeup at 7 am and at 10pm, it still looked good. I was outdoors for 7 hours during that time in 90 degree weather so I would definitely reommend it. Giving this a 4 star rating based on the spray bottle</li>
            <li> I purchased this sealer to use with my Purgatori cosplay this past weekend at Wizard World Chicago Comic Con, I use TAG stage paint, which is fantastic but rubs off easily when I  move and pose for photos after an extended period of time. Not only did my body paint stay totally intact, but it also seemed to set the paint, making it richer and more vibrant. I wish I  could give it a higher rating that 5 stars! Its quick drying and washes off very easily with an exfoliating body wash and sponge.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Great sealer.  Got me through a couple Halloween parties without any smears or costume stains.  Came off easy with makeup remover wipes.  Has a very pleasant mint smell that disappears as soon as it dries.</li>
            <li> My make-up stayed fresh and in place throughout the day of my wedding. It didn&#x27;t even smudge when the tears started. Highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels like I sprayed extra hold hairspray on my face, caused blotchy spots, will have to put it in a different spray bottle, if I decide to use it again</li>
            <li> Used this for my wedding and LOVED IT!!! Make-up stayed on all afternoon/evening!!</li>
            <li> Worked very well for my rainy wedding day.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job for the most part. I&#x27;m a sweater and with this summer heat I don&#x27;t think anything will keep my make-up on completely but this has helped me a GREAT deal! I wish the bottle was bigger. I&#x27;ll be ordering refill solution soon!</li>
            <li> Used this to keep my makeup put on my wedding day. I have to say it did its job! Only complaint is that the product would be better off in aerosol bottle. The spritzer on these bottles does not create a fine enough mist, and it can sometimes dry in these patches/blobs that leave a shiny residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> This product is the best, I am glad a made this purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like makeup cement. It is absolutely perfect for parties or anything where you absolutely need your make up to stay put. I purchased this for a cosplay and my makeup stayed very well intact for 12+ hours. It wasn&#x27;t perfect at the end of the day, but if I had freshened it up maybe once in the middle of the day, it would have been flawless. My only problems with it is the strong minty smell (which I enjoyed but others may find annoying), and the fact that because it&#x27;s so sticky, it drys stiff your face feels like it has a layer of hairspray on it; which also means if you rub your face on anything, your makeup will chip/flake off much like hairspray instead of gently rub off. I also wouldn&#x27;t recumbent this product if you want a dewy finish. It is a MATTE face spray, and if your face is dry/powdery/cakey it will dry and set that way, so make sure your makeup is slightly dewy before using this product. I&#x27;ve mixed mine with some rosewater toner and it is my makeup SAVIOR.</li>
            <li> I like it, stay put. arrived fast!</li>
            <li> It worked for a little bit, but not all day. I felt like I had to use more and half the bottle was gone pretty quickly! I&#x27;ve used many products like this and it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
            <li> It is very sticky when you first spay it but it does dry I really don&#x27;t see any different in my make up not coming off</li>
            <li> my make up still gets oily, and my face burns from this product. I will not be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Overpriced for amount of product received</li>
            <li> I was looking for a &amp;#34;sealer&amp;#34; to keep my eye shadow from fading as the day wore on. This does the job. You apply the make-up. Then spray (with your eyes closed, of course.) Wait a few seconds before opening your eyes. Now this is where the item lost the 5th star. Sometimes the mascara bleeds a little. I guess I could spray before applying the mascara, but I&#x27;m a No More Than 5 Minutes for Make-Up Application kinda person. And waiting for the sealer to dry, then applying the mascara and curling the lashes adds time to the whole process. So...while I love the product, I would add this improvement - seal the mascara, quick before it bleeds!</li>
            <li> This spray does exactly what it claims to do! You spray your face after you&#x27;ve completed your entire face of makeup and allow it to dry. It keeps your makeup on your face and off of your shirt collar, your significant others clothes and anything else that your face my come in contact with. I will say, when you spray it on and you are waiting on it to dry, you should constantly move your face around or this stuff feels like it&#x27;s gluing your face in a permanent position. If you keep your face still while it&#x27;s drying, after it&#x27;s dry, your face will feel like it&#x27;s going to crack!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help set my makeup for a wedding that I was a part of.  This definitely did the job!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I was in a wedding today so my makeup was put on around 10am, it lasted through tears at the ceremony, sweat for outdoor pictures in August in Florida, and lots of dancing at the reception. My face is a little bit shiny now at the end of the day but the makeup still looks awesome.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Have had it for a little over a month and I use it everyday! Works perfectly and I recommend it to people living in hot climates! My makeup lasts all day and I know when I run out I&#x27;m going to have to make another order for the Ben nye !</li>
            <li> Used it for an outdoor event at work and loved it. It kept my makeup looking fresh all day</li>
