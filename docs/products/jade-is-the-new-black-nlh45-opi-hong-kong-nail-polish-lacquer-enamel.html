            <li>The nail polish itself goes on smooth and even and has a nice shine to it.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this Jade color from OPI.  </li>

            <li>Application is pretty good with only two coats needed to get a good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was unique and beautiful in the bottle, however on my hand -- it was not the same.</li>
            <li>The color is like actual jade, and with two coats max you have a great richness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderfully glinting green.</li>
            <li>It does look good on many different skin colors, however it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this color and so quickly!</li>
            <li>However, the shipping was very fast and the polish seems ok, so</li>
            <li>This should be a fun one and can&#x27;t wait for St. Paddy&#x27;s day!</li>
            <li>The pigment is so rich that you don&#x27;t even have to put on two coats if you don&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a unique color that pops while it is not too bright of fluorescent enough to be obnoxious.</li>
            <li>BUT THIS ONE WAS REALLY TRUE TO COLOR</li>
            <li>the first coat that you put on looks like a jade color, but the more coats you put on turns into a very nice light forest green color.</li>
            <li>this color is VERY pretty.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my new favorite by OPI.</li>
            <li>OPI nail polishes are awesome and they last quite a long time.</li>
            <li>It goes on evenly and has a nice wide brush for easy application.  </li>
            <li>Went on great, I thought it was too dark when I first saw it but loved it after I put it on and lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>A great for year round color for any skin tone.</li>
            <li>Most turn out looking like Christmas or that I&#x27;m a 5 year old.</li>

            <li>Love the different names!</li>
            <li>overall what you see on the bottle is the color that you will achieve when you apply 2 or more coats.</li>
            <li>I was really pleased when this item arrived only two days after I ordered it.</li>

            <li>keep getting compliments after compliments, it won&#x27;t go unnoticed, but in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good green nail polish for the longest time.  </li>
            <li>However, the top of the nail polish bottle is not an actual OPI black top, and the bottle was not sealed which makes me wonder whether or not it had been used before me.</li>
            <li>The polish is very pigmented takes 2 coats max.</li>
            <li>also it was extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love OPI nail polish, thought this would be more of a deep green color...</li>
            <li>Color was better than I expected from the picture.</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous and a really classy green.  </li>
            <li>This is such a rich and enchanting color of green.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li>Jade is The New Black is beautiful green nail polish.  </li>
            <li>so I might be biased, but this is such a gorgeous green!</li>
            <li>it was more on the pastel side of green...</li>
            <li>an instant classic.&lt;br /&gt;The color is very refined and classy while being very original.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments by both men and women on my green nails!</li>
            <li>I can usually get away with just 2 coats for most colors, but sometimes throw on another one.</li>
            <li>Jade is such an unusual color</li>
            <li>IVE COMBINED IT WITH AND SHOWS UP SO CLASSY ON THE NAILS.</li>
            <li>Also a major plus</li>
            <li>it is a very pretty shade of green.</li>
            <li>Its a little funky and fun, but I like to branch out.</li>
            <li>This one turns out a little different to the color shown in picutre, but generally is really a cool color.</li>
            <li>I tried the usual 2 coats but the color was nowhere near the color in the picture, this was more like a Christmas green.</li>
            <li>Green is my favorite color and finding a good green polish has been very difficult.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry, either.</li>
            <li> However, this color has the same power of the black.</li>

            <li> It is not as dark as the pictured fingernails on amazon.  </li>
            <li> I wish it dried faster, but other than that I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> GREEN COLORS ARE REALLY HARD TO TELL WHAT ACTUAL COLOR</li>
            <li> recommend this as a replacement for ladies who wear black.</li>
            <li> green is my favourite color</li>
            <li> Seller sent wrong item.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I would try it, sorry I did.</li>
            <li> but I was afraid to wear it on my nails.</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed with the color.</li>

            <li> This polish is great!  It goes on evenly and has a nice wide brush for easy application.  The color is like actual jade, and with two coats max you have a great richness.  It is not as dark as the pictured fingernails on amazon.  It is closer to an ivy color as opposed to a pine, if that makes any sense.  This should be a fun one and can&#x27;t wait for St. Paddy&#x27;s day!</li>
            <li> Opi really knocked it out of the park on this one! It&#x27;s a wonderfully glinting green. Applies beautifully, evenly and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you choose one colour from this collection, let this be it!</li>
            <li> This is no surprise that this color became an instant classic.&lt;br /&gt;The color is very refined and classy while being very original.&lt;br /&gt;Green is my favorite color so I might be biased, but this is such a gorgeous green! Application is pretty good with only two coats needed to get a good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I keep getting compliments after compliments, it won&#x27;t go unnoticed, but in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a definitely a must-have!</li>
            <li> The formula for hong kong is wonderful. The polish is very pigmented takes 2 coats max. It has a wide brush and it applies like a dream. Jade is such an unusual color it will be one of those you&#x27;ll regret not buying.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got this polish it made my favorites list.  It was delivered quickly and in great condition.  The color is gorgeous and a really classy green.  It only needs 1-2 coats.  I got a lot of compliments the first time I wore it.  Definitely a must-have!</li>
            <li> green is my favourite color but I was afraid to wear it on my nails. However, this color has the same power of the black. It&#x27;s go well with everything.</li>
            <li> Love this color. Its a little funky and fun, but I like to branch out. Green is my favorite color and finding a good green polish has been very difficult. Most turn out looking like Christmas or that I&#x27;m a 5 year old. This one turns out a little different to the color shown in picutre, but generally is really a cool color. I&#x27;ve worn it and gotten compliments because it stands out so well. Also a major plus that it came before I thought it would! Bonus! Love the color and would totally buy from this sender again. Great purchase and great price too.</li>
            <li> Opi is a great quality of nail polish. I will only by opi for this reason. Opi seems to not chip as much as other nail polishes. Love the different names!</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS COLOR AND IT BLENDS SO WELL WITH THE OTHER COLORS IVE COMBINED IT WITH AND SHOWS UP SO CLASSY ON THE NAILS. IT LOOKS LIKE A VERY RICH, CLASSY, COLOR ON THE NAIL AND I FELT IT ACTUALLY ENHANCED THE DESIGN. ID BUY THIS AGAIN. GREEN COLORS ARE REALLY HARD TO TELL WHAT ACTUAL COLOR THEY ARE GOING TO COME OUT ON THE NAIL BUT THIS ONE WAS REALLY TRUE TO COLOR AND IT LOOKS GREAT.  DIANNA FROM CALIFORNIA</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish and the color looks amazing! It is quality at a cheap price and surprisingly goes with a lot of outfits.</li>
            <li> O.P.I. is the best brand of nail polish I&#x27;ve ever come across, and this particular color is superb. It goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t peel and scratch off easily. It doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry, either. The pigment is so rich that you don&#x27;t even have to put on two coats if you don&#x27;t want to. It was also nice to not have to pay full salon price (around $10!), even with shipping. I would definitely recommend this brand and color to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a unique color that pops while it is not too bright of fluorescent enough to be obnoxious. Works great on both hands and feet. My favorite OPI yet.</li>
            <li> this color is VERY pretty. the first coat that you put on looks like a jade color, but the more coats you put on turns into a very nice light forest green color. it is a very pretty shade of green. it is a lighter and more sheerer version of opi&#x27;s aragon here gone tomorrow. overall what you see on the bottle is the color that you will achieve when you apply 2 or more coats. this nail polish is must have if you love wearing green nail polish and if you dont, you will learn to love it. also it was extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased when this item arrived only two days after I ordered it. However, the top of the nail polish bottle is not an actual OPI black top, and the bottle was not sealed which makes me wonder whether or not it had been used before me. However, the shipping was very fast and the polish seems ok, so I&#x27;ll give it three stars. But do take notice- my polish was about 2.50, but my shipping and handling for just this was almost 11 dollars. I realized this after ordering, and most salons sell OPI for around 8.50, so I could&#x27;ve purchased it cheaper.</li>
            <li> This was the IT color from the OPI Hong Kong Collection. It was unique and beautiful in the bottle, however on my hand -- it was not the same. I have very pale skin with a hint of yellow (no pink in skin color) and it made my hands look old and just unflattering. It does look good on many different skin colors, however it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> OPI never disappoints! I wear this color during all seasons.</li>
            <li> Bottle and brush were not damaged. I really enjoyed the color! Bottle as a little smudged but no big deal.</li>
            <li> Seller sent wrong item.  I contacted seller who said he would replace it.  3 weeks later, still no replacement.</li>
            <li> it is a beautiful color</li>
            <li> Opi is always a fab polish.</li>
            <li> This is such a rich and enchanting color of green.&lt;br /&gt;The deep color is softer looking than black.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this as a replacement for ladies who wear black.</li>
            <li> You probably would never think of this color, but it is gorgeous and you will love it.</li>
            <li> Love OPI nail polish, thought this would be more of a deep green color... it was more on the pastel side of green...</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments by both men and women on my green nails! This is definitely my new favorite by OPI.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good green nail polish for the longest time.  My mother recommended this one to me.  When I received it in the mail, I was amazed at how beautiful the green is! The nail polish itself goes on smooth and even and has a nice shine to it.  It looks great on my fair skin!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color and is a great nailpolish. It&#x27;s OPOI! This color is so pretty my daughter ended up with it. I had to order a second for myself. LOLOL.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this Jade color from OPI.  Looks great any time of year.  I was so excited to get this color and so quickly!</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polishes and they have always been my go-to nail polishes! OPI nail polishes are awesome and they last quite a long time. Whenever I think that all nail polishes are the same, OPI always reminds me that there is a difference. I love the array of colors that I can choose from. I can usually get away with just 2 coats for most colors, but sometimes throw on another one. The polishes leave a beautiful finish. I have not had any problems with staining or chipping.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, unique green that is perfect for fall/winter. 2 coats is all you need for a lasting finish. I wish it dried faster, but other than that I have no complaints. It&#x27;s a great polish!</li>
            <li> Love it and shine color</li>
            <li> I always wear dark colors ( Essie&#x27;s wicked is my favorite) so I was disappointed with the color. I tried the usual 2 coats but the color was nowhere near the color in the picture, this was more like a Christmas green. I like OPI &amp; had not seen this in the salon or in stores so I thought I would try it, sorry I did. If you are looking for something for the holidays this might be your color....</li>
            <li> 。☆。。☆ 。&lt;br /&gt;★。＼\｜/／。★&lt;br /&gt;  I used this for my nail Spa. customers Love this so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;★。／/｜\＼。★&lt;br /&gt;。☆。。☆</li>
            <li> Jade is The New Black is beautiful green nail polish.  A great for year round color for any skin tone.</li>
            <li> Color was better than I expected from the picture. Love it!</li>
            <li> Went on great, I thought it was too dark when I first saw it but loved it after I put it on and lasted a long time.  I love green nail polish and this is a great deep emerald color.</li>
