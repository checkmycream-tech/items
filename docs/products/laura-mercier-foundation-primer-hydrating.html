            <li>I love Laura Mercier.</li>
            <li>This is mostly oil and seems separated..Not usable</li>
            <li>I feel great putting it on my skin, and I have very sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>I feel my face feels and looks as good by the&lt;br /&gt;end of the day as when I first put my makeup on.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I just wanted to share that a light shake or two doesn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li>This primer goes on smoothly and leaves your skin dewy soft...perfect pallets for my Laura Mercier foundation.</li>
            <li>You have to really shake that tube!!!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  </li>
            <li>So disappointed....ordered the exact same primer again because I loved it..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have large pores and never could find a makeup to make my skin look smooth.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this primer, with some hesitation due to the price, but I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Primer is great for my dry &amp; sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Great product but small amount for the price</li>
            <li>My skin is Very dry, so I was thrilled to find a primer and foundation that leaves my skin feeling moist and supple.</li>
            <li>At first, I tried shaking the tube lightly to get them to mix back together</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;d purchase this again.</li>
            <li>it is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>it can keep almost whole day.</li>
            <li>It fills in crow&#x27;s feet and laugh lines, making you look younger, and it just makes your face look more vibrant overall.</li>
            <li>Other than that the cream does deliver what it&#x27;s supposed to, feels good on the skin and helps makeup last longer.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate and always struggle to keep my face looking hydrated, especially in winter months, and this does the job flawlessly without being heavy or causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>Besides making my skin look smooth, it has also helped take away some dry areas on my face.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s particularly beneficial for somewhat older skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know that my foundation could look so much better with just a little of this product.</li>
            <li>It just felt as though I was putting a moisturizer on my face and did not offer a smooth canvas on my skin as other primers I have tried like Smash Box.</li>
            <li>so I came to leave a review, and found that 1 of the 12 previuos reviewers also had the exact same problem.  </li>
            <li>The first couple days I used this primer, it would come out of the tube with a little of the clear liquid first</li>
            <li>\\&quot;mix\\&quot; the clear liquid and the lotion together</li>
            <li>Light - prevents shine, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy...</li>
            <li>and I ordered early</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating, but I would definitely not consider it a primer.</li>
            <li>and then the pink lotion which I thought was really a pain but workable...</li>
            <li>With all the good reviews maybe I just got a bad tube</li>
            <li>The stuff separated into waterlike clear liquid and pink cream.</li>

            <li> I could not get the pink part of the primer to come out without at least a teaspoon of clear stuff squirting out first.</li>
            <li> I finally emptied the whole thing into a small jar</li>
            <li> So I have to carefully let the clear liquid it drip off from my hand into the sink or a piece of tissue and try to pick up the pink cream that is left to put on my face, and then wipe my hands dry before rubbing the cream onto the entire face.</li>

            <li> Everytime I use it the watery stuff squirts out along with some of the pink cream on to my hand.</li>

            <li> A little dab does it.</li>
            <li> The primer is transluscent, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about matching it to your skin tone and you can use it year round.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel thick or goopy and it won&#x27;t make your skin break out either.</li>
            <li> Not happy....</li>
            <li> sorry!</li>
            <li> For a $30 product this is really awful to have to deal with.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product but small amount for the price</li>
            <li> I got this product in a sample kit. I had never heard of a make-up primer. I didn&#x27;t know that my foundation could look so much better with just a little of this product. Now, I&#x27;m wondering what other things I&#x27;m missing out on.</li>
            <li> Helps my makeup set better. Leaves my skin with a great texture. Doesn&#x27;t feel oily or like silicone.This primer is wonderful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have large pores and never could find a makeup to make my skin look smooth.  After hearing about foundation primers, my research found this product.    This hydrating primer is great.  Besides making my skin look smooth, it has also helped take away some dry areas on my face.  I highly recommend it.[[ASIN:B001M5H000 Laura Mercier Foundation Primer - Hydrating - 50ml-1.7oz]]</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Primer is great for my dry &amp; sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I just started using this primer, with some hesitation due to the price, but I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. The primer is transluscent, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about matching it to your skin tone and you can use it year round. It comes out as a liquid/gel consistency and if you use a foundation brush to apply it the rest of your makeup will go on flawlessly. It doesn&#x27;t feel thick or goopy and it won&#x27;t make your skin break out either. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The first couple days I used this primer, it would come out of the tube with a little of the clear liquid first and then the pink lotion which I thought was really a pain but workable...until I decided to shake the tube to see if I could \\&quot;mix\\&quot; the clear liquid and the lotion together and then it totally seperated! I could not get the pink part of the primer to come out without at least a teaspoon of clear stuff squirting out first. I finally emptied the whole thing into a small jar so I could mix it around with a toothpick before applying it by dipping my finger in it. A big pain! If I hadn&#x27;t spent over $30 on it I would have thrown it away. With all the good reviews maybe I just got a bad tube but I will not purchase again...sorry!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good ,my GF like it</li>
            <li> The stuff separated into waterlike clear liquid and pink cream. Everytime I use it the watery stuff squirts out along with some of the pink cream on to my hand. So I have to carefully let the clear liquid it drip off from my hand into the sink or a piece of tissue and try to pick up the pink cream that is left to put on my face, and then wipe my hands dry before rubbing the cream onto the entire face. For a $30 product this is really awful to have to deal with. Other than that the cream does deliver what it&#x27;s supposed to, feels good on the skin and helps makeup last longer. I couldn&#x27;t believe such defect though so I came to leave a review, and found that 1 of the 12 previuos reviewers also had the exact same problem.  Looks like they need to work on quality control.</li>
            <li> it nothing in regard to makeup prep</li>
            <li> Have used it for over a year now and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Other makeups I have used have felt caked by the end of the day.  I feel my face feels and looks as good by the&lt;br /&gt;end of the day as when I first put my makeup on.</li>
            <li> Love this face primer but I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it&#x27;s very similar to E.L.F Primer. Of course this is more $$$$. It has a nicer feel that&#x27;s more like a lotion than the E.L.F brand so I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;d purchase this again. I&#x27;m no dummy!!</li>
            <li> it is very hydrating. it is a nice product, i love it. it can keep almost whole day. recommond to</li>
            <li> This is by far the best foundation primer I&#x27;ve ever used. It fills in crow&#x27;s feet and laugh lines, making you look younger, and it just makes your face look more vibrant overall. It goes on smoothly, adds moisture without being greasy, and provides a perfect surface for applying foundation. I&#x27;m amazed at what a difference it makes! I live in a dry climate and always struggle to keep my face looking hydrated, especially in winter months, and this does the job flawlessly without being heavy or causing breakouts. I think it&#x27;s particularly beneficial for somewhat older skin (I&#x27;m 39). I can&#x27;t recommend this primer highly enough!  ----Edit 2/10/2012----  I wanted to add that I&#x27;ve encountered the same problem as others have with the cream and liquid separating in the tube. At first, I tried shaking the tube lightly to get them to mix back together but it didn&#x27;t work. Then one day I got super annoyed, shook the tube vigorously for about 20-30 seconds and voila! It worked! Anyway, I just wanted to share that a light shake or two doesn&#x27;t do the trick. You have to really shake that tube!!!</li>
            <li> I love Laura Mercier. This primer goes on smoothly and leaves your skin dewy soft...perfect pallets for my Laura Mercier foundation. My skin is Very dry, so I was thrilled to find a primer and foundation that leaves my skin feeling moist and supple. A little dab does it.</li>
            <li> Light - prevents shine, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy... Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  I feel great putting it on my skin, and I have very sensitive skin!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> So disappointed....ordered the exact same primer again because I loved it..the last one was a cream. This is mostly oil and seems separated..Not usable and I ordered early so I wouldn&#x27;t be out so can not send it back...Not happy....</li>
            <li> This got rave reviews from a makeup artist, so I thought I would give it a try. It is very hydrating, but I would definitely not consider it a primer. It just felt as though I was putting a moisturizer on my face and did not offer a smooth canvas on my skin as other primers I have tried like Smash Box. Maybe one of the other formulas works better, but the hydrating version is a disappointment.</li>
