            <li>and I love the smell!</li>
            <li>The texture, the weight, and the results of this product are amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight and does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>I keep goggling around looking for some kind of treatment/relief</li>
            <li>Thanks HOPE in a jar - all of their products are fabulous!!!!</li>
            <li>Before it was very pleasant - now not so much.</li>
            <li>Perfect for someone with normal skin.</li>
            <li>It is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Nice feel and look to my face many hours after application.</li>
            <li>Price was good, delivery was quick</li>
            <li>I started buying this product after I saw it on Oprah&#x27;s favorite things.  </li>
            <li>I am not often satisfied with skin care products and switch around a lot.  </li>
            <li>The consistency of the cream was more like a cream soup.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It feels like it absorbs into my skin and isn&#x27;t just a coating on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the Philosophy skin care line.  </li>
            <li>So I am thinking the product does something to the top layer of skin, like maybe a dermabrasion effect</li>
            <li>Wish I would have found this years ago :)</li>
            <li>My wife is in love with this product, makes her skin look and feel better.</li>
            <li>but it appears most people have just to wait this</li>
            <li>I love this face lotion</li>
            <li>I will not order any more cosmetics from amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love hope in a jar and don&#x27;t want to be without it.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li>Its the same great product!</li>
            <li>but it was just ok.  </li>
            <li>It seems like it bothers some people more than others</li>
            <li>I love love love this face lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is his favorite face cream after shaving.</li>
            <li>And, everyone I&#x27;ve persuaded to try their products is equally as satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I found a better and cheaper face cleaning and moisturizing product at Walmart.</li>
            <li>My wife love Philosophy Products and found a much better price through Amazon than all competitors.  </li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizing and it is very well priced</li>
            <li>My skin looks healthy and stays hydrated all day.  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer and use it every day.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite moisturizer for many years.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t get any better than Hope in a jar.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve changed face washing products to be sure that wasn&#x27;t the problem.</li>
            <li>These worked better than the body moisturizer, as which they should have</li>
            <li>so I thought I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>why I claim it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>I Love all your products.</li>
            <li>So I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Probably best for dry skin types</li>
            <li>Such a great product and so nice to have it arrive at my door.</li>
            <li>Good value, fast shipping</li>
            <li>I have been an avid user of this skin cream and usually love it!</li>
            <li>I am in love and am so happy that I have finally found these products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>that strong chemical stink weed smell.  </li>
            <li>I love everything Philosophy and fell in love all over again after I used hope in a jar for the first time.  </li>
            <li>It is really light on the skin.</li>
            <li>So light and creamy.</li>
            <li>It soaks into your skin to leave it silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>and it feels light on your face</li>
            <li>I sure didn&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Sold by tennis*mom, just like a cup of soup, it doesn&#x27;t like a Genuine, production date in 12301JP.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth</li>
            <li>her beauty is important for me.</li>
            <li>Light, not oily and my skin LOVES it.  </li>
            <li>I like how light but affective it is.</li>
            <li>Love the Phliosophy hope in a jar in the large size.  !</li>
            <li>and this has helped significantly</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth the hype!</li>
            <li>I love the whole line of Philosophy!  </li>
            <li>but I do see a significant difference in the moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li>I have problem skin and this stuff just makes me look like my skin is dewey and clean.  </li>
            <li>well, I can just say, try it yourself, and see if the minimum benefits are good enough for you.</li>
            <li>I really, really, really wanted to love this lotion.</li>
            <li>When I put this on my face in the morning, I have to quickly put an Aveda moisturizing lotion over it just to tolerate the smell</li>
            <li>I used to buy this at Macys and was so happy when I found it on Amazon for slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li>Me and my wife&#x27;s skin is not only super soft, it&#x27;s more vibrant and we fight off that cracked winter skin like the plague (we win by the way).</li>
            <li>Use daily and love it!</li>
            <li>So worth the money.</li>
            <li>but they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite skin care product by far.</li>
            <li>I have Rosacea and could never use any kind of moisturizer on my face without it breaking out and being all red.</li>
            <li>Their products are always fresh.  </li>
            <li>and I are worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes later in the day, I seem to have a sheen over my skin if I am having an oily day, but overall I love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather buy something that smells better that offers moisturizing components.  </li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I stumbled across \\&quot;Hope in a jar\\&quot; and gave it a shot that I realized how useful</li>
            <li>Benefit #2 is that this moisturizer is so quickly absorbed by the skin</li>
            <li>I have tried many many other moisturizers  and none of them could even begin to compare to hope in a jar.  </li>
            <li>The right cream is the one I recived from this seller...</li>
            <li>This has just the right amount of moisture but does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>The product does soak right into the skin, which is nice, but I noticed my face feeling rough</li>
            <li>but this product actually flared up my very light case of Rosacia</li>
            <li>This daily moisturizer is light weight but also rich.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect size since a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>, I am only ok with that area if I just use Dove soap and Eucrine Lotion, for some reason those two products don&#x27;t irritate, but they don&#x27;t repair either.</li>
            <li>I can always count on my skin returning to a natural and comfortable state as soon as I put this on.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They were very prompt!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It looks healthier and feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is so light, you don&#x27;t need to use much and after one week I could clearly feel and see a difference in the softness of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too thick, and blends in smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>Wish the fragrance were a little more fresh but wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li>and I decided to give HIAJ another try since I wasn&#x27;t positive what the reaction was from.</li>
            <li>I have used  philosophy hope in a jar for a long time now,  and  I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>This particular jar I received though, has started to develop a yellowish tinge and seems to be separating into some time of yellow liquid that sits on top of the cream.</li>
            <li>I love Hope because it isn&#x27;t heavy, it isn&#x27;t greasy, and it has a mild bouquet.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t very well complain about the high cost of fuel or diamonds when I willingly purchased this item.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed by this product.</li>
            <li>I also tried Benadryl - which didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>I hope the next one is actually filled with procduct</li>
            <li>I absolutely have found MY moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This product works really well for me.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, it really does exfoliate during the day....</li>
            <li>This cream has a light greenish yellow look.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>Use this as a night cream, always feels skin smooth next morning.</li>
            <li>Not saying I see much difference in wrinkles</li>
            <li>Some days, super oily and others super dry.  </li>
            <li>First off, the feel is more thin than the original.</li>
            <li>The main thing that turned me off was the smell.  </li>
            <li>think I would recommend sticking with a smaller jar, and is probably what I will do in the future, unless I can find out more information about this happening.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this moisturizer</li>
            <li>Since I really haven&#x27;t noticed anything as far as an improvement in my skin or complextion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick.  </li>
            <li>I love &amp;#34;Hope in a Jar&amp;#34; because it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not to heavy nor too light!</li>
            <li>I have been using this now for a few yrs and love it.</li>
            <li>Use this product everyday, love it</li>
            <li>It is worth a try for those who want younger skin.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>My face loves this new regiment.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t have major wrinkles to see an improvement</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, always breaking out.</li>
            <li>This is my third jar but the first one I have purchased on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Since it does nothing for the skin, why suffer with the smell when there are hundreds of other facial products that are much better?</li>
            <li>I have used this product for ten years and was excited about getting it for so much less than QVC or straight from Philosophy, but the product was liquidy instead of a mousse texture</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to breakouts but</li>
            <li>I did have some sensitivity in my forehead area, but my skin is sensitive there anyway</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin and have NEVER had a reaction like this before.</li>
            <li>I think they are either old,  or rejects that have been returned.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know seems old, discolored.</li>
            <li>I was truly surprised</li>
            <li>Anyway, if you are buying this cream just buy it directly from sephora.</li>
            <li>, it was only upon stoping the product for a few days that I noticed my skin, in some areas, looks more even toned and smoother.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t waste money on a larger one!</li>
            <li>Not typical of Philosophy products.</li>
            <li>I use it along with the purity made simple and highly recommend that combination.  </li>
            <li>If you live in or have ever been in Southern California, we have a \\&quot;stink weed\\</li>
            <li>But I have used this every day for at least 2 years and always make sure I have an extra.</li>
            <li>I know it was a used jar because it was only about half full.  </li>
            <li>When I first received this I was a bit concerned because it was packaged differently than the previous one I had bought (e.g. it had a foil seal under the cap instead of the plastic disc that can be reseated after use) and the consistency is different than my original 8 oz jar I bought from that other retailer.  </li>
            <li>&quot; that is very pungent and smells very strong but artificial.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s barely noticable now.  </li>
            <li>I suggest that amazon&#x27;s might be old,  possibly someone has returned it,  who knows.  </li>
            <li>Waited a while before i decided to invest in this but its soo good my skin was going crazy</li>
            <li>Overall the smell ruins the product and if it actually improved the skin, maybe it would be worth the sacrafice.  </li>
            <li>Came online to read reviews and after reading these horrible reviews about people breaking out, I just washed my face and put on my beloved Erno Laszlo cream, which by the way, smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>the first few days I used it and lasting for almost two weeks</li>
            <li>Being a male and not knowing much in regards to how to choose what verses what I began using your typical body moisturizer.</li>

            <li> Its the same great product!</li>
            <li> but it was just ok.  </li>
            <li> It seems like it bothers some people more than others</li>
            <li> I love love love this face lotion.  </li>
            <li> It is his favorite face cream after shaving.</li>
            <li> And, everyone I&#x27;ve persuaded to try their products is equally as satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I found a better and cheaper face cleaning and moisturizing product at Walmart.</li>
            <li> My wife love Philosophy Products and found a much better price through Amazon than all competitors.  </li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing and it is very well priced</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthy and stays hydrated all day.  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and use it every day.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite moisturizer for many years.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t get any better than Hope in a jar.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve changed face washing products to be sure that wasn&#x27;t the problem.</li>
            <li> These worked better than the body moisturizer, as which they should have</li>
            <li> so I thought I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> why I claim it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> I Love all your products.</li>
            <li> So I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Probably best for dry skin types</li>
            <li> Such a great product and so nice to have it arrive at my door.</li>
            <li> Good value, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have been an avid user of this skin cream and usually love it!</li>
            <li> I am in love and am so happy that I have finally found these products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> that strong chemical stink weed smell.  </li>
            <li> I love everything Philosophy and fell in love all over again after I used hope in a jar for the first time.  </li>
            <li> It is really light on the skin.</li>
            <li> So light and creamy.</li>
            <li> It soaks into your skin to leave it silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> and it feels light on your face</li>
            <li> I sure didn&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Sold by tennis*mom, just like a cup of soup, it doesn&#x27;t like a Genuine, production date in 12301JP.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth</li>
            <li> her beauty is important for me.</li>
            <li> Light, not oily and my skin LOVES it.  </li>
            <li> I like how light but affective it is.</li>
            <li> Love the Phliosophy hope in a jar in the large size.  !</li>
            <li> and this has helped significantly</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not worth the hype!</li>
            <li> I love the whole line of Philosophy!  </li>
            <li> but I do see a significant difference in the moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have problem skin and this stuff just makes me look like my skin is dewey and clean.  </li>
            <li> well, I can just say, try it yourself, and see if the minimum benefits are good enough for you.</li>
            <li> I really, really, really wanted to love this lotion.</li>
            <li> When I put this on my face in the morning, I have to quickly put an Aveda moisturizing lotion over it just to tolerate the smell</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Macys and was so happy when I found it on Amazon for slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> Me and my wife&#x27;s skin is not only super soft, it&#x27;s more vibrant and we fight off that cracked winter skin like the plague (we win by the way).</li>
            <li> Use daily and love it!</li>
            <li> So worth the money.</li>
            <li> but they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite skin care product by far.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and could never use any kind of moisturizer on my face without it breaking out and being all red.</li>
            <li> Their products are always fresh.  </li>
            <li> and I are worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes later in the day, I seem to have a sheen over my skin if I am having an oily day, but overall I love love love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather buy something that smells better that offers moisturizing components.  </li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I stumbled across \\&quot;Hope in a jar\\&quot; and gave it a shot that I realized how useful</li>
            <li> Benefit #2 is that this moisturizer is so quickly absorbed by the skin</li>
            <li> I have tried many many other moisturizers  and none of them could even begin to compare to hope in a jar.  </li>
            <li> The right cream is the one I recived from this seller...</li>
            <li> This has just the right amount of moisture but does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> The product does soak right into the skin, which is nice, but I noticed my face feeling rough</li>
            <li> but this product actually flared up my very light case of Rosacia</li>
            <li> This daily moisturizer is light weight but also rich.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect size since a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> , I am only ok with that area if I just use Dove soap and Eucrine Lotion, for some reason those two products don&#x27;t irritate, but they don&#x27;t repair either.</li>
            <li> I can always count on my skin returning to a natural and comfortable state as soon as I put this on.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> They were very prompt!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It looks healthier and feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is so light, you don&#x27;t need to use much and after one week I could clearly feel and see a difference in the softness of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick, and blends in smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> Wish the fragrance were a little more fresh but wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> and I decided to give HIAJ another try since I wasn&#x27;t positive what the reaction was from.</li>
            <li> I have used  philosophy hope in a jar for a long time now,  and  I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li> This particular jar I received though, has started to develop a yellowish tinge and seems to be separating into some time of yellow liquid that sits on top of the cream.</li>
            <li> I love Hope because it isn&#x27;t heavy, it isn&#x27;t greasy, and it has a mild bouquet.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t very well complain about the high cost of fuel or diamonds when I willingly purchased this item.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed by this product.</li>
            <li> I also tried Benadryl - which didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> I hope the next one is actually filled with procduct</li>
            <li> I absolutely have found MY moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This product works really well for me.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, it really does exfoliate during the day....</li>
            <li> This cream has a light greenish yellow look.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li> Use this as a night cream, always feels skin smooth next morning.</li>
            <li> Not saying I see much difference in wrinkles</li>
            <li> Some days, super oily and others super dry.  </li>
            <li> First off, the feel is more thin than the original.</li>
            <li> The main thing that turned me off was the smell.  </li>
            <li> think I would recommend sticking with a smaller jar, and is probably what I will do in the future, unless I can find out more information about this happening.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this moisturizer</li>
            <li> Since I really haven&#x27;t noticed anything as far as an improvement in my skin or complextion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick.  </li>
            <li> I love &amp;#34;Hope in a Jar&amp;#34; because it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not to heavy nor too light!</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for a few yrs and love it.</li>
            <li> Use this product everyday, love it</li>
            <li> It is worth a try for those who want younger skin.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> My face loves this new regiment.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t have major wrinkles to see an improvement</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, always breaking out.</li>
            <li> This is my third jar but the first one I have purchased on amazon.  </li>
            <li> Since it does nothing for the skin, why suffer with the smell when there are hundreds of other facial products that are much better?</li>
            <li> I have used this product for ten years and was excited about getting it for so much less than QVC or straight from Philosophy, but the product was liquidy instead of a mousse texture</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to breakouts but</li>
            <li> I did have some sensitivity in my forehead area, but my skin is sensitive there anyway</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and have NEVER had a reaction like this before.</li>
            <li> I think they are either old,  or rejects that have been returned.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know seems old, discolored.</li>
            <li> I was truly surprised</li>
            <li> Anyway, if you are buying this cream just buy it directly from sephora.</li>
            <li> , it was only upon stoping the product for a few days that I noticed my skin, in some areas, looks more even toned and smoother.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t waste money on a larger one!</li>
            <li> Not typical of Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> I use it along with the purity made simple and highly recommend that combination.  </li>
            <li> If you live in or have ever been in Southern California, we have a \\&quot;stink weed\\</li>
            <li> But I have used this every day for at least 2 years and always make sure I have an extra.</li>
            <li> I know it was a used jar because it was only about half full.  </li>
            <li> When I first received this I was a bit concerned because it was packaged differently than the previous one I had bought (e.g. it had a foil seal under the cap instead of the plastic disc that can be reseated after use) and the consistency is different than my original 8 oz jar I bought from that other retailer.  </li>
            <li> &quot; that is very pungent and smells very strong but artificial.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s barely noticable now.  </li>
            <li> I suggest that amazon&#x27;s might be old,  possibly someone has returned it,  who knows.  </li>
            <li> Waited a while before i decided to invest in this but its soo good my skin was going crazy</li>
            <li> Overall the smell ruins the product and if it actually improved the skin, maybe it would be worth the sacrafice.  </li>
            <li> Came online to read reviews and after reading these horrible reviews about people breaking out, I just washed my face and put on my beloved Erno Laszlo cream, which by the way, smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> the first few days I used it and lasting for almost two weeks</li>
            <li> Being a male and not knowing much in regards to how to choose what verses what I began using your typical body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> , The only problem I had is the bottle even though sealed was pretty much half empty..</li>
            <li> I just know that I use aveeno positively ageless night cream that I usually purchase from walmart for about twenty dollars.</li>
            <li> My experience from the previous one I had and a live &amp;#34;make-over&amp;#34</li>
            <li> without having to do any hard work ;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the benefits of long term use or if it helps with wrinkles or not, but I suspect that it can only help.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s dry, this is my water (yes, it is actually a quenching feeling).  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s broken out, this is my quick repair.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin tight, but soft.</li>
            <li> One jar is white and the other was yellow and lumpy....</li>
            <li> After searching for a long time for moisture without breaking out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s normal, but it looks incredibly strange</li>
            <li> And again, that&#x27;s in comparison to some other facial moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds and my skin is dry and oily and I have roseacia.  </li>
            <li> My face was terribly dry the another night</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry sometimes flakey skin on my face in the mornings after showers.</li>
            <li> , that can only be noticed after a few weeks, and only when taking a break from the product.</li>
            <li> Previous face creams would need to be applied daily because every morning my face would be dry coming out of the shower.</li>
            <li> With this product, I&#x27;ve noticed less dryness the next morning after use.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> and i wanted something to save it, It completely cleared up my situation which sucks</li>
            <li> He never wants to be without it.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing without being to wet.</li>
            <li> Plus, with this product, it&#x27;s rather thin and doesn&#x27;t feel like it really absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It make my face feel soft and subtle.  </li>
            <li> so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> On the other side I knew that it was still extravagant.</li>
            <li> ; at that other retailer&#x27;s location was that the consistency of the product is &amp;#34;soufflé&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> All winter I had been fighting dry skin but anything to heavy will cause acne.</li>
            <li> I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting one from this expensive product with \\&quot;a</li>
            <li> The hope in a jar cream that you buy at sephora is a white thick consistency.</li>
            <li> Once I started using this product my roseacia calmed down</li>
            <li> From the moment I applied it my face slightly burned.</li>
            <li> I can handle the odd smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an odd smell, one of my friends said it smells like cardboard.  </li>
            <li> I have previously purchased this from sephora and I have also found it at a discounted price at TJMAXX.</li>
            <li> For some of you who gave bad  reviews on this,  maybe it wasn&#x27;t fresh.  </li>
            <li> I woke up to a swollen, red, and itchy face that kept getting worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been a few weeks</li>
            <li> One last note, some people comment on its smell as being unappealing.</li>
            <li> my black heads have all but vanished!</li>
            <li> As I put it on, I thought it felt nice and went to bed to read but couldn&#x27;t get past the fact that I just smelled awful.  </li>
            <li> , I hold off for a few days to get my skin past the abrasion phase.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that this lotion has such a bad smell that lingers a while after you apply it (and that is why it gets 4 stars).  </li>
            <li> This product usually runs sixty dollars for four ounces at skinstore,  macys,  or philosophy.com.  </li>
            <li> I may take it to a Philosophy retailer to have them look at it, because it is past the return window for Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually purchase from another on-line/TV shopping outlet.  </li>
            <li> I am not excited about this.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s too thin.  </li>
            <li> I should have listened to the reviewers who have complained about the smell.  </li>
            <li> Some of you who are disappointed in hope in a jar,  may I suggest that you buy it directly from philosophy.com or skinstore.com.  </li>
            <li> It seems too thin like they put too much water in as a base.  </li>
            <li> price is not too bad considering it last forever.</li>
            <li> It has that \\&quot;fragrence free\\&quot; scent that just is not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> The reaction seems to be so much worse this time.</li>
            <li> Well, needless to say, since using Hope in a Jar, I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts and the redness has lessened.</li>
            <li> Between it&#x27; $60 + price and shipping, I felt guilty every time I replenished my stock.</li>
            <li> My order is FAKE....</li>
            <li> The smell is terrible, but after several days I got used to it.</li>
            <li> (I hate thick greasy products and this doesn&#x27;t fall into that category</li>
            <li> The smell is awful, straight up awful.</li>
            <li> I held cold water bottles up to my cheeks all day.</li>
            <li> My face looks so bad</li>
            <li> and i just got it from a bad seller</li>
            <li> This cream was either a knock-off or bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I want to claw my face off :(</li>
            <li> so I stupidly used this cream again.</li>
            <li> This Philosophy cream was beyond awful.  </li>
            <li> this is one of the worst product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The burning was terrible -</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received a sample of this recently and just put it on my face.  As I put it on, I thought it felt nice and went to bed to read but couldn&#x27;t get past the fact that I just smelled awful.  I put my hands up to my face and smoothed my cheeks and then smelled my fingers to see if it was indeed the cream I was smelling and I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Came online to read reviews and after reading these horrible reviews about people breaking out, I just washed my face and put on my beloved Erno Laszlo cream, which by the way, smells fantastic.  This Philosophy cream was beyond awful.  In the garbage it went.</li>
            <li> this is one of the worst product I have ever used. It didn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell, and I started to have a breakout. I will never purchase anything from philosophy again.</li>
            <li> I started buying this product after I saw it on Oprah&#x27;s favorite things.  It is great!  It is really light on the skin. I have oily skin and a lot of creams and moisturizers make me break out.  This never does. It make my face feel soft and subtle.  It&#x27;s great when you fly when traveling, too, because you can apply it and not feel like you have anything on except fresh skin! I am not often satisfied with skin care products and switch around a lot.  But I have used this every day for at least 2 years and always make sure I have an extra. It lives up to it&#x27;s name!</li>
            <li> Good value, fast shipping</li>
            <li> The consistency of the cream was more like a cream soup.  I have used philosophy for years and have never seen this product so runny.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. So light and creamy. Nice feel and look to my face many hours after application. Been using it for years. This jar (4fl oz) will last me awhile too. So worth the money.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product! Instant absorption that makes you feel like your skin just passed through the hydrating mist of a waterfall. Allows for immediate makeup application with no tackiness or residual oily feel on skin. Wish the fragrance were a little more fresh but wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I have been using Purity face wash and Hope in a Jar for about 4 months and let me just tell you how WONDERFUL these products are! I have not had a pimple in 4 months (not even during THAT TIME of month)and my black heads have all but vanished! I am in love and am so happy that I have finally found these products. I know they are a bit pricey but they are worth every penny. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is a really great face cream. It is not greasy but hydrates skin well. My skin is sensitive to breakouts but this cream dosen&#x27;t bother it at all.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisurizer Ive used. It feels like it absorbs into my skin and isn&#x27;t just a coating on top of my skin. And no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I love the Philosophy skin care line.  This daily moisturizer is light weight but also rich.  It soaks into your skin to leave it silky smooth.  I use it daily and the night cream version before bed.</li>
            <li> I Love Philosophy!! It&#x27;s my favorite skin care product by far. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds and my skin is dry and oily and I have roseacia.  Once I started using this product my roseacia calmed down and it&#x27;s barely noticable now.  Thanks HOPE in a jar - all of their products are fabulous!!!!</li>
            <li> Best lotion I have had.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell like it seems others do. I actually prefer it because it doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers, which tend to give me a headache.  The product does soak right into the skin, which is nice, but I noticed my face feeling rough the first few days I used it and lasting for almost two weeks, it was only upon stoping the product for a few days that I noticed my skin, in some areas, looks more even toned and smoother. So I am thinking the product does something to the top layer of skin, like maybe a dermabrasion effect, that can only be noticed after a few weeks, and only when taking a break from the product. I don&#x27;t know, maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough. I did have some sensitivity in my forehead area, but my skin is sensitive there anyway, I am only ok with that area if I just use Dove soap and Eucrine Lotion, for some reason those two products don&#x27;t irritate, but they don&#x27;t repair either. Ugh! LOL..well, I can just say, try it yourself, and see if the minimum benefits are good enough for you. I still use it from time to time, but if I know I have an affair to attent to, I hold off for a few days to get my skin past the abrasion phase.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. I have very dry skin and this has helped significantly and it feels light on your face</li>
            <li> I love Hope because it isn&#x27;t heavy, it isn&#x27;t greasy, and it has a mild bouquet. Oh and it does a great job moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed by this product. I have Rosacea and could never use any kind of moisturizer on my face without it breaking out and being all red. Well, needless to say, since using Hope in a Jar, I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts and the redness has lessened. Wish I would have found this years ago :)</li>
            <li> I am not excited about this.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s too thin.  and has an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m not having a reaction to it but I can&#x27;t return it because I threw away the box.&lt;br /&gt;not seeing anything about SPF so using it when i&#x27;m stuck inside on rainy days.</li>
            <li> My wife is in love with this product, makes her skin look and feel better. Perfect gift!</li>
            <li> I really, really, really wanted to love this lotion. I bought a smaller size (0.5 oz) and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t waste money on a larger one! From the moment I applied it my face slightly burned. The smell is awful, straight up awful. By the end of the day it was all I could smell and taste, even while eating. I woke up to a swollen, red, and itchy face that kept getting worse. The burning was terrible - I held cold water bottles up to my cheeks all day. I also tried Benadryl - which didn&#x27;t help much. The rash and itching finally dissipated after about a week. I do not have sensitive skin and have NEVER had a reaction like this before. I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting one from this expensive product with \\&quot;a cult-like following\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a few weeks and I decided to give HIAJ another try since I wasn&#x27;t positive what the reaction was from. My face was terribly dry the another night so I stupidly used this cream again. I woke up in the morning with itching all over - same reaction. This is day 2 now, Benadryl is not making any difference and I want to claw my face off :( The reaction seems to be so much worse this time. My face looks so bad I don&#x27;t think I can leave the house. I have washed my face but I&#x27;m too afraid to put any kind of make up on. I just want this to be over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m chucking Hope In A Jar in the trash. Perhaps it&#x27;s the lavendar oil? I keep goggling around looking for some kind of treatment/relief but it appears most people have just to wait this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the hype!</li>
            <li> I love &amp;#34;Hope in a Jar&amp;#34; because it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy on your skin. I have tried them all and always come back to &amp;#34;Hope in a Jar.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the best but it&#x27;s a wonderful consistency. Not greasy and  works all day. Perfect for someone with normal skin.</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion it&#x27;s not to heavy nor too light! This is the perfect size since a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have used  philosophy hope in a jar for a long time now,  and  I absolutely love it.  I have tried many many other moisturizers  and none of them could even begin to compare to hope in a jar.  For some of you who gave bad  reviews on this,  maybe it wasn&#x27;t fresh.  This product usually runs sixty dollars for four ounces at skinstore,  macys,  or philosophy.com.  Since the price here at amazon is only thirty some dollars for a four ounce jar,  doesn&#x27;t that tell you something?  I suggest that amazon&#x27;s might be old,  possibly someone has returned it,  who knows.  I just know that I use aveeno positively ageless night cream that I usually purchase from walmart for about twenty dollars. Well  I dediced to buy it here on amazon a lot cheaper.  Big Mistake.  I sure didn&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth. I know it was a used jar because it was only about half full.  I will not order any more cosmetics from amazon.  I think they are either old,  or rejects that have been returned.  Some of you who are disappointed in hope in a jar,  may I suggest that you buy it directly from philosophy.com or skinstore.com.  Their products are always fresh.  I love hope in a jar and don&#x27;t want to be without it.  It&#x27;s the best moisturizer out there.</li>
            <li> There is nothing else like hope in a jar.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I can&#x27;t live without it.  My husband also uses it. It is light and pleasant.  I am a Philosophy girl through and through, and this one is a winner!</li>
            <li> Best Product of its kind! Love it</li>
            <li> Have been using for a while.  Price is comp to buying at store and saves me the trip.  will order again</li>
            <li> I bought this religiously for three years and used it daily. I can handle the odd smell. It moisturized well. It never caused breakouts. The issue was the price. Between it&#x27; $60 + price and shipping, I felt guilty every time I replenished my stock. I couldn&#x27;t very well complain about the high cost of fuel or diamonds when I willingly purchased this item. It took me two years to find a bona fide replacement but I finally did. On one side I said my face and I are worth it. On the other side I knew that it was still extravagant.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer on the planet. My skin has never felt better. I loathe the smell, but I&#x27;ll put up with it for the effect. Saved ten bucks buying through Amazon - can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Macys and was so happy when I found it on Amazon for slightly cheaper. Its the same great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years...great product and great price!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this moisturizer but it was just ok.  The main thing that turned me off was the smell.  It&#x27;s an odd smell, one of my friends said it smells like cardboard.  It seems like it bothers some people more than others but it was a big turnoff for me, I could smell it throughout the day.  Definitely will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Sold by tennis*mom, just like a cup of soup, it doesn&#x27;t like a Genuine, production date in 12301JP. DON&#x27;T BUY!!!</li>
            <li> For the last 20+ years I have been looking to fill a void in my life. Well, look no further. This is actual &amp;#34;HOPE&amp;#34; in this jar. Me and my wife&#x27;s skin is not only super soft, it&#x27;s more vibrant and we fight off that cracked winter skin like the plague (we win by the way). Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it. It&#x27;s not too thick, and blends in smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and loved it. Tried it again,in this larger size, and it seems the scent has changed. Before it was very pleasant - now not so much. Not typical of Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> This is my third jar but the first one I have purchased on amazon.  Price was good, delivery was quick but I don&#x27;t know seems old, discolored.</li>
            <li> Waited a while before i decided to invest in this but its soo good my skin was going crazy and i wanted something to save it, It completely cleared up my situation which sucks cuz now i have to keep buying it and it aintt cheep, The only problem I had is the bottle even though sealed was pretty much half empty.. I hope the next one is actually filled with procduct and i just got it from a bad seller</li>
            <li> I love love love this face lotion.  I have problem skin and this stuff just makes me look like my skin is dewey and clean.  I use it along with the purity made simple and highly recommend that combination.  The only thing is that this lotion has such a bad smell that lingers a while after you apply it (and that is why it gets 4 stars).  It has that \\&quot;fragrence free\\&quot; scent that just is not pleasant.  But my skin looks great so I deal with it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely have found MY moisturizer.  After searching for a long time for moisture without breaking out. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I actually buy this for my husband. It is his favorite face cream after shaving. He never wants to be without it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years now. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it. It is moisturizing without being to wet. It leaves my skin tight, but soft. I would never change facial lotions unless they change the product!</li>
            <li> I have been an avid user of this skin cream and usually love it! This particular jar I received though, has started to develop a yellowish tinge and seems to be separating into some time of yellow liquid that sits on top of the cream. I did not have this happen with my last jar, but it was only a 1 ounce versus 4 ounce. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s normal, but it looks incredibly strange and I hesitate to even put it on my face. I may take it to a Philosophy retailer to have them look at it, because it is past the return window for Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I would recommend sticking with a smaller jar, and is probably what I will do in the future, unless I can find out more information about this happening.</li>
            <li> Love this face cream! Goes on smooth and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using philosophy for almost 5 years now and have not once thought about trying anything else.  My skin loves Philosophy!  And, everyone I&#x27;ve persuaded to try their products is equally as satisfied.</li>
            <li> My order is FAKE....One jar is white and the other was yellow and lumpy....FRAUD</li>
            <li> I love everything Philosophy and fell in love all over again after I used hope in a jar for the first time.  It is so light, you don&#x27;t need to use much and after one week I could clearly feel and see a difference in the softness of my skin.  Wish I could use it all over my body, LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Gave it away...I was truly surprised but this product actually flared up my very light case of Rosacia and I found a better and cheaper face cleaning and moisturizing product at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Do not buy! Fraud product!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter how my skin is when I woke up...If it&#x27;s dry, this is my water (yes, it is actually a quenching feeling).  If it&#x27;s broken out, this is my quick repair.  If it&#x27;s cold or warm, it gives me the rosy cheeks I adore (without blush or pinching).  This product works really well for me. I have combination skin with an emphasis on combination.  Some days, super oily and others super dry.  Either way, hope mellows my skin the minute I put it on.  Sometimes later in the day, I seem to have a sheen over my skin if I am having an oily day, but overall I love love love this product.  A coworker gave me the 8oz one time for $40 and it has been a struggle to not buy another jar...I gave in.  The texture, the weight, and the results of this product are amazing.  I can always count on my skin returning to a natural and comfortable state as soon as I put this on.  As an added bonus, it really does exfoliate during the day....without having to do any hard work ;)</li>
            <li> My wife love Philosophy Products and found a much better price through Amazon than all competitors.  Product came in the timeframe promised.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philosophy products for about 1 and 1/2 years.  I usually purchase from another on-line/TV shopping outlet.  When I first received this I was a bit concerned because it was packaged differently than the previous one I had bought (e.g. it had a foil seal under the cap instead of the plastic disc that can be reseated after use) and the consistency is different than my original 8 oz jar I bought from that other retailer.  My experience from the previous one I had and a live &amp;#34;make-over&amp;#34; at that other retailer&#x27;s location was that the consistency of the product is &amp;#34;soufflé&amp;#34; like.  This is definitely not the same consistency.  However, I am not having any adverse reaction, so maybe the product has changed.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing and it is very well priced</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthy and stays hydrated all day.  I love the whole line of Philosophy!  Great product.  Recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like it in the world. I love this moisturizer and use it every day. If you have yet to try it, you owe it to yourself to give it a go.</li>
            <li> Love the Phliosophy hope in a jar in the large size.  !y face loves it too.  Such a great product and so nice to have it arrive at my door.</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased this from sephora and I have also found it at a discounted price at TJMAXX. I know what this product is supposed to feel like, smell like, look like. First off, the feel is more thin than the original. The smell is completely different! It smells similar to hair dye. I am not exaggerating. After putting it on my face, it took me 30 minutes trying to figure out the smell. The look of this cream was also off! The hope in a jar cream that you buy at sephora is a white thick consistency. This cream has a light greenish yellow look. It almost looks like it could glow or something. The weirdest thing! Anyway, if you are buying this cream just buy it directly from sephora. This cream was either a knock-off or bad. I posted a picture to show you the difference regarding he color. The right cream is the one I recived from this seller... The left is what the hope in a jar cream should look like!</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the reviewers who have complained about the smell.  I can&#x27;t quite describe it.  It&#x27;s almost a strong chemical smell.  If you live in or have ever been in Southern California, we have a \\&quot;stink weed\\&quot; that is very pungent and smells very strong but artificial.  It&#x27;s almost like that strong chemical stink weed smell.  When I put this on my face in the morning, I have to quickly put an Aveda moisturizing lotion over it just to tolerate the smell otherwise I smell that stinky chemical smell ALL DAY.  Since I really haven&#x27;t noticed anything as far as an improvement in my skin or complextion and I really don&#x27;t have major wrinkles to see an improvement, I will never buy this product again.  I&#x27;d rather buy something that smells better that offers moisturizing components.  Plus, with this product, it&#x27;s rather thin and doesn&#x27;t feel like it really absorbs into the skin.  It&#x27;s not thick.  (I hate thick greasy products and this doesn&#x27;t fall into that category so that&#x27;s a plus I guess.)  It seems too thin like they put too much water in as a base.  Overall the smell ruins the product and if it actually improved the skin, maybe it would be worth the sacrafice.  Since it does nothing for the skin, why suffer with the smell when there are hundreds of other facial products that are much better?</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite moisturizer for many years. It is lightweight and does an amazing job. Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Philosophy hope in a jar is the best face moisturizer i have ever used and i will use it forever. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I have very sensitive skin, always breaking out. This product has done wonders for me. And amazon, what an amazing price! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for ten years and was excited about getting it for so much less than QVC or straight from Philosophy, but the product was liquidy instead of a mousse texture so I received a credit immediately by the seller.  They were very prompt!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t get any better than Hope in a jar. This is an amazing product and a great buy for the money. Amazon never disappoints!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s her favorite.&lt;br /&gt;The price is not too bad considering it last forever. :)&lt;br /&gt;And her beauty is important for me. ;)</li>
            <li> I came across this product on accident so I guess it was meant to be. I tend to have dry sometimes flakey skin on my face in the mornings after showers. I&#x27;ve changed face washing products to be sure that wasn&#x27;t the problem. I started using face creams afterwards to alleviate this concern. Being a male and not knowing much in regards to how to choose what verses what I began using your typical body moisturizer. After finding that to be too greasy and oily, I switched to specific face creams. These worked better than the body moisturizer, as which they should have so I thought I was satisfied. It wasn&#x27;t until I stumbled across \\&quot;Hope in a jar\\&quot; and gave it a shot that I realized how useful this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my rational as to why I claim it&#x27;s better. Previous face creams would need to be applied daily because every morning my face would be dry coming out of the shower. With this product, I&#x27;ve noticed less dryness the next morning after use. That&#x27;s benefit #1. Benefit #2 is that this moisturizer is so quickly absorbed by the skin that it does&#x27;t leave an oily feeling or look. And again, that&#x27;s in comparison to some other facial moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, it&#x27;s a great product I recommend. No one product is perfect for everyone but this has worked for me. I can&#x27;t comment on the benefits of long term use or if it helps with wrinkles or not, but I suspect that it can only help. One last note, some people comment on its smell as being unappealing. I don&#x27;t have a problem with it. I bought it for its benefits and use, not for its smell. I would say the smell is neutral to me.</li>
            <li> This product does wonders for your face. Feels like silk on your face. Hope in a jar is a wonderful moisturizer.I use in the morning and also before bed.  HOPE IN A JAR is for every skin type ..</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery. Product as described.</li>
            <li> Use this as a night cream, always feels skin smooth next morning. The smell is terrible, but after several days I got used to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs into my skin almost immediately.  I like the smell although I have read that others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love the moisturizer and happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Use daily and love it! I am a philosophy woman and will be for life! I Love all your products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for a few yrs and love it.</li>
            <li> Did work for my skin at all.  Probably best for dry skin types</li>
            <li> Light, not oily and my skin LOVES it.  I use this after the Claresonic with the Purity by Philosophy.  My face loves this new regiment. It looks healthier and feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Use this product everyday, love it</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot for your face and throat. It becomes almost liquid as soon as you begin to rub on your face and throat so a little bit goes a long way. I like how light but affective it is. Not saying I see much difference in wrinkles but I do see a significant difference in the moisture in my skin. That has improved dramatically. All winter I had been fighting dry skin but anything to heavy will cause acne. This has just the right amount of moisture but does not cause breakouts. So I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it makes an noticeable difference. I was very pleased to find it cheaper on Amazon! It is worth a try for those who want younger skin.</li>
    </ol>
