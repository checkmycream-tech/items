            <li>As one who really takes care of my skin, I am thrilled to discover these two items.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>A very popular and solid product from COSMEDICA.</li>
            <li>but so far I am loving the hyaluronic acid</li>
            <li>Whether they are doing any good or not, I cant tell because I dont use them regularly enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 years old and wasn&#x27;t sure if it would do anything to my skin.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast!  </li>
            <li>I have used all the major brands at more than triple the price.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much  </li>

            <li>This PREP &amp; TONE solution is a soothing Vitamin C solution that not only is safe for all skin types and is guaranteed with a money back satisfaction policy, but you skin will rarely feel as refreshed as when using this prep and tone solution.</li>
            <li>I really buff up my complexion of my</li>
            <li>Hope you all take time to access all review write out from customers and make a correct decision when purchasing any product as this product really works on me.  </li>
            <li>Only been using product for a few days but so far seems great -</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>This is a very good product especially the Vitamin C facial toner for my super active acne pimples skin on my chin for the pass 2-3 months have not leave me in peace (small acne pimple cloud all over looks like i am having a bee hive clustering on my chin.  </li>
            <li>Few months later, skin has been amazing.</li>
            <li>is the 2nd order of these two products because they really work!</li>
            <li>After using a cleanser this solution closes the pores of the skin to be tightened by neutralizing the skin surface to ensure skin is clear of excess oil, dirt, and make-up.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell whether it does what it claims</li>
            <li>my skin feels soft and seem firmer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early for me to tell whether this combo is doing all that it&#x27;s supposed to do but after applying the toner and then putting on the hyaluronic serum, I like the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily, and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>The hyaluronic acid makes my skin soft and glory whereas the vitamin c makes it sticky.</li>
            <li>Start this while you are young and you&#x27;ll never need a face lift.</li>
            <li>So far ,  I can not tell that I have used anything on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In this set the Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum hydrates and plumps the skin, holding in moisture that is the key for younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>I will add more to my feed back after using the product at least a month.</li>
            <li>but I can completely notice a different.</li>
            <li>I was also a sun worshiper and never really took care of my complexion...and it really shows the damage.  </li>
            <li>This is a far cry from the other offers for the facial treatment for wrinkles.</li>

            <li> but I could care less about the vitamin c toner.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic Acid Serum is in a dropper and like a glycerin product, and to use no more than two drops.</li>
            <li> and it has a slight smell not good or bad, unknown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought from them before and have never been disappointed!</li>

            <li> This was a waste of money. I have used these products together for over three weeks and I do not see any specific results I believed may happen. I would rather spend the money for the more expensive creams than to feel that I wasted time and effort. The Vitimin C is a water based spray not a cream and it has a slight smell not good or bad, unknown. There are few directions, other than to spray your face once with Vit. C but the spray only covers a 2 inch circle. The Hyaluronic Acid Serum is in a dropper and like a glycerin product, and to use no more than two drops. This is a far cry from the other offers for the facial treatment for wrinkles. This is a lesson learned.</li>
            <li> COSMEDICA supplies excellent customer service in addition to providing superb products. This PREP &amp; TONE solution is a soothing Vitamin C solution that not only is safe for all skin types and is guaranteed with a money back satisfaction policy, but you skin will rarely feel as refreshed as when using this prep and tone solution. After using a cleanser this solution closes the pores of the skin to be tightened by neutralizing the skin surface to ensure skin is clear of excess oil, dirt, and make-up. It prepares the skin for moisturizers, serums or chemical peels - and Cosmedica supplies those elements also. In this set the Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum hydrates and plumps the skin, holding in moisture that is the key for younger looking skin. It is fragrance-free with no added dyes, fragrances or fillers so that men can use this equally well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result of applying this prep and tone will make you skin look refreshed and allow you to get the best benefit from the rest of your skin care regimen. A very popular and solid product from COSMEDICA. Grady Harp, December 14</li>
            <li> Still have spots on face. Will keep trying to see if they leave. And will let you know if wrinkles fade. Nothing yet.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it is awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> Too early to tell whether it does what it claims but so far I am loving the hyaluronic acid , the vit c feels like water. I will add more to my feed back after using the product at least a month.</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase the single items until I saw this listing and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I saved some money and this product is working great! I have had it less than a month but I can completely notice a different. So happy! :)</li>
            <li> When my order arrived, the Vitamin C toner was not sealed and the cap was stained. The HA Serum was sealed and boxed but the Vit C bottle looked like a returned, partially used bottle. I was astonished to receive cosmetics in this condition and will not order from this company again!!!</li>
            <li> This product works well for me. I need hydration for my face and this product provided much needed hydration as well as softness to my face for a great price. I would recommend this product to my friends and family members.</li>
            <li> I like it very much  it looks that it is working  on my skin,</li>
            <li> Only been using product for a few days but so far seems great - my skin feels soft and seem firmer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early for me to tell whether this combo is doing all that it&#x27;s supposed to do but after applying the toner and then putting on the hyaluronic serum, I like the way my skin feels.

The main thing is that my skin, which is extremely sensitive, has not reacted badly to these products so they get a thumbs up for that.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t look or feel so dry  I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in the fine line wrinkles they are still there</li>
            <li> great!! I recommend them for your  facial creme</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this again. I have sensitive, oily, and acne prone skin. I would use these after using my derma roller. (A little goes a long way). Few months later, skin has been amazing.</li>
            <li> great price for both items.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product especially the Vitamin C facial toner for my super active acne pimples skin on my chin for the pass 2-3 months have not leave me in peace (small acne pimple cloud all over looks like i am having a bee hive clustering on my chin.  Due to hormonal all product from korea, japan, local, none can cure.  BUT - Only this superb bottles cure me in a week all gone for good PLUS one more week to dissolve all my blemishes...

Hope you all take time to access all review write out from customers and make a correct decision when purchasing any product as this product really works on me.  GOOD LUCK!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;Chelsa</li>
            <li> I love these products!  They are so refreshing in the morning!  Shipping was super fast!  I&#x27;ve bought from them before and have never been disappointed!</li>
            <li> Such a good value when you compare to all others! Love the feel of the toner followed by the serum!</li>
            <li> Amazing .  Use to pay over hundred dollars at a spa for these items. ...... this is quality.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Love this--immediate results</li>
            <li> This is the best most reasonably priced purist serum I have found and love it!! I&#x27;m 58 years old and have used it on my face and neck and sometimes all over my body for a few months. My face looks radiant!! I definitely recommend all cosmedica products!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I trully recommended.</li>
            <li> I love the spritz... feels refreshing and tingly. not so sure about the serum. Whether they are doing any good or not, I cant tell because I dont use them regularly enough. I am trying to be better... so maybe in a future review.</li>
            <li> Great, perfectly wonderful products! As one who really takes care of my skin, I am thrilled to discover these two items.&lt;br /&gt;This is the 2nd order of these two products because they really work!</li>
            <li> I love the hyaluronic acid but I could care less about the vitamin c toner. The hyaluronic acid makes my skin soft and glory whereas the vitamin c makes it sticky. I will buy the hyaluronic acid separately next time.</li>
            <li> I got the prep and tone and the hydra-c serum.  I&#x27;m 68 years old and wasn&#x27;t sure if it would do anything to my skin. I was also a sun worshiper and never really took care of my complexion...and it really shows the damage.  I started using these products in the morning and at bedtime about 2 1/2 weeks ago.  The change is out of this world!  I have used all the major brands at more than triple the price.  The change in my complexion is remarkable all ready.  My husband even remarked at how soft and smooth my skin felt.  Deep furrows and lines are smoothing out.  I&#x27;ll never use any other products.  Start this while you are young and you&#x27;ll never need a face lift.</li>
            <li> I am beyond pleased with both of these products. I am 33 and have wrinkle creases from smiling :) on my forehead. I have been using both products in the morning before make up and at night before bed with a good moisturizer. It&#x27;s been over a week and I can already see a difference! Not just in the wrinkles but my skin is softer and than smoother. I will use these for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> People, men and women alike! This is one of those products that.  If you try it you will love it!</li>
            <li> Haven &#x27;t seen any improvements in skin after using for one month.So far ,  I can not tell that I have used anything on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
