            <li>thanks for the great stuff!great stuff!</li>
            <li>I did some research on acne products and found that some people really liked Retin A for controlling acne.  </li>
            <li>My skin is nice and smooth from the product.</li>
            <li>I think this product is a keeper :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this beyond words.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Pleased on both counts.  </li>
            <li>my mom fell in love with it too.</li>
            <li>Also darkness under my eyes are better.</li>
            <li>It is a more even skin tone</li>
            <li>When I use it at night I look more rested when I wake up in the morning, if that makes any sense to you.</li>
            <li>I am 61 &amp; my skin looks better than it did 10 years ago...</li>
            <li>I get better results out of neurogena rapid wrinkle repair.</li>
            <li>i Love these products.</li>
            <li>I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to mix it w something very mild and use 3x a week.</li>
            <li>This is some strong stuff.</li>
            <li>Skin is smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>In just a few days, lines were softened, and my skin felt great!  </li>
            <li>I apply it only at night, although I&#x27;m considering applying it in the morning followed by a good 30 SPF lotion.</li>
            <li>clean, fresh, lines seems to disappear.</li>
            <li>100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Solution, Paraben &amp; Alcohol Free / Multi-use - 30ml</li>
            <li>Very dry, fair, freckled &amp; I burn far better than I tan.</li>
            <li>So far I have noticed a difference in my skin, time will tell more.</li>
            <li>Not crazy.</li>
            <li>so I really have to moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Very well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been unsure which one should layer first, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
            <li>This really works for me.  </li>
            <li>But it is not too much or too stringent.</li>
            <li>I really like it and</li>
            <li>I use so much who knows what&#x27;s doing what</li>
            <li>Have used this product every other evening before bedtime and have noticed a definitive change for the better in the softening of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>it now a normal part of my process.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado at around 7000&#x27; elevation</li>
            <li>New skincare regiment since 11/2014:&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light skinned African American and it&#x27;s helping me.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate your skin, and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been pushing out my white heads and cleaning up my whole face.</li>
            <li>I put it directly on just once a day.</li>
            <li>It is simple, really.</li>
            <li>a 52 year old guy and my skin has improved markedly using this product-  even minimized wrinkles.</li>
            <li>So other than Oil of Olay which I used for years before it started breaking me out, I&#x27;m not a face-stuff guru or fan in general of bottles of mystery stuff full of non-pronounceable ingredients.</li>
            <li>skin is very sensitive to additives &amp; perfumes, for years I only used natural oils head to toe after showering.</li>
            <li>My daughter has been using this for a month now and her acne has completely cleared up, she loves this product especially because it&#x27;s not harsh to her skin but still cleared her skin up.</li>
            <li>I wipe my entire face, yes eyelids included and all 3 are completely non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too many things are irritating or cannot be used around the eyes without howl inducing pain when it gets in your eyes.</li>
            <li>Have only been using this trio for a few months now and seeing tighter skin, diminished jawline crepeness &amp; the smile lines around mouth &amp; eyes are fading.</li>
            <li>My daughter tested it on a small area of her skin for a few days , just to make sure she was not sensative to the Retin A.  </li>

            <li> My face looks so clear, less wrinkles, and glows.</li>
            <li> so it gets very dry, especially during the winters!</li>

            <li> bed &amp; after showering I use 2 pumps each of the following in this order on wet face, neck, chest &amp; hands.</li>

            <li> Smaller wrinkles are gone and deeper wrinkles - especially around the mouth - seem to be less and less.  </li>
            <li> As good if not better than the expensive creams I&#x27;ve wasted money on in the past.</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbs into the skin, and the results are dramatic!  </li>
            <li> Purchased due to other reviews.</li>
            <li> seems to work like other retinol products</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product - as well as other Watts Beauty products.</li>
            <li> WELL WHEN OTHER PRODUCTS ARE APPLIED FLAKES OFF</li>
            <li> Also a few pimples along the chin disappeared after a few tiny applications.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was unable to use the product long enough to see any results, as my skin broke out after the first use.</li>
            <li> Less skin to pull.</li>
            <li> Oredered it a few days ago and can already can see it working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it will work for you</li>
            <li> I can REALLY see the difference, usually winter has me looking miserable with dull &amp; dry looking skin.</li>
            <li> Beauty Peptide - Hyaluronic Acid Concentrated Serum Complex with L - Arginine &amp; Silk Amino Acids- 2oz</li>
            <li> Not good badddddddddddd</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was unable to use the product long enough to see any results, as my skin broke out after the first use.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product.  How long before you saw results.</li>
            <li> I didnt notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Works great on my skin. As good if not better than the expensive creams I&#x27;ve wasted money on in the past.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it at night during the summer months. It does not irritate my sensitive skin. My skin is nice and smooth from the product. I get compliments that I look younger than my age. I think this product is a keeper :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this beyond words. I use it without any problems. I cannot live without this product. I hope that it is continued to be sold in a double batch like this. My daughter and I both LOVE it. My face looks so clear, less wrinkles, and glows.</li>
            <li> So far I have noticed a difference in my skin, time will tell more.</li>
            <li> Yes, that point five percent makes a difference in performance and noticeable results.  I bought one for myself and one as a gift.  Pleased on both counts.  Will purchase this product again.  I use it as a day cream under sunblock.</li>
            <li> 1st time using Watts.  Purchased due to other reviews. Hope this works.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing! i have acne prone skin and hyper-pigmentation and this helps prevent breakout and brightens up my skin. i have oily skin and this is still a good moisturizer. my mom fell in love with it too. she gets pigmentation from the sun and aging and this has brightened up her complexion. love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Works wonders. Oredered it a few days ago and can already can see it working. It&#x27;s been pushing out my white heads and cleaning up my whole face. Skin is smooth and glowing. I apply it only at night, although I&#x27;m considering applying it in the morning followed by a good 30 SPF lotion. Does not irritate your skin, and I have very sensitive skin. Would recommend this product to anyone after 30 who is taking their skin care regimen to an upper level.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I live in Colorado at around 7000&#x27; elevation so it gets very dry, especially during the winters! Add to that the fact that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s so I really have to moisturizer! When I started using this I was shocked to find that I was able to decrease the amount of daily moisturizer needed! I love this stuff and will keep it stocked at my house!</li>
            <li> seems to work like other retinol products</li>
            <li> This really works for me.  My face feels hydrated and my skin looks younger.  Smaller wrinkles are gone and deeper wrinkles - especially around the mouth - seem to be less and less.  I do recommend this product - as well as other Watts Beauty products.</li>
            <li> The reviews were great and I&#x27;ve heard about retinol.  I agree with the rest. Great product.  I had a deep crevice between my eyes from frowning, aging. After about a week it&#x27;s not showing up.  I tried to frown to see if I was crazy. Not crazy. Happy! Also darkness under my eyes are better. Skin is tighter there. Less skin to pull. I&#x27;m a light skinned African American and it&#x27;s helping me. Also a few pimples along the chin disappeared after a few tiny applications.  It&#x27;s not as helpful for my daughter. Maybe it&#x27;s how we use it. I put it directly on just once a day. Then I use the L&#x27;Oréal collagen moisturizer. I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Goodbye Clinique...hello Watts Beauty.  I use the retinol and the hyaluronic acid every day and have noticed a difference in my skin.  It is a more even skin tone and I sometimes go places with no makeup on, I would never do that before.  When I use it at night I look more rested when I wake up in the morning, if that makes any sense to you.</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbs into the skin, and the results are dramatic!  In just a few days, lines were softened, and my skin felt great!  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle, it has don&#x27;t nothing for my skin or wrinkles!</li>
            <li> It is simple, really. This product is phenomenal ! Skin looks clean, fresh, lines seems to disappear. I use it at night only, and would not go without it, ever !</li>
            <li> Have been using for 2 years... I am 61 &amp; my skin looks better than it did 10 years ago... I also take vitamins, amino acids etc for the skin... Watts has a customer for life... Also use their vit-c &amp; peptide serum!</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT BUT DOES NOT MIX WELL WHEN OTHER PRODUCTS ARE APPLIED FLAKES OFF</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  Your skins will exfoliate, and refresh and renew. But it is not too much or too stringent. I really like it and it now a normal part of my process.</li>
            <li> I like it Very much, it works..!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Great results.</li>
            <li> Very well! Buy several times and myself and friends. Great fighting acne!</li>

For the price point Watts has all the store brands beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been unsure which one should layer first, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. Now that winter is here I can REALLY see the difference, usually winter has me looking miserable with dull &amp; dry looking skin. Have only been using this trio for a few months now and seeing tighter skin, diminished jawline crepeness &amp; the smile lines around mouth &amp; eyes are fading. I use all 3 on my hands as well and it&#x27;s helping there as well with dry skin, sun spots &amp; general moisture. I wipe my entire face, yes eyelids included and all 3 are completely non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive to additives &amp; perfumes, for years I only used natural oils head to toe after showering. Very dry, fair, freckled &amp; I burn far better than I tan. So other than Oil of Olay which I used for years before it started breaking me out, I&#x27;m not a face-stuff guru or fan in general of bottles of mystery stuff full of non-pronounceable ingredients. Too many things are irritating or cannot be used around the eyes without howl inducing pain when it gets in your eyes. YUK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love ya Watts!!! thanks for the great stuff!great stuff!</li>
            <li> Did nothing. Doesn&#x27;t work.I get better results out of neurogena rapid wrinkle repair.</li>
            <li> i Love these products. great prices and shipping options</li>
            <li> This is some strong stuff. I can&#x27;t use it every day. I get reddening. But I recently got a compliment on my skin. I use so much who knows what&#x27;s doing what but I like this stuff. I&#x27;m going to mix it w something very mild and use 3x a week.</li>
            <li> Not good badddddddddddd</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter who had some acne, moderate acne.  I did some research on acne products and found that some people really liked Retin A for controlling acne.  My daughter has been using this for a month now and her acne has completely cleared up, she loves this product especially because it&#x27;s not harsh to her skin but still cleared her skin up. I&#x27;m not sure if it will work for you but it did work for my daughters acne. My daughter tested it on a small area of her skin for a few days , just to make sure she was not sensative to the Retin A.  Thank you watts for this product</li>
            <li> Have used this product every other evening before bedtime and have noticed a definitive change for the better in the softening of wrinkles. My skin tone has brightened as well. The price is awesome considering the results. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice -- applies well and you don&#x27;t feel the 2.5% retinol.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin looks smoother and healthier.  I have not had a problem with dryness, peeling or breaking out.  I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Great, great product.  I am a 52 year old guy and my skin has improved markedly using this product-  even minimized wrinkles.</li>
