            <li>This product has more debris in it than I like.</li>

            <li>Fabulous salt!</li>
            <li>she was getting that no creams from the doctor was able to get rid of.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Great to put on a washcloth and gently exfoliate your body and</li>
            <li>everything I have tried from this company and look forward to trying more of their bath products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sea salt seemed of high quality and is packaged attractively.  </li>
            <li>The salt is good size pieces and consistent in color.</li>
            <li>Both products somehow make my water &#x27;softer&#x27; or better able to clean my skin...</li>
            <li>, one was great and one was completely opened in the box.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m comparing their scented Epsom salt product with this genuine Minera  </li>
            <li>I note it is also available in scented form.  </li>
            <li>This company sells the best Dead Sea salt product.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than the stuff in the store, and fabulous if you&#x27;re a prime member on shipping.</li>
            <li>and this stuff is great in a bath following.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, cleared my skin up almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>They are certified as being authentic Dead Sea salts, the price is fair, and they are nice to soak in.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing!!!</li>
            <li>It seems really exotic to soak in a hot tub of this marvelous Dead Sea Salt to relax.  </li>
            <li>I love taking a hot bath in this after a workout before going to sleep at night.  </li>
            <li>They did provide a nice soak, as I had expected, softened the water, and were generally nice and what I hoped to get from them.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased a lavender dead sea salt, but saw this 10lb bag, and felt that it was a very good price.  </li>
            <li>i can not say enough good things about these bath salts...</li>
            <li>Also using it with our foot detox machine and for a good facial scrub too.</li>
            <li>It dissolves quickly in the bath, and does a great job soothing sensitive/inflamed skin due to eczema.</li>
            <li>Ran a very hot bath and a scoopful of these salts, sat in it for about 20 min and felt all the sore aching muscles  just floated away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to keep in the bathroom to pour into the water those days and nights when you want to forget your cares and lavish a little luxury on yourself.  </li>
            <li>This is the best price I&#x27;ve ever found for them (no matter how much my skin bugs me, it will always be hard to justify spending $100 on a bag of SALT).</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Salts are great for a relaxing bath.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling afterwards; my skin was so soft and</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I do very intense sports</li>
            <li>I add my own high quality DoTerra essential oils to the bath with the unscented salts.  </li>
            <li>I have Psoriasis, on my first try I could feel and see a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Although it dried up MY skin, I would recommend it to anybody who are willing to give it a try for good customer service.</li>
            <li>It never fails , every time I get in the tub with this mineral salt</li>
            <li>I will recommend trying the fine grain (although I don&#x27;t have experience with the fine grain) because there were too many hidden rocks with the coarse grain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but I would get a finer grain next time but from the same company.</li>
            <li>This large bag is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised at how thoroughly and quickly the course grain salt dissolves in water.</li>
            <li>Clear skin rash quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>It is pure without any additives.</li>
            <li>Dissolves much quicker in the warm water than epsom salts, and the water is smoother, silkier and makes my skin feel nicer with this dead sea salt.  </li>
            <li>The Dead Sea salts did an amazing job of helping to exfoliate my skin...</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>You can add essential oils, or just enjoy it as is...</li>
            <li>Really made a difference when I went to pumice my feet.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing and cleansing.</li>
            <li>Just a reminder this is the real deal, for me.</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I really like it, and plan to buy this brand from now on.</li>
            <li>Bonus: it has a natural, fresh smell, though it is not scented.</li>
            <li>Huge package, you can save lots of money compare buy retail package in local store.&lt;br /&gt;specially, love the pure dead sea smell.</li>
            <li>I owe the opportunity to do so to the company&#x27;s current marketing initiative but my only obligation/compensation for my efforts is a set of samples of their products and the promise to write a fair review for potential customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The company contacted me and refunded me the full price for my experience even though I didn&#x27;t send the product back.</li>
            <li>I have recently started taking salt baths, not only for my sore feet, but mostly for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Comfortably hot water at a depth that you can sink down into and get skin coverage is also, obviously, important.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Your skin is exposed to more minerals with the Dead Sea product ...</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels after soaking in dead sea salt.</li>
            <li>I go right to sleep and wake up feeling totally refreshed !!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this salt to make a body scrub with almond oil and essential oils, so I ordered the coarse grain.</li>
            <li>El natural!</li>
            <li>First, it cost $700 and had to be applied to my ten spots every night and might take months to see any improvement.  </li>
            <li>As a popular Amazon reviewer has pointed out, Dead Sea Salts have a more complex composition than Epsom salts, which are magnesium tetra hydrate (for the vast part).  </li>
            <li>Thank you for making a product that’s natural with out side effects.</li>
            <li>I am a believer that there are a lot of remedies out there using natural, inexpensive products or food.  </li>
            <li>As with other reviewers, I found this mix in this concentration will provide some useful &#x27;drawing&#x27; action to ease skin irritation from insect bites (in my case, chiggers).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend mixed with some Epsom salt</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go as far as testifying that these particular salts offered a major cure for some seasonal dry skin itching</li>
            <li>It detoxifies my body like no other salt I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>One thing I noticed when searching, was that some people&#x27;s reviews questioned the legitimacy of whether or not the particularly claimed products really contained Dead Sea salts specifically.</li>
            <li>I used two cups of the salt in a bath with peppermint essential oil and felt a noticeable difference in how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li>Did find a couple tiny rocks so far, but I don&#x27;t care about that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For what I was getting, and what I was used to paying, Minera Dead Sea Salts seemed to be right in the ball park.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have Psoriasis, on my first try I could feel and see a difference in my skin.  I will be ordering more.  Thank you for making a product that’s natural with out side effects.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this salt to make a body scrub with almond oil and essential oils, so I ordered the coarse grain. Unfortunately, the &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; grains are too big for this purpose. I am pleasantly surprised at how thoroughly and quickly the course grain salt dissolves in water. I used two cups of the salt in a bath with peppermint essential oil and felt a noticeable difference in how soft my skin was. The addition of the salt and oil makes for a much more relaxing bath. An added plus is that the salt smells like the beach!</li>
            <li> Great product for my daughters skin eczema.</li>
            <li> I really like it it takes a little longer to dissolve so it makes my bath enjoyable.  I like that I can make it into a detox bath or a relaxing bath. I also like it a foot soak  I plan to keep it on hand</li>
            <li> Soaks away all your kinks, and feels great all over!  You can add essential oils, or just enjoy it as is...</li>
            <li> I love love this salt! Way better than epsom salt. Really made a difference when I went to pumice my feet. Very relaxing and cleansing.I am also using this for my 2 year olds eczema. It wirks amazingly!  I will be buying this product again and keeping it in my home as a staple</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love these sea salts for my winter bath! I use them in combination with the epsom salts - sometimes together, sometimes separately. I also put in a few drops of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Ever since I was in the Salt Lake I love the feeling afterwards; my skin was so soft and I felt re-energized. This is the closest I could get to that feeling. When I feel drained or stressed I add a cupful to my bath and the feeling is magical. Who needs Calgon? I am looking forward to purchasing a much larger bulk in the future.</li>
            <li> what a great product...i can not say enough good things about these bath salts...they are wonderful and do exactly what they say they will...amazing feeling and i will buy them again and again...thanks for a great product!!</li>
            <li> Harvested my lavender this year and decided to make bath salts for gifts. The salt is good size pieces and consistent in color. The packaging is a good quality keeping out moisture, so the salt was not clumped at all. Will be purchasing more to use up all the lavendar. Guess what I will be giving people at Christmas.</li>
            <li> I had previously been taking Epsom Salt baths when a friend recommended I change to dead sea salts for the bath.  Ordered this 10# bag of dead sea salts from Amazon.  Came in a timely manner.  Very reasonably priced.  Dissolves much quicker in the warm water than epsom salts, and the water is smoother, silkier and makes my skin feel nicer with this dead sea salt.  I add my own high quality DoTerra essential oils to the bath with the unscented salts.  Good stuff.  Nice and convenient packaging.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is bc I ordered 2 bags, one was great and one was completely opened in the box. You could tell they knew it wasn&#x27;t sealed when it was shipped bc they tried to seal it with an amazon prime sticker, but the sticker couldn&#x27;t hold it closed. So I had 10 lbs of loose sea salt in a box. Amazon was great and gave me a full refund. The bag that was unopened was fantastic!</li>
            <li> Ran a very hot bath and a scoopful of these salts, sat in it for about 20 min and felt all the sore aching muscles  just floated away. Perfect!</li>
            <li> My adventures in comparing salt(s) from the San Francisco Salt Company continue.  I owe the opportunity to do so to the company&#x27;s current marketing initiative but my only obligation/compensation for my efforts is a set of samples of their products and the promise to write a fair review for potential customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m comparing their scented Epsom salt product with this genuine Minera  Dead Sea Salt soak (unscented.)  As a popular Amazon reviewer has pointed out, Dead Sea Salts have a more complex composition than Epsom salts, which are magnesium tetra hydrate (for the vast part).  Your skin is exposed to more minerals with the Dead Sea product ...but you don&#x27;t get the &#x27;aroma-therapy&#x27; that comes with my peppermint/eucalyptus extract sample.  Both products are attractively packaged and the crystals are clean and wholesome.  Both products dissolve well but not instantly in bath-temperature water.  Both products somehow make my water &#x27;softer&#x27; or better able to clean my skin...and I tested that without using soap.  The Dead Sea salts did an amazing job of helping to exfoliate my skin...in comparison to the Epsom-based soak.  I did not expect to see such a difference.  This is a top-class product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For therapeutic purposes, a soak will require about twelve gallons of water and about a pound of these salts and it will take at least twelve minutes of your time.  Well...we are in the tub to rest and relax!  Comfortably hot water at a depth that you can sink down into and get skin coverage is also, obviously, important.  As with other reviewers, I found this mix in this concentration will provide some useful &#x27;drawing&#x27; action to ease skin irritation from insect bites (in my case, chiggers).  Thankfully, I haven&#x27;t had to test this on poison ivy or nettles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From now on, this will be my bath salt of choice.  I note it is also available in scented form.  I enjoyed the peppermint/eucalyptus scent in the Epsom product offered by this company but I look forward to also getting the lavender infused Minera salts for a relaxing, exfoliating soak.orward to also getting the lavender infused Minera salts for a relaxing, exfoliating soak.</li>
            <li> This product has more debris in it than I like.</li>
            <li> Anyone with stress and muscle pain owes it to themselves to have a salt bath.  This stuff is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again and again.&lt;br /&gt;http://bishop55.hubpages.com/hub/Sea-Salt-Bath-The-benefits</li>
            <li> Huge package, you can save lots of money compare buy retail package in local store.&lt;br /&gt;specially, love the pure dead sea smell.</li>
            <li> I love this salt. I should have chosen the fine grade for my body scrub but the salt itself is great. It makes my skin feel and look great. I used it to make body scrub &amp; bath salt as gifts for Christmas and everyone loves it!</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after soaking in dead sea salt. My skin feels softer. My joint pain is reduced.I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> This company sells the best Dead Sea salt product. It is pure without any additives. I use it for a bath, and it is a life-saver for someone who had to deal with eczema. Clear skin rash quickly and efficiently. Nice packaging and fast shipping. I bought it from this company before and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I got this to make hand scrubs.  It&#x27;s a good product, but I would get a finer grain next time but from the same company.</li>
            <li> great price for a great product.  I take a lot of baths in the winter and go through bath products like a fiend.  This large bag is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic. You can actually feel it drawing out the toxins in you body when you soak in it. Very relaxing!!! Will order this product again. Also arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> use on a regular basis</li>
            <li> Great product! Using it for my bath products and it is working wonderful.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Salts are great for a relaxing bath. I used it (with other ingredients) to make bath salt scrubs. It works great for that, too!</li>
            <li> The company contacted me and refunded me the full price for my experience even though I didn&#x27;t send the product back. Although it dried up MY skin, I would recommend it to anybody who are willing to give it a try for good customer service. I will recommend trying the fine grain (although I don&#x27;t have experience with the fine grain) because there were too many hidden rocks with the coarse grain.</li>
            <li> Great product. My wife never liked using our Jacuzzi until I started adding Minerva Dead Sea and Epsen salts. Now she loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Cheaper than the stuff in the store, and fabulous if you&#x27;re a prime member on shipping. El natural! I do very intense sports and this stuff is great in a bath following. Did find a couple tiny rocks so far, but I don&#x27;t care about that. Just a reminder this is the real deal, for me.</li>
            <li> I use it for my feet, it&#x27;s really nice</li>
            <li> Fabulous salt! Makes very good quality ORMUS</li>
            <li> It never fails , every time I get in the tub with this mineral salt I go right to sleep and wake up feeling totally refreshed !!!</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and I use these in lukewarm baths. Not sure how much it actually helps, but it does make my skin feel softer, especially in the winter. Anyway, dead sea salts are often crazy expensive. This is the best price I&#x27;ve ever found for them (no matter how much my skin bugs me, it will always be hard to justify spending $100 on a bag of SALT). And I like that they have different size options, too! Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This dead see salt doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same softening effect on my skin that the dead sea salt does which I buy at the Sunflower Shoppe in Fort Worth, Texas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these salts in my daughter&#x27;s batch since she was 2 or so and it&#x27;s done a great job in eliminating the rashes she was getting that no creams from the doctor was able to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top notch!</li>
            <li> I order this salt at least once a month. I can&#x27;t live without it. It detoxifies my body like no other salt I&#x27;ve tried before. Amazing value.</li>
            <li> Closest thing to going to the Dead Sea</li>
            <li> These work well as soaking salts in a bath. I like them mixed with epson salts and eucalyptus oil or peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> What can one write about salt?  I got this to add into my custom bath recipe (readily available over on the Martha Stewart site) because these salts are so expensive in the store, they must be a specialty item.  I figured in bulk was cheaper. All other ingredients are cheaper at your local store. It performs as one would expect--it dissolves in water.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, cleared my skin up almost immediately.  Love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for a detox process. Also using it with our foot detox machine and for a good facial scrub too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend mixed with some Epsom salt</li>
            <li> I have recently started taking salt baths, not only for my sore feet, but mostly for my skin.  I have found it extremely beneficial.  I had numerous red marks on my legs for which my dermatologist gave me a prescription for a cream to apply nightly.  First, it cost $700 and had to be applied to my ten spots every night and might take months to see any improvement.  Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t get the prescription filled.  When I started using a dead sea salt bath, I noticed that the spots were improving!  I was very surprised!  I was not expecting this result.  I am a believer that there are a lot of remedies out there using natural, inexpensive products or food.  I had originally purchased a lavender dead sea salt, but saw this 10lb bag, and felt that it was a very good price.  I add one cup of this salt, along with a small sprinkle of lavender sea salt to my bath water.  I believe the recommendation is to soak for 20 minutes, warm water and rinse thoroughly after.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It seems really exotic to soak in a hot tub of this marvelous Dead Sea Salt to relax.  It seems to soften the water and feels pampering to the skin.  I love taking a hot bath in this after a workout before going to sleep at night.  It is very relaxing.  The sea salt seemed of high quality and is packaged attractively.  It&#x27;s great to keep in the bathroom to pour into the water those days and nights when you want to forget your cares and lavish a little luxury on yourself.  Great to put on a washcloth and gently exfoliate your body and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love everything I have tried from this company and look forward to trying more of their bath products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A sample bag was provided in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using dead sea salt in the bath for years, but had never used this brand until recently. I really like it, and plan to buy this brand from now on. It dissolves quickly in the bath, and does a great job soothing sensitive/inflamed skin due to eczema. Bonus: it has a natural, fresh smell, though it is not scented. I guess it&#x27;s the mineral content in the salts that makes it smell that way.</li>
            <li> When I was looking for epsom or bath salts to use for a soak, I also had Dead Sea salts in mind. One thing I noticed when searching, was that some people&#x27;s reviews questioned the legitimacy of whether or not the particularly claimed products really contained Dead Sea salts specifically. That&#x27;s when I found Minera brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what I was getting, and what I was used to paying, Minera Dead Sea Salts seemed to be right in the ball park. When I got to trying the salts, they did the trick. I won&#x27;t go as far as testifying that these particular salts offered a major cure for some seasonal dry skin itching I was having at the time, but I can say that I wasn&#x27;t so bothered by itching after soaking. They did provide a nice soak, as I had expected, softened the water, and were generally nice and what I hoped to get from them. I would definitely recommend them. They are certified as being authentic Dead Sea salts, the price is fair, and they are nice to soak in. I do use them regularly.</li>
            <li> Creates wonderful scented bath salts</li>
