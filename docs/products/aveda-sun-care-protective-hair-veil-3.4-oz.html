            <li>But for the finish and texture, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>It smells great.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>it is making my ends look very healthy.</li>
            <li>and I honestly don&#x27;t think it works.</li>
            <li>it came very fast , its very nice on hair non oily, smells nice</li>
            <li>Smells good and light, it doesn&#x27;t make my fine hair feel oily</li>
            <li>Might be ok for thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I love Aveda products</li>
            <li>I might feel better if I thought it had conditioning properties, because my hair FADES anyway</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>and light.</li>
            <li>Important for me that I am swimmer</li>
            <li>smells nice &amp; not nearly as sticky as most sun care hair products.</li>
            <li>But of all the sunscreen sprays I&#x27;ve tried, this one is the best for feeling weightless (as long as you dose properly!)</li>
            <li>It has a light consistency and really did protect my highlighted hair from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Might be more of a nice to have than a need to have - for me at least.</li>
            <li>One of the very very products that protects your hair and scalp from sun and color fading.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much at all to cover hair</li>
            <li>really well even in the Arizona sun.</li>
            <li>(I had my hair up due to the heat or underneath a cap for most of the day).</li>
            <li>Brought this product with me for a 3 weeks trip to mexico, and used it mainly as a leave in conditioner on the go.</li>
            <li>Hard to tell whether or not it helped as a sun veil, but my hair got less frizzy and worn from a summer vacation than what I&#x27;ve experienced before.  </li>
            <li>Last me a whole season.</li>
            <li>Unless I wear a hat constantly, my color fades so I was really hoping this product would work.  </li>
            <li>Left my hair really greasy.</li>
            <li>and therefore it is not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>I have red tones and typically fade fast in the sun, this product really protects the hair from the sun.</li>

            <li> Will last a long while, I believe.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy, dark-brown hair, and didn&#x27;t come home with bleached ends - but wouldn&#x27;t attest that to this product alone</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I put it on wet</li>
            <li> It is pretty expensive, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard enough to find a sunscreen for skin that doesn&#x27;t do this.</li>
            <li> Expensive product, but works very well.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and the product holds my color</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s impossible to tell, with this or any other hair product, because I&#x27;ve never gotten a hair sunburn, and I don&#x27;t really need this for my scalp.</li>
            <li> i used this product everyday i was at the beach this summer</li>
            <li> and it helped preserve my color made my hair feel softer and not so dried out from the ocean and the sun</li>
            <li> I was just in Florida for a few days and used the Aveda after swimming in the ocean and chlorine pool.  </li>
            <li> I colored my hair my usual shade on Sunday evening.......</li>
            <li> I get that it&#x27;s hard to create a sunscreen for the hair that doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it made it greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say, it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t grease up the hair too badly, like some do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but the smell is just awful.</li>
            <li> Made my head itch and burn.. HATE IT!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This not only protects your hair, but your scalp as well. I used it all summer and never had a burn and my hair did not fade. Very satisfied. I will buy it again next summer!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it made it greasy. Might be ok for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I get that it&#x27;s hard to create a sunscreen for the hair that doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy. It&#x27;s hard enough to find a sunscreen for skin that doesn&#x27;t do this. But of all the sunscreen sprays I&#x27;ve tried, this one is the best for feeling weightless (as long as you dose properly!) and light. Now, to what extent is it actually protecting my hair? That&#x27;s impossible to tell, with this or any other hair product, because I&#x27;ve never gotten a hair sunburn, and I don&#x27;t really need this for my scalp. But for the finish and texture, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> it came very fast , its very nice on hair non oily, smells nice it gives shine non frizz at all it is making my ends look very healthy.</li>
            <li> I have color treated damaged hair.... i used this product everyday i was at the beach this summer and it helped preserve my color made my hair feel softer and not so dried out from the ocean and the sun</li>
            <li> Important for me that I am swimmer</li>
            <li> One of the very very products that protects your hair and scalp from sun and color fading. Expensive but worth it. Last me a whole season.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again. I do feel that it can protect my hair but the smell is just awful.</li>
            <li> I love Aveda products but this one is pricey and I honestly don&#x27;t think it works. I might feel better if I thought it had conditioning properties, because my hair FADES anyway</li>
            <li> I have red tones and typically fade fast in the sun, this product really protects the hair from the sun. I put it on wet and it stays in all day while I golf. If I go swimming, I put it on about every 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I was just in Florida for a few days and used the Aveda after swimming in the ocean and chlorine pool.  It has a light consistency and really did protect my highlighted hair from the sun.  I also didn&#x27;t get burned on my scalp like I ususally do.  Expensive product, but works very well.</li>
            <li> smells nice &amp; not nearly as sticky as most sun care hair products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say, it doesn&#x27;t work.  I colored my hair my usual shade on Sunday evening.......reddish brown.  Unless I wear a hat constantly, my color fades so I was really hoping this product would work.  Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings I sprayed my hair with the product.  It&#x27;s Wednesday evening.  My hair color has faded.  It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m not in the sun during the day.  I walk to and from my car throughout the day.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Brought this product with me for a 3 weeks trip to mexico, and used it mainly as a leave in conditioner on the go. Hard to tell whether or not it helped as a sun veil, but my hair got less frizzy and worn from a summer vacation than what I&#x27;ve experienced before.  I have long, wavy, dark-brown hair, and didn&#x27;t come home with bleached ends - but wouldn&#x27;t attest that to this product alone (I had my hair up due to the heat or underneath a cap for most of the day). Do worry that the remains of the bottle will linger in my bathroom until next summer. Might be more of a nice to have than a need to have - for me at least.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy. It is pretty expensive, so I HOPE it is working.</li>
            <li> Left my hair really greasy. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Protect your hair! This product is great. Doesn&#x27;t take much at all to cover hair and therefore it is not heavy or oily. It smells great. Will last a long while, I believe.</li>
            <li> Smells good and light, it doesn&#x27;t make my fine hair feel oily</li>

            <li> I have dark hair and the product holds my color really well even in the Arizona sun.</li>
