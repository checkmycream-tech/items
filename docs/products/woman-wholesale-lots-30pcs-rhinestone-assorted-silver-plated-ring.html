            <li>Mine are different from the photos shown below but these are totally awesome.</li>
            <li>Yes they&#x27;re cute online in person</li>
            <li>Just needed more variety in color, setting and sizes.</li>
            <li>So, 3 cheapy rings that are okay out of 30... Would not recommend.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>If these rings were made with a better quality I could see some of the designs being really cute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my niece will want them anyway.</li>
            <li>Most of the rings came bent.</li>
            <li>I do wish there was more variety in sizes.</li>
            <li>I love all these rings gave some to friends and some to family everyone was please with these rings.</li>
            <li>Great variety and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Very good and different sizes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really beautiful, the rhinestones are all different colors, so you can pick and choose until you find the one or more than you want to wear that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I was super impressed by that, especially considering the price for 30.</li>
            <li>Love theses perfect little rings</li>
            <li>Cute designs and perfect for little gifts.</li>
            <li>There could have been more variety of design but overall happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>can see using these as gifts, especially for kids, or putting a bunch of them together on a chain as a necklace, which would be rather beautiful as well.</li>
            <li>great rings nice seller works for little girls to the ladies</li>
            <li>They are great for the occasional wear.</li>
            <li>I will not be buying anymore cheap jewelry from China</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>in mind I paid about $.15 each for these rings, with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>- I ordered 30 for a party with 28 adult attendees and everyone was able to find one they liked &amp; could fit in.</li>
            <li>Cute, good price, but tiny.</li>
            <li>Fabulous - Definately got MORE than my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>Well worth purchase and better than the original selling photos .</li>
            <li>The rings came in a tiny zip lock bag and there were a nice selection of rings, most of the sizes were 6 and 7 in my bag</li>
            <li>/&gt;Received the full 30 count lot.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re not bad.</li>
            <li>Super for party favors or stocking stuffers, or just to keep a stash on hand as gifts for girls&#x27; birthdays.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured and very pretty!</li>
            <li>They came earlier than I expected and they are really nice quality for a great price.</li>

            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Cheaply made, but I didn&#x27;t pay a whole lot for them either.</li>
            <li>actually quite nice well worth the price</li>
            <li>One came broken but aside from that totally happy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving these away as promotional gifts at my monthly craft show, so they&#x27;re well worth what I paid for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was happy with the fact that they came in adult sizes and we&#x27;re not extremely tiny correct sizes as advertised in the description.</li>
            <li>Out of 30 rings I only like 3 of them and even though I l kind of like them, they&#x27;re not that pretty.</li>
            <li>cute little assortment of rings great for gifts or prizes for carnival games or grab bags for teen girls birthday parties.</li>
            <li>I would happily give these to a child for dress up, but if they&#x27;re too big for me then they&#x27;re too big for a child.</li>
            <li>Love them, different sizes, gems, and designs.</li>
            <li>The sizes and designs were varied, and exactly what I would expect these items to look for the $5.43 price tag.</li>
            <li>Beautiful set of silver plated rings, in various sizes with rhinestones at the center of each and every one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty</li>
            <li>Wish sizes  where more equally distributed from sizes 6-8.</li>
            <li>They are mostly too big for me</li>
            <li>the majority range higher toward sizes 7 thru 9).</li>
            <li>(I kind of expected that).</li>
            <li>I really like the rings!</li>
            <li>When buying remember they aren&#x27;t going to be super nice quality like the more expensive rings.</li>
            <li>they were cute, they came w/ lots of different sizes but had to give more than half away bc</li>
            <li>nice little case for my rings</li>
            <li>Shipped from overseas and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>It took about a whole month to get here.</li>
            <li>They came early and are much more shiny and colorful than expected.</li>
            <li>Mostly small rings, but they were pretty and honestly I would buy again.</li>
            <li>Solid design, young customers love them</li>
            <li>They came in a couple different sizes which is nice for the same reason.</li>
            <li>Cute little rings that you can stack up on your fingers.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have got a little more variety and colors</li>
            <li>I expected them to look realllllly cheap at 30pc for $6...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sorted according to size (increasing left to right) in the attached picture.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get nearly the variety pictured, but still received a decent batch.  </li>
            <li>I did not receive a good variety, most of the settings were the same and quite ugly.</li>
            <li>but  many are small.  </li>
            <li>Most where to small for my fingers.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Silver plated (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a thin plating for the price I paid) but very pretty and lots of different designs.  </li>
            <li>The ring next to it with the pink stone is also supposed to have holes, but the plating has filled them in; as well as the pinky</li>
            <li>Very please with this purchase in a variety of colors and sizes they even came to weeks earlier than estimated arrival</li>
            <li>im giving them to my 7 and 9 year old nieces so they can play with when they play dress up</li>
            <li>So far people who have seen them like the variety and colors.</li>
            <li>The ones that did fit me started to turn my finger green</li>
            <li>Most of them ran very small about size 5-7.</li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t look very cheap, not much of what I expected, lots were similar, but i would recommend it</li>
            <li>Most rings were too big, I have thin fingers.</li>
            <li>Only one ring fit my finger, they come in very small sizes.</li>

            <li> All 30 came a week and a half early!!</li>
            <li> I only give this crap one star because it does not get any lower, looks as cheap as if you got it from a pi√±ata, it is not expensive but is money that went directly to the trash as soon as I opened the envelop</li>
            <li> About five of the rings I received with no stones, a waste of money and way to small, will fit children</li>
            <li> Even if they turn green after a little while they were still fun for a time.</li>
            <li> The ONLY criticism someone might have, is that the width of the bands is not consistent - an individual ring will have thinner and thicker spots.  </li>
            <li> A few of the bands were slightly bent but not enough to be very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Try painting the rings with clear polish before wearing them that will keep them from making your finger green.</li>
            <li> The metal looks really cheap, a few rings were defective in design or broken.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn them against my skin long enough to find any green tinting yet though.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> A few were too big, but for the price I can just give them away.</li>
            <li> And and a few was the same color.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Turned my fingers green and the ring tarnished after only a few hours.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t start turning me green after maybe 2 weeks of continuous wear (shower, sleep, gym, etc)</li>
            <li> the ones i got was a 6 or 5 and all the rings were bent , 4 of the stones were missing they were not even in the bag with the rings ,</li>
            <li> my photo, the ring with the green stone has holes in the design that you can see my skin through.</li>
            <li> Not cheap looking.</li>
            <li> The reason I did not give a five star is because a few came without a stone.</li>
            <li> A lot of the stones were missing on a lot of the rings.</li>
            <li> One was missing a stone.</li>
            <li> For this price point and shipping time (less than 10 days for me, from CHINA!)</li>
            <li> When it arrived, it came in a little package and I was expecting them to at least be in a ring holder.</li>
            <li> All of the settings wrapped around the gem (which looks like a rhinestone btw) and I wanted at least a few rings with the prong setting.</li>
            <li> Well uh, DUH.</li>
            <li> some were missing stones, a few were badly bent.</li>
            <li> Came horribly chipped and are obviously made of plastic.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, whatever they are plated with has no quality at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just casual rings to wear.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> We ordered toe rings with elastic bottoms and received the wrong ones, she was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> , they look horrible, they are repeated, there were pieces of metal falling from the package, can&#x27;t even describe it, they looked awful!!!.</li>

            <li> Biggest mistake in 2015</li>
            <li> Very nice rings great for my daughters grab bags at their birthday parties</li>
            <li> Great! They came early and are much more shiny and colorful than expected.</li>
            <li> actually quite nice well worth the price, doesn&#x27;t look very cheap, not much of what I expected, lots were similar, but i would recommend it</li>
            <li> Mostly small rings, but they were pretty and honestly I would buy again. They didn&#x27;t start turning me green after maybe 2 weeks of continuous wear (shower, sleep, gym, etc) so I was super impressed by that, especially considering the price for 30. One came broken but aside from that totally happy!</li>
            <li> Assorted sizes cute for a teenager</li>
            <li> Mine are different from the photos shown below but these are totally awesome. Well worth purchase and better than the original selling photos . Get these ! They&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> Love them, different sizes, gems, and designs. All 30 were delivered.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my purchase buying these rings. They came earlier than I expected and they are really nice quality for a great price. I would recommended these to anybody.</li>
            <li> I had received these rings today, i love them they are great for the price. When buying remember they aren&#x27;t going to be super nice quality like the more expensive rings. Some of the rings were bent , but again i only paid $5.00 usd for them. They are great for the occasional wear.</li>
            <li> Yes they&#x27;re cute online in person no. But for the price u pay they&#x27;re not bad.</li>
            <li> I love them, there all so beautiful not cheap looking I want more!!!!</li>
            <li> A color for everything</li>
            <li> bought them bc they were cute, they came w/ lots of different sizes but had to give more than half away bc they were just way too big for me.</li>
            <li> My kids and my niece loved them.thanks.</li>
            <li> Out of 30 rings I only like 3 of them and even though I l kind of like them, they&#x27;re not that pretty. I did not receive a good variety, most of the settings were the same and quite ugly. All of the settings wrapped around the gem (which looks like a rhinestone btw) and I wanted at least a few rings with the prong setting. Just needed more variety in color, setting and sizes. Most rings were too big, I have thin fingers. So, 3 cheapy rings that are okay out of 30... Would not recommend. The metal looks really cheap, a few rings were defective in design or broken. I will not be buying anymore cheap jewelry from China that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Love theses perfect little rings</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the basic breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received the full 30 count lot.  The sizes and designs were varied, and exactly what I would expect these items to look for the $5.43 price tag. The sizes range from 4 1/2 to 8 1/2, and the glass chips seem to run the gamut of the rainbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for polished, evenly coated beauties, then these are not for you.  The thickness of the band is nowhere uniform, and in some spots the metal isn&#x27;t quite luster polished around the &amp;#34;gems&amp;#34; or design.  The silver plating does seem to have held up well during shipping, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get nearly the variety pictured, but still received a decent batch.  I&#x27;m giving these away as promotional gifts at my monthly craft show, so they&#x27;re well worth what I paid for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the items four stars, despite the detractions, because I feel the item met the expectations I had for it.  For this price point and shipping time (less than 10 days for me, from CHINA!), I&#x27;m perfectly happy, and will probably order these again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful set of silver plated rings, in various sizes with rhinestones at the center of each and every one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really beautiful, the rhinestones are all different colors, so you can pick and choose until you find the one or more than you want to wear that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see using these as gifts, especially for kids, or putting a bunch of them together on a chain as a necklace, which would be rather beautiful as well.</li>
            <li> About five of the rings I received with no stones, a waste of money and way to small, will fit children</li>
            <li> Cheap but like the price</li>
            <li> Pretty but  many are small.  You should try and make them sizeable.</li>
            <li> No they don&#x27;t adjust, too big so of course I can&#x27;t wear them . Good thing they are cheap. My kids lay with them!! Oh well</li>
            <li> Came horribly chipped and are obviously made of plastic.</li>
            <li> I ordered my rings Easter Sunday, and they came today! The rings came in a tiny zip lock bag and there were a nice selection of rings, most of the sizes were 6 and 7 in my bag but I will give the left over rings I don&#x27;t use to my younger sisters. Very satisfied with my purchaseüëèüòÅ</li>
            <li> They are nothing like the photos.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and some of them didn&#x27;t even have a diamond...</li>
            <li> Try painting the rings with clear polish before wearing them that will keep them from making your finger green.</li>
            <li> Wish sizes  where more equally distributed from sizes 6-8. Most where to small for my fingers.</li>
            <li> Can chose all kind for all days</li>
            <li> Very please with this purchase in a variety of colors and sizes they even came to weeks earlier than estimated arrival time.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;On another note I was happy with the fact that they came in adult sizes and we&#x27;re not extremely tiny correct sizes as advertised in the description. 5 ***** for value description and shipping time</li>
            <li> looks nice and even better for the price</li>
            <li> This made great gifts i loved them makes things easier when in bulk.</li>
            <li> Very good and different sizes</li>
            <li> i got all 30 rings in the mail yesterday , came in all one size only i wear a size 8 or 9 but the ones i got was a 6 or 5 and all the rings were bent , 4 of the stones were missing they were not even in the bag with the rings , im giving them to my 7 and 9 year old nieces so they can play with when they play dress up , i just love wasting my money on junk , SMH!!!!</li>
            <li> Cute, good price, but tiny.</li>
            <li> I only give this crap one star because it does not get any lower, looks as cheap as if you got it from a pi√±ata, it is not expensive but is money that went directly to the trash as soon as I opened the envelop, they look horrible, they are repeated, there were pieces of metal falling from the package, can&#x27;t even describe it, they looked awful!!!.</li>
            <li> Good Fun! Cute little rings that you can stack up on your fingers. All different sizes and colors. Even if they turn green after a little while they were still fun for a time.</li>
            <li> We ordered toe rings with elastic bottoms and received the wrong ones, she was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Solid design, young customers love them</li>
            <li> I got all 30 rings earley and in great condition. The rings are very sturdy and a great buy!</li>
            <li> So far people who have seen them like the variety and colors. Have not had any complaints. My only concern is that the sizes. Are not identified to its constantly trying on ring and sorting them before trying to give them away</li>
            <li> I wish I would have got a little more variety and colors</li>
            <li> Beautiful rings!  Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Fabulous - Definately got MORE than my money&#x27;s worth.  Here&#x27;s the size distribution I received:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;size 5  7 rings&lt;br /&gt;size 6  8 rings&lt;br /&gt;size 7  3 rings&lt;br /&gt;size 8  8 rings&lt;br /&gt;size 9  4 rings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind I paid about $.15 each for these rings, with free shipping.  BARGAIN!  There&#x27;s a nice variety of settings and color stones.  The silver is nice and shiny - I don&#x27;t expect it to stay that way forever.  The ONLY criticism someone might have, is that the width of the bands is not consistent - an individual ring will have thinner and thicker spots.  But at this price, who cares! ?!?!</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured and very pretty!</li>
            <li> These were by far one of my best Amazon purchases yet.  Silver plated (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a thin plating for the price I paid) but very pretty and lots of different designs.  I&#x27;m a silversmith, and can attest to the fact that they appeared way more valuable than what I paid for them!  Super for party favors or stocking stuffers, or just to keep a stash on hand as gifts for girls&#x27; birthdays.  Came in a variety of sizes - I ordered 30 for a party with 28 adult attendees and everyone was able to find one they liked &amp; could fit in.</li>
            <li> If these rings were made with a better quality I could see some of the designs being really cute. Unfortunately, whatever they are plated with has no quality at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my photo, the ring with the green stone has holes in the design that you can see my skin through. The ring next to it with the pink stone is also supposed to have holes, but the plating has filled them in; as well as the pinky ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive 30 rings. Only one came warped and out of shape. They are mostly too big for me (I think maybe two size 4, three size 6.5, and the majority range higher toward sizes 7 thru 9). The ones that did fit me started to turn my finger green (I kind of expected that). I would happily give these to a child for dress up, but if they&#x27;re too big for me then they&#x27;re too big for a child. I&#x27;m sure my niece will want them anyway.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I EXPECTED. BEAUTIFUL COLORS. I WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM ORDERING THIS AGAIN. PLUS, IT ARRIVED EARLIER THAN THEY ESTIMATED.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. One was broke. Looks nothing like the photos.</li>
            <li> cute little assortment of rings great for gifts or prizes for carnival games or grab bags for teen girls birthday parties. They came in a couple different sizes which is nice for the same reason. I haven&#x27;t worn them against my skin long enough to find any green tinting yet though. they are a good value for the price and I&#x27;m looking forward to using them as prizes for a ring toss at a family event this summer.</li>
            <li> Great product. Shipped from overseas and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Most of these are good. But some of them must of been made baby size.  Great for children.</li>
            <li> All 30 came a week and a half early!! Beautiful colors! A few were too big, but for the price I can just give them away. Not cheap looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny how there are some saying they look cheap. Well uh, DUH. You&#x27;re getting 30 rings for 6 bucks. So you&#x27;re paying about 20 cents per ring. Obviously they&#x27;re not gonna be sterling silver or anything. You want nice rings, pay more money. I just ordered mine but I&#x27;m not expecting them to be nice. Just casual rings to wear.</li>
            <li> I really like the rings! The reason I did not give a five star is because a few came without a stone. And and a few was the same color. Other than that they where great!</li>
            <li> Most of the rings came bent. But the ones that weren&#x27;t, were beautiful pieces. I do wish there was more variety in sizes. Most of them ran very small about size 5-7.</li>
            <li> A lot of the stones were missing on a lot of the rings.</li>
            <li> I love all these rings gave some to friends and some to family everyone was please with these rings.</li>
            <li> Great Deal, i am buying some for my mom,step mom,sisters...i am sure they will love them also !!!</li>
            <li> One was missing a stone. There could have been more variety of design but overall happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, but I didn&#x27;t pay a whole lot for them either.</li>
            <li> great rings nice seller works for little girls to the ladies</li>
            <li> I expected them to look realllllly cheap at 30pc for $6...I was pleasantly surprised! They are good quality, all sizes and styles!!</li>
            <li> It took about a whole month to get here. When it arrived, it came in a little package and I was expecting them to at least be in a ring holder. Only one ring fit my finger, they come in very small sizes.</li>
            <li> I received all 30 rings earlier than the estimated delivery date. There is a fair amount of variation in stone color and ring design. A few of the bands were slightly bent but not enough to be very noticeable. They varied in sizes from 6-9. They&#x27;re sorted according to size (increasing left to right) in the attached picture.</li>
            <li> My customers really liked the product.</li>
            <li> Awesome, not items pictured</li>
            <li> Turned my fingers green and the ring tarnished after only a few hours.</li>
            <li> Great variety and shipping was fast. Cute designs and perfect for little gifts.</li>
            <li> very cute rings, all different sizes. some were missing stones, a few were badly bent.</li>
            <li> nice little case for my rings</li>
