            <li>perfect ite i am from brazil</li>
            <li>I purchased a couple of them and am very happy with this color #04 and the price!  </li>
            <li>Amazon has the very best price.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with my favorite color of lipstick of revlon!</li>
            <li>Colorstay is a great product and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Great price and speedy delivery.  </li>
            <li>(Which is always good for girls expecting goodnight kisses)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>just doesn&#x27;t feel good on.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Love the color!  </li>
            <li>Cute!</li>
            <li>Nice color that lasts but tends to cake on the lips</li>
            <li>However, I was thrilled to find them with this seller.  </li>
            <li>but it was the most gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>Lovely color, stays on through EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>This is no longer &amp;#34;on the shelves&amp;#34; of the drugstores and markets, so I was glad to find it here.</li>
            <li>Make sure you rub excess off as you are taking it out of tube.</li>
            <li>more of a creme than a frost.</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick and could not find anywhere in this color.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get this lipstick, that is no longer sold in the stores, as it has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I have NO idea why in the world Revlon would discontinue this whole line of liquid lipsticks, because frankly,if you put them on correctly, they are amazing!</li>
            <li>It is very light and sweet, and perfect for summer or those days where you want to look \\&quot;natural\\&quot; but not completely!</li>
            <li>At one time I couldn&#x27;t find it, but now it seems to be available again</li>
            <li>this lipstick is great; it stays on for long periods of time</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Great staying power... felt kind of icky on lips also have to spread quickly before drying otherwise</li>
            <li>Happy in pINK</li>
            <li>So...this particular color is more of a Barbie-pink, if you know what I mean...not shimmery...but glossy...</li>
            <li>I intend to buy a LOT more of a lot of different shades of this lipstick.</li>
            <li>A very nice color, and hard to find lipstick.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long while and love it.</li>
            <li>However, this color is really intense.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>it was more than I thought I ought to have spent on a whim</li>
            <li>I initially tried the Colorstay Ultimate Liquid Lipstick when I saw an amazing color in a local grocery store....</li>
            <li>Add on layers after each one dries for a deeper shade of this cotton-candy pink or just one for a sweet baby-doll look.</li>
            <li>Stays on all day and does not dry out my lips.</li>

            <li> I found the whole line of colors here on Amazon, much less than what I paid at the grocery store!</li>
            <li> This color blends in over lipliner and  does last a very long time.</li>
            <li> They will last ages on your lips and a tube lasts a very long while.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry our your lips and it does stay on.</li>
            <li> I bought this Prime Pink lipstick and ended up giving it to my teen daughter, not because it looked bad on me, but because it looked even better on her</li>
            <li> I actually had trouble getting it all off!</li>
            <li> so very little goes a long way!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Then I had trouble finding it!</li>
            <li> Amazon came through as always for me on hard to find items.</li>
            <li> I was so sad to not find this color anywhere around here.  </li>

            <li> Nice color that lasts but tends to cake on the lips</li>
            <li> perfect ite i am from brazil so i bougth wen i traveled! I want this in Brazil! Tanks for the attention!</li>
            <li> this lipstick is great; it stays on for long periods of time so very little goes a long way!!!!!  recommend.</li>
            <li> Watery I didn&#x27;t like this</li>
            <li> Once in a while a product lives up to it&#x27;s hype. This one does. It doesn&#x27;t dry our your lips and it does stay on.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long while and love it. At one time I couldn&#x27;t find it, but now it seems to be available again</li>
            <li> Love the color!  It is a bit sticky so I use bag balm or gloss over it after it dries.  Stays on for hours!</li>
            <li> Colorstay is a great product and it stays on all day. However, this color is really intense. Unless you want to look like a 1960s go-go dancer, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain at all! Lovely color, stays on through EVERYTHING. I actually had trouble getting it all off! (Which is always good for girls expecting goodnight kisses)</li>
            <li> I was so sad to not find this color anywhere around here.  However, I was thrilled to find them with this seller.  I purchased a couple of them and am very happy with this color #04 and the price!  Happy in pINK</li>

            <li> This color is so feminine. Have worn this color for 2 yrs. with different lipliners.This color blends in over lipliner and  does last a very long time. There is no taste or smell. Make sure you rub excess off as you are taking it out of tube. Amazon has the very best price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this lipstick for a while in every store that sells revlon and didn&#x27;t appear, so I decided to buy it online and I&#x27;m very happy with my favorite color of lipstick of revlon!</li>
            <li> A very nice color, and hard to find lipstick.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Stays on all day and does not dry out my lips. I can use a gloss over it and it still stays on.</li>
            <li> I bought this Prime Pink lipstick and ended up giving it to my teen daughter, not because it looked bad on me, but because it looked even better on her and she wanted it!

It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Great staying power... felt kind of icky on lips also have to spread quickly before drying otherwise its stay were its placed. It does what product states... just doesn&#x27;t feel good on.</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick and could not find anywhere in this color.  Amazon came through as always for me on hard to find items.</li>
