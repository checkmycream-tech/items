            <li>On a plus side my wife liked the smell, and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>It is my new favorite!!</li>
            <li>Excellent n nice but too small</li>
            <li>Just fresh and nice.</li>
            <li>I am perfume lover and that I&#x27;m very particular of what I wear, but this was exceptional.</li>
            <li>this is one of the most amazing perfumes thanks</li>
            <li>but I heard other brands like Bright Crystal and etc are gaining good reviews too.</li>
            <li>just okay, i&#x27;m glad i tried the tester first,  not to please with the perfumes on amazon, they appear to be unlike the ones purchase in the stores;;;;</li>
            <li>Smells absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I could of got this for free at Macys.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic fragrance.</li>
            <li>I think it is a fabulous scent.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and last all day..  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice from back ground to frange</li>
            <li>- so very fresh.  </li>
            <li>Very strong and sweet at first.</li>
            <li>This reminds me of the spring time, very light and crisp scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>And the bottle is so cute ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every cent!</li>
            <li>It.s very tiny but it.s a great way to see if you like it first.</li>
            <li>This Crystal Noir is very different from Bright Crystal.</li>
            <li>This is not the sweet, or the flowery.  </li>
            <li>MY absolute favorite of all time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good scent for those that want to have more toned down scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your quick shipping :-)</li>
            <li>, this little bottle is perfect for purse, I do prefer the large spray bottle,</li>
            <li>(cause some perfumes don&#x27;t wear well on others due to phermones,I hope I spelled that correctly) but it smells great on</li>
            <li>The fragrance is wonderful for me and tends to last a long time.</li>
            <li>A Very mild but soft pleasant scent and not loud.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I liked it at all, but after a few minutes, it turned into a fresh, yet sweet floral that is super feminine (still a bit too strong).</li>
            <li>Overpriced for size, but overall amazing smell</li>
            <li>Loved it so much I purchased the larger bottle!!</li>
            <li>THIS ONE IS MAYBE FOR THE ELDER, HAVE TO HAVE A DISTINCT MOOD TO HAVE THE SCENT.  </li>
            <li>you &amp; I smile and thank them for the compliment.</li>
            <li>bottle was absolutely genuine &amp; new.  </li>
            <li>this is not a real perfume product smells nothing like the others I own.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>needs to conme in a bigger size, love the scent</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li>I got a sample size instead of spending more on a larger bottle.  </li>
            <li>Glad I only paid 10 for this</li>
            <li>Love the smell just wish they were not so  tiny.</li>
            <li>I wear it especially when I&#x27;m dressed up sexy.</li>
            <li>Great as a gift or tester for yourself since it is small and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Bought this as a stocking gift for my wife and it looks like I&#x27;m going to have to follow up with a bigger bottle because she loves its light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sweet or clinging, it does have a fresh floral underlay, yet it&#x27;s suitable for nighttime wear.</li>
            <li>This perfume is grown up and mature not too musky and too floral sweet.</li>
            <li>the noir is nice just a little heavier.more for night use.</li>
            <li>all the way hahahahaha</li>
            <li>Unusual for my habits.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my sister and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>This is available at your big department stores-go smell it.  </li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I absolutely can&#x27;t believe that anyone  gave this any stars.  </li>
            <li>It does not take much</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>Will buy again, I was wearing LIGHT BLUE BY (D &amp;G)  </li>
            <li>Shipped incredibly fast too..</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is very snug so be careful when opening or you will wear more perfume than you might want to.</li>
            <li>The gardenia is soft &amp; pretty &amp; then there are the spicy notes of cardamom, ginger, pepper &amp; sandalwood with an underlayment of gentle musk.  </li>
            <li>Nice long lasting fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Very soft, subtle scent that is pleasant to smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is genuine, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The bottle is small, but, smells really nice.</li>
            <li>It has a creamy dark amber exotic thing going on that I shamefully can&#x27;t put into words well.</li>
            <li>I thought, it&#x27;s more for brunettes and dark skin ladies.</li>
            <li>I live in Nj and so does seller so shipping was ridiculously fast.</li>
            <li>pure as examples of other fragrances I enjoy.  </li>
            <li>It has an exotic coconut scent but not sweet, fruity nor suntan lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love almost all the Chanels, alien, D&amp;G Light Blue, and DKNY</li>
            <li>Ladies, if you want a lovely scent that is not overbearing or you want a sexy new scent for your man, can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li>I love this little bottle for my collection.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t last as long as some others but it.s ok.</li>
            <li>Very nice perfume, it may be small but a little dab will do you, reasonable cost and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I love the way this  smells very soft and the smell last a long  time.</li>
            <li>Such a light but vibrant attraction- will be buying a larger quantity.</li>
            <li>im not good at explaining top notes undertones and all that perfume speak!</li>
            <li>The Noir is a new fragrance for me.</li>
            <li>, I am very sensitive to odors, I have Synesthesia, so</li>
            <li>It is unique and not like any other perfume I have smelt.</li>
            <li>It is a very small container, but the smell is a really fresh and clean smell.  </li>
            <li>I so far like the Versace brand.</li>
            <li>but I think this one might be too old for me.</li>
            <li>classy perfume.</li>
            <li>Its very mature, and when worn at night, it pulls the opposite sex closer.  </li>
            <li>Out of the three perfumes I wear in total, I&#x27;ve tested &amp; compared the other two with this perfume &amp; hands down, it&#x27;s at THE top of my list.</li>
            <li>very small box, easy to lose.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE FIRST ITEM WHICH WAS LIKE A LITTLE BIT</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am SO hooked up! :)</li>
            <li> I thought i would smell more of an amber musk with &#x27;Noir&#x27; in the name.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite from Versace.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite winter scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> girls love it .. and its pocket size</li>
            <li> I love Versace.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is better then most I have worn.  </li>
            <li> It is a sexy.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Smells more like it&#x27;s for men.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making my mother a happy &amp;#34;woman&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> smells heavenly love it will purchase more</li>
            <li> Try it, I KNOW you&#x27;ll LOVE it like I do.</li>
            <li> i love this</li>
            <li> I just love the way it smell.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh-washed and very clean on me.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!!</li>
            <li> On a plus side my wife liked the smell, and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> It is my new favorite!!</li>
            <li> Excellent n nice but too small</li>
            <li> Just fresh and nice.</li>
            <li> I am perfume lover and that I&#x27;m very particular of what I wear, but this was exceptional.</li>
            <li> this is one of the most amazing perfumes thanks</li>
            <li> but I heard other brands like Bright Crystal and etc are gaining good reviews too.</li>
            <li> just okay, i&#x27;m glad i tried the tester first,  not to please with the perfumes on amazon, they appear to be unlike the ones purchase in the stores;;;;</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I could of got this for free at Macys.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic fragrance.</li>
            <li> I think it is a fabulous scent.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and last all day..  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice from back ground to frange</li>
            <li> - so very fresh.  </li>
            <li> Very strong and sweet at first.</li>
            <li> This reminds me of the spring time, very light and crisp scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> And the bottle is so cute ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every cent!</li>
            <li> It.s very tiny but it.s a great way to see if you like it first.</li>
            <li> This Crystal Noir is very different from Bright Crystal.</li>
            <li> This is not the sweet, or the flowery.  </li>
            <li> MY absolute favorite of all time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good scent for those that want to have more toned down scent.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your quick shipping :-)</li>
            <li> , this little bottle is perfect for purse, I do prefer the large spray bottle,</li>
            <li> (cause some perfumes don&#x27;t wear well on others due to phermones,I hope I spelled that correctly) but it smells great on</li>
            <li> The fragrance is wonderful for me and tends to last a long time.</li>
            <li> A Very mild but soft pleasant scent and not loud.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I liked it at all, but after a few minutes, it turned into a fresh, yet sweet floral that is super feminine (still a bit too strong).</li>
            <li> Overpriced for size, but overall amazing smell</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I purchased the larger bottle!!</li>
            <li> THIS ONE IS MAYBE FOR THE ELDER, HAVE TO HAVE A DISTINCT MOOD TO HAVE THE SCENT.  </li>
            <li> you &amp; I smile and thank them for the compliment.</li>
            <li> bottle was absolutely genuine &amp; new.  </li>
            <li> this is not a real perfume product smells nothing like the others I own.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> needs to conme in a bigger size, love the scent</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li> I got a sample size instead of spending more on a larger bottle.  </li>
            <li> Glad I only paid 10 for this</li>
            <li> Love the smell just wish they were not so  tiny.</li>
            <li> I wear it especially when I&#x27;m dressed up sexy.</li>
            <li> Great as a gift or tester for yourself since it is small and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Bought this as a stocking gift for my wife and it looks like I&#x27;m going to have to follow up with a bigger bottle because she loves its light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sweet or clinging, it does have a fresh floral underlay, yet it&#x27;s suitable for nighttime wear.</li>
            <li> This perfume is grown up and mature not too musky and too floral sweet.</li>
            <li> the noir is nice just a little heavier.more for night use.</li>
            <li> all the way hahahahaha</li>
            <li> Unusual for my habits.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sister and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This is available at your big department stores-go smell it.  </li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> I absolutely can&#x27;t believe that anyone  gave this any stars.  </li>
            <li> It does not take much</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> Will buy again, I was wearing LIGHT BLUE BY (D &amp;G)  </li>
            <li> Shipped incredibly fast too..</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It is very snug so be careful when opening or you will wear more perfume than you might want to.</li>
            <li> The gardenia is soft &amp; pretty &amp; then there are the spicy notes of cardamom, ginger, pepper &amp; sandalwood with an underlayment of gentle musk.  </li>
            <li> Nice long lasting fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Very soft, subtle scent that is pleasant to smell.</li>
            <li> The scent is genuine, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small, but, smells really nice.</li>
            <li> It has a creamy dark amber exotic thing going on that I shamefully can&#x27;t put into words well.</li>
            <li> I thought, it&#x27;s more for brunettes and dark skin ladies.</li>
            <li> I live in Nj and so does seller so shipping was ridiculously fast.</li>
            <li> pure as examples of other fragrances I enjoy.  </li>
            <li> It has an exotic coconut scent but not sweet, fruity nor suntan lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love almost all the Chanels, alien, D&amp;G Light Blue, and DKNY</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you want a lovely scent that is not overbearing or you want a sexy new scent for your man, can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I love this little bottle for my collection.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t last as long as some others but it.s ok.</li>
            <li> Very nice perfume, it may be small but a little dab will do you, reasonable cost and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love the way this  smells very soft and the smell last a long  time.</li>
            <li> Such a light but vibrant attraction- will be buying a larger quantity.</li>
            <li> im not good at explaining top notes undertones and all that perfume speak!</li>
            <li> The Noir is a new fragrance for me.</li>
            <li> , I am very sensitive to odors, I have Synesthesia, so</li>
            <li> It is unique and not like any other perfume I have smelt.</li>
            <li> It is a very small container, but the smell is a really fresh and clean smell.  </li>
            <li> I so far like the Versace brand.</li>
            <li> but I think this one might be too old for me.</li>
            <li> classy perfume.</li>
            <li> Its very mature, and when worn at night, it pulls the opposite sex closer.  </li>
            <li> Out of the three perfumes I wear in total, I&#x27;ve tested &amp; compared the other two with this perfume &amp; hands down, it&#x27;s at THE top of my list.</li>
            <li> very small box, easy to lose.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE FIRST ITEM WHICH WAS LIKE A LITTLE BIT</li>
            <li> Took a little long to arrive but nevertheless, it was PURE VERSACE.</li>
            <li> I was happy to get this little bottle of cologne because it&#x27;s very expensive -</li>
            <li> I usually wear Pleasures by Estee Lauder--this is very different--light</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed disgruntled people saying that their Versace isn&#x27;t lasting very long: well, that is not the case for this product from this seller.</li>
            <li> I will say its a very soft but heavy fall/winter sent.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> and I put it on after a shower and it lingers on for a long time.  </li>
            <li> or they ask \\&quot;Excuse me</li>
            <li> Three years later, I still have about half the tiny bottle remaining.</li>
            <li> I purchased this small bottle to see if I would actually want to spend about $70 for a much bigger one,  </li>
            <li> it was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> ONe spray and its empty</li>
            <li> I almost believe they sent me a empty box.</li>
            <li> It is about 3/4 of an inch tall and 1 &amp;#34; wide.  </li>
            <li> Need only a few dabs.  </li>
            <li> Looked bigger than it is, too small for the price.</li>
            <li> After this perfume I want to try other Versace brands</li>
            <li> It is unlike any other scent I have smelled.  </li>
            <li> Less than I expected. ...</li>
            <li> The HUGE picture gives you the extremely wrong impression (I mean, who besides a research MD knows what 5 ml&#x27;s is)?...</li>
            <li> Not sickly sweet.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> I like this little bottle because I prefer a \\&quot;dab-on\\&quot; perfume over spray so I can control the amount.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too spicy and heavy for my taste.</li>
            <li> The smell does not stay even for few hours.</li>
            <li> I can get Way over an ounce at Macys for less!  </li>
            <li> I also like these little bottles for travel &amp; since they are small, I use them up before they go \\&quot;off\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Although the scent isn&#x27;t bad, it is the type to give you a headache if you wear too much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be that small when I brought it</li>
            <li> Just a small amount is needed.  </li>
            <li> was extrememly small and I was giving it as a gift.</li>
            <li> The bottle is just incredibly small.</li>
            <li> SMALL</li>
            <li> The bottle is so small .17</li>
            <li> the bottle is way too small.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s it type of small.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the bottle was this small.  </li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I paid this much for a sample when I could have gone to Macys for the same price and gotten just shy of 2 ounces!!!  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a spray bottle (which they tell you) and it was very small (which they tell you).</li>
            <li> However, remember that this size is very, very, small.  </li>
            <li> Very very small!  </li>
            <li> THAT YOU UNDERSTAND SORRY NICHOLAS POPEL POPEL3@COLUMBUS.RR.COM</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this smell and it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the size,waaay too small!</li>
            <li> Very expensive perfume</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I like it. It smells fresh-washed and very clean on me. Not sickly sweet. Just fresh and nice.</li>
            <li> Great product and not stagnant.......Took a little long to arrive but nevertheless, it was PURE VERSACE.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a stocking gift for my wife and it looks like I&#x27;m going to have to follow up with a bigger bottle because she loves its light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Its nice though the bottle is too thiny</li>
            <li> Versace did it again.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful fragrance&lt;br /&gt;For your favorite lady</li>
            <li> Very nice perfume, it may be small but a little dab will do you, reasonable cost and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Overpriced for size, but overall amazing smell</li>
            <li> Good stuff. The longer my wife wears it, the better it smelled.</li>
            <li> Luv the smell of this splash.</li>
            <li> very small box, easy to lose.</li>
            <li> I was happy to get this little bottle of cologne because it&#x27;s very expensive - I really liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> Very very small!  I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be big but have never need such a tiny bottle. This is basically a sample size for $10.00. Not worth it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be that small when I brought it I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description  all the way hahahahaha</li>
            <li> Wife and my daughters love it because is compact for the purse</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. The scent will really open up when it&#x27;s applied. Lasts all day- great with a light raspberry lotion and no need for a body mist. Such a light but vibrant attraction- will be buying a larger quantity. Not because I need to reapply but because I want to wear it more days than not. Unusual for my habits. Won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> I like it, it smells nice...it didn&#x27;t last as long as some others but it.s ok. It.s very tiny but it.s a great way to see if you like it first.</li>
            <li> Excellent flavor and perfume for a night out</li>
            <li> Less than I expected. ...didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Smells so good. Great seller, great product!</li>
            <li> I would like a bigger bottle of this perfume ! ]This perfume has a lovely smell. I&#x27;m gonna have to buy a bigger bottle of this for my wife.</li>
            <li> Smells great, will save for special occasions!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the size,waaay too small!</li>
            <li> nice smell, i need a bigger size</li>
            <li> This is my favorite smell ever.  It&#x27;s sexy and grown up without being too musky. Just a small amount is needed.  Noticeably smells of amber and sandalwood.  I get compliments all the time.  Mostly from women.  The smell lingers and smells even better with time.  Goes well from day to night.  I hope I&#x27;m always able to find this, being that it&#x27;s my signature.</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it. Love it. This fragrance lasts all day. Awesome. So many compliments.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sister and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, thx.</li>
            <li> this is not a real perfume product smells nothing like the others I own.</li>
            <li> I love my item. It smells gr8t. I will buy again. But a larger bottle. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I COULDN&#x27;T BE HAPPIER WITH THE PRODUCT! I AM VERY PLEASED AND CAN NOT WAIT TO PURCHASE MORE OF THE PRODUCT WHEN FIHISHED</li>
            <li> Vanilla sweet but in a good way-not sticky vanilla.  This is available at your big department stores-go smell it.  And then buy here :)</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for one of my daughter&#x27;s for her Christmas stocking. She loves it. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I purchased the larger bottle!!</li>
            <li> i espictet biger but it&#x27;s oki</li>
            <li> Son bought this for his girl. The bottle is small, but, smells really nice. It has the wrist dabbers style top. It is very snug so be careful when opening or you will wear more perfume than you might want to.</li>
            <li> Loooovvveee this smell. Definitely will recommend this product. Worth the buy!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice perfume for day or night. It&#x27;s not sweet or clinging, it does have a fresh floral underlay, yet it&#x27;s suitable for nighttime wear. Every time I wear it, someone says, &amp;#34;you smell good; what do you have on?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Looked bigger than it is, too small for the price. Able to get in store for cheaper. It smells so good though. Would recommend in bigger size of going to buy.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely fantastic.  Love the reaction I get.  Do you have a body cream/body wash???? Hoping you do.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I also purchased versace Bright chystal. which is my signature fragrance. and i love it the noir is nice just a little heavier.more for night use.</li>
            <li> Versace Crystal Noir by Versace for Women Eau De Toilette Splash , 5 ml smells so good.  I love this little bottle for my collection.  Thanks for your quick shipping :-)</li>
            <li> The fragrance is wonderful for me and tends to last a long time. I will be getting more of this fragrance</li>
            <li> Got this today. Didn&#x27;t relieve it was a sample bottle. The box says not for sale sample only. I&#x27;m pretty sure I could of got this for free at Macys. On a plus side my wife liked the smell, and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I have already received compliments--I usually wear Pleasures by Estee Lauder--this is very different--light, wish I had bought it in a spray--</li>
            <li> This Crystal Noir is very different from Bright Crystal. They both have the wonderful Versace quality but personally, I like the Noir better.</li>
            <li> Very soft, subtle scent that is pleasant to smell. It definitely makes me think of a chic night out. Very sophisticated and alluring.</li>
            <li> sample model not for sale..</li>
            <li> it was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite ever, I do purchase this often, many compliments on the fresh beautiful scent, this little bottle is perfect for purse, I do prefer the large spray bottle,</li>
            <li> The bottle was as promised. It wasn&#x27;t a spray bottle (which they tell you) and it was very small (which they tell you). The scent is genuine, and lasts a long time. I wore this for my wedding and great memories are now attached to this scent. Three years later, I still have about half the tiny bottle remaining. I am glad I chose this seller, because this seems to be authentic Versace. I&#x27;ve noticed disgruntled people saying that their Versace isn&#x27;t lasting very long: well, that is not the case for this product from this seller.</li>
            <li> I smelled this fragrance at a distance and I purchased this sample to confirm I truly liked it. I don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s too spicy and heavy for my taste.</li>
            <li> im not good at explaining top notes undertones and all that perfume speak! I will say its a very soft but heavy fall/winter sent. It has a creamy dark amber exotic thing going on that I shamefully can&#x27;t put into words well. If there was a category I would put it in the Calvin K&amp;#34;s &amp;#34;Uphoria&amp;#34; family if that helps any. I live in Nj and so does seller so shipping was ridiculously fast. This was packaged well and appears to be the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;. Lasts all day</li>
            <li> needs to conme in a bigger size, love the scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice from back ground to frange</li>
            <li> The Noir is a new fragrance for me. I thought, it&#x27;s more for brunettes and dark skin ladies. No way! This is fantastic fragrance. I am SO hooked up! :)</li>
            <li> I gave this as a stocking stuffer and what a hit it was.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for myself as well. Loved it</li>
            <li> I like this scent even the guy who bought it for me likes it. This perfume is grown up and mature not too musky and too floral sweet. It&#x27;s a good scent for those that want to have more toned down scent. I so far like the Versace brand. After this perfume I want to try other Versace brands but I heard other brands like Bright Crystal and etc are gaining good reviews too.</li>
            <li> Very strong and sweet at first. I didn&#x27;t think I liked it at all, but after a few minutes, it turned into a fresh, yet sweet floral that is super feminine (still a bit too strong). After it wore off somewhat, it was wearable. I thought i would smell more of an amber musk with &#x27;Noir&#x27; in the name. Whatever. The bottle is pretty. Although the scent isn&#x27;t bad, it is the type to give you a headache if you wear too much. Not my favorite from Versace.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this scent!  It is unlike any other scent I have smelled.  This is a grownup perfume.  It has an exotic coconut scent but not sweet, fruity nor suntan lotion.  The gardenia is soft &amp; pretty &amp; then there are the spicy notes of cardamom, ginger, pepper &amp; sandalwood with an underlayment of gentle musk.  This is my favorite winter scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottle was absolutely genuine &amp; new.  I bought it from Amazon - \\&quot;Ships From &amp; Sold By Amazon\\&quot;.  The manufacture code on the box matched the bottle &amp; was manufactured on 5/28/2014 - so very fresh.  I like this little bottle because I prefer a \\&quot;dab-on\\&quot; perfume over spray so I can control the amount.  I also like these little bottles for travel &amp; since they are small, I use them up before they go \\&quot;off\\&quot;.  And the bottle is so cute ;)</li>
            <li> I am perfume lover and that I&#x27;m very particular of what I wear, but this was exceptional.</li>
            <li> I love the way this  smells very soft and the smell last a long  time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I got a sample size instead of spending more on a larger bottle.  It is a beautiful scent but reminds me more of a grandmother.  I&#x27;m no twenty-something myself but I think this one might be too old for me.</li>
            <li> girls love it .. and its pocket size</li>
            <li> Smells great...very tiny</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes, I recommend it to any woman who wants to smell wonderful. thanks.</li>
            <li> was extrememly small and I was giving it as a gift. ONe spray and its empty</li>
            <li> just okay, i&#x27;m glad i tried the tester first,  not to please with the perfumes on amazon, they appear to be unlike the ones purchase in the stores;;;;</li>
            <li> I love Versace.  I intend to purchase a larger bottle when money allows. The fragrance is better then most I have worn.  However, remember that this size is very, very, small.  Know your measures before buying.</li>
            <li> it is my favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, It is what it says it is. The bottle is just incredibly small. Word.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; before I went ahead and purchased a bigger size. I absolutely love this smell! It is unique and not like any other perfume I have smelt. It is a sexy. classy perfume. Love it.</li>
            <li> I Love this!! Smells SO Good. It is my new favorite!! The only way I can personally describe it...SENSUAL!!!</li>
            <li> WELL AMAZON THIS IS THE FIRST ITEM WHICH WAS LIKE A LITTLE BIT SMALL I HOPE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND SORRY NICHOLAS POPEL POPEL3@COLUMBUS.RR.COM THE END</li>
            <li> THis scent is for a night of elegance.  THis size is all I could afford at the time.  This is not the sweet, or the flowery.  Nor does it smell like something you would wear and also have the same scent in a candle, hint hint.  Its very mature, and when worn at night, it pulls the opposite sex closer.  That has been my experience....trust me!  GO ME!</li>
            <li> Way smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Smells more like it&#x27;s for men.</li>
            <li> this is one of the most amazing perfumes thanks</li>
            <li> Nothing Against the person who sold this to me, the product itself came as described.. but the smell of the perfume is something my great grandma would wear.. I bought it for the reviews that said it had a coconut smell to it. I was not impressed with this smell and it gave me a headache. YUK.. Glad I only paid 10 for this otherwise I would have been sending it back for refund.</li>
            <li> This smells so good. The bottle is so small .17oz I almost believe they sent me a empty box.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying move of this!&lt;br /&gt;It makes me feel and smell sexy!&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> Great smell and it got here before the 5 days it was suppose to be here! I recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li> Love the smell just wish they were not so  tiny.</li>
            <li> perfect my wife lovit</li>
            <li> Great smell. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Great smell but the bottle is way too small.  Definelty on of those use twice and that&#x27;s it type of small.  Very expensive perfume but I want more of this kind.</li>
            <li> Sent this one to my mother .  She called me up and was so happy she couldn&#x27;t believe it and it smelled so good.  Thanks for making my mother a happy &amp;#34;woman&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> smells heavenly love it will purchase more</li>
            <li> THIS ONE IS MAYBE FOR THE ELDER, HAVE TO HAVE A DISTINCT MOOD TO HAVE THE SCENT.  THIS ONE SPEAKS WINTER MOOD.</li>
            <li> I absolutely can&#x27;t believe that anyone  gave this any stars.  The HUGE picture gives you the extremely wrong impression (I mean, who besides a research MD knows what 5 ml&#x27;s is)?...It is about 3/4 of an inch tall and 1 &amp;#34; wide.  They should have measured this in drops instead of ml&#x27;s!  I can get Way over an ounce at Macys for less!  I feel cheated to the ultimate!.. I can&#x27;t believe I paid this much for a sample when I could have gone to Macys for the same price and gotten just shy of 2 ounces!!!  Robbery.</li>
            <li> This reminds me of the spring time, very light and crisp scent. Looking forward to using it for the spring and summer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this small bottle to see if I would actually want to spend about $70 for a much bigger one,  This smells so beautiful.  It does not take much and I put it on after a shower and it lingers on for a long time.  If you just want to test to see if you would like it, this would be the size to purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like it. Wish I had gotten a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Nice long lasting fragrance.  Need only a few dabs.  Anymore would be over powering.</li>
            <li> Excellent n nice but too small</li>
            <li> It is a very small container, but the smell is a really fresh and clean smell.  I work at a bank and smelled this on a lady that came in and knew that I needed to buy it.</li>
            <li> I discovered this wonderful scent at an upscale mall in Dallas,TX while on vacation &amp; had to have it. EVERY time I wear it, I get compliments. Its LASTS ALL day.  A Very mild but soft pleasant scent and not loud. Out of the three perfumes I wear in total, I&#x27;ve tested &amp; compared the other two with this perfume &amp; hands down, it&#x27;s at THE top of my list. I wear it especially when I&#x27;m dressed up sexy. My husband loves the smell. I&#x27;ve had total strangers come up to me(both men &amp; women)whenever I&#x27;m in stores,etc &amp; compliment the scent or they ask \\&quot;Excuse me but what&#x27;s that wonderful perfume your wearing\\&quot; I say, Versace &amp; they say ohhhh I can&#x27;t wear it (cause some perfumes don&#x27;t wear well on others due to phermones,I hope I spelled that correctly) but it smells great on you &amp; I smile and thank them for the compliment. I always keep this stocked up &amp; even keep the sample sprays in my purse. Overall, it&#x27;s expensive but hey it&#x27;s Versace &amp; Priceless to me. It&#x27;s worth every cent! Ladies, if you want a lovely scent that is not overbearing or you want a sexy new scent for your man, can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. It&#x27;s a brand of perfume you must have. Try it, I KNOW you&#x27;ll LOVE it like I do. Thanks for reading. Hope I helped someone today on this item.</li>
            <li> yes this perfume it is delicious, I am very sensitive to odors, I have Synesthesia, so this perfume I was hoping to be light and still great, well, it is light, smells great, and it is not over powering, my friend wears it all the time and I like smelling it on her.</li>
            <li> I smelled this on a friend, then purchased this wonderful sample size for myself.  I think it is a fabulous scent.  I love almost all the Chanels, alien, D&amp;G Light Blue, and DKNY pure as examples of other fragrances I enjoy.  I bought one for my mom and she loves it also.  Great as a gift or tester for yourself since it is small and reasonably priced.  Great stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife and feel that its a counterfeit product. The smell does not stay even for few hours. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> MY absolute favorite of all time</li>
            <li> i love this i smell so good i have to get a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the bottle was this small.  It&#x27;s okay nothing to jump up and shot about!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just got it today I just love the way it smell. Will buy again, I was wearing LIGHT BLUE BY (D &amp;G)  but I will say this is the best.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Getting ALL kinds of compliments. Shipped incredibly fast too.. Thanks</li>
            <li> Too small. I am buying from fragrancenet.com.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try this scent based on the reviews.. It smells great and last all day..  Will I buy a larger bottle ...yes!!</li>
