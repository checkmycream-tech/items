            <li>What a wonderful smell!  </li>
            <li>I am rating this shampoo 4 stars as the ingredients are not organic, but would rate it 5 stars for best choice for being non organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>but I stay with this product line because it continues to do the best job for MY hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I was surprised and happy</li>
            <li>The shampoo is lightly scented, like aloe and apple, not overly fragrant, like old-lady perfume.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo gently cleans your hair, and even though I haven&#x27;t had a blow-out in 2 years, it makes my hair look so healthy.</li>
            <li>it is no more than the cheap stuff people buy and use tons more of!</li>

            <li>This shampoo completely strips my hair and smells like cheap hand soap in a public restroom.  </li>
            <li>the shampoo did what I had hoped I found my hair had a new feel and look</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m one of those who have tried a lot of shampoosin their lifetime and neither cheap nor expensive products were able to deal with my frizzy, tangled up hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo seemed watery and it made me &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; more than usual.</li>

            <li> My wife uses this shampoo and the price I paid for it is half what it costs locally.  She likes it and it is just what she wanted.  I liked the price and service.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2times... Very happy&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> Perfect for color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;Does not strip your color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;You will notice a difference the first time you use this.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful smell!  I really can&#x27;t live without the shampoo and daily conditioner.  Whenever I run out, I look awful.  Do yourself a favor and get this, especially if you have dry hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 years now, it was recommended by my hairstylist after a brazilian blow-out.  This shampoo gently cleans your hair, and even though I haven&#x27;t had a blow-out in 2 years, it makes my hair look so healthy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo seemed watery and it made me &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; more than usual. My long fine hair did not seem to respond well and I needed extra conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love it and so does my hair and price wise it is no more than the cheap stuff people buy and use tons more of!</li>
            <li> My hair loves this shampoo.  I could tell after the first time.  Cannot recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo and it does not take much to lather up</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo it makes my hail shine and controllable</li>
            <li> This shampoo completely strips my hair and smells like cheap hand soap in a public restroom.  The product claims that it has a  WHITE TEA restorative complex  except Orange is a listed ingredient- no white tea- so it smells nothing like white tea.  This shampoo is overpriced and the absolute worst I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My name is Olivia and I am 11 years old. I am writing this review for my mom because I am the one using this product. I got this product because my hair is oily. I swim 4 times a week so the ends of my hair get very dry but my scalp remains oily. After using this shampoo my hair is still dry on the ends but my scalp and hair is no longer oily when used daily. If I skip a day, my hair is oily again. My hair feels soft and looks smooth. The shampoo is lightly scented, like aloe and apple, not overly fragrant, like old-lady perfume.  I am rating this shampoo 4 stars as the ingredients are not organic, but would rate it 5 stars for best choice for being non organic ingredients. I would buy it again. My mom purchases this as part of Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Geat shampoo paired with the conditioner and it does make my hair look healthier and smother.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> This product has exceeded my expectations and I will continue to use this shampoo going forward. It cleans, shines and keeps you hair manageable to style.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for my hair.  Gave it to a friend who does like it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised and happy the shampoo did what I had hoped I found my hair had a new feel and look</li>
            <li> Feels and smells great.</li>
            <li> just as described...arrived on time</li>
            <li> Used to have quite a fight with my hair as it loves to tangle up in the shower and makes me look like I put my finger in the electrical socket afterwards. As I grew my hair longer, the annoyance of it was acerbated by the length of the hair and the time I needed to brush through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those who have tried a lot of shampoosin their lifetime and neither cheap nor expensive products were able to deal with my frizzy, tangled up hair. Scruples White Tea Restorative Shampoo, however, did the trick!  I now use it in conjunction with the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to spent less on a shampoo - just like everyone else - but I stay with this product line because it continues to do the best job for MY hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I recommend it to people with frizzy, tangle prone hair. You don&#x27;t need much product either, so it last a long time and I love that it is sulfate free!</li>
            <li> Works well on white and silver hair. Makes it soft but full-bodied. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products but this one works better than ones purchased for much more money at a salon.</li>
