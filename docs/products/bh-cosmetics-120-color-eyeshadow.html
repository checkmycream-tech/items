            <li>It is really great palette, has  lot of metallic eyeshadows,  1st.</li>
            <li>Colors are great; however, none of that means anything if you cannot use them.  </li>
            <li>It came in really handy when my best friend asked me to do her makeup for her wedding.  </li>
            <li>Great pallet  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, I also have the Manly 120 Palette</li>
            <li>BH has a great line of products.</li>

            <li>The price is great.</li>
            <li>GREAT EYESHADOWS EXRTEMELY PIGMENTED</li>
            <li>They also have great staying power.</li>
            <li>Colors are great which is why I chose this edition.</li>
            <li>Great buy...</li>
            <li>The pigments of the darker colors/ hues are great for darkening and color placement , but I still feel the need for a softer consistency...</li>
            <li>For the price it was a great investment</li>
            <li>This palette is very nice.</li>
            <li>The color are brilliant, so many colors!</li>
            <li>The colors are real nice but one thing would be to make sure you Wes primer!,</li>
            <li>but these are amazing!</li>
            <li>This eyeshadow palette is an amazing deal for the price!</li>
            <li>( but still love how pigmented they are,, plus the price is great!!</li>
            <li>I loved it and was happy.</li>
            <li>and this is perfect. :)</li>
            <li>I love the color selection and it came in very good condition.</li>
            <li>When I opened it Christmas day, within the bright pallet colors, the orange one was busted.</li>
            <li>The colors are so greatly pigmented for the amazing price and there is a ton of variety of colors for a ton of looks that ANYONE can wear.</li>
            <li>it has bright tones and darker ones underneath.</li>
            <li>not one eyeshadow was cracked or anything the packaging was good</li>
            <li>the bottom tray had alot of shimmery golds topes and browns which were gorgeous</li>
            <li>But for the price, I think these are really good.</li>
            <li>and I prefer matte colors, but over all a good array of colors.</li>
            <li>so I gave her the good pallet and called them immediately.</li>
            <li>For the money and variety of colors, it is a good product.</li>
            <li>A primer is a must, a good one.</li>
            <li>it came in good condition</li>
            <li>There have a good pigmentation.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>The price was right and the colors are great!</li>

            <li>So I AM IN LOVE!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this palette!</li>
            <li>The shipping/packaging is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great quality for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Gives you a great variety of colors and goes on fantastic on skin .</li>
            <li>I used MAC before as well as others but BH Cosmetics  are amazing.</li>
            <li>these colors are amazing.  </li>
            <li>At most it stayed on good for an hour, after that it was downhill.</li>
            <li>I like the palettes I got, they are really nice colored</li>
            <li>This is a great beginners palette because it has all the bright fun colors and sultry smokey muted colors one would ever need.  </li>
            <li>However I ordered the 4th edition palette through Amazon straight from BH Cosmetics and it arrived in perfect condition!</li>
            <li>Again the price kind of makes up for that.</li>
            <li>This palette was a perfect choice for her.&lt;br /&gt;It has amazing color choices and the quality was decent...</li>
            <li>this is a gift for a high schooler, perfect colors, nice packagins.</li>
            <li>Get it, it&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li>Colors are gorgeous and true to the picture quality !</li>
            <li>i also love the fact that it was at a good price :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good range of colors, and can be used either day or night since it contains both bright colorful and neutral tone color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good deal!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for any makeup effect you want; whether it&#x27;s natural, day time or night time looks.</li>
            <li>There are colors in this palette that are suitable for all skin tones and the brighter ones are for springy/summery looks and the darker shades will work well in the fall/winter months..</li>
            <li>The price was great, the shadow combination was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a nice mix of shimmers and mattes with the colors ranging from warm to cool.</li>
            <li>this is just perfect the colors are amazing and they are pretty much every color on the rainbow</li>
            <li>i loved all of them and the colors in the picture look exactly like the colors in person!    </li>
            <li>but it needs to be better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and the price as well.</li>
            <li>Yet i still hope they would have handle the package better.</li>
            <li>I think E.l.f. eyeshadows are better than these.</li>
            <li>The item arrived in a timely manner and seemed to be appropriately packaged, however some of the colors were cracked.  </li>
            <li>I love this color palette.  </li>
            <li>i put the darker colored palette on top which makes it easier to lift off the top palet..</li>
            <li>The colors are mostly shimmer</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t believe the hype that this is a MAC comparable or better.</li>
            <li>Go for it! :)</li>
            <li>They mailed out a replacement which came two days later and was perfect.</li>
            <li>but I love the colors in both trays.</li>
            <li>You can do so many looks with them.</li>
            <li>I love all the BH eyeshadow palettes, i have all the editions except the 2nd, all are very bright and pigmented!</li>
            <li>I have read &amp; watched many reviews on the BH Cosmetics 120 palettes.</li>
            <li>so I may be able to salvage it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t leave your eyes smelling like paint or that any one will be so close to sniff your seductive lids.</li>
            <li>The palettes are kind of cheap in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a beginner with makeup and this palette gives me so many options to play with and I love that.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many I can work with.</li>
            <li>Makeup is great but the delivery and care for package is lacking much.</li>
            <li>If anyone is looking for a winner for eye color, this palette is sure to do the job.  </li>
            <li>I have thoroughly enjoyed this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love BH cosmetics</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I use this palette the most out of the 1st three.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real joy that I&#x27;m able to use eye shadow without having a puffy, red and tearful eye.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>My friends and I love doing eachothers makeup</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I WILL BUY MORE.</li>
            <li>If I had to change anything, it would be to package the box better and to put &amp;#</li>
            <li>I gave it a four star rating more for the dealer that I ordered from (BlueScandal).</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed dressing up with these eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors that come.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the colors.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PALETTE</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE COLORS</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>LOVE THE COLORS</li>
            <li>and i am surely going to invest my money in this company</li>
            <li>I love the product itself, I love BH Cosmetics</li>
            <li>Great colors and decent quality...especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I had it shipped to Brazil, and it was still a pretty good price to pay.</li>
            <li>The colors of the shadows themselves are actually pretty good.  </li>
            <li>palette has some very bright colors and the second one has more subdued metallics.</li>
            <li>It has all the colors you will need ranging from bold, neutral and warm colors.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and my product arrived in perfect condition which I was very happy about after seen some of the reviews that received their palettes broken up.</li>
            <li>sure she will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Used some yesterday that way and had an awesome pop of pink shimmer on my eyes that was</li>
            <li>A lot of color might look pigmented but without the primer, it would fade away easily.</li>
            <li>I love this item, this was a great price for it and a lot cheaper than the actual website had it</li>
            <li>A great palette that can be used for many different looks.</li>
            <li>Stay on all day and don&#x27;t smear easily.</li>
            <li>This was one of my first bh cosmetics items and its amazing.</li>
            <li>I RECIEVED THE PACKAGE PERFECTLY FINE</li>
            <li>The first one I ordered, the 120, 2nd edition, was wonderful!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been fine ever since.</li>
            <li>The bottom palette (With the more cool tones) has some great potential for smokey eye looks that I can&#x27;t wait to try!</li>
            <li>Eventually i picked this one because i liked that there were greyish and brownish tones more than vivid colors</li>
            <li>But all in all everything else was great and it all i expected it to be and more.</li>
            <li>Shipping speed was fantastic, condition the product came in was not.</li>
            <li>The colors have great pigment to them and do especially well with an eyeshadow primer.  </li>
            <li>The price of the product is quite cheap considering its quality.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation (without primer) is so so, and relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>The packaging is extremely nice &amp; very well put together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely happy with my purchase &amp; can&#x27;t wait to start playing with different looks.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li>This is a great kit for starting off and learning to apply eye shadow.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow glides in smoothly.</li>
            <li>but still important to point</li>
            <li>the arent cheap at all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually rather impressed with the quality, given that I paid as much for 120 colors as I would have paid for 1 color from MAC.</li>
            <li>The color payoff is amazing, these shadows are highly pigmented, you get a large variety of colors to choose from and its just amazing.</li>
            <li>this is great for beginners because it has so much variety, you have nudes, smokey colors, and vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>For the price it really is a great product the top tray has alot of beautiful colors that are very edgey and vibrant i usually dont wear colors like that</li>
            <li>It definitely has come in handy, it has every color you could need!</li>
            <li>Got my palette today, was initially really excited for it</li>
            <li>I was really excited to be getting this product and even with prime</li>
            <li>When I opened it yesterday, I was amazed: the colors in the 3rd edition palette are more sophisticated and exotic.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you use a god quality primer first.</li>
            <li>This is a great product but you have to work with it a little more.</li>
            <li>I recieved My 3rd edition palette and it was packaged very nicely and the colors as I stated before on my last review are very pigmented and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I decided that I liked the less sparkly palette, but one with many neutrals as well as many brights.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was good :)</li>
            <li>SO SO pigmented i was suprised for such a bright color    </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of more.</li>
            <li>Love the pallet otherwise, just wish I could use the whole thing instead of just parts of it.</li>
            <li>So investing in a good primer will have to be next on my list.</li>
            <li>Overall good kit for the price.</li>
            <li>but then I said I&#x27;d give it a shot since it&#x27;s really cheap and worth a try.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>The colors are very blend able..</li>
            <li>I just love this palette so much and BH Cosmetics in general and I can&#x27;t wait to try out more of their cosmetics!</li>
            <li>I was excited and bought the third edition palett (best one so far) I was looking to receive it fast in which I did</li>
            <li>Love all the colors, there are neutral colors as well as vibrant.</li>
            <li>You have your colorful colors and warm natural colors all in one.</li>
            <li>Received the package intact with quick turnaround delivery.</li>
            <li>This pallet has very nice colors, I have used it and compered with other brads</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to experiment or looking for a nice selection for every day AND special occasions this pallet is versatile enough for both.</li>
            <li>So many beautiful colors and none of them were broken.</li>
            <li>Not expensive!</li>
            <li>Now I want to order the first 2!</li>
            <li>By itself I see that some of the colors look great and will last all day, but then some of the lighter colors are not as vivid.</li>
            <li>Shipping was awesome and the make up did have one broken color</li>
            <li>and I have lots of fun with these.</li>
            <li>I was able to return it with no problem and I have purchased it again from BHCosmetics directly.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty true to how they appear in their palette.</li>
            <li>Alot of fun to play around with...</li>
            <li>so it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Two of my eyeshadows was cracked but I just pressed them down with a dime on top of some aluminum foil and they were good as new.</li>
            <li>If you dampen your make-up brush slightly and smear it on the shadow to make a paste the color comes out vibrant and absolutely gorgeous!</li>
            <li>The colors are good not like some other brands I&#x27;ve used that were almost transparent</li>
            <li>The colors go one smooth and pretty much all day.  </li>
            <li>For someone with good skin that can handle any new product on it, this did irritate my eyes a bit when I brushed some shadow on the bottom lid.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make a huge mess &amp; stayed well intact in it&#x27;s own circle</li>
            <li>Many of the shimmers and colors compare with the Bare Minerals pots I used to buy, except now</li>
            <li>The colors are true, and they blend very well.</li>
            <li>i recommend this product very much.</li>
            <li>On some of the not as pigmented shadows, I just spray a little Mac Fix+ spray on a brush, dip it in the pan, and it is good to go.</li>
            <li>are very pigmented, although I would definitely use a good eyeshadow primer to make the colors appear brighter and more vivid and of course to help the shadows last longer.</li>
            <li>I never use eye shadow but I love having this big guy as an option.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors in this palette and the colors last me all day.</li>
            <li>My eyeshadow came cracked which left me not being able to use some colors</li>
            <li>pigments are pretty and the shadow stays well</li>
            <li>I ordered the first edition 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s hope the second time works out for me. :)</li>
            <li>Haha but for the price the quality exceeds it!</li>
            <li>and it came exactly when they said it would.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first</li>
            <li>This was my first bh cosmetics purchase.</li>
            <li>colors themselves were exactly as described, and</li>
            <li>At first, I fussed over which color palette to get and, even though I wanted them all, I eventually settled with just one.</li>
            <li>I love it especially the color variety.</li>
            <li>I will spend a bit more to get quality eyeshadow next time and give these away.</li>
            <li>:) Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li>but for the price it&#x27;s pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li>But overall,  I LOVE this palette</li>
            <li>It has so many different colors you can play with</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is remarkable and the colors last for a long time.</li>
            <li>With such an array of colors, even if you are a neutral color wearer, you can put on a different look every day and your eyes will look gorgeous from sunrise to sunset.</li>
            <li>They are so beautiful and none of the eye-shadows were broken.</li>
            <li>plus they set really good and last a long time.</li>
            <li>When I put certain colors on the brush it seems like dust</li>
            <li>The packaging was nice and tight.</li>
            <li>the palette came in a pretty decent shape.</li>
            <li>The color palate is amazing, but a little chalky for my taste.  </li>
            <li>Product itself seems pretty high quality</li>
            <li>WILL BE MAKIN A HUGE ORDER FOR CHRISTMAS FOR THE YOUNGER LADIES IN MY FAMILY.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loooove this product.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to buying a make up palette.</li>
            <li>in all, i think that for this price (i paid 16$), the product is better than expected</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product with all the hype on beauty blogs and youtube and all that</li>
            <li>I really like this palette.  </li>
            <li>Mine arrived unbroken and was packed very well.  </li>
            <li>I also really enjoy the metallic tones in the 3rd edition.</li>
            <li>The darker shades however, are very well pigmented.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind too much, because it would have still been usable.</li>
            <li>I am a beginner and would really recommend this palette.</li>
            <li>So i got really upset about that, but</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and affordable.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and all but one color was unbroken.</li>
            <li>It was packaged really well.</li>
            <li>because this one didnt really come with any yellows just golds</li>
            <li>There is so much pigmentation in these colors.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it and it arrived without damage.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this.</li>
            <li>as for the product, it&#x27;s worth the money but don&#x27;t be surprised if some of the colors are shattered.</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>The one thing I discovered with the eyeshadow itself is that it is better used slightly wet.</li>
            <li>IT HAS SO MUCH VARIETY.</li>
            <li>One word to describe this palette for me is, WOW!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a notch better than The Color Institute that you find in JC Penny or other department stores like it.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love the product and it can in about 10days</li>
            <li>use too often but are great for combining) and the colors won´t fade even after the most crazy party!  </li>
            <li>I only use the palette on special occasions</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a bit afraid of the shipping part because a lot of people complaint about crashed eyeshadows and so on, but mine came beautifully bubble-wrapped and i was thrilled that each and every eyeshasow was intact!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more visible with dark colors.</li>
            <li>I chose this one since it has a nice mix of light and dark, but they also have a few other palettes that have more vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>These shadows are vibrant from the moment you put them on and stay put all day until you take them off.  </li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant and stay all day.</li>
            <li>They are decent sized too.</li>
            <li>I bought this thing years ago and for the price it was a decent set of colors.</li>
            <li>It seems like a very sturdy plastic casing that is extremely easy to open with an inch wide slim button right in front.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product and will buy from this company again</li>
            <li>I mean I got 118 more colors! ;</li>
            <li>The trouble was that there are too many and</li>
            <li>but it did have the colors she wanted and just to try something different it was exciting for her.</li>
            <li>Color are not as pigmented as i expected i really only ordered for the reds and went out and bought a red on etsy but its a good palette</li>
            <li>So excited to get these sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>Im new to using makeup</li>
            <li>Altough i like it very much, i gave it only 4 stars beacuse of the lighter colors.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery, i ordered it on tues and received it 2 days later.</li>
            <li>And was very surprised with the quality of it.</li>
            <li>it came a day early than it was supose to!</li>
            <li>and wow at the cheapest price iv seen yet!</li>
            <li>I chose the 3rd edition because I would use these colors more than the other editions.</li>
            <li>But the scent is a bit powering when you first open the case.</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t a fan, I obviously have no idea</li>
            <li>Definitely an upgrade in makeup for still an unreal yet reasonable price!</li>
            <li>The colors i need [the browns, greys, dark oranges, and even the vivid red/orange(that coral color)] are very pigmented and look very nice(also the shimmering ones!!).</li>
            <li>After doing some searching, I found that Ebay does carry this and many other palettes like this through other company brands and for much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>It has a large mirror in the lid, where you can not only see what your doing if you were to use it</li>
            <li>These Colors are hard to find and im glad I ordered them.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more just to see if the others are dull as well.</li>
            <li>I only gave this product three stars because I feel the pigment is kind of dull even with a primer.  </li>
            <li>I have green eyes, so it was nice to be able to pick from the spectrum and mix/match colors to see what looked nice and what looked horrible.</li>
            <li>some of the colors broke upon delivery which ruined a few important pigments.</li>
            <li>I chose this palette because it had wild, yet neutral colors.</li>
            <li>; on the outside of the package, so the mail person doesn&#x27;t kick it around too much.</li>
            <li>As the old adage says \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The downside: Unfortunately, when I received the package and opened it up, three of the eyeshadows were smashed, including the far right side bottom color of the top tray, which is the brightest red -- one of the colors I really wanted.</li>
            <li>but there was also colorful dust everywhere (box, packaging, the case, and other colors).</li>
            <li>SERIOUSLY I&#x27;VE HIT PAN ON MOST OF THESE COLORS.</li>
            <li>Each little eye shadow pot in the two large trays were smaller than expected, however not so much smaller than many multi color palettes found in the Walmarts, drugstores, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So now I am ordering a new one, but I thought it was necessary to inform others that this product came to me damaged.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s big enough you can see your whole face in it.</li>
            <li>However, some colors like those light ones are not very pigmented and does not really show up altough i use a primer every time(so, for example, i have to use another product for the white color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a 30 year old female who has just started wearing makeup</li>
            <li>next time i will order from BH cosmetics directly.</li>
            <li>It got delivered to the wrong apt</li>
            <li>I had many broken shadows and my mirror was cracked.</li>
            <li>i expected a lot from this product but when i recieved it, i did not like that the box wasnt marked FRAGILE, the eyeshadows where not broken, but smaller then they appear on the picture!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a plastic sheet in there to protect everything, so the other color didn&#x27;t really mix with the others.     </li>
            <li>The colors don&#x27;t stick as well as I expected, very powdery and not very bold and vibrant.</li>
            <li>:) The only downside was when I received it two of the colora were broken</li>
            <li>The thing that bothered me the most was that the actual box the colors are held in was broken.</li>
            <li>You just put on a little and it looks pretty.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think this is normal because I&#x27;ve used other types of shadows from MAC and Maybelline that do not do that.</li>

            <li> It is really great palette, has  lot of metallic eyeshadows,  1st.</li>
            <li> Colors are great; however, none of that means anything if you cannot use them.  </li>

            <li> Colors are great which is why I chose this edition.</li>
            <li> Great buy...</li>
            <li> The pigments of the darker colors/ hues are great for darkening and color placement , but I still feel the need for a softer consistency...</li>
            <li> For the price it was a great investment</li>
            <li> This palette is very nice.</li>
            <li> The color are brilliant, so many colors!</li>

            <li> I loved it and was happy.</li>
            <li> and this is perfect. :)</li>
            <li> I love the color selection and it came in very good condition.</li>
            <li> When I opened it Christmas day, within the bright pallet colors, the orange one was busted.</li>
            <li> The colors are so greatly pigmented for the amazing price and there is a ton of variety of colors for a ton of looks that ANYONE can wear.</li>
            <li> it has bright tones and darker ones underneath.</li>
            <li> not one eyeshadow was cracked or anything the packaging was good</li>
            <li> the bottom tray had alot of shimmery golds topes and browns which were gorgeous</li>
            <li> But for the price, I think these are really good.</li>
            <li> and I prefer matte colors, but over all a good array of colors.</li>
            <li> so I gave her the good pallet and called them immediately.</li>
            <li> For the money and variety of colors, it is a good product.</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this palette!</li>
            <li> The shipping/packaging is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great quality for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Gives you a great variety of colors and goes on fantastic on skin .</li>
            <li> I used MAC before as well as others but BH Cosmetics  are amazing.</li>
            <li> these colors are amazing.  </li>
            <li> At most it stayed on good for an hour, after that it was downhill.</li>
            <li> I like the palettes I got, they are really nice colored</li>
            <li> This is a great beginners palette because it has all the bright fun colors and sultry smokey muted colors one would ever need.  </li>
            <li> However I ordered the 4th edition palette through Amazon straight from BH Cosmetics and it arrived in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> Again the price kind of makes up for that.</li>
            <li> This palette was a perfect choice for her.&lt;br /&gt;It has amazing color choices and the quality was decent...</li>
            <li> this is a gift for a high schooler, perfect colors, nice packagins.</li>
            <li> Get it, it&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Colors are gorgeous and true to the picture quality !</li>
            <li> i also love the fact that it was at a good price :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good range of colors, and can be used either day or night since it contains both bright colorful and neutral tone color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good deal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for any makeup effect you want; whether it&#x27;s natural, day time or night time looks.</li>
            <li> There are colors in this palette that are suitable for all skin tones and the brighter ones are for springy/summery looks and the darker shades will work well in the fall/winter months..</li>
            <li> The price was great, the shadow combination was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a nice mix of shimmers and mattes with the colors ranging from warm to cool.</li>
            <li> this is just perfect the colors are amazing and they are pretty much every color on the rainbow</li>
            <li> i loved all of them and the colors in the picture look exactly like the colors in person!    </li>
            <li> but it needs to be better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and the price as well.</li>
            <li> Yet i still hope they would have handle the package better.</li>
            <li> I think E.l.f. eyeshadows are better than these.</li>
            <li> The item arrived in a timely manner and seemed to be appropriately packaged, however some of the colors were cracked.  </li>
            <li> I love this color palette.  </li>
            <li> i put the darker colored palette on top which makes it easier to lift off the top palet..</li>
            <li> The colors are mostly shimmer</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t believe the hype that this is a MAC comparable or better.</li>
            <li> Go for it! :)</li>
            <li> They mailed out a replacement which came two days later and was perfect.</li>
            <li> but I love the colors in both trays.</li>
            <li> You can do so many looks with them.</li>
            <li> I love all the BH eyeshadow palettes, i have all the editions except the 2nd, all are very bright and pigmented!</li>
            <li> I have read &amp; watched many reviews on the BH Cosmetics 120 palettes.</li>
            <li> so I may be able to salvage it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t leave your eyes smelling like paint or that any one will be so close to sniff your seductive lids.</li>
            <li> The palettes are kind of cheap in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a beginner with makeup and this palette gives me so many options to play with and I love that.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many I can work with.</li>
            <li> Makeup is great but the delivery and care for package is lacking much.</li>
            <li> If anyone is looking for a winner for eye color, this palette is sure to do the job.  </li>
            <li> I have thoroughly enjoyed this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love BH cosmetics</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I use this palette the most out of the 1st three.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real joy that I&#x27;m able to use eye shadow without having a puffy, red and tearful eye.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> My friends and I love doing eachothers makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I WILL BUY MORE.</li>
            <li> If I had to change anything, it would be to package the box better and to put &amp;#</li>
            <li> I gave it a four star rating more for the dealer that I ordered from (BlueScandal).</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed dressing up with these eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors that come.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the colors.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PALETTE</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE COLORS</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> LOVE THE COLORS</li>
            <li> and i am surely going to invest my money in this company</li>
            <li> I love the product itself, I love BH Cosmetics</li>
            <li> Great colors and decent quality...especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I had it shipped to Brazil, and it was still a pretty good price to pay.</li>
            <li> The colors of the shadows themselves are actually pretty good.  </li>
            <li> palette has some very bright colors and the second one has more subdued metallics.</li>
            <li> It has all the colors you will need ranging from bold, neutral and warm colors.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and my product arrived in perfect condition which I was very happy about after seen some of the reviews that received their palettes broken up.</li>
            <li> sure she will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Used some yesterday that way and had an awesome pop of pink shimmer on my eyes that was</li>
            <li> A lot of color might look pigmented but without the primer, it would fade away easily.</li>
            <li> I love this item, this was a great price for it and a lot cheaper than the actual website had it</li>
            <li> A great palette that can be used for many different looks.</li>
            <li> Stay on all day and don&#x27;t smear easily.</li>
            <li> This was one of my first bh cosmetics items and its amazing.</li>
            <li> I RECIEVED THE PACKAGE PERFECTLY FINE</li>
            <li> The first one I ordered, the 120, 2nd edition, was wonderful!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been fine ever since.</li>
            <li> The bottom palette (With the more cool tones) has some great potential for smokey eye looks that I can&#x27;t wait to try!</li>
            <li> Eventually i picked this one because i liked that there were greyish and brownish tones more than vivid colors</li>
            <li> But all in all everything else was great and it all i expected it to be and more.</li>
            <li> Shipping speed was fantastic, condition the product came in was not.</li>
            <li> The colors have great pigment to them and do especially well with an eyeshadow primer.  </li>
            <li> The price of the product is quite cheap considering its quality.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation (without primer) is so so, and relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> The packaging is extremely nice &amp; very well put together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely happy with my purchase &amp; can&#x27;t wait to start playing with different looks.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit for starting off and learning to apply eye shadow.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow glides in smoothly.</li>
            <li> but still important to point</li>
            <li> the arent cheap at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually rather impressed with the quality, given that I paid as much for 120 colors as I would have paid for 1 color from MAC.</li>
            <li> The color payoff is amazing, these shadows are highly pigmented, you get a large variety of colors to choose from and its just amazing.</li>
            <li> this is great for beginners because it has so much variety, you have nudes, smokey colors, and vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> For the price it really is a great product the top tray has alot of beautiful colors that are very edgey and vibrant i usually dont wear colors like that</li>
            <li> It definitely has come in handy, it has every color you could need!</li>
            <li> Got my palette today, was initially really excited for it</li>
            <li> I was really excited to be getting this product and even with prime</li>
            <li> When I opened it yesterday, I was amazed: the colors in the 3rd edition palette are more sophisticated and exotic.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you use a god quality primer first.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but you have to work with it a little more.</li>
            <li> I recieved My 3rd edition palette and it was packaged very nicely and the colors as I stated before on my last review are very pigmented and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I decided that I liked the less sparkly palette, but one with many neutrals as well as many brights.</li>
            <li> Other than that it was good :)</li>
            <li> SO SO pigmented i was suprised for such a bright color    </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of more.</li>
            <li> Love the pallet otherwise, just wish I could use the whole thing instead of just parts of it.</li>
            <li> So investing in a good primer will have to be next on my list.</li>
            <li> Overall good kit for the price.</li>
            <li> but then I said I&#x27;d give it a shot since it&#x27;s really cheap and worth a try.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> The colors are very blend able..</li>
            <li> I just love this palette so much and BH Cosmetics in general and I can&#x27;t wait to try out more of their cosmetics!</li>
            <li> I was excited and bought the third edition palett (best one so far) I was looking to receive it fast in which I did</li>
            <li> Love all the colors, there are neutral colors as well as vibrant.</li>
            <li> You have your colorful colors and warm natural colors all in one.</li>
            <li> Received the package intact with quick turnaround delivery.</li>
            <li> This pallet has very nice colors, I have used it and compered with other brads</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to experiment or looking for a nice selection for every day AND special occasions this pallet is versatile enough for both.</li>
            <li> So many beautiful colors and none of them were broken.</li>
            <li> Not expensive!</li>
            <li> Now I want to order the first 2!</li>
            <li> By itself I see that some of the colors look great and will last all day, but then some of the lighter colors are not as vivid.</li>
            <li> Shipping was awesome and the make up did have one broken color</li>
            <li> and I have lots of fun with these.</li>
            <li> I was able to return it with no problem and I have purchased it again from BHCosmetics directly.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty true to how they appear in their palette.</li>
            <li> Alot of fun to play around with...</li>
            <li> so it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Two of my eyeshadows was cracked but I just pressed them down with a dime on top of some aluminum foil and they were good as new.</li>
            <li> If you dampen your make-up brush slightly and smear it on the shadow to make a paste the color comes out vibrant and absolutely gorgeous!</li>
            <li> The colors are good not like some other brands I&#x27;ve used that were almost transparent</li>
            <li> The colors go one smooth and pretty much all day.  </li>
            <li> For someone with good skin that can handle any new product on it, this did irritate my eyes a bit when I brushed some shadow on the bottom lid.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make a huge mess &amp; stayed well intact in it&#x27;s own circle</li>
            <li> Many of the shimmers and colors compare with the Bare Minerals pots I used to buy, except now</li>
            <li> The colors are true, and they blend very well.</li>
            <li> i recommend this product very much.</li>
            <li> On some of the not as pigmented shadows, I just spray a little Mac Fix+ spray on a brush, dip it in the pan, and it is good to go.</li>
            <li> are very pigmented, although I would definitely use a good eyeshadow primer to make the colors appear brighter and more vivid and of course to help the shadows last longer.</li>
            <li> I never use eye shadow but I love having this big guy as an option.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors in this palette and the colors last me all day.</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow came cracked which left me not being able to use some colors</li>
            <li> pigments are pretty and the shadow stays well</li>
            <li> I ordered the first edition 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s hope the second time works out for me. :)</li>
            <li> Haha but for the price the quality exceeds it!</li>
            <li> and it came exactly when they said it would.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first</li>
            <li> This was my first bh cosmetics purchase.</li>
            <li> colors themselves were exactly as described, and</li>
            <li> At first, I fussed over which color palette to get and, even though I wanted them all, I eventually settled with just one.</li>
            <li> I love it especially the color variety.</li>
            <li> I will spend a bit more to get quality eyeshadow next time and give these away.</li>
            <li> :) Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> but for the price it&#x27;s pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li> But overall,  I LOVE this palette</li>
            <li> It has so many different colors you can play with</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is remarkable and the colors last for a long time.</li>
            <li> With such an array of colors, even if you are a neutral color wearer, you can put on a different look every day and your eyes will look gorgeous from sunrise to sunset.</li>
            <li> They are so beautiful and none of the eye-shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> plus they set really good and last a long time.</li>
            <li> When I put certain colors on the brush it seems like dust</li>
            <li> The packaging was nice and tight.</li>
            <li> the palette came in a pretty decent shape.</li>
            <li> The color palate is amazing, but a little chalky for my taste.  </li>
            <li> Product itself seems pretty high quality</li>
            <li> WILL BE MAKIN A HUGE ORDER FOR CHRISTMAS FOR THE YOUNGER LADIES IN MY FAMILY.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loooove this product.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to buying a make up palette.</li>
            <li> in all, i think that for this price (i paid 16$), the product is better than expected</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product with all the hype on beauty blogs and youtube and all that</li>
            <li> I really like this palette.  </li>
            <li> Mine arrived unbroken and was packed very well.  </li>
            <li> I also really enjoy the metallic tones in the 3rd edition.</li>
            <li> The darker shades however, are very well pigmented.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind too much, because it would have still been usable.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner and would really recommend this palette.</li>
            <li> So i got really upset about that, but</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and affordable.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and all but one color was unbroken.</li>
            <li> It was packaged really well.</li>
            <li> because this one didnt really come with any yellows just golds</li>
            <li> There is so much pigmentation in these colors.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it and it arrived without damage.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this.</li>
            <li> as for the product, it&#x27;s worth the money but don&#x27;t be surprised if some of the colors are shattered.</li>
            <li> I really like this set.</li>
            <li> The one thing I discovered with the eyeshadow itself is that it is better used slightly wet.</li>
            <li> IT HAS SO MUCH VARIETY.</li>
            <li> One word to describe this palette for me is, WOW!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a notch better than The Color Institute that you find in JC Penny or other department stores like it.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love the product and it can in about 10days</li>
            <li> use too often but are great for combining) and the colors won´t fade even after the most crazy party!  </li>
            <li> I only use the palette on special occasions</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit afraid of the shipping part because a lot of people complaint about crashed eyeshadows and so on, but mine came beautifully bubble-wrapped and i was thrilled that each and every eyeshasow was intact!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more visible with dark colors.</li>
            <li> I chose this one since it has a nice mix of light and dark, but they also have a few other palettes that have more vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> These shadows are vibrant from the moment you put them on and stay put all day until you take them off.  </li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant and stay all day.</li>
            <li> They are decent sized too.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing years ago and for the price it was a decent set of colors.</li>
            <li> It seems like a very sturdy plastic casing that is extremely easy to open with an inch wide slim button right in front.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product and will buy from this company again</li>
            <li> I mean I got 118 more colors! ;</li>
            <li> The trouble was that there are too many and</li>
            <li> but it did have the colors she wanted and just to try something different it was exciting for her.</li>
            <li> Color are not as pigmented as i expected i really only ordered for the reds and went out and bought a red on etsy but its a good palette</li>
            <li> So excited to get these sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Im new to using makeup</li>
            <li> Altough i like it very much, i gave it only 4 stars beacuse of the lighter colors.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, i ordered it on tues and received it 2 days later.</li>
            <li> And was very surprised with the quality of it.</li>
            <li> it came a day early than it was supose to!</li>
            <li> and wow at the cheapest price iv seen yet!</li>
            <li> I chose the 3rd edition because I would use these colors more than the other editions.</li>
            <li> But the scent is a bit powering when you first open the case.</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t a fan, I obviously have no idea</li>
            <li> Definitely an upgrade in makeup for still an unreal yet reasonable price!</li>
            <li> The colors i need [the browns, greys, dark oranges, and even the vivid red/orange(that coral color)] are very pigmented and look very nice(also the shimmering ones!!).</li>
            <li> After doing some searching, I found that Ebay does carry this and many other palettes like this through other company brands and for much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> It has a large mirror in the lid, where you can not only see what your doing if you were to use it</li>
            <li> These Colors are hard to find and im glad I ordered them.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more just to see if the others are dull as well.</li>
            <li> I only gave this product three stars because I feel the pigment is kind of dull even with a primer.  </li>
            <li> I have green eyes, so it was nice to be able to pick from the spectrum and mix/match colors to see what looked nice and what looked horrible.</li>
            <li> some of the colors broke upon delivery which ruined a few important pigments.</li>
            <li> I chose this palette because it had wild, yet neutral colors.</li>
            <li> ; on the outside of the package, so the mail person doesn&#x27;t kick it around too much.</li>
            <li> As the old adage says \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The downside: Unfortunately, when I received the package and opened it up, three of the eyeshadows were smashed, including the far right side bottom color of the top tray, which is the brightest red -- one of the colors I really wanted.</li>
            <li> but there was also colorful dust everywhere (box, packaging, the case, and other colors).</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY I&#x27;VE HIT PAN ON MOST OF THESE COLORS.</li>
            <li> Each little eye shadow pot in the two large trays were smaller than expected, however not so much smaller than many multi color palettes found in the Walmarts, drugstores, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So now I am ordering a new one, but I thought it was necessary to inform others that this product came to me damaged.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s big enough you can see your whole face in it.</li>
            <li> However, some colors like those light ones are not very pigmented and does not really show up altough i use a primer every time(so, for example, i have to use another product for the white color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old female who has just started wearing makeup</li>
            <li> next time i will order from BH cosmetics directly.</li>
            <li> It got delivered to the wrong apt</li>
            <li> I had many broken shadows and my mirror was cracked.</li>
            <li> i expected a lot from this product but when i recieved it, i did not like that the box wasnt marked FRAGILE, the eyeshadows where not broken, but smaller then they appear on the picture!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a plastic sheet in there to protect everything, so the other color didn&#x27;t really mix with the others.     </li>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t stick as well as I expected, very powdery and not very bold and vibrant.</li>
            <li> :) The only downside was when I received it two of the colora were broken</li>
            <li> The thing that bothered me the most was that the actual box the colors are held in was broken.</li>
            <li> You just put on a little and it looks pretty.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think this is normal because I&#x27;ve used other types of shadows from MAC and Maybelline that do not do that.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes that that makes it a real struggle for me to find eye shadows that work and don&#x27;t cause my eyes a serious allergic reaction every time I use them.</li>
            <li> It has a good selection of shimmer and matt colors, however I&#x27;m disappointed that some colors are just not very pigmented, but some other colors are very pigmented...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical in purchasing this eye shadow pallet because i usually buy Mac products , But to my amazement , this product is actually good .</li>
            <li> However, when I opened it up &amp; removed the top tray the matte black was broken.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s going to last me a really long time.</li>
            <li> the colors last all day long!</li>
            <li> When opening the package of makeup there were several colors that had become loose.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal since it was still in place and not mixed with the other colors.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical with this palette only because I have watched so many youtube tutorials and heard positives and negatives.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a good primer or base to wear underneath the eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty bold without a base, pr an initial cover up or foundation.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I have to complain about is that there were a few  shadows that were broken and it took me a long time to clean it all uo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right that you would pay money for a broken item.</li>
            <li> Mine seemed to have been dropped on the right side, since that&#x27;s where the broken eyeshadow was located.</li>
            <li> and I would probabaly purchase BH&#x27;s other color palate as well in the future.</li>
            <li> I have purchased single eyeshadows for the price of this palette</li>
            <li> It has every single color I need (even the ones I don´t</li>
            <li> The only thing down side that I would comment on is the staying power and the pigmentation.</li>
            <li> it was an unknown company.   </li>
            <li> there are a wide range of colors but they&#x27;re not very pigmented</li>
            <li> This package came way sooner than expected</li>
            <li> which is what I expected.</li>
            <li> I did not really use anyways</li>
            <li> Other than that you do get a lot of colors for the money</li>
            <li> Not like other eyeshadows that u have to keep putting some on to show the color you want.  </li>
            <li> and i might get some of the other editions for the yellows...</li>
            <li> Can not wait to get the other pallets.</li>
            <li> I got both in 1 package and only 1 shadow in the entire package was broken</li>
            <li> But do be careful because with some of the colors there is some slight fallout.</li>
            <li> Apparently I am not the only one receiving a semi broken product.</li>
            <li> The only thing I have not liked is that the shadows seem to be hard to actually apply on.</li>
            <li> At any rate, I give this an average rating speaking in terms of quality, color pay-off and price.  </li>
            <li> You really cannot go wrong with this palette.  </li>
            <li> So I am sure with a base layer the color impact would be explosive.</li>
            <li> Multiple eye shadow colors had broken and got all over the pallets,leaving some of the colors unusable since there was nothing left to use, also mixing with other colors in the pallets which makes them very hard to use now since they&#x27;re mixed (brown and orange?</li>
            <li> and we had to track it down.   </li>
            <li> It got here it no damage, extremely well-packed and in little time.</li>
            <li> it came in a few days later than usual (not a huge deal).  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I wanted to experiment with different colors without having to pay a small fortune (I usually buy MAC products).</li>
            <li> the pigmentation is decent but the staying power even after applying the colors on the of a primer and base did not last long at all.</li>
            <li> I looked at this one in the past but never really wanted it until my friend saw it and wanted one</li>
            <li> but takes a little effort to get the color off the their little plots.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m definately gonna buy one of the other palets!!</li>
            <li> I do not where makeup everyday</li>
            <li> Only issue was that one of my colors was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> but when I opened it one of the shadows was broken and smeared all over inside and outside the plastic box.</li>
            <li> Used this palette to do make up for weddings and everyday looks.</li>
            <li> One of the colors was broken into loose powder, but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> Palette arrived with a number of the colors broken or crushed.</li>
            <li> and also they are extremely small, almost like samples.</li>
            <li> disappointed, I was really looking forward to the kit.</li>
            <li> it has, just wish they weren&#x27;t so dull.  </li>
            <li> A negative of this product would be the shipping.</li>
            <li> It arrived with 2 broken eyeshadows and I was pretty disappointed because of that.</li>
            <li> A few arrived broken</li>
            <li> One thing when I got them in the mailma few color were broken.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow is very delicate, and this palette is no exception.</li>
            <li> but when I opened the kit, the were minor cracks on 3 colors :(   </li>
            <li> None of the colors were broken.</li>
            <li> Order 2 palette one came with a eyeshadow broken:</li>
            <li> The case arrived broken at the hinges, defeating the purpose of calling this a \\&quot;palette\\&quot; that can be held as one stationery unit.  </li>
            <li> A color was broken when i opened otherwise</li>
            <li> In addition, one side was broken.</li>
            <li> It arrived broken, but BH sent me another one.</li>
            <li> None of my colors were broken.</li>
            <li> However, I just received the package today and one of the color circles was broken.</li>
            <li> So if you do not mind one being broken buy.</li>
            <li> colors broken.</li>
            <li> I would have gave a 5 star but one of the shadows was broken.</li>
            <li> Two of mine came broken</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brand of cosmetic and was disappointed that she was unable to use it because they were broken and the powders mixed.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m a little disappointed in that (reason for the lost star)</li>
            <li> but unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t the case with me.</li>
            <li> but it did come broken :(</li>
            <li> but the product itself is bad.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette as a gift and was slightly disappointed about that.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed on how some didn&#x27;t show up too well.</li>
            <li> I am, however, disappointed in the highlight colors.</li>
            <li> Delivery was bad!</li>
            <li> Get it, you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s terrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely loooove this product. The colors are so pigmented and you get such a variety! :) The only downside was when I received it two of the colora were broken but it was really no big deal I mean I got 118 more colors! ;p</li>
            <li> I never use eye shadow but I love having this big guy as an option. It definitely has come in handy, it has every color you could need!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to buying a make up palette. The trouble was that there are too many and i didn&#x60;t know which one to pick! Eventually i picked this one because i liked that there were greyish and brownish tones more than vivid colors and it is at a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this palette does its work. The colors i need [the browns, greys, dark oranges, and even the vivid red/orange(that coral color)] are very pigmented and look very nice(also the shimmering ones!!). The blues are beautiful also. However, some colors like those light ones are not very pigmented and does not really show up altough i use a primer every time(so, for example, i have to use another product for the white color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit afraid of the shipping part because a lot of people complaint about crashed eyeshadows and so on, but mine came beautifully bubble-wrapped and i was thrilled that each and every eyeshasow was intact! It&#x60;s awesome that no damage occured. The package is great, and there is a mirror attached to the inside of the palette which is very nice! (i didn&#x60;t know that it will come with one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, i think that for this price (i paid 16$), the product is better than expected and if you are looking for darker colors, then this is the palette you need. Altough i like it very much, i gave it only 4 stars beacuse of the lighter colors.</li>
            <li> Im new to using makeup so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of more. The price was right and the colors are great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was all broke up...handle with care.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the company or the driver but it needs to be better.</li>
            <li> So excited to get these sooner than expected. Shipping speed was fantastic, condition the product came in was not. Multiple eye shadow colors had broken and got all over the pallets,leaving some of the colors unusable since there was nothing left to use, also mixing with other colors in the pallets which makes them very hard to use now since they&#x27;re mixed (brown and orange? no thank you). Love the pallet otherwise, just wish I could use the whole thing instead of just parts of it.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors in this palette and the colors last me all day. I am a 30 year old female who has just started wearing makeup and I can honestly say for the money that I am very impressed... I absolutely love it and the price as well. Shipping was awesome and the make up did have one broken color but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal since it was still in place and not mixed with the other colors.</li>
            <li> just recieved mine in the mail 5 minutes ago!!!! i ordered 4: one for me and 3 for my sisters. not one eyeshadow was cracked or anything the packaging was good it came a day early than it was supose to! everything was perfect!!!    For the price it really is a great product the top tray has alot of beautiful colors that are very edgey and vibrant i usually dont wear colors like that but i tested one out and it was SO SO SO pigmented i was suprised for such a bright color    the bottom tray had alot of shimmery golds topes and browns which were gorgeous i loved all of them and the colors in the picture look exactly like the colors in person!    Over all... awesome product for the price on amazon!</li>
            <li> Got my palette today, was initially really excited for it but when I opened the kit, the were minor cracks on 3 colors :(   It has a good selection of shimmer and matt colors, however I&#x27;m disappointed that some colors are just not very pigmented, but some other colors are very pigmented...since there are 120 colors it&#x27;s  hit and miss! Very fast delivery, i ordered it on tues and received it 2 days later. Yet i still hope they would have handle the package better.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product with all the hype on beauty blogs and youtube and all that but unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t the case with me. The shipping/packaging is amazing. I give them props for that but the product itself is bad. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s terrible just bc the pigmentation is decent but the staying power even after applying the colors on the of a primer and base did not last long at all. At most it stayed on good for an hour, after that it was downhill. I think E.l.f. eyeshadows are better than these. Never buying this again.</li>
            <li> The best palette  between all 5!</li>
            <li> Love it! Great quality for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> The item arrived in a timely manner and seemed to be appropriately packaged, however some of the colors were cracked.  I bought this palette as a gift and was slightly disappointed about that.</li>
            <li> I like the palettes I got, they are really nice colored and I have lots of fun with these. The shadows themselves do blend well and stay put all night. The only thing I have not liked is that the shadows seem to be hard to actually apply on. When I put certain colors on the brush it seems like dust and when I put it on the eye this dust goes everywhere. Don&#x27;t think this is normal because I&#x27;ve used other types of shadows from MAC and Maybelline that do not do that. Other than that you do get a lot of colors for the money and I would recommend this if you like to play with make up!</li>
            <li> It is really great palette, has  lot of metallic eyeshadows,  1st. palette has some very bright colors and the second one has more subdued metallics.</li>
            <li> I love it! It is just what i was looking for! Not expensive! None of the colors were broken. Package was very secure! the colors last all day long! Cant get much better for this price!</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow came cracked which left me not being able to use some colors but there was also colorful dust everywhere (box, packaging, the case, and other colors). I was able to return it with no problem and I have purchased it again from BHCosmetics directly. The palette is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Order 2 palette one came with a eyeshadow broken:( but still love how pigmented they are,, plus the price is great!!</li>
            <li> Colors are great; however, none of that means anything if you cannot use them.  The case arrived broken at the hinges, defeating the purpose of calling this a \\&quot;palette\\&quot; that can be held as one stationery unit.  Also, several of the eyeshadow pots were cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed, I was really looking forward to the kit.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette.  Mine arrived unbroken and was packed very well.  The colors have great pigment to them and do especially well with an eyeshadow primer.  Now I want to order the first 2!</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty true to how they appear in their palette. I just find that sometimes some of the eyeshadow falls onto my cheeks throughout the day . It&#x27;s more visible with dark colors. The eyeshadows also have a distinguishable smell to them. But for the price, I think these are really good.</li>
            <li> I love this color palette.  It came in really handy when my best friend asked me to do her makeup for her wedding.  It&#x27;s perfect for any makeup effect you want; whether it&#x27;s natural, day time or night time looks.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeshadow palate I&#x27;ve ever purchased!!  I was amazed with all the color choices, and I&#x27;ve had the best time experimenting.  I would definiately purchase this again!!!  Great Product!!</li>
            <li> These colors are beautiful!!! the shadow lasts all day!! (using a primer) the case is not flimsy at all, very cute and not too bulky.. i put the darker colored palette on top which makes it easier to lift off the top palet.. i&#x27;m definately gonna buy one of the other palets!! totally buy if you&#x27;re thinking of buying!</li>
            <li> The price of the product is quite cheap considering its quality. I had it shipped to Brazil, and it was still a pretty good price to pay. It got here it no damage, extremely well-packed and in little time. The pigmentation is remarkable and the colors last for a long time. Would recommend not only to every-day use but also to professionals.</li>
            <li> Great pallet  but takes a little effort to get the color off the their little plots. The colors are mostly shimmer and I prefer matte colors, but over all a good array of colors.</li>
            <li> I was excited and bought the third edition palett (best one so far) I was looking to receive it fast in which I did and wow at the cheapest price iv seen yet! Alot of fun to play around with... pigments are pretty and the shadow stays well</li>
            <li> One word to describe this palette for me is, WOW!!! I love the color selection and it came in very good condition. This is a great beginners palette because it has all the bright fun colors and sultry smokey muted colors one would ever need.  I am a filipino woman with tan skin and the colors are very pigmented, although I would definitely use a good eyeshadow primer to make the colors appear brighter and more vivid and of course to help the shadows last longer. Get it, it&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li> i expected a lot from this product but when i recieved it, i did not like that the box wasnt marked FRAGILE, the eyeshadows where not broken, but smaller then they appear on the picture! next time i will order from BH cosmetics directly.</li>
            <li> After doing some searching, I found that Ebay does carry this and many other palettes like this through other company brands and for much cheaper.  I saw some YouTube reviews and some girls paid about $20 for this.      At any rate, I give this an average rating speaking in terms of quality, color pay-off and price.  For someone with good skin that can handle any new product on it, this did irritate my eyes a bit when I brushed some shadow on the bottom lid.  My eyes teared a lot but it didn&#x27;t hurt.  Please don&#x27;t believe the hype that this is a MAC comparable or better. This is a great product but you have to work with it a little more. It&#x27;s just a notch better than The Color Institute that you find in JC Penny or other department stores like it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I also have the Manly 120 Palette so I wanted to see if there was any difference. I also really enjoy the metallic tones in the 3rd edition. [...]</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister who is into make-up. BH has a great line of products. This palette was a perfect choice for her.&lt;br /&gt;It has amazing color choices and the quality was decent...the colors stay on/show (although you may want to buy a primer to get the best results).&lt;br /&gt;Overall: great eyeshadow (great brand, quality, &amp; colors)!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical with this palette only because I have watched so many youtube tutorials and heard positives and negatives. The color payoff is amazing, these shadows are highly pigmented, you get a large variety of colors to choose from and its just amazing. You wont regret this purchase at all. There are colors in this palette that are suitable for all skin tones and the brighter ones are for springy/summery looks and the darker shades will work well in the fall/winter months.. Go for it! :)</li>
            <li> I was simply unimpressed by this product. The pigmentation (without primer) is so so, and relatively cheap. I am allll for inexpensive products, but this one isnt it.</li>
            <li> I RECIEVED THE PACKAGE PERFECTLY FINE AND THE COLORS ARE GREAT.NOW I WILL ORDER ANOTHER IN SHIMMERS.I WILL BE MAKIN A HUGE ORDER FOR CHRISTMAS FOR THE YOUNGER LADIES IN MY FAMILY.</li>
            <li> Delivery was bad! It got delivered to the wrong apt and we had to track it down.   It wasn&#x27;t like UPS or FEDX it was an unknown company.   Product is awesome! Colors are lovely! You just put on a little and it looks pretty. Not like other eyeshadows that u have to keep putting some on to show the color you want.  These Colors are hard to find and im glad I ordered them. Love it!</li>
            <li> A color was broken when i opened otherwise the palette came in a pretty decent shape.</li>
            <li> I ordered the first edition 2 years ago. I loved it and was happy. I looked at this one in the past but never really wanted it until my friend saw it and wanted one so I figured, might as well get two since I was ordering hers. I got both in 1 package and only 1 shadow in the entire package was broken so I gave her the good pallet and called them immediately. They mailed out a replacement which came two days later and was perfect. I love this company!</li>
            <li> I only use the palette on special occasions but I love the colors in both trays.You can do so many looks with them.But do be careful because with some of the colors there is some slight fallout.</li>
            <li> I love all the BH eyeshadow palettes, i have all the editions except the 2nd, all are very bright and pigmented!</li>
            <li> This pallet has very nice colors, I have used it and compered with other brads and it last for hours.</li>
            <li> I have read &amp; watched many reviews on the BH Cosmetics 120 palettes. I chose the 3rd edition because I would use these colors more than the other editions. The packaging is extremely nice &amp; very well put together. However, when I opened it up &amp; removed the top tray the matte black was broken. It didn&#x27;t make a huge mess &amp; stayed well intact in it&#x27;s own circle so I may be able to salvage it. I absolutely love the case! It seems like a very sturdy plastic casing that is extremely easy to open with an inch wide slim button right in front. It has a large mirror in the lid, where you can not only see what your doing if you were to use it but it&#x27;s big enough you can see your whole face in it. This palette has every color range in mattes, satin &amp; shimmers. I didn&#x27;t swatch all of them but I picked a variety of colors from the lights to the darks. I was a bit disappointed on how some didn&#x27;t show up too well. So investing in a good primer will have to be next on my list. The darker shades however, are very well pigmented. The scent the product gives off smells like paint, which isn&#x27;t a big deal. I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t leave your eyes smelling like paint or that any one will be so close to sniff your seductive lids. But the scent is a bit powering when you first open the case. I&#x27;m definitely happy with my purchase &amp; can&#x27;t wait to start playing with different looks.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to be getting this product and even with prime it came in a few days later than usual (not a huge deal).  The colors of the shadows themselves are actually pretty good.  The only thing that I have to complain about is that there were a few  shadows that were broken and it took me a long time to clean it all uo.</li>
            <li> tried it out today and the colors were so pigmented, not to mention BEAUTIFUL! love Bh cosmetics! buy this if youre thinking about it!</li>
            <li> The palettes are kind of cheap in my opinion. The colors don&#x27;t stick as well as I expected, very powdery and not very bold and vibrant. I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this eyeshadow palette. It is a very good buy, however selling should ship ups. I had many broken shadows and my mirror was cracked.</li>
            <li> This was my 2nd eyeshadow palette purchase from BH.  The first one I ordered, the 120, 2nd edition, was wonderful!  I thought I had the end-all in eyeshadow palettes with every color I&#x27;d ever want or need.  The colors in that one were oh-so-beautiful! Then, my 3rd edition arrived.  When I opened it yesterday, I was amazed: the colors in the 3rd edition palette are more sophisticated and exotic.  Many of the shimmers and colors compare with the Bare Minerals pots I used to buy, except now I get more, in one sleek 9\\&quot; compact, and for a fraction of the cost! The only thing I wish they would add is a mirror but, I understand they would have to redesign the compact. These shadows are vibrant from the moment you put them on and stay put all day until you take them off.  With such an array of colors, even if you are a neutral color wearer, you can put on a different look every day and your eyes will look gorgeous from sunrise to sunset.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the girlfriend, and she loves it! Has all the colors she needs.  Still has it as it has been sometime.  Gonna have to purchase her another on soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a beginner with makeup and this palette gives me so many options to play with and I love that.</li>
            <li> For the money and variety of colors, it is a good product. I am, however, disappointed in the highlight colors. There aren&#x27;t many I can work with.</li>
            <li> Well I got this pallet for Christmas, and it arrived and was wrapped for me immediately. When I opened it Christmas day, within the bright pallet colors, the orange one was busted. I didn&#x27;t mind too much, because it would have still been usable. But the color was all over the package inside and the case. The thing that bothered me the most was that the actual box the colors are held in was broken. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right that you would pay money for a broken item. The item was returned, and I received notice that there wasn&#x27;t a replacement, it would just be a refund. So now I am ordering a new one, but I thought it was necessary to inform others that this product came to me damaged. Let&#x27;s hope the second time works out for me. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I wanted to experiment with different colors without having to pay a small fortune (I usually buy MAC products). I&#x27;m actually rather impressed with the quality, given that I paid as much for 120 colors as I would have paid for 1 color from MAC. One of the colors was broken into loose powder, but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me. There&#x27;s a plastic sheet in there to protect everything, so the other color didn&#x27;t really mix with the others.     The colors themselves range from vibrant to bland, and there&#x27;s a lot to play with. I have green eyes, so it was nice to be able to pick from the spectrum and mix/match colors to see what looked nice and what looked horrible. I chose this one since it has a nice mix of light and dark, but they also have a few other palettes that have more vibrant colors. If you&#x27;re looking to experiment or looking for a nice selection for every day AND special occasions this pallet is versatile enough for both.</li>
            <li> some of the colors broke upon delivery which ruined a few important pigments. there are a wide range of colors but they&#x27;re not very pigmented</li>
            <li> This is a great kit for starting off and learning to apply eye shadow. A primer is a must, a good one. By itself I see that some of the colors look great and will last all day, but then some of the lighter colors are not as vivid. Overall I use it daily with a primer and have created all kinds of day and night looks with this pallet. The shipping was fast and my product arrived in perfect condition which I was very happy about after seen some of the reviews that received their palettes broken up.</li>
            <li> My daughter actually requested this item for Christmas after seeing it on TV.  I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the reviews and comments about the ordering process from the manufacturer&#x27;s website.  So I ordered thru Amazon.  Received the product promptly and my daughter is absolutely thrilled with the makeup!!  Product itself seems pretty high quality and she&#x27;s happy with the way the makeup applies and looks once on.  Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I receive my product today and I have to say I love the assorted colors and the pigment is very nice. I bought this palette because I realized I did not have any eyeshadow in my makeup collection..., which is zero to none. I am a beginner and would really recommend this palette. It has all the colors you will need ranging from bold, neutral and warm colors. I do not where makeup everyday but when I do I would like to match my eyeshadows with what I am wearing. A negative of this product would be the shipping. Two of my eyeshadows was cracked but I just pressed them down with a dime on top of some aluminum foil and they were good as new. In addition, one side was broken. Makeup is great but the delivery and care for package is lacking much. I am rating this product based on the contents inside the box not the packaging and it is great. I would recommend a good primer or base to wear underneath the eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> If anyone is looking for a winner for eye color, this palette is sure to do the job.  I have had this set for well into my 2nd year and have not found a color on either tray that i did not like.  The colors go one smooth and pretty much all day.  I have thoroughly enjoyed this purchase.</li>
            <li> When opening the package of makeup there were several colors that had become loose. I simply pressed them back into their spot and it&#x27;s been fine ever since. I will order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I got my order yesterday &amp; i ordered this edition &amp; the 5th edition, &amp; i got two of the same one. So i got really upset about that, but im giving it away now so whatever. But the colors are so beautiful &amp; i was expecting them too be like super bright but their not so im happy with that.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and affordable. I love BH cosmetics</li>
            <li> I have never been one for eyeshadow&#x27;s but these are amazing! The only compliant I have is that I need help on matching the colors! Haha but for the price the quality exceeds it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful array of colors! The eyeshadow glides in smoothly. A few arrived broken and I just threw them away. Overall good kit for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this Palette! Definately need to purchase the others. Colors are vibrant and stay all day. Only issue was that one of my colors was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical in purchasing this eye shadow pallet because i usually buy Mac products , But to my amazement , this product is actually good . Gives you a great variety of colors and goes on fantastic on skin . IF you use an eye primer, colors will stay on for a while</li>
            <li> this is great for beginners because it has so much variety, you have nudes, smokey colors, and vibrant colors. it came in good condition so im very pleased</li>
            <li> this is a gift for a high schooler, perfect colors, nice packagins. looks good.&lt;br /&gt;im sure she will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This palette has such an array of colors and it ranges from neutrals to pastels and brights. They last all day with no creasing if used with a primer.</li>
            <li> This palette its just wonderful i love it. Try it. I want to get all editions. There have a good pigmentation.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and all but one color was unbroken. I use this palette the most out of the 1st three.</li>
            <li> They are so beautiful and none of the eye-shadows were broken. The packaging was all bubble wrap and it came exactly when they said it would. So excited to have this!!!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes that that makes it a real struggle for me to find eye shadows that work and don&#x27;t cause my eyes a serious allergic reaction every time I use them. I used MAC before as well as others but BH Cosmetics  are amazing. I was hesitant at first but then I said I&#x27;d give it a shot since it&#x27;s really cheap and worth a try. I absolutely LOVED them. The colors are good not like some other brands I&#x27;ve used that were almost transparent and I had to apply a million coats just to get the proper effect on. No allergic reaction, at all! It&#x27;s a real joy that I&#x27;m able to use eye shadow without having a puffy, red and tearful eye. It&#x27;s a pretty good deal!</li>
            <li> This package came way sooner than expected and I am in LOVE!!! So many beautiful colors and none of them were broken. It was packaged really well. My sister is an esthetician and I bought this palette because she recommended this product. I have worn them to work for about a week now and my makeup lasted all day. The price is great. I have purchased single eyeshadows for the price of this palette so it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The price was great, the shadow combination was exactly what I was looking for. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> So I AM IN LOVE! I bought this in 2011 when I was just starting out in make up and experimenting with different looks and make up brands. At first, I wasn&#x27;t a fan, I obviously have no idea what I was neither thinking nor doing because now it is 2014, brought the baby out from hiding, and I LOVE IT! The colors are so greatly pigmented for the amazing price and there is a ton of variety of colors for a ton of looks that ANYONE can wear. On some of the not as pigmented shadows, I just spray a little Mac Fix+ spray on a brush, dip it in the pan, and it is good to go. If you don&#x27;t have the Fix+ spray, you can use eye drops or even water. I just love this palette so much and BH Cosmetics in general and I can&#x27;t wait to try out more of their cosmetics!</li>
            <li> There was no company name on the product, thus I have no Idea if it is BH or not. The packaging was nice and tight. All my shadows were impact, and the pigments are awesome, good buy.</li>
            <li> It arrived broken, but BH sent me another one. Some of the colors are pigmented, but all are chalky and the lighter ones dont show up at all</li>
            <li> Love all the colors, there are neutral colors as well as vibrant. i also love the fact that it was at a good price :)</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was actually overwlem with this but it did have the colors she wanted and just to try something different it was exciting for her.</li>
            <li> If theres a mirror in the picture its what i would like in my package... Color are not as pigmented as i expected i really only ordered for the reds and went out and bought a red on etsy but its a good palette and i might get some of the other editions for the yellows... because this one didnt really come with any yellows just golds</li>
            <li> I just get my 120 Color Eyeshadow Palette 3rd Edition and I love it, it&#x27;s everything I wanted, I was worried to see this palette all broked but it&#x27;s not wich is good the colors are very beautiful as it appears on the picture and in person they are better! I GIVE THIS 5 STARS BECAUSE THIS PRODUCT IT&#x27;S PERFECT.</li>
            <li> There is so much pigmentation in these colors. This was my first bh cosmetics purchase. I chose this palette because it had wild, yet neutral colors. None of my colors were broken. They are decent sized too. My friends and I love doing eachothers makeup and this is perfect. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good range of colors, and can be used either day or night since it contains both bright colorful and neutral tone color. This palette also has a variety of eyeshadow finish textures: shimmer, matte, glitters, and silk.  The only thing down side that I would comment on is the staying power and the pigmentation. A lot of color might look pigmented but without the primer, it would fade away easily.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and after reading reviews I decided on it.  She absolutely loves it and it arrived without damage.  Good value for what it sells for.</li>
            <li> Each little eye shadow pot in the two large trays were smaller than expected, however not so much smaller than many multi color palettes found in the Walmarts, drugstores, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors themselves were exactly as described, and the &amp;#34;smoky&amp;#34; tray is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product and will buy from this company again</li>
            <li> this is just perfect the colors are amazing and they are pretty much every color on the rainbow so you don´t need anything else..plus they set really good and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this item, this was a great price for it and a lot cheaper than the actual website had it</li>
            <li> I bought this thing years ago and for the price it was a decent set of colors. I recommend using a primer because this stuff fades otherwise. It&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> Palette arrived with a number of the colors broken or crushed. My daughter loves this brand of cosmetic and was disappointed that she was unable to use it because they were broken and the powders mixed.</li>
            <li> The color are brilliant, so many colors! The colors are pretty bold without a base, pr an initial cover up or foundation. So I am sure with a base layer the color impact would be explosive. I love it. Definitely an upgrade in makeup for still an unreal yet reasonable price! I love it so much. Very happy with my purchase, I plan on buying these for my sisters. Love it! It is just a palate with no brushes, just in case you thought you wouldn&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> GREAT EYESHADOWS EXRTEMELY PIGMENTED I WILL BUY MORE. DONT HESITATE TO BUY JUST BUY IT YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this palette! It has every single color I need (even the ones I don´t use too often but are great for combining) and the colors won´t fade even after the most crazy party!  I absolutely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Do not buy the product from Amazon. two of the colors are un-usable. as for the product, it&#x27;s worth the money but don&#x27;t be surprised if some of the colors are shattered.</li>
            <li> At first, I fussed over which color palette to get and, even though I wanted them all, I eventually settled with just one. I decided that I liked the less sparkly palette, but one with many neutrals as well as many brights. This palette has them all. I really like this set. The colors are true, and they blend very well. They also have great staying power. The downside: Unfortunately, when I received the package and opened it up, three of the eyeshadows were smashed, including the far right side bottom color of the top tray, which is the brightest red -- one of the colors I really wanted. Eyeshadow is very delicate, and this palette is no exception. If I had to change anything, it would be to package the box better and to put &amp;#34;EXTREMELY FRAGILE&amp;#34; on the outside of the package, so the mail person doesn&#x27;t kick it around too much. Mine seemed to have been dropped on the right side, since that&#x27;s where the broken eyeshadow was located.</li>
            <li> Colors are great which is why I chose this edition. However, I just received the package today and one of the color circles was broken. Apparently I am not the only one receiving a semi broken product. So if you do not mind one being broken buy.</li>
            <li> I love it especially the color variety.</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow arrived with&lt;br /&gt;3 colors broken. The color won&#x27;t stay on. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. As the old adage says \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;. I will spend a bit more to get quality eyeshadow next time and give these away.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow palette is an amazing deal for the price! There&#x27;s a nice mix of shimmers and mattes with the colors ranging from warm to cool. The bottom palette (With the more cool tones) has some great potential for smokey eye looks that I can&#x27;t wait to try! The one thing I discovered with the eyeshadow itself is that it is better used slightly wet. If you dampen your make-up brush slightly and smear it on the shadow to make a paste the color comes out vibrant and absolutely gorgeous! Used some yesterday that way and had an awesome pop of pink shimmer on my eyes that was oh so bright! I gave it a four star rating more for the dealer that I ordered from (BlueScandal). The product came seemingly well packed but when I opened it one of the shadows was broken and smeared all over inside and outside the plastic box. It wasn&#x27;t a color that I was worried about so didn&#x27;t bother to contact them. However I ordered the 4th edition palette through Amazon straight from BH Cosmetics and it arrived in perfect condition! :) Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> This palette is very nice. I have really enjoyed dressing up with these eyeshadows. I always get compliments on my makeup when working with this palette. Get it, you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> A great palette that can be used for many different looks. Used this palette to do make up for weddings and everyday looks. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I would have gave a 5 star but one of the shadows was broken. Other than that I love the product and it can in about 10days which is what I expected. My next I order thru amazon I opt for ups shipping instead of thru the postal service.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors that come. You have your colorful colors and warm natural colors all in one. The color are very good but primar might be needed. One thing when I got them in the mailma few color were broken. They were colors I did not really use anyways but still important to point thatt out</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister and she loves it to the max. The colors are real nice but one thing would be to make sure you Wes primer!,</li>
            <li> Everything was in perfect condition. I absolutely love the colors. This was one of my first bh cosmetics items and its amazing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PALETTE IT HAS SO MUCH VARIETY. I LOVE THE COLORS THE NEUTRALS THE DARKER SHADES EVERYTHING. SERIOUSLY I&#x27;VE HIT PAN ON MOST OF THESE COLORS. ALSO, I SUGGEST GETTING IT FROM AMAZON THE SHIPPING IS A BIT CHEAPER THEN THE BH COSMETICS WEBSITE.</li>
            <li> i recommend this product very much. My wife loved it. And was very surprised with the quality of it. You should try it.</li>
            <li> Great colors and decent quality...especially for the price.  You really cannot go wrong with this palette.  Its my go to when I want to experiment with different looks.  I haven&#x27;t had any problem with fall-out or staying power.  Just make sure you use a god quality primer first.</li>
            <li> Great buy... The colors are very blend able.. I&#x27;m very pleased and I&#x27;m definitely a fan of this brand.</li>
            <li> I tried I couple of the pigments and I do like their staying power.  Not MAC but for the price it&#x27;s pretty darn close.  Two of mine came broken so I&#x27;m a little disappointed in that (reason for the lost star) and also they are extremely small, almost like samples. Again the price kind of makes up for that.</li>
            <li> I only gave this product three stars because I feel the pigment is kind of dull even with a primer.  I like the variety of color it has, just wish they weren&#x27;t so dull.  I will be buying more just to see if the others are dull as well.</li>
            <li> I recieved My 3rd edition palette and it was packaged very nicely and the colors as I stated before on my last review are very pigmented and beautiful. The only problem that I had with this palette was that one of the colors was cracked. But all in all everything else was great and it all i expected it to be and more.</li>
            <li> I ordered this palette because I was amazed by the variety of different colors. It came in just a couple of days. The only problem was the shipping. It arrived with 2 broken eyeshadows and I was pretty disappointed because of that. But overall,  I LOVE this palette and it&#x27;s going to last me a really long time. It has so many different colors you can play with and I love that&#x27;s it has bright tones and darker ones underneath.</li>
            <li> Received the package intact with quick turnaround delivery. The color palate is amazing, but a little chalky for my taste.  I can appreciate a smoother powder.  The pigments of the darker colors/ hues are great for darkening and color placement , but I still feel the need for a softer consistency...like revlon&#x27;s 24 color stay ...these colors are amazing.  For the price it was a great investment and I would probabaly purchase BH&#x27;s other color palate as well in the future.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE COLORS the arent cheap at all and i am surely going to invest my money in this company</li>
            <li> Colors are gorgeous and true to the picture quality ! Stay on all day and don&#x27;t smear easily. Can not wait to get the other pallets.</li>
            <li> I love the product itself, I love BH Cosmetics but it did come broken :( there was 2 shadows on top broken &amp; 4 on bottom! Other than that it was good :)</li>
