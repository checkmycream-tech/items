            <li>Good product for a good price</li>
            <li>Good product, I asked my dental assistant about it before I bought it</li>
            <li>no i would be fair to the people..</li>
            <li>Works well, good for the money.  </li>
            <li>I would say a good value.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great to get them more relaxed with dental tools and ease their fears of the dentist office.</li>
            <li>Very glad I bought these.</li>
            <li>Works great and keeps my aging teeth in top shape.</li>
            <li>am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Better remove that plaque before seeing the dental hygienist!</li>
            <li>The thinner and longer pick is pretty impressive.  </li>
            <li>The mirror however is great and does not fog, making it easy to view</li>
            <li>Great product...arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>These work great for light use but the metal does not go through the handle as it should.</li>
            <li>the point is well machined and well finished I am comfortable when I need to use this inside my mouth happy with purchase</li>
            <li>Handy tools that your dentist uses.</li>
            <li>I purchased these tools to use on my own teeth between dental checkups, but I&#x27;ve found I can also use them on my two kids, one of which hates going to the dentist</li>
            <li>EXTREMELY effective.</li>
            <li>I say, \\&quot;Dentists and hygienists probably don&#x27;t make the kind of tartar and plaque that</li>
            <li>This fits the bill nicely.</li>
            <li>the rubber on these is quite nice and even when in the mouth there is no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to scrape my own teeth</li>
            <li>Well, I wasnt about to try that kind of pressure.</li>
            <li>These might be effective but weren&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest:  </li>
            <li>This is a nice dental scaler &amp; pick set.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of advantageous to see parts of one&#x27;s mouth from the &#x27;other-side&#x27;, so to speak.</li>
            <li>but it does work nice to remove plaque and unsightly tartar.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.</li>
            <li>get a smooth clean feeling without the hassle of having a stranger&#x27;s hands in your mouth lol!</li>
            <li>The mirror works great and surprisingly does not fog very much at all.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product and the quick delivery</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been super happy with</li>
            <li>There are lots of dental professionals who strongly discourage people from scaling their own teeth at home.</li>
            <li>but you can always get something better.</li>
            <li>I use these instead of floss with much better results.</li>
            <li>Quite pleased with quality of Dental Pik.  </li>
            <li>The rubber grips allow for a nice comfort fit.</li>
            <li>This set has nice comfortable plastic handles as opposed to all metal handles.</li>
            <li>You should probably sterilize it once a month or more.</li>
            <li>... learned my lesson and will stick to more manageable things</li>
            <li>Best of all, I don&#x27;t need an appointment with the dentist whenever spot removal is necessary.</li>
            <li>Excellent dental tools to help in the cleaning of areas in the mouth beyond the regular visits to the dentist office.</li>
            <li>Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck.</li>
            <li>even better than the dentists.</li>
            <li>Those are better than the non-lighted ones.</li>
            <li>I love being able to scrape away the plaque between my lower incissors between bi-annual cleanings.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>This product is ok</li>
            <li>and my teeth look and feel better.  </li>
            <li>using mirror with either pik or scraper is a bit challenging.</li>
            <li>much better than manicure scissors and toothpicks.</li>
            <li>Product is good, but right after I bought it</li>
            <li>I love these for that clean feeling between my teeth!</li>
            <li>I couldnt relly see with the mirror, but they work pretty fair.</li>
            <li>You can easily do between your front teeth, but doing rear teeth with the mirror would qualify as a Houdini magic trick in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I was able to remove it easily with the scaler.</li>
            <li>As i got more comfortable and confident using it, scrape scrape scrape..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about those $60+ scalers, maybe they do clean better, but I can&#x27;t see them cleaning $55+ better.</li>
            <li>..this is THE BEST $8 i have ever spent on my health.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;One suggestion to the manufacturer, more detailed step by step instruction.</li>
            <li>Good quality at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>, I just knew that I needed a way to more efficiently clean my teeth at home.  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold and grip.  </li>
            <li>Handle of pick has a softness to it that makes it easy not to drop.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>easily get water, saliva,</li>
            <li>Good price, useful and fun to use and save money.</li>
            <li>The grips on the picks are easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>The grip handle makes it easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Good quality dental care product kit, I like the rubberized grip, and the price is right, good basic way to supplement a dental self-care routine at home.</li>
            <li>I changed the angle of the dental pick just a bit, but otherwise they work just fine.</li>
            <li>The handles are comfortable and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>These work fine for picking stuff out of your teeth.</li>
            <li>These are just fine.</li>
            <li>Bulky handles, light feeling metal tips.  </li>
            <li>But the quality is so cheap.</li>
            <li>The handles are comfortable and the construction feels sturdy.</li>
            <li>Comfortable grips.</li>
            <li>I tried to buy one that had a light in the mirror, but could not find one, so I bought this.</li>
            <li>The grips fit my hand and make using the scraper easier.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really remember why I felt like I needed this, but if you do want to own a set for home, this is an affordable option.  </li>
            <li>I use a 10 x magnifying mirror that is sold cheaply on Amazon.</li>
            <li>But overall everything worked great.</li>
            <li>Who knew how easily it would come off with the right too?!</li>
            <li>Dental pics are not easy to find, so Amazon was a perfect shopping location.</li>
            <li>THANKS!!!</li>
            <li>For the first time in over thirty years my dentist didn&#x27;t yell at me about tartar buildup!!</li>
            <li>Very useful...</li>
            <li>This kit is great and helps keep my teeth white and clean without resorting to bleach.</li>
            <li>and i am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>However, for me, this pick itself is worth the price!</li>
            <li>It has worked!I am now 56 and have zero periodontal disease despite significant receding</li>
            <li>Tool construction and presentation very good quality and the price is very affordable and will revert in savings, is use properly.</li>
            <li>but it keeps your teeth mighty clean, especially when you pair it with some good flossing.</li>
            <li>use it to clean my 2 dogs teeth</li>
            <li>Good quality, and I really like the cushioned handles as it makes it much easier to use efficiently.  </li>
            <li>While not used for human dental uses I find these make great additions to my reptile first aid kit.</li>
            <li>I love it , I do not use the mirror that much</li>
            <li>Works good, but the mirror broke on the third use.</li>
            <li>The picks are good quality, and come with some instructions to use them properly.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and useful.</li>
            <li>The only thing good about the set is the pick, when food  is caught between your teeth, the pick will get it out.</li>
            <li>these (not as good quality) do the job well enough at a fraction of the cost, and with comfy rubber handles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works fine, the mirror is really anti fog and the piks work fine.</li>
            <li>I dont ever use the mirror, but the other two tools are really great.</li>
            <li>Other than that the scaler works great.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly and works as described.  </li>
            <li>My dental visits for cleaning have improved tremendously.</li>
            <li>Ok, five stars is a little over the top for what it is, but they&#x27;re VERY comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li>As expected, very nice.... worth the money and well packed.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really help because it fogs up easily</li>
            <li>and they feel very hefty and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Exact what I was expecting!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really use the mirror, but it seems fine.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to help keep the teeth clean between dental appointments.</li>
            <li>Take a little to get the hang of it, but once you figured out, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>The dog didn&#x27;t really mind -- she has never bitten me or anyone else, so I felt quite certain that I&#x27;ll have as many fingers after I was done as I did before that --</li>
            <li>It seems like a cheap and very bendy metal was used, unlike the tools my dentist would use.</li>
            <li>The picture looks really ghetto and cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>While the pick has been of occasional use, the scaler in this kit has been absolutely amazing in helping to remove those stains during the months between dental visits.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that kind of throws me off is the mirror.</li>
            <li>So useful and well designed.</li>
            <li>Easily worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have actually removed my own plaque</li>
            <li>Like this set much better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>The materials are solid and sturdy and the handles feel nice in your hand while manipulating in a mouth.</li>
            <li>thats right</li>
            <li>Using this scaler once a week or so really helps to keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I would not let my kids attempt to clean their own teeth with these tools because they are sharp!</li>
            <li>Picks are very sharp, which I suppose is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t had much use for the mirror, I&#x27;m a big fan of the rest of it (and the price was most definitely right!).</li>
            <li>Nice tools, but the pick seems to be a little flimsy as it is easy to bend without much pressure.</li>
            <li>Very much needed to maintain dental health.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I should really be scraping my teeth myself, but I had some really stuck on plaque, and these worked great to knock that shiz off toot sweet.</li>
            <li>The item is exactly is described, but I dislike the quality of the mirror.</li>
            <li>The pick and scaler is exactly like what the dentist uses.</li>
            <li>I have used Plaque rinses and am a frequent user of mouthwash for helping to reduce plaque, but I have to say that having a tool to actually mechanically scrape plaque away is very satisfying.</li>
            <li>There are better out there for similar prices.</li>
            <li>Probably took five minutes instead of ten, and it seems to get more of the glass out?</li>
            <li>Rubber grips to me seem like a better choice when actually using the tools as intended rather then slippery metal.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li>Product arrived exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I love this set and only wish I&#x27;d gotten one sooner!</li>
            <li>Exactly what i needed</li>
            <li>This item is exactly as it was described on website.  </li>
            <li>The first set I purchased was flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Only light pressure is needed, let the tool do all the work!</li>
            <li>I used more, the one that you hold against your entire tooth and scrap up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product as long as you are gentle</li>
            <li>Good little set of tools!</li>
            <li>not sure whether or not to recommend it because after all it is a good price.</li>
            <li>An unfortunate byproduct of this love affair is that the hard-to-reach areas between my bottom-front teeth tend to get stained more quickly than most people&#x27;s--even with regular flossing.  </li>
            <li>Got my braces and use it after brushing and flossing to remove any extra residue that wasn&#x27;t easily removed.</li>
            <li>Just be careful, follow instructions, and you&#x27;re fine!</li>
            <li>Nice little set.  </li>
            <li>This product is very well made, it works as how I imagine it would.</li>
            <li>It works very well at removing it and my teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>absolutely nothing has been removed from my teeth.</li>
            <li>They scrape off plaque very well and are affordable.</li>
            <li>Under ten dollars and free Amazon Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>Great for someone, like me, who builds up calculus behind ther front bottom teeth from saliva glands there.  </li>
            <li>I needed something just a bit stronger than a plastic pick for fast building tartar between dental visits.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and the item was what I wanted</li>
            <li>I really just needed the Anti Fog mirror.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>The instruments were useful and professional.</li>
            <li>i thought when i had ordered it that it would be much sturdier.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>The picks are metal and work very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li>Wroks very well and is durable.</li>
            <li>but I just didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have a dentist look at my teeth when I&#x27;m ready.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and on with no confusions.</li>
            <li>Items function as expected and are certainly a good enough quality for home use.  </li>
            <li>This will serve the purpose, but the scaler flexes more than it should so it can be hard to clean your teeth with it.  </li>
            <li>The other implements are much more durable than the mirror.</li>
            <li>The other pick, I used with more caution.</li>
            <li>am former OR RN so am familiar with instruments.</li>
            <li>with my $8 pick i would clean them up and only ask they repay me in floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>recently got braces and need a kit to clean my teeth out with</li>
            <li>I can easily use this to scrape loose the tartar.</li>
            <li>Be gentle and careful though, because it can be easy to pierce your gums.</li>
            <li>i will definitely be upgrading to the full on metal ones when i can.</li>
            <li>The package does look pretty old.</li>
            <li>The pick is great for getting hard to reach food out from between your teeth, especially molars.</li>
            <li>I purchased these mainly for the pick.</li>
            <li>Which just seems very unsanitary for any more than a few uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are of high quality and do the job they were intended to do.</li>
            <li>I hv braces, and this helps to clean minor plaque.</li>
            <li>I always be careful with my teeth, this is the tools that I need for clean my mouth very well.</li>
            <li>You have to press harder than is comfortable, but it does get the job done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Metal tools are of cheap metal, but, that&#x27;s what was expected, so no complaints there.</li>
            <li>maybe not professional grade or anything for major use, but for a set to have on hand, its fine.</li>
            <li>and I may end up ordering a new set.</li>
            <li>I wiped it with a soft cloth &amp; it got all scratched up!</li>
            <li>This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought because I lost the first one.</li>
            <li>Recently got some staining on my front teeth for the first time.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to replace one that I already had (exact same thing).</li>
            <li>find the thicker pick to be more suited for the job rather than the small pick.</li>
            <li>I suggest going to the drugstore to be positive what you are purchasing, next time around.</li>
            <li>i would definitely recommend this product to anybody that wants and enjoys quality on a daily basis works very well !</li>
            <li>When I go for regular cleanings the hygienists always remark on how healthy my gums are and how little they need to do.</li>
            <li>Damage control is done with this although I hv to buy another electric toothbrush for prevention action.</li>
            <li>You know the tartar buildup between your front bottom teeth that, no matter how much you floss, still appears before your next dental cleaning?</li>
            <li>to my amazement it started to peel off in much the same way when you scrape at a potatoe.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t remember the old brand name</li>
            <li>My teeth felt sensitive to this pick, so I decided not to use it after that.</li>
            <li>But using the pick and scaler along with my intermittent flossing has helped considerably.  </li>
            <li>I had another set (different brand) which rusted to hell, but these are very well made.</li>
            <li>The handles are plastic, and although they&#x27;re thick and feel fairly sturdy, they&#x27;re obviously not going to feel the same as a completely metallic pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but the pick, scaler, and mirror are top notch.</li>
            <li>A simple disc that attaches via suction to my facial mirror.&lt;br /&gt;An investment in 10 minutes a day of scaling has resulted in $$$ savings on periodontal care and more importantly a healthy mouth without that bad breath that older people tend to get.</li>
            <li>&quot; My dentist didn&#x27;t really mind that I scale my teeth at home, as long as I don&#x27;t go too nuts.</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars only because the mirror seems a little cheap.</li>
            <li>The smaller one doesn&#x27;t really add anything that the larger one can&#x27;t do, so I never end up using that one.</li>
            <li>I was able to clean excessive plaque behind the lower front teeth and remove plaque at the gum line.</li>
            <li>Works generally as described.</li>
            <li>The mirror gives a clear image although it is likely not made of glass.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;dont listen to the detractors who fearmongers with &#x27;only a trained professional can care for your teeth&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Not a single fleck of substance came away after all the scraping I did.</li>
            <li>Of course it&#x27;s only a supplement to regular professional dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used dental picks before though, it takes a little bit of time to get used to how to use it so that you don&#x27;t scratch and bleed your gums (and you will the first time)</li>
            <li>First and foremost, you should visit a dentist at least every 6 months for professional cleaning.</li>

            <li> Good mirror (doesn&#x27;t fog) and workable piks will pry plaque off of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just what you expect, they have a nice grip and a great finish, also they&#x27;re built to last.&lt;br /&gt;The thinner pick is flexible (</li>
            <li> Good product for a good price</li>
            <li> Good product, I asked my dental assistant about it before I bought it</li>
            <li> no i would be fair to the people..</li>
            <li> Works well, good for the money.  </li>
            <li> I would say a good value.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great to get them more relaxed with dental tools and ease their fears of the dentist office.</li>
            <li> Very glad I bought these.</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps my aging teeth in top shape.</li>
            <li> am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Better remove that plaque before seeing the dental hygienist!</li>
            <li> The thinner and longer pick is pretty impressive.  </li>
            <li> The mirror however is great and does not fog, making it easy to view</li>
            <li> Great product...arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> These work great for light use but the metal does not go through the handle as it should.</li>
            <li> the point is well machined and well finished I am comfortable when I need to use this inside my mouth happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Handy tools that your dentist uses.</li>
            <li> I purchased these tools to use on my own teeth between dental checkups, but I&#x27;ve found I can also use them on my two kids, one of which hates going to the dentist</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY effective.</li>
            <li> I say, \\&quot;Dentists and hygienists probably don&#x27;t make the kind of tartar and plaque that</li>
            <li> This fits the bill nicely.</li>
            <li> the rubber on these is quite nice and even when in the mouth there is no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to scrape my own teeth</li>
            <li> Well, I wasnt about to try that kind of pressure.</li>
            <li> These might be effective but weren&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest:  </li>
            <li> This is a nice dental scaler &amp; pick set.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of advantageous to see parts of one&#x27;s mouth from the &#x27;other-side&#x27;, so to speak.</li>
            <li> but it does work nice to remove plaque and unsightly tartar.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.</li>
            <li> get a smooth clean feeling without the hassle of having a stranger&#x27;s hands in your mouth lol!</li>
            <li> The mirror works great and surprisingly does not fog very much at all.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product and the quick delivery</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been super happy with</li>
            <li> There are lots of dental professionals who strongly discourage people from scaling their own teeth at home.</li>
            <li> but you can always get something better.</li>
            <li> I use these instead of floss with much better results.</li>
            <li> Quite pleased with quality of Dental Pik.  </li>
            <li> The rubber grips allow for a nice comfort fit.</li>
            <li> This set has nice comfortable plastic handles as opposed to all metal handles.</li>
            <li> You should probably sterilize it once a month or more.</li>
            <li> ... learned my lesson and will stick to more manageable things</li>
            <li> Best of all, I don&#x27;t need an appointment with the dentist whenever spot removal is necessary.</li>
            <li> Excellent dental tools to help in the cleaning of areas in the mouth beyond the regular visits to the dentist office.</li>
            <li> Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck.</li>
            <li> even better than the dentists.</li>
            <li> Those are better than the non-lighted ones.</li>
            <li> I love being able to scrape away the plaque between my lower incissors between bi-annual cleanings.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> This product is ok</li>
            <li> and my teeth look and feel better.  </li>
            <li> using mirror with either pik or scraper is a bit challenging.</li>
            <li> much better than manicure scissors and toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Product is good, but right after I bought it</li>
            <li> I love these for that clean feeling between my teeth!</li>
            <li> I couldnt relly see with the mirror, but they work pretty fair.</li>
            <li> You can easily do between your front teeth, but doing rear teeth with the mirror would qualify as a Houdini magic trick in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was able to remove it easily with the scaler.</li>
            <li> As i got more comfortable and confident using it, scrape scrape scrape..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about those $60+ scalers, maybe they do clean better, but I can&#x27;t see them cleaning $55+ better.</li>
            <li> ..this is THE BEST $8 i have ever spent on my health.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;One suggestion to the manufacturer, more detailed step by step instruction.</li>
            <li> Good quality at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> , I just knew that I needed a way to more efficiently clean my teeth at home.  </li>
            <li> Easy to hold and grip.  </li>
            <li> Handle of pick has a softness to it that makes it easy not to drop.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> easily get water, saliva,</li>
            <li> Good price, useful and fun to use and save money.</li>
            <li> The grips on the picks are easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> The grip handle makes it easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Good quality dental care product kit, I like the rubberized grip, and the price is right, good basic way to supplement a dental self-care routine at home.</li>
            <li> I changed the angle of the dental pick just a bit, but otherwise they work just fine.</li>
            <li> The handles are comfortable and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> These work fine for picking stuff out of your teeth.</li>
            <li> These are just fine.</li>
            <li> Bulky handles, light feeling metal tips.  </li>
            <li> But the quality is so cheap.</li>
            <li> The handles are comfortable and the construction feels sturdy.</li>
            <li> Comfortable grips.</li>
            <li> I tried to buy one that had a light in the mirror, but could not find one, so I bought this.</li>
            <li> The grips fit my hand and make using the scraper easier.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really remember why I felt like I needed this, but if you do want to own a set for home, this is an affordable option.  </li>
            <li> I use a 10 x magnifying mirror that is sold cheaply on Amazon.</li>
            <li> But overall everything worked great.</li>
            <li> Who knew how easily it would come off with the right too?!</li>
            <li> Dental pics are not easy to find, so Amazon was a perfect shopping location.</li>
            <li> THANKS!!!</li>
            <li> For the first time in over thirty years my dentist didn&#x27;t yell at me about tartar buildup!!</li>
            <li> Very useful...</li>
            <li> This kit is great and helps keep my teeth white and clean without resorting to bleach.</li>
            <li> and i am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> However, for me, this pick itself is worth the price!</li>
            <li> It has worked!I am now 56 and have zero periodontal disease despite significant receding</li>
            <li> Tool construction and presentation very good quality and the price is very affordable and will revert in savings, is use properly.</li>
            <li> but it keeps your teeth mighty clean, especially when you pair it with some good flossing.</li>
            <li> use it to clean my 2 dogs teeth</li>
            <li> Good quality, and I really like the cushioned handles as it makes it much easier to use efficiently.  </li>
            <li> While not used for human dental uses I find these make great additions to my reptile first aid kit.</li>
            <li> I love it , I do not use the mirror that much</li>
            <li> Works good, but the mirror broke on the third use.</li>
            <li> The picks are good quality, and come with some instructions to use them properly.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and useful.</li>
            <li> The only thing good about the set is the pick, when food  is caught between your teeth, the pick will get it out.</li>
            <li> these (not as good quality) do the job well enough at a fraction of the cost, and with comfy rubber handles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works fine, the mirror is really anti fog and the piks work fine.</li>
            <li> I dont ever use the mirror, but the other two tools are really great.</li>
            <li> Other than that the scaler works great.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and works as described.  </li>
            <li> My dental visits for cleaning have improved tremendously.</li>
            <li> Ok, five stars is a little over the top for what it is, but they&#x27;re VERY comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li> As expected, very nice.... worth the money and well packed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really help because it fogs up easily</li>
            <li> and they feel very hefty and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Exact what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really use the mirror, but it seems fine.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to help keep the teeth clean between dental appointments.</li>
            <li> Take a little to get the hang of it, but once you figured out, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The dog didn&#x27;t really mind -- she has never bitten me or anyone else, so I felt quite certain that I&#x27;ll have as many fingers after I was done as I did before that --</li>
            <li> It seems like a cheap and very bendy metal was used, unlike the tools my dentist would use.</li>
            <li> The picture looks really ghetto and cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> While the pick has been of occasional use, the scaler in this kit has been absolutely amazing in helping to remove those stains during the months between dental visits.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that kind of throws me off is the mirror.</li>
            <li> So useful and well designed.</li>
            <li> Easily worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have actually removed my own plaque</li>
            <li> Like this set much better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> The materials are solid and sturdy and the handles feel nice in your hand while manipulating in a mouth.</li>
            <li> thats right</li>
            <li> Using this scaler once a week or so really helps to keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I would not let my kids attempt to clean their own teeth with these tools because they are sharp!</li>
            <li> Picks are very sharp, which I suppose is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t had much use for the mirror, I&#x27;m a big fan of the rest of it (and the price was most definitely right!).</li>
            <li> Nice tools, but the pick seems to be a little flimsy as it is easy to bend without much pressure.</li>
            <li> Very much needed to maintain dental health.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I should really be scraping my teeth myself, but I had some really stuck on plaque, and these worked great to knock that shiz off toot sweet.</li>
            <li> The item is exactly is described, but I dislike the quality of the mirror.</li>
            <li> The pick and scaler is exactly like what the dentist uses.</li>
            <li> I have used Plaque rinses and am a frequent user of mouthwash for helping to reduce plaque, but I have to say that having a tool to actually mechanically scrape plaque away is very satisfying.</li>
            <li> There are better out there for similar prices.</li>
            <li> Probably took five minutes instead of ten, and it seems to get more of the glass out?</li>
            <li> Rubber grips to me seem like a better choice when actually using the tools as intended rather then slippery metal.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> Product arrived exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I love this set and only wish I&#x27;d gotten one sooner!</li>
            <li> Exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> This item is exactly as it was described on website.  </li>
            <li> The first set I purchased was flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Only light pressure is needed, let the tool do all the work!</li>
            <li> I used more, the one that you hold against your entire tooth and scrap up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product as long as you are gentle</li>
            <li> Good little set of tools!</li>
            <li> not sure whether or not to recommend it because after all it is a good price.</li>
            <li> An unfortunate byproduct of this love affair is that the hard-to-reach areas between my bottom-front teeth tend to get stained more quickly than most people&#x27;s--even with regular flossing.  </li>
            <li> Got my braces and use it after brushing and flossing to remove any extra residue that wasn&#x27;t easily removed.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, follow instructions, and you&#x27;re fine!</li>
            <li> Nice little set.  </li>
            <li> This product is very well made, it works as how I imagine it would.</li>
            <li> It works very well at removing it and my teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> absolutely nothing has been removed from my teeth.</li>
            <li> They scrape off plaque very well and are affordable.</li>
            <li> Under ten dollars and free Amazon Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> Great for someone, like me, who builds up calculus behind ther front bottom teeth from saliva glands there.  </li>
            <li> I needed something just a bit stronger than a plastic pick for fast building tartar between dental visits.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and the item was what I wanted</li>
            <li> I really just needed the Anti Fog mirror.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> The instruments were useful and professional.</li>
            <li> i thought when i had ordered it that it would be much sturdier.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> The picks are metal and work very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> Wroks very well and is durable.</li>
            <li> but I just didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have a dentist look at my teeth when I&#x27;m ready.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and on with no confusions.</li>
            <li> Items function as expected and are certainly a good enough quality for home use.  </li>
            <li> This will serve the purpose, but the scaler flexes more than it should so it can be hard to clean your teeth with it.  </li>
            <li> The other implements are much more durable than the mirror.</li>
            <li> The other pick, I used with more caution.</li>
            <li> am former OR RN so am familiar with instruments.</li>
            <li> with my $8 pick i would clean them up and only ask they repay me in floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> recently got braces and need a kit to clean my teeth out with</li>
            <li> I can easily use this to scrape loose the tartar.</li>
            <li> Be gentle and careful though, because it can be easy to pierce your gums.</li>
            <li> i will definitely be upgrading to the full on metal ones when i can.</li>
            <li> The package does look pretty old.</li>
            <li> The pick is great for getting hard to reach food out from between your teeth, especially molars.</li>
            <li> I purchased these mainly for the pick.</li>
            <li> Which just seems very unsanitary for any more than a few uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are of high quality and do the job they were intended to do.</li>
            <li> I hv braces, and this helps to clean minor plaque.</li>
            <li> I always be careful with my teeth, this is the tools that I need for clean my mouth very well.</li>
            <li> You have to press harder than is comfortable, but it does get the job done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Metal tools are of cheap metal, but, that&#x27;s what was expected, so no complaints there.</li>
            <li> maybe not professional grade or anything for major use, but for a set to have on hand, its fine.</li>
            <li> and I may end up ordering a new set.</li>
            <li> I wiped it with a soft cloth &amp; it got all scratched up!</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought because I lost the first one.</li>
            <li> Recently got some staining on my front teeth for the first time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace one that I already had (exact same thing).</li>
            <li> find the thicker pick to be more suited for the job rather than the small pick.</li>
            <li> I suggest going to the drugstore to be positive what you are purchasing, next time around.</li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this product to anybody that wants and enjoys quality on a daily basis works very well !</li>
            <li> When I go for regular cleanings the hygienists always remark on how healthy my gums are and how little they need to do.</li>
            <li> Damage control is done with this although I hv to buy another electric toothbrush for prevention action.</li>
            <li> You know the tartar buildup between your front bottom teeth that, no matter how much you floss, still appears before your next dental cleaning?</li>
            <li> to my amazement it started to peel off in much the same way when you scrape at a potatoe.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t remember the old brand name</li>
            <li> My teeth felt sensitive to this pick, so I decided not to use it after that.</li>
            <li> But using the pick and scaler along with my intermittent flossing has helped considerably.  </li>
            <li> I had another set (different brand) which rusted to hell, but these are very well made.</li>
            <li> The handles are plastic, and although they&#x27;re thick and feel fairly sturdy, they&#x27;re obviously not going to feel the same as a completely metallic pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but the pick, scaler, and mirror are top notch.</li>
            <li> A simple disc that attaches via suction to my facial mirror.&lt;br /&gt;An investment in 10 minutes a day of scaling has resulted in $$$ savings on periodontal care and more importantly a healthy mouth without that bad breath that older people tend to get.</li>
            <li> &quot; My dentist didn&#x27;t really mind that I scale my teeth at home, as long as I don&#x27;t go too nuts.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars only because the mirror seems a little cheap.</li>
            <li> The smaller one doesn&#x27;t really add anything that the larger one can&#x27;t do, so I never end up using that one.</li>
            <li> I was able to clean excessive plaque behind the lower front teeth and remove plaque at the gum line.</li>
            <li> Works generally as described.</li>
            <li> The mirror gives a clear image although it is likely not made of glass.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;dont listen to the detractors who fearmongers with &#x27;only a trained professional can care for your teeth&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Not a single fleck of substance came away after all the scraping I did.</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s only a supplement to regular professional dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used dental picks before though, it takes a little bit of time to get used to how to use it so that you don&#x27;t scratch and bleed your gums (and you will the first time)</li>
            <li> First and foremost, you should visit a dentist at least every 6 months for professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> all 3 are very well made: sturdy, sharp, carefully deigned.</li>
            <li> made well strong, i am a little scared of doing it too hard and making a problem</li>
            <li> The only downside is that there is no light, but I already new that beforehand.</li>
            <li> The key thing about these scrapers are that they are made of soft steel, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about destroying your enamel.</li>
            <li> The kit would also be useful for other delicate hobby and tool tasks.</li>
            <li> Mine came in dark blue and white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i was careful with my gums but inevitably they would bleed.</li>
            <li> they had a splinter between them for so long.</li>
            <li> The pick works but it broke not too long after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with both picks, and don&#x27;t use them on a regular basis because you can damage your teeth.</li>
            <li> I found it can work well, however with only the 2 kinds of picks certain areas of the mouth are darn near impossible to reach properly.</li>
            <li> Not only was saliva strands rolling off my tongue but joys of tears down my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cyclists have to remove all the little bits of glass that accumulate in the rubber bike tires, or they migrate to the inner tube and puncture it.</li>
            <li> Read the directions and be careful around your gums however.</li>
            <li> Not much use for mirror.  </li>
            <li> are just what I expected</li>
            <li> Even with wet hands.</li>
            <li> but I do use the other instruments -the pik and the scraper.  </li>
            <li> The picks didn&#x27;t break or chip off like some of the other ones offered by Amazon.</li>
            <li> other than that , it made well and it works well</li>
            <li> the other two help me out between teeth cleanings...</li>
            <li> I have not used the other two items in the pack.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t rust and they are sharp and ergonomic.</li>
            <li> but u need to be very very careful because they are sharp..</li>
            <li> First of the mirror is useless because the mirrior is not clear enough, cause there is fog on the mirror  and the scrapper is a little to dull .</li>
            <li> Was waiting for insurance to become active and couldn&#x27;t go to dentist, so ordered these.</li>
            <li> the pic and scraper are very sharp and care needs to be taken.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a real issue with the mirror fogging up bad for short use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Immediately afterwards i had thoughts of opening up a black market service for people..</li>
            <li> first i was afraid to scratch at it.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to use them.</li>
            <li> but I have a little spot that collects tartar.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful since you could damage your enamel if you scrapped too hard.  </li>
            <li> and she thought they were a waste of money, and was concerned people might hurt themselves.</li>
            <li> All tools have appears durable through a few uses.</li>
            <li> After getting a $900+ estimate for my dog&#x27;s teeth cleaning (which also sounded dreadful -- more like serious surgery involving an anesthesiologist and various types of catheters), I bought this set, opened my dog&#x27;s mouth and started scraping.</li>
            <li> - I would like it to be hard), the other one is hard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very little teeth issues</li>
            <li> I accidentally got a scratch in it, and I&#x27;m not sure how as I&#x27;ve been avoiding scraping the surface of it at all.  </li>
            <li> Ive been carrying around that gunk for at least a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very tough and would last years.  </li>
            <li> or so I can tell the metal is getting a bit dull</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s hard to know after a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was cheap so worst case scenario you dont like them.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really not all that expensive either.</li>
            <li> I hope it is an anti-fog mirror at least.</li>
            <li> Mirror is biggest complaint, the circle of glass on the end of the tool moves around instead of staying in place.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t treat them as toys as you can cause serious damage if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing.</li>
            <li> There is something a little cheesy</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not nearly as good as I should be about flossing.  </li>
            <li> the poor people like me who are forced to pay $65 for an &#x27;xray&#x27;..then told off 23 cavities i MUST FILL UP</li>
            <li> I wanted a wider, paddle-shaped scaler, but I found this to be a curved thin scraper to be used sideways.</li>
            <li> whatever behind the glass.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t care that it is of poor quality (which it is).</li>
            <li> i bought these products (mirror, pik, and scraper) to help between cleanings to remove plaque behind front lower teeth where salivary glands do their work.</li>
            <li> Found some nasty crap behind my teeth.., I am glad I ordered</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with it, I received 2 picks and one mirror</li>
            <li> I have been obsessed with prevention of dental disease all my life.</li>
            <li> I used to get the expensive dental instruments from dental schools but</li>
            <li> Not too expensive, just what I needed.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re also like me, I also feel like my teeth are dirty even after I floss and electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s very difficult to do it yourself.</li>
            <li> You know how the dentist scrapes the crap out of your teeth like a jack-hammer?</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, going to the dentist can get very expensive!  </li>
            <li> I fired my Dentist and nasty Ins.</li>
            <li> My parents all had terrible issues with periodontal disease.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is very well made, it works as how I imagine it would. The only thing that kind of throws me off is the mirror. It doesn&#x27;t really help because it fogs up easily but you can always get something better. Overall it does what its made for. I&#x27;m happy with what I received.</li>
            <li> Good to get around teeth with crowns</li>
            <li> This is perfect when you dont go to dentist often. get a smooth clean feeling without the hassle of having a stranger&#x27;s hands in your mouth lol!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SET!!  THANKS!!!</li>
            <li> Bulky handles, light feeling metal tips.  But, for the price?  They meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with it, I received 2 picks and one mirror and actually I needed the mirror only.</li>
            <li> While not used for human dental uses I find these make great additions to my reptile first aid kit. These feel great in the hand and appear nicely built</li>
            <li> This will serve the purpose, but the scaler flexes more than it should so it can be hard to clean your teeth with it.  You have to press harder than is comfortable, but it does get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice dental pik.  Very much needed to maintain dental health.  Better remove that plaque before seeing the dental hygienist!</li>
            <li> Bought this item through AmericanWholesale.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a dental assistant &amp; bought this item for the use at home. The item is exactly is described, but I dislike the quality of the mirror. Yes it is an Anti Fog mirror. But the quality is so cheap. I wiped it with a soft cloth &amp; it got all scratched up! I don&#x27;t know with what!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure whether or not to recommend it because after all it is a good price.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought because I lost the first one. I only use the scraper thing to get at the plaque between my teeth. It works very well at removing it and my teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> The pick and scaler is exactly like what the dentist uses. They get plaque off your teeth as advertised. Read the directions and be careful around your gums however. This is an excellent product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product...arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Handy tools that your dentist uses. Enables you to give your teeth similar care to an office visit or between visits.</li>
            <li> I purchased these tools to use on my own teeth between dental checkups, but I&#x27;ve found I can also use them on my two kids, one of which hates going to the dentist (he&#x27;s 5). I have my kids lay in my lap after I&#x27;ve brushed their teeth and I can scrape off any extra buildup. I think it&#x27;s great to get them more relaxed with dental tools and ease their fears of the dentist office. The handles are comfortable and the construction feels sturdy. I would not let my kids attempt to clean their own teeth with these tools because they are sharp!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and Service.</li>
            <li> Works great. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Works good. Comfortable grips.</li>
            <li> Nice tools, but the pick seems to be a little flimsy as it is easy to bend without much pressure.</li>
            <li> I have used Plaque rinses and am a frequent user of mouthwash for helping to reduce plaque, but I have to say that having a tool to actually mechanically scrape plaque away is very satisfying. Be gentle and careful though, because it can be easy to pierce your gums.</li>
            <li> for between dental cleaning visit. I hv braces, and this helps to clean minor plaque. We went to east coast this summer and I didnt bring my electric tootbrush. Soon enough I notice a plaque in between teeth. Damage control is done with this although I hv to buy another electric toothbrush for prevention action.</li>
            <li> These work great for light use but the metal does not go through the handle as it should. The tip of my scraper broke off and would need to be glued in to be usable again. There are better out there for similar prices.</li>
            <li> I get tartar build up on my lower teeth no matter how well I brush and floss (and water pic, mouthwash, etc). I can easily use this to scrape loose the tartar. For the first time in over thirty years my dentist didn&#x27;t yell at me about tartar buildup!! Don&#x27;t really use the mirror, but it seems fine.</li>
            <li> It was perfect for getting everywhere you may miss otherwise with just a brush, arrived very quick and it was nice and affordable!</li>
            <li> This item works just as will as they said. Would buy this again. Great Item for clening your teeth without damaging..</li>
            <li> I love it , I do not use the mirror that much but I do use the other instruments -the pik and the scraper.  They are wonderful  This kit is great and helps keep my teeth white and clean without resorting to bleach.</li>
            <li> Recently got some staining on my front teeth for the first time. Was waiting for insurance to become active and couldn&#x27;t go to dentist, so ordered these. EXTREMELY effective. Took off all the staining in about two minutes and it hasn&#x27;t returned. Very glad I bought these.</li>
            <li> Good tool for removing calcium and things stuck inbetween teeth. I use these instead of floss with much better results.</li>
            <li> Perfect for &amp;#34;after-popcorn&amp;#34; type meals/snacks when toothpicks, fingers, nor tongue seem to be able to do any good whatsoever. Relief!</li>
            <li> Cyclists have to remove all the little bits of glass that accumulate in the rubber bike tires, or they migrate to the inner tube and puncture it. I&#x27;ve been using my car keys for years, but this dental scaler is faster. Probably took five minutes instead of ten, and it seems to get more of the glass out? I think.</li>
            <li> The material is good for  its price. You need to use it to see how it fits you best. :-)</li>
            <li> Great tool when you dont have access to a toothbrush</li>
            <li> Works good, but the mirror broke on the third use. The other implements are much more durable than the mirror.</li>
            <li> Quite pleased with quality of Dental Pik.  Would recommend no problems. Not much use for mirror.  Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> For about 7 bucks this works awesome. I don&#x27;t know about those $60+ scalers, maybe they do clean better, but I can&#x27;t see them cleaning $55+ better. Rubber grips to me seem like a better choice when actually using the tools as intended rather then slippery metal.</li>
            <li> the grips on this item are especially good even when your hands are moist the point is well machined and well finished I am comfortable when I need to use this inside my mouth happy with purchase</li>
            <li> My last visit to the dentist, he mentioned that I have a lot of plaque built up on my back teeth and I need to schedule a cleaning. I bought this thinking it might save some money, but after working on my teeth for about 20 minutes (following the instructional video that they have online) absolutely nothing has been removed from my teeth. Not a single fleck of substance came away after all the scraping I did.</li>
            <li> The rubber grips allow for a nice comfort fit.</li>
            <li> i always wanted to try these at home and i am not disappointed. It was cheap so worst case scenario you dont like them.  They scrape off plaque very well and are affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I should really be scraping my teeth myself, but I had some really stuck on plaque, and these worked great to knock that shiz off toot sweet.</li>
            <li> I like the scaler as it cleans between the teeth where they&#x27;re stained from coffee and tea.  Take a little to get the hang of it, but once you figured out, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I use these almost daily to combat plaque buildup. I dont ever use the mirror, but the other two tools are really great. After 6 months or so I can tell the metal is getting a bit dull and I may end up ordering a new set.</li>
            <li> Good product for price</li>
            <li> The picks are good quality, and come with some instructions to use them properly.  I like having them so I can do some extra scraping along my gum line to get stain off between dentist visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is of a lesser quality than the picks.  I accidentally got a scratch in it, and I&#x27;m not sure how as I&#x27;ve been avoiding scraping the surface of it at all.  Oh well, it&#x27;s still usable.</li>
            <li> This set has nice comfortable plastic handles as opposed to all metal handles. You can easily do between your front teeth, but doing rear teeth with the mirror would qualify as a Houdini magic trick in my opinion. Of course it&#x27;s only a supplement to regular professional dental cleaning. The kit would also be useful for other delicate hobby and tool tasks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace one that I already had (exact same thing). So, I already knew what I was getting. However, the package was already opened on the backside - Its a dental pick... Obviously I will not be using it now.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  No concerns or problems to date.  Dental pics are not easy to find, so Amazon was a perfect shopping location.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I needed it to do. Got my braces and use it after brushing and flossing to remove any extra residue that wasn&#x27;t easily removed.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and excellent quality.  The rubber part doesn&#x27;t dis-color or get any stains from the left-over moisture after using it.  I use this about 3x a week.  Very tough and would last years.  You should probably sterilize it once a month or more.</li>
            <li> I make a LOT of tartar. Daily Sonicare + daily flossing + daily Water Pik + dental cleaning every 4 months STILL doesn&#x27;t keep my tartar and plaque under control. Using this scaler once a week or so really helps to keep my teeth clean. There are lots of dental professionals who strongly discourage people from scaling their own teeth at home. Their argument is often, \\&quot;Dentists and hygienists don&#x27;t do it; neither should you.\\&quot; To them I say, \\&quot;Dentists and hygienists probably don&#x27;t make the kind of tartar and plaque that I do.\\&quot; My dentist didn&#x27;t really mind that I scale my teeth at home, as long as I don&#x27;t go too nuts. The scaler is great, the pick is good too -- I haven&#x27;t used the mirror. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Good little set of tools! I changed the angle of the dental pick just a bit, but otherwise they work just fine. The handles are comfortable and easy to grip. The tools seem to be well-made.</li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this product to anybody that wants and enjoys quality on a daily basis works very well !</li>
            <li> Product arrived exactly as described. Under ten dollars and free Amazon Prime shipping. Great deal.</li>
            <li> Works Great for the$$$</li>
            <li> Cheap and useful. What an idea!</li>
            <li> For the price, this is excellent.  Good mirror (doesn&#x27;t fog) and workable piks will pry plaque off of your teeth.  Won&#x27;t replace a dental hygienist; but will delay your need to see one.</li>
            <li> I fired my Dentist and nasty Ins. Co for a year, saved 1100.00, and used this product. After returning to the Doc they asked if i went in to see the dentist recently, this works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Works great. The picks didn&#x27;t break or chip off like some of the other ones offered by Amazon. The mirror works great and surprisingly does not fog very much at all. Does a very good job of removing plaque in between dentist visits. If you&#x27;ve never used dental picks before though, it takes a little bit of time to get used to how to use it so that you don&#x27;t scratch and bleed your gums (and you will the first time) but it keeps your teeth mighty clean, especially when you pair it with some good flossing.</li>
            <li> Works generally as described. The handles are plastic, and although they&#x27;re thick and feel fairly sturdy, they&#x27;re obviously not going to feel the same as a completely metallic pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the thicker pick to be more suited for the job rather than the small pick. The smaller one doesn&#x27;t really add anything that the larger one can&#x27;t do, so I never end up using that one.</li>
            <li> use it to clean my 2 dogs teeth so they now have great breath and saves me a ton of money getting cleanings from the dog dentist.</li>
            <li> So useful and well designed.</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps my aging teeth in top shape. Saves $$ on visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li> As expected, very nice.... worth the money and well packed.</li>
            <li> Great for someone, like me, who builds up calculus behind ther front bottom teeth from saliva glands there.  Easily worth the price.</li>
            <li> Tried to play Dentist;tip broke but probably my fault  ... learned my lesson and will stick to more manageable things</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just what you expect, they have a nice grip and a great finish, also they&#x27;re built to last.&lt;br /&gt;The thinner pick is flexible (the metal part - I would like it to be hard), the other one is hard.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Product is good, but right after I bought it I saw it for cheaper at walmart. Could have bought it there and had it instantly.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, going to the dentist can get very expensive!  I did not know what to expect when I purchased this, I just knew that I needed a way to more efficiently clean my teeth at home.  Boy does this do the trick!  I recently went to the dentist after using this product and they were blown away by how well scaled my teeth were.  No cavities!!</li>
            <li> I needed something just a bit stronger than a plastic pick for fast building tartar between dental visits. This fits the bill nicely.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and the item was what I wanted</li>
            <li> The quality of the dental picks are sub-par. It seems like a cheap and very bendy metal was used, unlike the tools my dentist would use. The mirror however is great and does not fog, making it easy to view/clean the backs of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Ok, five stars is a little over the top for what it is, but they&#x27;re VERY comfortable to hold and use. I am happy with the product and the quick delivery so why not five stars?</li>
            <li> I really just needed the Anti Fog mirror. Great quality for the price. I haven&#x27;t had a real issue with the mirror fogging up bad for short use.</li>
            <li> Good product for a good price</li>
            <li> You know the tartar buildup between your front bottom teeth that, no matter how much you floss, still appears before your next dental cleaning? No more! I was able to remove it easily with the scaler. Who knew how easily it would come off with the right too?! The mirror is an added bonus to see the back of the teeth. The pick is great for getting hard to reach food out from between your teeth, especially molars. I love this set and only wish I&#x27;d gotten one sooner!</li>
            <li> made well strong, i am a little scared of doing it too hard and making a problem</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it&#x27;s really not all that expensive either. I gave 4 stars only because the mirror seems a little cheap. Other than that the scaler works great. I have actually removed my own plaque lol! Good product, I asked my dental assistant about it before I bought it and she thought they were a waste of money, and was concerned people might hurt themselves. Just be careful, follow instructions, and you&#x27;re fine!</li>
            <li> im reviewing this product 25 minutes after receiving and using it. thats right 25 minutes was all it took to get rid of an ungodly tartar (calculus) that i had lodge between my lower two front teeth. Ive been carrying around that gunk for at least a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at first i was afraid to scratch at it. to my amazement it started to peel off in much the same way when you scrape at a potatoe. i kept reminding myself of the product claims &#x27;wont damage the teeth enamel&#x27;. As i got more comfortable and confident using it, scrape scrape scrape..big chunk unlodged. wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was careful with my gums but inevitably they would bleed. why wouldnt they..they had a splinter between them for so long. I kept going at it..and within 10 minutes i cleared out the area between my teeth. Not only was saliva strands rolling off my tongue but joys of tears down my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately afterwards i had thoughts of opening up a black market service for people..id be known as the mr calculus and give them cleanings in my van parked in the alley. Why not give power back to the people. the poor people like me who are forced to pay $65 for an &#x27;xray&#x27;..then told off 23 cavities i MUST FILL UP OR I WILL DIE. but mr dentist..i only came for a cleaning...no i would be fair to the people..with my $8 pick i would clean them up and only ask they repay me in floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dont listen to the detractors who fearmongers with &#x27;only a trained professional can care for your teeth&#x27;. You my friend..YOU CAN TAKE BACK THE POWER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(seriously..this is THE BEST $8 i have ever spent on my health.)</li>
            <li> I bought this dental pik set  to used in between dentist visit and it did not work out well for me. First of the mirror is useless because the mirrior is not clear enough, cause there is fog on the mirror  and the scrapper is a little to dull . The only thing good about the set is the pick, when food  is caught between your teeth, the pick will get it out.</li>
            <li> I tried to buy one that had a light in the mirror, but could not find one, so I bought this. It works fine, the mirror is really anti fog and the piks work fine. The only downside is that there is no light, but I already new that beforehand.</li>
            <li> I always be careful with my teeth, this is the tools that I need for clean my mouth very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this to check out my mouth when I have an issue going on.  I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m a bit of a hypochondriac and any time I feel tarter or an irregularity in my mouth I want to check it out.  The mirror works great and the pik is shaped very nicely to get at the area between the gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the rubber on these is quite nice and even when in the mouth there is no irritation.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> it works great. the plastic could be smaller in diameter; it feels like i&#x27;m holding a fat oral-b tooth brush. other than that , it made well and it works well</li>
            <li> I use this every day watching TV.  Now I&#x27;ll wait and see how my next checkup goes.  Great idea!  ginger</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but the pick, scaler, and mirror are top notch. Exactly what I needed to help keep the teeth clean between dental appointments.</li>
            <li> Nice little set.  Easy to hold and grip.  Handle of pick has a softness to it that makes it easy not to drop.</li>
            <li> Good quality dental care product kit, I like the rubberized grip, and the price is right, good basic way to supplement a dental self-care routine at home.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, I like it when I go to the dentist and get my teeth scraped at. If you&#x27;re also like me, I also feel like my teeth are dirty even after I floss and electric toothbrush. I&#x27;ve always wanted to scrape my own teeth and so I purchased this product and I&#x27;ve been super happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks much different than what the product picture looks like. The picture looks really ghetto and cheap plastic. My pick, scaler, and mirror had a blue rubber grip mixed in with a white plastic body. Sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I found it can work well, however with only the 2 kinds of picks certain areas of the mouth are darn near impossible to reach properly. I would say the quality reminds me of a fusion of those dental keychains you can find for a couple dollars, and actual dental tools. The inclusion of the mirror is great.</li>
            <li> Found some nasty crap behind my teeth.., I am glad I ordered</li>
            <li> Works well, good for the money.  There is something a little cheesy but I would buy again.  Seems like they will hold up well.</li>
            <li> These are great for scraping but u need to be very very careful because they are sharp..</li>
            <li> Exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do. only thing that is usable in this kit is the mirror.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly as it was described on website.  The scaler works great and my dog doesn&#x27;t seem to mind.</li>
            <li> The first set I purchased was flimsy.  I ordered this in hopes that it was sturdier and it is.  The grips fit my hand and make using the scraper easier.</li>
            <li> The instruments were useful and professional. I was able to clean excessive plaque behind the lower front teeth and remove plaque at the gum line. Best of all, I don&#x27;t need an appointment with the dentist whenever spot removal is necessary. I do recommend seeing your dentist, your teeth, if properly cared for can last a life time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion to the manufacturer, more detailed step by step instruction.</li>
            <li> Excellent dental tools to help in the cleaning of areas in the mouth beyond the regular visits to the dentist office. Tool construction and presentation very good quality and the price is very affordable and will revert in savings, is use properly.</li>
            <li> These seem well made and like they will last.  Though it&#x27;s hard to know after a week.&lt;br /&gt;They are just what I expected and I have no complaints about them.</li>
            <li> I get plaque on the backs of my front lower teeth.  These picks allow me to break up the plaque that floss just won&#x27;t remove.  Helpful to have around.</li>
            <li> These work fine for picking stuff out of your teeth. I was a little scared to use them. You know how the dentist scrapes the crap out of your teeth like a jack-hammer? Well, I wasnt about to try that kind of pressure. I couldnt relly see with the mirror, but they work pretty fair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll do the job definitely, and it does the job, but i thought when i had ordered it that it would be much sturdier. i will definitely be upgrading to the full on metal ones when i can.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. Product is what is advertised.  Don&#x27;t know what else to say for a dental pik, besides that it works.</li>
            <li> These might be effective but weren&#x27;t for me. I thought I could use them to simulate the just got cleaned feeling I get from the dentist. It didn&#x27;t quite work out. Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and works as described.  Great product for the cost.  Would definitely recommend in addition to regular flossing.</li>
            <li> Exact what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> Very useful...the mirror I haven&#x27;t used at all but the other two help me out between teeth cleanings...</li>
            <li> The picks are metal and work very well.  You have to be careful since you could damage your enamel if you scrapped too hard.  I have not found this to be a problem and they feel very hefty and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest:  I drink a lot of coffee.  A LOT.  An unfortunate byproduct of this love affair is that the hard-to-reach areas between my bottom-front teeth tend to get stained more quickly than most people&#x27;s--even with regular flossing.  While the pick has been of occasional use, the scaler in this kit has been absolutely amazing in helping to remove those stains during the months between dental visits.  While I haven&#x27;t had much use for the mirror, I&#x27;m a big fan of the rest of it (and the price was most definitely right!).</li>
            <li> This product can do the job for it purpose however, It&#x27;s very difficult to do it yourself. It takes alot of time and effort. IMO leave it to the professionals if you can.</li>
            <li> After getting a $900+ estimate for my dog&#x27;s teeth cleaning (which also sounded dreadful -- more like serious surgery involving an anesthesiologist and various types of catheters), I bought this set, opened my dog&#x27;s mouth and started scraping. The dog didn&#x27;t really mind -- she has never bitten me or anyone else, so I felt quite certain that I&#x27;ll have as many fingers after I was done as I did before that -- and on occasion she would close her eyes and seemed to drift off... Once I figured out the correct pressure (which did take some experimentation), the tartar and the stains were gone in minutes.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really remember why I felt like I needed this, but if you do want to own a set for home, this is an affordable option.  maybe not professional grade or anything for major use, but for a set to have on hand, its fine.</li>
            <li> even better than the dentists.</li>
            <li> The thinner and longer pick is pretty impressive.  It removes food and plaque after flossing.  My dental visits for cleaning have improved tremendously. I have not used the other two items in the pack. However, for me, this pick itself is worth the price!</li>
            <li> I purchased these mainly for the pick. I have very little teeth issues but I have a little spot that collects tartar. So I use it for that spot. Works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift.  Recipient likes it.</li>
            <li> Like this set much better than my old one.  Can&#x27;t remember the old brand name but this set is great.  And the price was a bargain.</li>
            <li> This is a nice dental scaler &amp; pick set.  I wanted a wider, paddle-shaped scaler, but I found this to be a curved thin scraper to be used sideways. I couldn&#x27;t tell by the photo.  However, it works well, and I will use them both.  Good quality, and I really like the cushioned handles as it makes it much easier to use efficiently.  I would say a good value.</li>
            <li> Im really happy with these for the price. Theyvwork justcas advertised and dont rust.</li>
            <li> This does not look like the same product I was expecting. However I will use it since it was the cheapest and I don&#x27;t want to go thru the hassles of returning and finding another. I was looking for a replacement to a lighted scaler set and anti-fog mirror set I had before. Those are better than the non-lighted ones. However this looks like an able-bodied product. Mine looks nothing like the photo, it has a scaler, a pick, and a mirror. The package does look pretty old. I hope it is an anti-fog mirror at least. I suggest going to the drugstore to be positive what you are purchasing, next time around.</li>
            <li> Mirror is biggest complaint, the circle of glass on the end of the tool moves around instead of staying in place.&lt;br /&gt;Can easily get water, saliva, whatever behind the glass. Which just seems very unsanitary for any more than a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;Metal tools are of cheap metal, but, that&#x27;s what was expected, so no complaints there.</li>
            <li> These are just fine. If your looking for something to pick your teeth/gums with then these will do. Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> I love being able to scrape away the plaque between my lower incissors between bi-annual cleanings. I try to do it almost weekly. The key thing about these scrapers are that they are made of soft steel, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about destroying your enamel. Only light pressure is needed, let the tool do all the work! I love these for that clean feeling between my teeth!</li>
            <li> Love them. I use these between dental cleaning. Wroks very well and is durable.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because one of my back molars was hurting. The pick works but it broke not too long after I bought it. This product is ok but I just didn&#x27;t use it much. I&#x27;ll have a dentist look at my teeth when I&#x27;m ready.</li>
            <li> Items function as expected and are certainly a good enough quality for home use.  Picks are very sharp, which I suppose is a good thing.  All tools have appears durable through a few uses. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been obsessed with prevention of dental disease all my life. My parents all had terrible issues with periodontal disease. Our dentist told me at age 12 that if I removed all the plaque around my teeth daily I had a chance of beating my genetics. It has worked!I am now 56 and have zero periodontal disease despite significant receding gums.&lt;br /&gt;My routine has been to floss, then use a rubber tipped scaler around the gums, then metal scalers. I used to get the expensive dental instruments from dental schools but these (not as good quality) do the job well enough at a fraction of the cost, and with comfy rubber handles.&lt;br /&gt;I never use the mirror so don&#x27;t care that it is of poor quality (which it is). I use a 10 x magnifying mirror that is sold cheaply on Amazon. A simple disc that attaches via suction to my facial mirror.&lt;br /&gt;An investment in 10 minutes a day of scaling has resulted in $$$ savings on periodontal care and more importantly a healthy mouth without that bad breath that older people tend to get. Everyone should learn to use scalers as my dentist taught me as a girl. When I go for regular cleanings the hygienists always remark on how healthy my gums are and how little they need to do.</li>
            <li> Good price, useful and fun to use and save money.</li>
            <li> The mirror was perfect and did not fog, at all. The two picks were great as well. I used more, the one that you hold against your entire tooth and scrap up. It cleaned the tooth very nicely. The other pick, I used with more caution. My teeth felt sensitive to this pick, so I decided not to use it after that. But overall everything worked great. Just be careful with both picks, and don&#x27;t use them on a regular basis because you can damage your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have periodontal disease and I&#x27;m not nearly as good as I should be about flossing.  But using the pick and scaler along with my intermittent flossing has helped considerably.  I have no visible signs of tartar build up and my teeth look and feel better.  I don&#x27;t use the mirror except to look for stains.</li>
            <li> 5 stars!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently got braces and need a kit to clean my teeth out with, This is just was i was looking for and the perfect price. It shipped fast and on with no confusions.</li>
            <li> I read mixed reviews about this product.  Including one from a dentist cautioning people from using it.  I would agree with the dentist&#x27;s advice.  However, I got this to help remove stubborn materials from my front lower teeth (backside) in between dentists&#x27; visits and I would have to say it is exactly perfect for that.  An adjunct to proper brushing and flossing.  One must be carefull not to use it improperly.</li>
            <li> Good quality at a reasonable price.  The grips on the picks are easy to hold.  The mirror gives a clear image although it is likely not made of glass.  I use the picks to remove tartar between cleanings and it is very effective.</li>
            <li> Set of 3 dental tools, a mirror, a pick, and a scaler. These are actual tools so don&#x27;t treat them as toys as you can cause serious damage if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing. They are of high quality and do the job they were intended to do.</li>
            <li> Not too expensive, just what I needed. Been using this for a month now and no complains about it yet.</li>
            <li> i bought these products (mirror, pik, and scraper) to help between cleanings to remove plaque behind front lower teeth where salivary glands do their work. i just received them and haven&#x27;t had a lot of practice with them; using mirror with either pik or scraper is a bit challenging. the pic and scraper are very sharp and care needs to be taken. much better than manicure scissors and toothpicks. all 3 are very well made: sturdy, sharp, carefully deigned. am former OR RN so am familiar with instruments. it&#x27;s kind of advantageous to see parts of one&#x27;s mouth from the &#x27;other-side&#x27;, so to speak. i think they&#x27;ll work well once i get used to using them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product as long as you are gentle and you handle it with precaution. Of course it&#x27;s not substitution for what the dentist can do but it does work nice to remove plaque and unsightly tartar.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. The grip handle makes it easy to work with. Even with wet hands. The color is different than what is listed. Mine came in dark blue and white.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, you should visit a dentist at least every 6 months for professional cleaning. Don&#x27;t use these if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I would recommend this set. The materials are solid and sturdy and the handles feel nice in your hand while manipulating in a mouth.</li>
            <li> These are great for between dentist visits. they don&#x27;t rust and they are sharp and ergonomic. I had another set (different brand) which rusted to hell, but these are very well made.</li>
