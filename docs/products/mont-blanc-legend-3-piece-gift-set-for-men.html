            <li>The cologne, after shave, and shower gel were brand new in the package.</li>
            <li>Usually I go to &amp; get a couple free Cologne samples at Sephora in the mall &amp; try them before I buy them &amp; usually decide on the samples by asking what their #1 sellers are &amp; if the girl is hot, her personal recommendation.</li>
