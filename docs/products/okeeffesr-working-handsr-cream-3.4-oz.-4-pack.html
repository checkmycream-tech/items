            <li>soaks in good, smooth feeling to skin everyone in my house uses it.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>great stuff - and my wife used hundreds of things first.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>(I am sure that a lot of my problem occurred because my hands were in water often.)</li>

            <li>Today I’m ordering four more containers of WH since I’ll have this product around for many years.</li>

            <li>I love it and intend to keep it around my house at all times.</li>
            <li>I just love this cream.  </li>
            <li>Magic Stuff.</li>
            <li>I will buy more to give to friends.</li>
            <li>so I got him some more.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found anything better or a better price</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Need to use more than once a day though in the winter months.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Great stuff that really works.</li>
            <li>There is no smell like most of the lotions out there, and I found I didn&#x27;t mind using this more often as a result of that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Been using this stuff for a couple years now, and I love it.  </li>

            <li>mostly cause we have already lost one.</li>
            <li>O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream works better than the prescription drug that the doctor gave me and is a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I love this hand</li>
            <li>but O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Working Hands is better.</li>
            <li>It will sting for a bit if your hands are cracked but after a minute or two your hands feel better.</li>
            <li>, I prefer a more fragrant one, but my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t mind the smell (or lack thereof) at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best we&#x27;ve found, short of a dermatologist prescription lotion.</li>
            <li>This really works great</li>
            <li>but after 20 minutes the itch is gone and does not return for many hours.</li>
            <li>I bought 4 containers and get more than 5 month&#x27;s use out of each container.</li>
            <li>I have ordered more to make sure I get through the rest of the winter.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>This worked wonders and within a couple of weeks, his hands looked SO much better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am an office pusher for the most part, but do masonry and tile work on the side.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and item works great.</li>
            <li>I SAY MORE---</li>

            <li>Originally we found this product quite by accident at a Home Depot.</li>
            <li>We always buy it in bulk and amazon usually has the best price!</li>
            <li>Great for keeping my hands from getting over dry while I&#x27;m knitting.</li>
            <li>It works great for hands that are dry and chapped because of winter weather.  </li>
            <li>Works great for my dry cracked fingers and hands</li>
            <li>For those of &amp;#34;a certain age&amp;#34; you will know what I am talking about when I say it has the texture of Noxzema, but is very much better stuff than that.  </li>
            <li>Excellent hand cream for the hard working men and women.  </li>
            <li>Very solid, very sturdy and beautiful (when clean!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product should come with something like these butter spreaders to apply it</li>
            <li>Very solid, very sturdy and beautiful (when clean!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product should come with something like these butter spreaders to apply it</li>
            <li>I give one of these to each of my son inlaws and they all love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Works really well glad we bought the 4 pack</li>
            <li>The deal with the 4-pack was such a good deal.  </li>
            <li>works good only reason I&#x27;, giving it a 4 is that sent 2.7 oz instead of 3.4</li>
            <li>This is by far the greatest product for dry skin on the market.</li>
            <li>but I continue to rub my hands together and the WH dries quickly and is NOT greasy.</li>
            <li>tremendous value.</li>
            <li>not greasy and dries quick.  </li>
            <li>Really works great on my hand but you need to use it on a regular basis.</li>

            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I tried this product this winter, and for the first time in 15 years, NO Problems!  </li>

            <li>I love these little (what I call) scoopers.</li>
            <li>I clean houses, and always suffer from dry, cracked hands in the winter, someone suggested O&#x27;Keefe</li>
            <li>In the meantime, my wife, who has as her most aggressive winter activity typing on her laptop, had dried and cracked skin on her hands.  </li>
            <li>Normally at this time of year I would be covering my fingers with bandages because of the skin separating and bleeding.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to report that daily use after two weeks has made the dramatic difference and I will coninue use and certainly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>If my hands are dry, I apply once and it lasts several days until I need more.  </li>
            <li>After using 3 times a day for 1 week all of my fingers were sealed, and after 1 month they were like new.</li>
            <li>I have not had any new ones appear.</li>
            <li>It is hard to say enough good about it.</li>
            <li>2 years I have been using it, all year round,  great for cracked hands in winter, and dried out gardening hands in the summer.  </li>
            <li>By the way, I only used 1.25 containers of WH to totally resolve my problems with my split skin on my hands and fingers; complete healing was realized very quickly as mentioned above.ation about seven months into the problem.</li>
            <li>Strange texture at first but really works.</li>
            <li>I get pretty gnarly hangnails if I&#x27;m not careful, and by putting this stuff on at night before bed, my hands heal completely in like 48 hours.</li>
            <li>My hands dry out quickly</li>
            <li>Used regularly, this prevents my hands from becoming dry.  </li>
            <li>I went fishing this last weekend and forgot to put sunscreen on the first day.</li>
            <li>Almost instant healing after first application.</li>
            <li>Extremely hot water was the only thing that made them stop hurting believe it or</li>
            <li>Last winter was the first time in a number of years where I actually managed to go without skin problems on my hands, and not coincidentally it is the first year that I used Working Hands from start to finish.  </li>
            <li>the office and the car.&lt;br /&gt;We have had days over 90 degrees (inside car temps were probably over 110) and its consistency remains exactly the same as in the air conditioned spaces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I only had 3 fingers that were NOT bleeding.</li>
            <li>This is the first and only hand cream that has ever made a difference.</li>
            <li>The first night he used it, the very next morning his hands were soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Where on God&#x27;s fine and green earth has this hand cream been hiding from me ??  </li>
            <li>By the way, I only used 1.25 containers of WH to totally resolve my problems with my split skin on my hands and fingers; complete healing was realized very quickly as mentioned above.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for four days, but my very dry, cracked hands are already crack free.</li>
            <li>Working hands will clear up the cracks on my fingers within 10 days.</li>
            <li>I used the cream on everything and so far I am not peeling, although it still hurts.</li>
            <li>Wow, is the word that comes to mind.</li>
            <li>Wow..</li>
            <li>Makes finger splits from brake fluid and battery acid heal up fast.</li>
            <li>It really makes a big difference with continued use.</li>
            <li>Even my six-year old loves it.</li>
            <li>Made my weather cracked hands heal and they are now soft again.</li>
            <li>only thing I&#x27;ll warn you about is: Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>My hands were highly sensitive to both the material and lack of airflow that cause them to sweat.</li>
            <li>Since using working hands, my hands stay soft and no longer crack or bleed.</li>
            <li>Working as a nurse, I wash my hands frequently.</li>
            <li>After a week of using, those issues are completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I am 66 years old and have always engaged in work that was drying to the hands.</li>
            <li>and I had almost complete repair of dr hands after one use.</li>
            <li>My auto-mechanic son says this is the only stuff that has really worked on his chapped and cracked hands.</li>
            <li>Housekept my hand soft n</li>
            <li>One of the worse problems with most creams and ointments is that after putting it on your hands they will be greasy which is a real problem (for me).</li>
            <li>Wife a medical professional and loves these!!!</li>
            <li>so my hand get pretty dry, this helps a lot.</li>
            <li>Okay hand cream but not exceptional</li>
            <li>I and my husband have recommended Working hands to others and they have the same high praise for this product.</li>
            <li>High quality lotion that helps creat a barrier between your skin and whatever you&#x27;re working with (in my case medical gloves).</li>
            <li>I have struggled for a long time to find a hand cream that was not greasy, heal my hands from cracking and peeling, and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I work very aggressively with my hands all year long, and I pay for it during the winter months.  </li>
            <li>Really works on dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li>My dad and husband both work with their hands and this really helps heal and protect their dry skin.</li>
            <li>Really helps my dry hands.</li>
            <li>My cracked and bleeding fingertips are totally healed, and my hands are very soft after using Working Hands for 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hands are usually in water/soap, as I clean houses.</li>
            <li>Working hands works very well for overly worked and very dry hands.</li>
            <li>a small amount of the cream,paying special attention to finger tips.</li>
            <li>but, it will totally help clear up the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 30 years in the food service profession my hands feel as soft as they did when I wad much younger.</li>
            <li>With two young children, I am constantly washing my hands.</li>
            <li>Using this daily has completely eliminated my cracked knuckles.</li>
            <li>I am a nurse and this is the only handcream that keeps my hands soft.  </li>
            <li>and it takes just a little bit and in less than a week you will have better hands.  </li>
            <li>While I think the Aquaphor may work a little better, I like that this is less greasy</li>
            <li>If you have dry cracked skin this will definitely help them heal fast.</li>
            <li>I mix some Neosporine with it when I have skin cracks or small cuts, it helps healing quickly.</li>
            <li>A little of this goes a long way, and one tub has lasted me for months, and still is over 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li>I would have put it on more frequently, but it leaves an uncomfortable texture/feeling on my hands.</li>
            <li>When applied is seemed to never dry or absorb.</li>
            <li>smell, feels a little waxy at first but soaks in well.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product fro anyone with finger that crack in dry condition, especially as winter approaches and the furnace zaps all moister from the air inside one&#x27;s home.</li>
            <li>winter long to stay soft and stop winter itch!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hands dry and crack frequently and</li>
            <li>Seems do be doing well to moisturize my dry hands so far</li>
            <li>Depending on how much you apply, it may not dry in a few seconds</li>

            <li> I have tried everything for my cracked hands and this is far and away the best product!!</li>
            <li> Amazing so much better than moisturizer</li>
            <li> plus you can&#x60;t beat the price.you save over 2.00 dollars then going into a retailer it worth it plus work great on your hands with no smell to it .</li>
            <li> soaks in good, smooth feeling to skin everyone in my house uses it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> great stuff - and my wife used hundreds of things first.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> (I am sure that a lot of my problem occurred because my hands were in water often.)</li>
            <li> I think you’ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Today I’m ordering four more containers of WH since I’ll have this product around for many years.</li>
            <li> Today I’m ordering four more containers of WH since I’ll have this product around for many years.</li>

            <li> I love it and intend to keep it around my house at all times.</li>
            <li> I just love this cream.  </li>
            <li> Magic Stuff.</li>
            <li> I will buy more to give to friends.</li>
            <li> so I got him some more.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found anything better or a better price</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Need to use more than once a day though in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff that really works.</li>
            <li> There is no smell like most of the lotions out there, and I found I didn&#x27;t mind using this more often as a result of that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for a couple years now, and I love it.  </li>

            <li> O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream works better than the prescription drug that the doctor gave me and is a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I love this hand</li>
            <li> but O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Working Hands is better.</li>
            <li> It will sting for a bit if your hands are cracked but after a minute or two your hands feel better.</li>
            <li> , I prefer a more fragrant one, but my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t mind the smell (or lack thereof) at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best we&#x27;ve found, short of a dermatologist prescription lotion.</li>
            <li> This really works great</li>
            <li> but after 20 minutes the itch is gone and does not return for many hours.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 containers and get more than 5 month&#x27;s use out of each container.</li>
            <li> I have ordered more to make sure I get through the rest of the winter.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This worked wonders and within a couple of weeks, his hands looked SO much better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am an office pusher for the most part, but do masonry and tile work on the side.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and item works great.</li>
            <li> I SAY MORE---</li>

            <li> This product absorbs into my skin nicely and keeps my skin healthy and soft.</li>

            <li> Originally we found this product quite by accident at a Home Depot.</li>
            <li> We always buy it in bulk and amazon usually has the best price!</li>
            <li> Great for keeping my hands from getting over dry while I&#x27;m knitting.</li>
            <li> It works great for hands that are dry and chapped because of winter weather.  </li>
            <li> Works great for my dry cracked fingers and hands</li>
            <li> For those of &amp;#34;a certain age&amp;#34; you will know what I am talking about when I say it has the texture of Noxzema, but is very much better stuff than that.  </li>
            <li> Excellent hand cream for the hard working men and women.  </li>
            <li> Very solid, very sturdy and beautiful (when clean!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product should come with something like these butter spreaders to apply it</li>
            <li> Very solid, very sturdy and beautiful (when clean!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product should come with something like these butter spreaders to apply it</li>
            <li> I give one of these to each of my son inlaws and they all love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Works really well glad we bought the 4 pack</li>
            <li> The deal with the 4-pack was such a good deal.  </li>
            <li> works good only reason I&#x27;, giving it a 4 is that sent 2.7 oz instead of 3.4</li>
            <li> This is by far the greatest product for dry skin on the market.</li>
            <li> but I continue to rub my hands together and the WH dries quickly and is NOT greasy.</li>
            <li> tremendous value.</li>
            <li> not greasy and dries quick.  </li>
            <li> Really works great on my hand but you need to use it on a regular basis.</li>

            <li> good cream for dry hands</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product this winter, and for the first time in 15 years, NO Problems!  </li>
            <li> Less greasy and MORE effective.  </li>
            <li> I abuse my hands, have super sensitive skin, have too many years and then lamented that nothing worked because I couldn&#x27;t have the greasy slim on working hands.  </li>
            <li> here and scoop it out with these great little scoopers</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m enjoying the fact that her hands are healing and mine feel soft which is a plus in the winter months.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money and</li>
            <li> He loves this cream , it helps better then any we&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li> Works good my husbands hands were really rough</li>
            <li> and it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good for my dry hand and cracked heels.</li>
            <li> worked where many other products which cost more did not.</li>
            <li> I suffer from cracks in my fingers every winter, right along my nails</li>
            <li> They are right...</li>
            <li> It does not help with the itching right away</li>
            <li> Smile as that I had ruff very VERY ruff elbows</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing for healing dry hands and cracks-- non sticky, non greasy.  </li>
            <li> A real plus, there is no smell and it rubs in quickly.</li>
            <li> can put it on at a red light and still grab the stearing wheel when light changes</li>
            <li> This cream is great and helps heal some major cracks and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Since the healing of my hands occurred about a month ago a couple of tiny splits have reoccurred but that is my fault for not applying WH more often.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> It is almost like a miracle how fast it heals my hands!</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream; it&#x27;s especially helpful in the winter.</li>
            <li> Not only could I find it, but at much better pricing.</li>
            <li> first bought 2 at the drug store (1 for home and 1 for the office)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy when you first put it on</li>
            <li> Since I have been usung this product my hands are soft and free of cracks.</li>
            <li> The effected areas are now softer and more supple, redness is gone and open</li>
            <li> It really does what it says for your hands!</li>
            <li> first order was for 2 containers.</li>
            <li> noticed results within the first 2 days.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not working as well as description indicated.  </li>
            <li> I had smooth soft elbows</li>
            <li> It makes them soft and smooth, relieves irritation around cuticles and prevents cracking.  </li>
            <li> Not only were the immediate results outstanding</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> For the first time in years we are in December</li>
            <li> REALLY works, no joke!</li>
            <li> Sorry if this didn&#x27;t help you in your search for perfect flatwear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably better to apply a small amount to the hands and then add more if needed.</li>
            <li> This is the first winter he hasn&#x27;t had to suffer.  </li>
            <li> And sure enough it was there!  </li>
            <li> super highly rated so</li>
            <li> It works for all your skin problems,I originally bought it just to try not believing that it was different then others including prescription creams ,but I was quickly made a believer</li>
            <li> My father-in-law also uses this and gives positive feedback, so I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of putting way too much on the first time, and my hands felt like they were coated in plastic, like I had been playing with crayons all day.</li>
            <li> great for crows feet, dry heals, dry hands --- as a whole body</li>
            <li> but once I put it on my skin instantly relaxes, it&#x27;s my new favorite skin product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works VERY well.</li>
            <li> As a result of the doctor’s visit a prescription was issued that was very greasy and did nothing to resolve the issue.</li>

            <li> In the meantime, my wife, who has as her most aggressive winter activity typing on her laptop, had dried and cracked skin on her hands.  </li>
            <li> Normally at this time of year I would be covering my fingers with bandages because of the skin separating and bleeding.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to report that daily use after two weeks has made the dramatic difference and I will coninue use and certainly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> If my hands are dry, I apply once and it lasts several days until I need more.  </li>
            <li> After using 3 times a day for 1 week all of my fingers were sealed, and after 1 month they were like new.</li>
            <li> I have not had any new ones appear.</li>
            <li> It is hard to say enough good about it.</li>
            <li> 2 years I have been using it, all year round,  great for cracked hands in winter, and dried out gardening hands in the summer.  </li>
            <li> By the way, I only used 1.25 containers of WH to totally resolve my problems with my split skin on my hands and fingers; complete healing was realized very quickly as mentioned above.ation about seven months into the problem.</li>
            <li> Strange texture at first but really works.</li>

            <li> Last winter was the first time in a number of years where I actually managed to go without skin problems on my hands, and not coincidentally it is the first year that I used Working Hands from start to finish.  </li>
            <li> the office and the car.&lt;br /&gt;We have had days over 90 degrees (inside car temps were probably over 110) and its consistency remains exactly the same as in the air conditioned spaces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I only had 3 fingers that were NOT bleeding.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only hand cream that has ever made a difference.</li>

            <li> Working hands will clear up the cracks on my fingers within 10 days.</li>
            <li> I used the cream on everything and so far I am not peeling, although it still hurts.</li>

            <li> Made my weather cracked hands heal and they are now soft again.</li>
            <li> only thing I&#x27;ll warn you about is: Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> My hands were highly sensitive to both the material and lack of airflow that cause them to sweat.</li>
            <li> Since using working hands, my hands stay soft and no longer crack or bleed.</li>

            <li> My hands are usually in water/soap, as I clean houses.</li>
            <li> Working hands works very well for overly worked and very dry hands.</li>
            <li> a small amount of the cream,paying special attention to finger tips.</li>
            <li> but, it will totally help clear up the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 30 years in the food service profession my hands feel as soft as they did when I wad much younger.</li>

            <li> I mix some Neosporine with it when I have skin cracks or small cuts, it helps healing quickly.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way, and one tub has lasted me for months, and still is over 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li> I would have put it on more frequently, but it leaves an uncomfortable texture/feeling on my hands.</li>
            <li> When applied is seemed to never dry or absorb.</li>
            <li> smell, feels a little waxy at first but soaks in well.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product fro anyone with finger that crack in dry condition, especially as winter approaches and the furnace zaps all moister from the air inside one&#x27;s home.</li>

            <li> My hands dry and crack frequently and</li>

            <li> I find that this really helps &amp; only requires a small amount.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my husband as his hands and a few other spots were very dry.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> the only complaint I have on it</li>
            <li> This winter was rough on my husband&#x27;s and my hands and working hands cream does work hard to help with the dry, cracked fingers.</li>
            <li> Hands down (yes, pun)</li>
            <li> We tried every other product out there, and nothing worked as well as this one!</li>
            <li> right before going out in the cold.</li>
            <li> Usually my hands are dry and cracked this time of year.  </li>
            <li> the way ... no odor, and much less greasy than the majority of the products out there.  </li>
            <li> Later we found it difficult to locate locally.</li>
            <li> and my hands are healed and no greasy mess,</li>
            <li> I used 3 times a day and my hands healed in less then a week, I still use it everyday to prevent it from happening again, I won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> I tried to find the product locally but was not successful.</li>
            <li> had a genious idea of looking for a little \\&quot;scooper\\&quot; type thing to scoop&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li> Soooo if you need a little scooper tool for anything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other products in the past and this product tops them all.  </li>
            <li> but it feels a little sticky after applying to hands.</li>
            <li> Frequent hand washing, combined with the winter weather, makes my hands very dry, painful and rough.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using this cream, his hands are no longer cracked or bleeding.  </li>
            <li> just a few applications of working hands</li>
            <li> It is not uncommon for the skin on my fingertips to crack and bleed, despite the fact that I put lotion on my hands regularly.  </li>
            <li> Healing takes place within a few days.</li>
            <li> it out with my fingers becomes a messy and product loss experience</li>
            <li> A waste of $$.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone who suffers from cracks in fingers.</li>
            <li> After a few applications all was healed &amp; no more bleeding.</li>
            <li> I live in a cold Northeast climate and have suffered forever with cracked skin on my fingertips.</li>
            <li> Over the past 18 months I applied antibiotic ointment covered with Band-Aids trying to resolve the issue of cracked skin on my hands and fingers.</li>

            <li> and they hurt and are slow to heal.  </li>
            <li> Digging the nails into it / the fingers into it feels messy and uncomfortable.</li>

            <li> Nothing wrong with that</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> It arrived the day I had finished some automotive work that left my hands in terrible shape.</li>

            <li> This stuff works VERY well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> This product, “Working Hands” (WH) is absolutely wonderful. It is hard to say enough good about it. Over the past 18 months I applied antibiotic ointment covered with Band-Aids trying to resolve the issue of cracked skin on my hands and fingers. Actually, I used over 700 Band-Aids on hands and fingers during this time trying to heal the cuts. (I remember this since the boxes contain 100 Band-Aids per box. I spent around $90 on Band-Aids not including the cost for the ointments.) While this method healed the cuts (or splits) the problem would be back in a week or less as soon as the covering was removed. Over this time I heard about WH. I tried to find the product locally but was not successful. Then, I ordered Working Hands from Amazon. I found that there was a slight stinging (if the cut or split was fairly new) when I applied WH but it lasted only a minute or less. The WH is not greasy at all. Depending on how much you apply, it may not dry in a few seconds but I continue to rub my hands together and the WH dries quickly and is NOT greasy. One of the worse problems with most creams and ointments is that after putting it on your hands they will be greasy which is a real problem (for me). The WH feels great on your hands and almost like a small amount of dry powder after it dries. Remarkably within 10 days my hands were healed! I could not be more pleased with this product. Since the healing of my hands occurred about a month ago a couple of tiny splits have reoccurred but that is my fault for not applying WH more often. (I am sure that a lot of my problem occurred because my hands were in water often.) I have around 10 different containers of various creams and ointments (some were prescription medicines) that have been used to try and resolve this problem but nothing works like WH, period! I strongly recommend this product to anyone who is having a problem like I experienced. I think you’ll be glad you did. I spent money going to a Demonologist about my situation about seven months into the problem. As a result of the doctor’s visit a prescription was issued that was very greasy and did nothing to resolve the issue. Actually, I wasted money on the doctor when I could have spent a few dollars for a real cure. Today I’m ordering four more containers of WH since I’ll have this product around for many years. By the way, I only used 1.25 containers of WH to totally resolve my problems with my split skin on my hands and fingers; complete healing was realized very quickly as mentioned above.ation about seven months into the problem.

            <li> My thumbs no longer split, this is the only hand cream I will use all winter.</li>
            <li> It truly moisturize your skin. I bought them for my son who builds fences. It helped alot. I went fishing this last weekend and forgot to put sunscreen on the first day. Then the next morning, I ended up pouring coffee on my hand. Ouch!! I used the cream on everything and so far I am not peeling, although it still hurts.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream for extremely dry and cracked hands!  Almost instant healing after first application.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands and have tried a lot of different creams and lotions over the years. O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This is by far the greatest product for dry skin on the market. I live in a cold Northeast climate and have suffered forever with cracked skin on my fingertips. This cream has absolutely eliminated the problem. Period. I love it. Will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> Have used it pretty regularly for about six weeks and have very good results to date.</li>
            <li> I work outside six days a week and this is the only thing I use at the end of the day to keep my hands from cracking and bleeding.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I give one of these to each of my son inlaws and they all love it as much as I do. Great for keeping my hands from getting over dry while I&#x27;m knitting. And for those who work outside too.</li>
            <li> I have struggled for a long time to find a hand cream that was not greasy, heal my hands from cracking and peeling, and at a reasonable price.  This has been the best product I have found.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase and will continue to buy</li>
            <li> So great! I always get cracked skin on each side of my fingernails in the winter. No longer. This is a terrific product to prevent the cracking.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I suffer from cracks in my fingers every winter, right along my nails and they hurt and are slow to heal.  This helps enormously.  I like that it is not greasy.  For those of &amp;#34;a certain age&amp;#34; you will know what I am talking about when I say it has the texture of Noxzema, but is very much better stuff than that.  Also it does not smell.  I put some of the foot cream on my dogs foot pads, he had very dry and rough pads from walking on snow and ice for the past couple of weeks and after only one day I noticed a big improvement.  Since it absorbs very quickly and is non greasy I don&#x27;t worry about him tracking it over the carpet.  I love it and intend to keep it around my house at all times.</li>
            <li> I use this almost nightly and feel it&#x27;s one of the best. Hands are exposed to grease, oil, and other debris during the day at work and between the chemicals and the excessive washing to get clean my hands really dry out (way worse when the temperatures drop in the winter too)</li>
            <li> O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream, 3.4 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 28, 2013....(Original Review)&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered from cracked, painful, fingertips for a long&lt;br /&gt;time. I have used \\&quot;liquid bandage\\&quot; religiously to temporarily&lt;br /&gt;fill in the crack&#x27;s only to cringe in pain from applying this&lt;br /&gt;liquid cement. I was told to \\&quot;just try this\\&quot; (O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s) and&lt;br /&gt;see what happens...it&#x27;s says to use sparingly..but I applied&lt;br /&gt;a little extra to soak in, applying \\&quot;everynight before bed\\&quot; and&lt;br /&gt;after 1 week of using, well... to my \\&quot;disbelief\\&quot;, I can now&lt;br /&gt;say..I&#x27;m crack FREE....this product really works....I buy 2 at&lt;br /&gt;a time to keep extra so I can keep my hands from ever&lt;br /&gt;cracking again....don&#x27;t let the other reviews keep you from&lt;br /&gt;trying this product...it&#x27;s guaranteed to work or money back&lt;br /&gt;from the company......my hands thank you....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UpDate:&lt;br /&gt;Sept 30th 2013...&lt;br /&gt;Friends, I continue to use this product everyday(night)and I&lt;br /&gt;have been ordering when needed. My fingertips are crack free&lt;br /&gt;and cannot tell you how relieved I am of this painful condition.&lt;br /&gt;You simply have to try this and give it a chance to work. For&lt;br /&gt;the best results, work cream into your finger tips, apply extra&lt;br /&gt;for really dry hands and here is the key to having crack free&lt;br /&gt;finger tips.... Use every night before going to bed...&lt;br /&gt;It truly works for me..</li>
            <li> Wish I knew about this sooner. Stops cracked hands. Really protects your skin. Strange texture at first but really works.</li>
            <li> I just love this cream.  It works really well and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone with dry hands.</li>
            <li> Magic Stuff. Wow, is the word that comes to mind. This has really helped my wife&#x27;s hands. I have been using it too. And I&#x27;m enjoying the fact that her hands are healing and mine feel soft which is a plus in the winter months. Well worth the money and the package arrived fast. I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this at all. I will buy more to give to friends. Thank you from both of us.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product. My hands work hard on a cattle farm so they were cracked, calloused, and rough, that is till I used O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s. I have tried every hand cream known to man from the cheap to the ultra expensive. Nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to this product. Buy it, you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Very helpful items:  hands and feet are much softer.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Doesn&#x27;t help like expected.</li>
            <li> Great product. tremendous value. A very effective hand moisturizer and keeps hands from drying out.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and it works great</li>
            <li> My brother is a trucker and his hands get really dry. He&#x27;s tried a lot of lotions that did nothing.  I ordered this for him and he really liked it so I got him some more.</li>
            <li> Less greasy and MORE effective.  I just put it on at night and wake up with less cracks and irritation from dry work hands.</li>
            <li> Best stuff on the market if you have fingers that the skin splits in the winter.  Haven&#x27;t found anything better or a better price</li>
            <li> Really works on dry, cracked skin. Definitely does the trick after years of searching for a greaseless remedy. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice hand cream.  My husband still gets split skin late in the winter and this cream tends to help but not at 100%.</li>
            <li> I am an elementary art teacher who washes my hands no less then 15 times just between the school hours of 7-3, not to mention when cooking, cleaning, etc at home.  I love this cream to keep my hands from splitting and bleeding, especially in the winter when I am out at recess duty daily for almost an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother who is a barber, causing her to have her hands in water all day also uses this cream.  She swears it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s found in her 35 year quest!</li>
            <li> my husband loves this stuff</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing.  My son&#x27;s hands were cracked so badly they were bleeding.  Within a few days of using this cream, his hands are no longer cracked or bleeding.  If this worked for him, it will work great for you!</li>
            <li> this will be the hand cream I use the rest of my life. It works wonders on dry abused hands</li>
            <li> the best stuff of all</li>
            <li> Wow.. This cream really works.  It basically&lt;br /&gt;cured my dry, cracking hands</li>
            <li> Amazing product. My hands used to crack and bleed several times a week. I tried all sorts of lotions but nothing worked. I&#x27;ve been using Working Hands Cream daily for months now and my hands haven&#x27;t cracked or bled at all since I started using this.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Very good moisturizer that does not leave your hands feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for four days, but my very dry, cracked hands are already crack free. This cream really helps on the fingertips. It does require you to work it in quit a bit, and use just a bit extra between your fingers. The jar says that a little goes a long way, and they are not kidding! I made the mistake of putting way too much on the first time, and my hands felt like they were coated in plastic, like I had been playing with crayons all day. This is a great value!</li>
            <li> Great for chapped hands! It works overnight to soften and heal cracks.</li>
            <li> For years my husband has had a problem with his hands drying and cracking especially in the winter months. This has been the ONLY product that has helped him. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Great pricing and service. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Product works great. Have been using for a while now. Fast shipping with no problems.</li>
            <li> This stuff has saved my hands for years.  Need to use more than once a day though in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I work in a restaurant and my hands are always in gloves and water and being washed with soap.  They crack, bleed,split wide open and peel as they heal.  Extremely hot water was the only thing that made them stop hurting believe it or no !!!etc...I couldn&amp;#34;t make a fist because the cracks and cuts would bleed and hurt.  I saw the commercial on tv and as a last resort tried it.  Best thing I ever did!!!! Creams and meds from the doctors wouldn&#x27;t work even with steroids in it.  WORKING HANDS ROCKS !!!!!!!!!!!!  THANK YOU !!!!!!  I have recomended it to everyone that I know.  My co-workers are hooked on it also.</li>
            <li> This cream is great and helps heal some major cracks and dry skin. It is very soothing also. I would recommend this hand cream to anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It works great for hands that are dry and chapped because of winter weather.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff that really works.</li>
            <li> My hubby has cracked hands from working with paper.  The paper dust really dries out his hands and then they crack.  We tried O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s cream.  It did work initially, but after a while, his hands adjusted and the crack returned.  We will try it again.</li>
            <li> very good product, I use it on my heels and I shared a container of it with a friend...</li>
            <li> I work in a laboratory, and wash my hands over a dozen times a day.  Every winter I have to put up with cracked/bleeding knuckles and dry hands as a result.  I tried this product this winter, and for the first time in 15 years, NO Problems!  A little of this goes a long way, and one tub has lasted me for months, and still is over 3/4 full.  There is no smell like most of the lotions out there, and I found I didn&#x27;t mind using this more often as a result of that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also given a tub of this to my son, who has eczema on his hands, and always ends up with cracked skin from that as well.  Using this once nightly over the winter saved him from that issue this year.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great for cracked hands. I&#x27;m always washing something and bleach can sure mess ur hands up. My husband does a lot if work with his hands and they look like they&#x27;ve been chewed up there so rough. He loves this cream , it helps better then any we&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li> Working Hands is the only product that helps heal my hands. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing since sliced bread. I have severe dry hands that crack and itch. In one day I noticed a difference. By the fourth day they were fantastic. Thanks working hands.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal for chapped and overworked hands. Makes finger splits from brake fluid and battery acid heal up fast. Good for anything on your body that relates to dry skin and chafing.  Great product.</li>
            <li> not greasy and dries quick.  I like this product since i don&#x27;t use hand cream all the time this is great.</li>
            <li> It works for all your skin problems,I originally bought it just to try not believing that it was different then others including prescription creams ,but I was quickly made a believer</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream on the market</li>
            <li> O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s is the best moisturizer you can get.  Created for \\&quot;working hands\\&quot; and it works as promised.  I work for the phone company and my guys come in with dry chapped hands from working with cable and solvents all day and I recommend O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s to them.  Add to it the deal that is listed here for a four pack for the price of one.  No lids but who cares.  Store it in a small food container.</li>
            <li> Very good the best for dry skin</li>
            <li> The picture has lids. I got 4 &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34; bottoms. My husband opened one before I saw what came or this would have been returned post-haste. You don&#x27;t want to buy this unless you don&#x27;t care if it dries out.</li>
            <li> This hand cream keeps your hand for getting dry and splitting, I work with mail and cardboard so my hand get pretty dry, this helps a lot. cheaper to buy in bulk, stuff last for ever, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hand cream. It works.</li>
            <li> The O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream is the best for dry skin.  My husband is the user of this product and he has tried close to every kind of lotions, creams, etc...but this product is the best we have found.  He has been using this product for four months and his hands are no longer dry and rough.  He even uses this on his legs and torso.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my daughters cracked heels. I&#x27;ve reordered twice.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for a couple years now, and I love it.  And this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Love this product my Aunt has Diabetes and her skin is peeling off of her hands she uses this and her skin is healing and I have very dry skin and it helps my skin.  My son had a patch of dry skin on his leg I used on that it went away.  Also ordering on here for the 4 pack was way cheaper than in the store I think it is the same price for 1 in BB&amp;B..</li>
            <li> My hands are always cracking from doing dishes or just from general hand washing that is associated with having little kids. This is the only product that works. It is almost like a miracle how fast it heals my hands!</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband his hands seem to dry out and crack so matter what he does so I saw this in an ad and thought we would try it. Works really well glad we bought the 4 pack mostly cause we have already lost one. lol.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream; it&#x27;s especially helpful in the winter. Goes on without being greasy, and lasts until you wash your hands.</li>
            <li> Best product ever!!!! My husband tried everything on the market including prescription hand creams but nothing worked. I ordered some of this for him to try. It WORKS!!!! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Have shared with family.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin extremely HAPPY! I can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff, it&#x27;s great for your face, but keep it out of your eyes it may sting.. the only complaint I have on it it&#x27;s kinda sticky on the skin, I don&#x27;t quite like the texture, but once I put it on my skin instantly relaxes, it&#x27;s my new favorite skin product.</li>
            <li> I get pretty gnarly hangnails if I&#x27;m not careful, and by putting this stuff on at night before bed, my hands heal completely in like 48 hours. Thus stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> ...until my wife brought one home day.  I had cracks and sores around the cuticles for almost all my life.  Found this to be the best deal on all of Amazon.  They are right... two or three applications a day and it takes just a little bit and in less than a week you will have better hands.  I have tried everything including the product for healing feet and they didn&#x27;t help as much as O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s.  Odorless and non-greasy (if you thoroughly rub it in).  GET IT! IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> We have bought Working Hands Cream for several years.  But we&#x27;re always giving them away to people in need!  It was great to buy four.  It really works.  We take it when we travel, you never know what the climate may do to your hands.</li>
            <li> I thought it would make a dramatic difference in three days like others had written but not so.  I am happy to report that daily use after two weeks has made the dramatic difference and I will coninue use and certainly recommend it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have a dry hands problem.  O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream works better than the prescription drug that the doctor gave me and is a lot cheaper.  It contains a wax that helps prevent the skin from drying out.  Buy in by the four pack, it is cheaper than the one each price.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hands from cracking and bleeding!  My family likes it so I buy it for them to use daily.</li>
            <li> I have  very dry skin...Dry to the point that the ends of my fingers sometimes  bleed.  Winter is the most difficult season but the problem is always somewhat present.  The O&#x27;Keeffe Working Hands Cream is a wonderful help  One application in the morning and my hands are smooth/soft for 8-10 hours.  A real plus, there is no smell and it rubs in quickly.</li>
            <li> If you work with your hands, you NEED this stuff. I mix some Neosporine with it when I have skin cracks or small cuts, it helps healing quickly.</li>
            <li> I wash my alot and they were cracking &amp; bleed.  After a few applications all was healed &amp; no more bleeding.</li>
            <li> This working hands product is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever used on my hands. My hands dry and crack frequently and just a few applications of working hands and my hands are healed and no greasy mess, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> good cream for dry hands</li>
            <li> I have a problem with splitting sore finger tips every year once the weather turns cold for the winter. This cream has helped me to heal quicker and the relief is welcome. It really makes a big difference with continued use.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest feel but it works well enough.</li>
            <li> For hands in water all day, this is the best treatment for dry, cracked skin. The difference is almost instant!</li>
            <li> Works good my husbands hands were really rough so he uses this every night a now they are much smoother</li>
            <li> Really works great on my hand but you need to use it on a regular basis. It is available in many place now. Wal-Mart, hardware stores, drug stores so give it a try.</li>
            <li> Working hands works very well for overly worked and very dry hands. I and my husband have recommended Working hands to others and they have the same high praise for this product. I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Leaves a residue on your hands which &amp;#34;transfers&amp;#34; to objects such as your cell phone glass or a magazine. Doesn&#x27;t appear to be any better than other hand creams/lotions.</li>
            <li> Great product, keeps hands from chapping yet it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 15 years or more, best thing I ever did for my hands.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I work very aggressively with my hands all year long, and I pay for it during the winter months.  It is not uncommon for the skin on my fingertips to crack and bleed, despite the fact that I put lotion on my hands regularly.  I have tried everything under the sun to address this problem (Eucerin, Bag Balm, etc), and nothing worked, that is, until I tried Working Hands.  Last winter was the first time in a number of years where I actually managed to go without skin problems on my hands, and not coincidentally it is the first year that I used Working Hands from start to finish.  In the meantime, my wife, who has as her most aggressive winter activity typing on her laptop, had dried and cracked skin on her hands.  She too is now a convert to Working Hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way ... no odor, and much less greasy than the majority of the products out there.  Even my six-year old loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I has ever found for curing dry hands. After 30 years in the food service profession my hands feel as soft as they did when I wad much younger.</li>
            <li> I have found O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s to be the best cream, for sore, dry, cracked fingers. My hands are usually in water/soap, as I clean houses. I work it into my hands  at bedtime. In this area, only farm supply or hardware stores carry it, and the price is $7.95 to $8.95 a jar. Its much cheaper to buy it this way, in a 4 pack. O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s also makes a foot cream, in a blue container. Its good too.</li>
            <li> Originally we found this product quite by accident at a Home Depot. We picked one up and used it to help with dry, cracking &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; hands. It helped quite a bit. Later we found it difficult to locate locally. Amazon to the rescue. Not only could I find it, but at much better pricing. This is definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> It works on dry and cracked skin the best I have ever used.My husband and I both use it, I have a skin problem which leaves my hands cracked and a scale on them it clears it up fast.</li>
            <li> Made my weather cracked hands heal and they are now soft again.</li>
            <li> Great hand cream.  Not greasy, very long lasting.  No unpleasant odor.  In fact no odor at all. Good job O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I tried EVERYTHING for my husband&#x27;s rough, cracking, splitting, dry hands. He&#x27;s a farmer so his hands take a beating. Picked this up on a whim, and it&#x27;s been the only thing that keeps his hands from cracking and bleeding! It&#x27;s a must have item in our house.</li>
            <li> I clean houses, and always suffer from dry, cracked hands in the winter, someone suggested O&#x27;Keefe&lt;br /&gt;s and it&#x27;s a miracle, keeps my hands smooth and they never split.  Love it, buy it by the 4 pack!  Have told everyone about it, it&#x27;s the best product for problem hands.</li>
            <li> My husband and I heard a commercial for Working Hands on 55KRC in Cincinnati while we were out delivering newspapers.  I have had issues with dry hands for years and working with newspapers everyday has also caused my husband&#x27;s hands to become dry and cracked.  We ordered Working Hands from Amazon, (4-pack, 3.4 oz each), and have been amazed at the results.  Normally at this time of year I would be covering my fingers with bandages because of the skin separating and bleeding.  I&#x27;m happy to report that is no longer the case.  Working Hands Cream is &#x27;working&#x27; great for me!  My husband was holding my hand the and was amazed at the difference.  I think &#x27;silky&#x27; was the word he used to describe my skin.  We purchased Working Hands Cream for both of our parents this Christmas and also we are telling everyone at the newspaper about it.  Thank-you for making winter less painful.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;I first bought 2 at the drug store (1 for home and 1 for the office)&lt;br /&gt;This purchase was because I used them completely.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have 1 for home, the office and the car.&lt;br /&gt;We have had days over 90 degrees (inside car temps were probably over 110) and its consistency remains exactly the same as in the air conditioned spaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;ll warn you about is: Don&#x27;t use too much. If you apply too much you may not like it. Using the right amount it is the best. I have used Corm Husker&#x27;s Lotion for decades. Nothing wrong with that but O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Working Hands is better.</li>
            <li> This hand cream has worked wonders for my boyfriend. He constantly has cracked and dry hands from lacing up his hockey skates. It is a bit greasy when you first put it on but once it has soaked in there isn&#x27;t a problem with it. It will sting for a bit if your hands are cracked but after a minute or two your hands feel better. Also, it has a fairly neutral smell to it. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a good smell, I prefer a more fragrant one, but my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t mind the smell (or lack thereof) at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for anyone who hasn&#x27;t had the best of luck with all the other intense, deep moisture, extreme healing lotions you can buy at Walgreens/Walmart etc. It&#x27;s the best we&#x27;ve found, short of a dermatologist prescription lotion.</li>
            <li> This really works great</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff.  I use it daily.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is amazing. It really does eliminate cracked skin. I also use it on my lips to help when they are chapped!</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!  A product that actually does what it says!  2 years I have been using it, all year round,  great for cracked hands in winter, and dried out gardening hands in the summer.  I have a tub with me at all times and in several rooms of the house.  Always available for a quick swipe to keep my hands pain free .</li>
            <li> Usually my hands are dry and cracked this time of year.  Since I have been usung this product my hands are soft and free of cracks.</li>
            <li> I like this cream as much as the O&#x27;Keefes foot cream</li>
            <li> It does not have any smell, is not greasy and leaves no coloring on my hands. This great product has replaced any expensive topical cream moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used on my Psoriasis condition on the top of my hands, ankles and forearms. It does not help with the itching right away but after 20 minutes the itch is gone and does not return for many hours. The effected areas are now softer and more supple, redness is gone and open cracks around my knuckles now heal really fast. I bought 4 containers and get more than 5 month&#x27;s use out of each container. I keep one in my car and another in my coat pocket in the winter. I can&#x27;t praise this product enough! BEST-BEST-BEST is all I can say.  5 stars!</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say on this one. High quality lotion that helps creat a barrier between your skin and whatever you&#x27;re working with (in my case medical gloves). My hands were highly sensitive to both the material and lack of airflow that cause them to sweat. I had severe irritation and pain until I started using this. A little goes a long way and it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a very good thing, I really like it, then I still need me will come again very good</li>
            <li> for rough dry hands-working hands is absolutely the only thing that works for dry-rough hands.the moisture lasts all day long..</li>
            <li> Great stuff. It really does what it says for your hands!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! I have tried every single Hand Cream available and nothing works except O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s. You cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I only had 3 fingers that were NOT bleeding. After using 3 times a day for 1 week all of my fingers were sealed, and after 1 month they were like new. Now I only use it before bed 2 or 3 times a week and never have any problems with split finger tips or pain.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product I can get my hands on .. pun intended ... to stop my fingers from cracking and splitting and heal them quickly.  This stuff is amazing.  Hands down (yes, pun) the best I have found.  Incredible stuff.  My hands thank you!</li>
            <li> best stuff on earth. worked where many other products which cost more did not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products with mixed results....BUT almost every one leaves my hands greasy, not this product. Works great and no greasy residue...</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on the palms of my hands and before trying working hands, they would crack and bleed. Since using working hands, my hands stay soft and no longer crack or bleed. Great product. Would recommend this to mechanics or anyone with very dry hands.</li>
            <li> I have been enduring dry hands with split fingertips and bleeding sores for a number of years. I had seen this product advertised before, but was reluctant to try it.&lt;br /&gt;This year has been especially bad for my hands. Working as a nurse, I wash my hands frequently. The result was very dry skin that made performing my job duties difficult.&lt;br /&gt;My wife saw ads for Working hands cream and urged me to try it. I found it on Amazon and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;My first order was for 2 containers. I ordered it on Friday and received it on Monday. I started using it that night. I have one container that I take to work and use several times between hand washings.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed results within the first 2 days. My hands did not hurt and burn. The smaller splits were disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;It has now been 2 weeks. I have no more splits. I have not had any new ones appear. I have ordered more to make sure I get through the rest of the winter.</li>
            <li> For Everyone&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that the book showcases professional artists and a wide variety of styles.  It is a good teaching tool</li>
            <li> This is the only product we&#x27;ve found that works on my husband&#x27;s hands.  He swears by it and has been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Where on God&#x27;s fine and green earth has this hand cream been hiding from me ??  This is as-good-as-it-gets believe me.  WONDERFUL .. FIVE STARS .. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for years, he loves it!!  According to him there&#x27;s nothing like it.  The deal with the 4-pack was such a good deal.  Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Only cream we have found to help my husband&#x27;s dry, cracked hands. He uses it daily!</li>
            <li> very good. not oily but very moist</li>
            <li> Product was as described</li>
            <li> Bought these for my brother, as he works in a warehouse and his hands were in horrible shape. They were dry and cracked, even though he uses hand lotion. This worked wonders and within a couple of weeks, his hands looked SO much better. My father-in-law also uses this and gives positive feedback, so I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Not greasy, waterproof, lasts through the day. Compare at $10 a jar at drug stores.</li>
            <li> It is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> this is the best hand, face,  and all over cream for cracked, dry skin.  nothing else even compares to it.</li>
            <li> very happy...no problems...thank you...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Better than any other hand cream.</li>
            <li> My husbands hands get dry and crack to the point of bleeding over the winter. This is really the only thing that helps him without making his hands feel super greasy. We always buy it in bulk and amazon usually has the best price!</li>
            <li> great stuff - and my wife used hundreds of things first.</li>
            <li> Product came when it was suppose to and is amazingly effective...my hands feel so much better!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff WORKS great.  I am an office pusher for the most part, but do masonry and tile work on the side.  My hands dry out quickly and I get those cracks at end of fingertips which is PAINFUL.  this stuff does not sting when you apply it and w/in two days healing begins and pain is gone</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! High quality product! It works pretty good for my dry hand and cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Good product ... Not greasy and helps prevent those nasty cracked finger tips in the winter dry air.</li>
            <li> My son in law loves loves loves this .....he&#x27;s an electrician &amp; his hands take a beating....</li>
            <li> You HAVE to try this &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;.  If my hands are dry, I apply once and it lasts several days until I need more.  I handwash 30+  times a day and have my hands in dishwater constantly.  Try it!  it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and item works great.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the BEST hand cream for working people.  Helps to heal chapped skin and heal minor cuts and scratches.  I highly recommend this product if you work outdoors or work with your hands.  Works good on feet too.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my cracked hands and this is far and away the best product!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY 5TH ORDER---NEED I SAY MORE---IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> Okay hand cream but not exceptional</li>
            <li> love this stuff works great</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a great value.</li>
            <li> the only thing that works for winter, dry cracked hands...</li>
            <li> great cream as advertice</li>
            <li> awesome, and good for my nails too!</li>
            <li> Amazing so much better than moisturizer</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have been dealing with hands that look like they belong to an 80-yr-old for the past several winters. With two young children, I am constantly washing my hands. I switch between this product and Aquaphor at night. While I think the Aquaphor may work a little better, I like that this is less greasy and I can touch the sheets relatively soon after putting this on without worrying about staining them. I also have a steroid cream from the dermatologist, but I feel as if my routine works just as well.</li>
            <li> works wonders on my dry hands</li>
            <li> Great products! I love Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Relieves cracking and keeps hands feeling great.  It lasts a long time, as just a bit is needed with each application.  I would highly recommend this product fro anyone with finger that crack in dry condition, especially as winter approaches and the furnace zaps all moister from the air inside one&#x27;s home.</li>
            <li> Works great! I am a mechanic and wash my hands with harsh soap several times a day. They get really dry, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not working as well as description indicated.  My hands continue to be dry and cracked and splitting even though I put the cream on 3-4 times a day.  I would have put it on more frequently, but it leaves an uncomfortable texture/feeling on my hands.</li>
            <li> best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This stuff saves my hands in the winter.  And because of it&#x27;s nearly solid state you can put it in your handbag and not worry about it accidentily opening and ruining everything inside.</li>
            <li> The only hand cream I have found that  keeps my hands from drying out and cracking during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Really works fast ... Smile as that I had ruff very VERY ruff elbows and it works last for days worked fast with in 3 uses I had smooth soft elbows</li>
            <li> This is the only hand moisturizer I use anymore since I discovered it. It does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, works good on face too but, a bit tacky feeling.</li>
            <li> The 4 pack I received was actually 4 individual packages. This stuff is as advertised. I use it several times a day. Non-greasy and works itself in well. After two weeks, all my cracks in my fingertips are now gone. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife and i both work extensively with our hands.  This stuff really works well, use it everyday, keeps our hand from cracking and drying out.  If your hands do get a crack on the corner by your nail, this cream seems to speed up the healing process.....</li>
            <li> Best hand lotion I&#x27;ve EVER used.  I live in Utah and the winters get extremely dry and harsh, resulting in cracked and bleeding knuckles.  After a week of using, those issues are completely gone.  I have purchased this repeatedly.  I love the non-greasy feel as well.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my hands from getting dry and cracked. If you have dry cracked skin this will definitely help them heal fast.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hands feel after applying this cream.  It makes them soft and smooth, relieves irritation around cuticles and prevents cracking.  Only a little cream goes a long way!</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this for me. It arrived the day I had finished some automotive work that left my hands in terrible shape. I tried it and the results were remarkable. Not only were the immediate results outstanding there was also a lasting effect. I am 66 years old and have always engaged in work that was drying to the hands. I have tried everything. This is the best yet. I normally do not endorse products but will for Working Hands Cream because I think it will work for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s te only cream that actually works. It&#x27;s a Godsend. I&#x27;ve tried other costly brands but they could never clear up my dry skin. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> My family and I love this stuff!  We couldn&#x27;t recommend it enough!  We tried every other product out there, and nothing worked as well as this one!</li>
            <li> I would give this 10 stars if I could because it is just that great. Frequent hand washing, combined with the winter weather, makes my hands very dry, painful and rough. Right before bedtime I just dab a bit of this cream on my hands and gently rub it in, and my hands instantly feel smoother. And the smoothness last for several days, so I don&#x27;t have to reapply the cream every night. This is really fantastic cream!</li>
            <li> Works great!! I&#x27;m a letter carrier and was looking for something that actually works.</li>
            <li> For the first time in years we are in December and I have no cracks or cuts in my skin.  My skin feels smooth and comfortable.  I use it for both feet and hands.  It works!</li>
            <li> REALLY works, no joke!</li>
            <li> very good stuff plus you can&#x60;t beat the price.you save over 2.00 dollars then going into a retailer it worth it plus work great on your hands with no smell to it .</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing for healing dry hands and cracks-- non sticky, non greasy.  Highly recommend to anyone who suffers from cracks in fingers. Healing takes place within a few days.</li>
            <li> A great hand cream. I keep this with me everywhere I go. I live in the mountains of Utah and play outdoors all year round. This product absorbs into my skin nicely and keeps my skin healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  However it really needs to come in a tube!&lt;br /&gt;works great for crows feet, dry heals, dry hands --- as a whole body cream.&lt;br /&gt;Do not spread it all over your face however it isn&#x27;t made for that.&lt;br /&gt;No smell, feels a little waxy at first but soaks in well.  I&#x27;ll use it&lt;br /&gt;all winter long to stay soft and stop winter itch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However.......this will be a huge help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it doesn&#x27;t come in a tube form (it did but no longer does now)&lt;br /&gt;go look at \\&quot;Gingo Le Prix Butter Spreaders\\&quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; on amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Here is my review of the spreaders (or scoopers) and if you love this cream and are&lt;br /&gt;sick and tired of getting it all stuck under your fingernails(long) ladies... follow my&lt;br /&gt;lead here and scoop it out with these great little scoopers instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love these little (what I call) scoopers. I use a product called&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;working hands\\&quot; which is a miracle cream (you can look it up on amazon.)&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it only comes in a canister and I have long fingernails so&lt;br /&gt;digging it out with my fingers becomes a messy and product loss experience&lt;br /&gt;(too much of it under my nails - which are my real nails by the way). Anyway...&lt;br /&gt;I had a genious idea of looking for a little \\&quot;scooper\\&quot; type thing to scoop&lt;br /&gt;out the cream with and this is it! I keep \\&quot;working hands\\&quot; in my car, bathroom,&lt;br /&gt;at work and in the kitchen so I needed 4 scoopers. These 4 work great. I love&lt;br /&gt;the yellow - I can quickly find the scooper. When I want to use \\&quot;working hands\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I grab my yellow scooper and scoop out the amount of cream I want...then apply&lt;br /&gt;it to my body with the yellow scooper and rub it in. No more trying to dig&lt;br /&gt;cream out from under my nails. The yellow was a bright color - easy to spot&lt;br /&gt;in my purse/drawer wherever. Soooo if you need a little scooper tool for anything&lt;br /&gt;like that these are just long enough to hold and will last forever. Everyone asks&lt;br /&gt;me where I got it! Sorry if this didn&#x27;t help you in your search for perfect flatwear&lt;br /&gt;but if you asked me, these butter spreaders are really cute and would go with almost&lt;br /&gt;any diningroom decor. Very solid, very sturdy and beautiful (when clean!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product should come with something like these butter spreaders to apply it&lt;br /&gt;with!  Digging the nails into it / the fingers into it feels messy and uncomfortable.idn&#x27;t help you in your search for perfect flatwear&lt;br /&gt;but if you asked me, these butter spreaders are really cute and would go with almost&lt;br /&gt;any diningroom decor.

            <li> worked on hands overnight..really helped with cuts/dryness.</li>
            <li> Wife a medical professional and loves these!!!</li>
            <li> Working in food service, I wash my hands a lot. Using this daily has completely eliminated my cracked knuckles. Love it!</li>
            <li> my boyfriend suffers from extremely dry hands due to circulation disorder and this is one of the few items that softens and get moisture back into his skin quickly.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised if you apply it after each time you wash your hands. It sometimes leaves a bit of a &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling likely because of the paraffin that it contains for holding-in moisture. The product does not contain any perfume so it is essentially odorless after application. It&#x27;s probably better to apply a small amount to the hands and then add more if needed. A little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  This winter was rough on my husband&#x27;s and my hands and working hands cream does work hard to help with the dry, cracked fingers. Great product.</li>
            <li> super highly rated so I tried it.  not exactly what I am looking for but my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Where was this stuff all those years my family distributed newspapers?  I used to keep the &#x27;bandaid&#x27; company in business, I always had bandages on my fingers because of cracking from dryness.  This handcream really works, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and already see an improvement.  With buying the 4 pack I have one in the bathroom, bedroom, on my desk, and next to my TV viewing chair; there&#x27;s always one close by when I need it!  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> My hands get dry and peel, and my dad&#x27;s hands crack.  We both started using Working Hands, and we both feel a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries to a powder feel, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit does go a long way.  Just rub your fingers on it until a bit melts onto them.  Then rub it where you need it.  No need to dig into it.</li>
            <li> Healed my hands within days! I used 3 times a day and my hands healed in less then a week, I still use it everyday to prevent it from happening again, I won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> Living in Aspen, CO my hands are subject to extremely dry winter conditions which are rough on the hands.  In addition to that I work on salt water reef tanks which means my hands are in and out of salt water all day.  This makes for a nasty combo.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of other products in the past and this product tops them all.  I try to apply 3-4 times per day.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> My husband works at Starbucks and the constant washing of the hands in chemicals makes his hands extremely dry and cracked.  The first night he used it, the very next morning his hands were soft and supple.  Best product ever.</li>
            <li> This is the only hand cream that works on my hands, I have extremely dry hands in the winter, my finger tips split and bleed. I can hardly touch anything without severe pain. Working hands will clear up the cracks on my fingers within 10 days. You have to use it three or four times a day but, it will totally help clear up the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff. I have been using it for years, probably use 6 cans a year.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as his hands and a few other spots were very dry. he loves it and ask for more. I tried it and I had almost complete repair of dr hands after one use.</li>
            <li> Seems do be doing well to moisturize my dry hands so far</li>
            <li> My cracked and bleeding fingertips are totally healed, and my hands are very soft after using Working Hands for 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;I bought some cotton gloves at the drug store and wear them at night after applying the soothing cream.&lt;br /&gt;A truly fabulous product that does what is promised.</li>
            <li> I abuse my hands, have super sensitive skin, have too many years and then lamented that nothing worked because I couldn&#x27;t have the greasy slim on working hands.  I probably over applicate an hour before going to bed and that is enough to make my hands at least semi- human again.  Nothing else has ever given relief even close to this product.</li>
            <li> the wife loves it.It is hard to find in houston,so we order 3-4 each time.she uses both hand and feet.thanks</li>
            <li> My son is an auto mechanic and gets split skin.  This is the first winter he hasn&#x27;t had to suffer.  And the 4-pack is a great deal</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  My wife actually lets me touch her now. Never felt better.  Oh hands feel great too.  Awesome</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Solved the cracking and bleeding of my hands where all the prescription drugs the doctor gave me didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. My dad and husband both work with their hands and this really helps heal and protect their dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works great; items were packed well.</li>
            <li> My hands tend to get very dry, crack and bleed.  It can be painful.  Used regularly, this prevents my hands from becoming dry.  Wonderful product.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it!  So great to have in the winter time.</li>
            <li> No greasy feeling at all. soaks in good, smooth feeling to skin everyone in my house uses it. You should try it</li>
            <li> My auto-mechanic son says this is the only stuff that has really worked on his chapped and cracked hands.</li>
            <li> best product on the market for feet and hands</li>
            <li> I have had problems with finger skin cracking/splitting,in the winter, for 20 years and tried many creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream works wonders - started using it last winter and had no skin splits - None!!!  Can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much I love O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply a small amount of the cream,paying special attention to finger tips. Reapply throughout the day -especially right before going out in the cold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing we&#x27;ve found that helps our dry cracked hands in the winter.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Relieved the deep and painfull cracks in my fingers within days. Slept with cotton gloves over the lotion.</li>
            <li> greatest stuff for hands</li>
            <li> Housekept my hand soft n this cold Georgia winter</li>
            <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t really moisturize, it just sits on the skin.  A waste of $$.</li>
            <li> works good only reason I&#x27;, giving it a 4 is that sent 2.7 oz instead of 3.4</li>
            <li> I am a nurse my hands often crack &amp; bleed from all the hand washing. I find that this really helps &amp; only requires a small amount. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Healed my husband&#x27;s cracked hands and fingers in 2 nights.  We immediately bought 4 to last us through the winter.</li>
            <li> I really like the product. I was disappointed though when I opened the box and saw four 2.7oz cans when they were suppose to be 3.4oz. Product I would rate 5 star but discription of product I give 3.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and they work great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this cream works, but it sure does!  I suffered from those pesky cuts on my thumbs all summer.  I saw an ad on TV about O&#x27;Keeffee&#x27;s and ran to my computer to see if Amazon carried it. And sure enough it was there!  After a couple of applications the cuts began to heal and I was cut free all winter!  It&#x27;s truly amazing!  It works just as advertised!</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is that the product is advertised as 3.4 oz when it is actually 2.7 oz.</li>
            <li> This great product, and helps to heal the cracked skin on fingertips and feet.  Note that there is absolutely no need to buy a separate product for your feet-- this works fine for both.</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF.MY SCLERADERMA HANDS THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Does not burn on open cracks</li>
            <li> Really helps my dry hands.</li>
            <li> I like the foot cream better.  These works well too but it feels a little sticky after applying to hands.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. my entire family loves it and i give it as gifts</li>
            <li> The BEST out there!!!</li>
            <li> excellent hand cream if you do a lot with your hands. relieves  any damage</li>
            <li> My husband always had problems with his hands being a mechanic, but not any more.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream I will use.  It does actually heal.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I am a nurse so, of course, I wash my hands gazillions of times a day. This is the first and only hand cream that has ever made a difference. I order extra to give to other nurses. Love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and this is the only handcream that keeps my hands soft.  I have tried just about everything out there.  this is the best!</li>
            <li> Best product for dry hands I have EVER found!</li>
            <li> works like they say it will</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff. Works great!</li>
            <li> best stuff ever only had one split finger last year and it heal in a few days.  you need to keep some on when hands feel a little dry.  us about 7 or 8 times a day.  dose not take much.  can put it on at a red light and still grab the stearing wheel when light changes</li>
            <li> Excellent hand cream for the hard working men and women.  One of the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Gross. I threw mine away. When applied is seemed to never dry or absorb. Left my hands so sticky I could not take it anymore. Wasted them and then put on some normal hand lotion.</li>
            <li> Best stuff EVER for rough feet. Smooths them immediately and they stay smooth for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Love, it! Love it! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff.  Perhaps the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Finally! A product that backs up its claim to fame with results! This product is truly phenomenal. I have been searching for years and tried countless products in a vain attempt to discover the answer to my rough, dry and cracked hands. Working Hands literally works overnight. Apply before bedtime and you&#x27;ll be amazed at how smooth your skin is the very next morning. I&#x27;ve already ordered 4 more containers to have plenty on hand (no pun intended) and as gifts for friends and family who are desperate to find something to help with this age-old problem.</li>
            <li> Works great for my dry cracked fingers and hands</li>
