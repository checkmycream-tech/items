            <li>In my opinion this soap is on of the best on the market.</li>
            <li>and I LOVED it!</li>
            <li>It worked great for the bath products I was making for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the shower as shampoo and soap for the body and is great....</li>
            <li>This is a really great product.</li>
            <li>THAN IT DID IN MANY YEARS!!</li>
            <li>and it is good at cleansing....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell and good value soup.</li>
            <li>Love this amazing product!</li>
            <li>This has a pleasant smell &amp; feel, creates great suds, and works beautifully with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If that happens, I&#x27;ll make my own.</li>
            <li>It is a good healthy soap.</li>
            <li>It is has nice scent</li>
            <li>This product is just as good as the competition, but the price is much better.</li>
            <li>I bought this to start making my own shampoo</li>
            <li>It has a mild tea tree smell and is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This works great as a mild shampoo (4 oz castile soap, 4 oz water, 1/2 teaspoon olive oil).  </li>
            <li>AND MY HAIR LOOKS BETTER</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Soap.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has a more medicinal after note.  </li>
            <li>I like this soap and will probably switch to using it as most body washes on the market today are overpriced, overpackaged, overscented and leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I think it is interesting that you can also use this soap for laundry, but I have not tried that yet.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and love it.</li>
            <li>The tea tree variety says it is scented with Rosemary, but it smells more like a combination of Pine-sol and turpentine.  </li>
            <li>I Love this &amp;#34;bath product&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and I feel much better using this on the surfaces with which they come into contact.  </li>
            <li>I love this s product and use it all the time</li>
            <li>Love Dr. Woods soap.</li>
            <li>But have now found a better price.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was going to purchase more of Dr. Bronners Magic soap until I came across Dr.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff..</li>
            <li>love this soap .</li>
            <li>I got this soap and put it in a foaming soap dispenser diluted with water...and love it...</li>
            <li>If you are a camper, this soap works on your body, hair, dishes, laundry, car/boat, and is very ecologically safe.</li>
            <li>makes me feel very clean , and healthy.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need alot to work into a nice lather and it leaves you squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I also use it as a shampoo, it lathers up well and rinses out leaving my hair very clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Love the tingle and the clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>use it on my face and body , never dries me out , or leave me oily , the tea tree oil makes me feel , well , a healthy clean .</li>
            <li>clean is healthy .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using all of Dr. Woods products, they are gentle on skin and smell nice.</li>
            <li>Previously I had been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soap which is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>My family and I enjoy using this soap.  </li>
            <li>Tried this stuff as a slightly more economical substitute for Dr Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree soap.  </li>
            <li>Free shipping over $20</li>
            <li>great buy especially for the price</li>
            <li>With no solution available.</li>
            <li>I gave this a try and bought two more bottles (almond and peppermint) right away.  </li>
            <li>and i feel that my hands are really clean without  using the anti-bacterial materials.  </li>
            <li>I feel ultra clean and relaxed after I am finished with my bath.</li>
            <li>I also used a couple of ounces in a couple of gallons of water to clean the bathrooms and mop floors.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I cannot say for certain that Woods is actually more diluted than Bronner&#x27;s</li>
            <li>We love it and will continue to order this items, I am hoping the price stays reasonable too.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin nice and soft..</li>
            <li>At least as good as Bronners, and I love Bronners!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of much more expensive soap, but this stuff is the best!</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be ordering more when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>Woods soap is as good as Bronners if not better being that it is much more affordable.</li>
            <li>The price was better than Dr. Bonner&#x27;s and the product was just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t produce anywhere near as many suds</li>
            <li>Just as good as the competition, no real complaints.  </li>
            <li>I have had this problem most of my adult life.</li>
            <li>The scent, although distinctly Tea Tree, somehow has a slightly softer note which I find more appealing.  </li>
            <li>Good product wish shipping cost was less.</li>
            <li>I like castile soap but usually find tea tree to be too strong a scent, but this is nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they had enough consideration to package it plastic ziploc bags so that there would be no accidents even though the bottles are sealed under the cap; some places are careless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy and cheaper than major brand I bought in store.</li>
            <li>Have had other brands a bit more concentrated tea tree, but works well for shampoo/bathing and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>makes my skin soft  and hair clean.</li>
            <li>Up until now I have only used Dr. Bronners peppermint castile soap which is nice, but the mint oil leaves me feeling cold, great for summer, not so much for winter.</li>
            <li>It is a very invigorating soap.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>and we are, therefore, going through it about twice as fast as Bronner&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used this as a bubble bath a couple of times and it&#x27;s very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I found this product and it cleared up fast.</li>
            <li>Gets your hair nice and squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;No oily residue, you can feel that it doesn&#x27;t strip like some harsh silicone soaps.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and allowed me to use other scents if added with essential oil.</li>
            <li>I love Tea Products, but this doesn&#x27;t smell like any other product I use.  </li>
            <li>I alternate between this and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but this soap is better for the general purpose cleaning.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and my hair feels much healthier without all the harsh chemicals from other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I recommend caution around the eyes and mouth areas because of the tea tree oil, extra rinsing is advised to avoid very mild and short lived discomfort.</li>
            <li>The last thing I like about these more natural products is the lack of a five mile long ingredient list with unpronouncable chemical additives.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the other natural ingredients smooth things out.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s half filled with water and it works wonders.</li>
            <li>Made shampoo and my hair did not dry out as much as before.</li>
            <li>The slight scent that is left behind as it dries is much more pleasant than commercial household cleaning products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;And as far as that change of fragrance thing I mentioned?</li>
            <li>I was originally using Dr. Woods Pure Black Soap, but after exposure to a hazardous toxic mold environment at a hotel in AR (told they were newly renovated rooms, but found out 4 days later why I was getting so sick -- found all the very toxic molds behind the wallpapered areas in both rooms we were in) which resulted in very high mycotoxin levels (3 of the worse toxins you can have in your body), as well as being highly colonized with three fungal colonies found within me, I started to break out with live fungal sores all over my body, and since tree tea oil is very good for funguses, I started to use Dr. Woods Pure Tea Tree Castile Soap every day.  </li>
            <li>I might actually like it a little better for personal body care uses like washing and shampooing my hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oils from your hair like regular shampoos do, which contain detergents rather than natural soaps.</li>
            <li>All natural soap that does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Being a fan of tea tree oil I expected as much, and often being in a hurry liquid soap cuts shower time which also saves on water bills.</li>
            <li>My hair follicles produce too much oil and that other stuff.</li>

            <li> My hair follicles produce too much oil and that other stuff.</li>
            <li> If you are not sure you&#x27;ll like a scent, go for something safer and more common, such as lavender or almond.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I use it diluted in foaming soap bottles as handsoap, because it doesn&#x27;t dry my hand like SLS soap does.</li>
            <li> This soap will dry the hell out of your skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, this stuff is cheaper, especially if you are buying Bronner&#x27;s here on Amazon, but you could dilute it quite a bit before you got down to the strength of this Woods fellow.</li>
            <li> The smell is not intense, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It smells the way I expected it to being that it has tea tree oil in it..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this specific supplier&#x27;s Dr. Woods soap, but I&#x27;ve used Dr. Woods soap in the past and found no problem with the quality of the soap itself.</li>
            <li> At the time I bought this it was around 8 dollars, 1 dollar cheaper than the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s I usually get from my local Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I used that other doctor&#x27;s brand of liquid soap.  </li>

            <li> tea tree scent smells a bit like a wood-like medicine, which is expected, but unfortunately, Dr. Woods has less scent options than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s which is more expensive.</li>

            <li> If you have psoriasis, WORKS LIKE A DREAM AND MY HAIR LOOKS BETTER THAN IT DID IN MANY YEARS!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this specific supplier&#x27;s Dr. Woods soap, but I&#x27;ve used Dr. Woods soap in the past and found no problem with the quality of the soap itself. As for the supplier, they sent it and it was received without any problems or delays. I&#x27;m glad they had enough consideration to package it plastic ziploc bags so that there would be no accidents even though the bottles are sealed under the cap; some places are careless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tea tree scent smells a bit like a wood-like medicine, which is expected, but unfortunately, Dr. Woods has less scent options than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s which is more expensive. If you are not sure you&#x27;ll like a scent, go for something safer and more common, such as lavender or almond.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Soap. It has a mild tea tree smell and is a great moisturizer. I&#x27;ve used lots of much more expensive soap, but this stuff is the best! I will most definitely be ordering more when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  Previously I had been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soap which is an excellent product.  Unfortunately the prices have been going up.  After reading the information provided here about Dr. Woods and reading reviews, I decided to give it a try.  Glad I did.  I might actually like it a little better for personal body care uses like washing and shampooing my hair.  The scent, although distinctly Tea Tree, somehow has a slightly softer note which I find more appealing.  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has a more medicinal after note.  Perhaps the other natural ingredients smooth things out.  I&#x27;ll be buying this from now one unless they raise their prices too.  If that happens, I&#x27;ll make my own.</li>
            <li> Up until now I have only used Dr. Bronners peppermint castile soap which is nice, but the mint oil leaves me feeling cold, great for summer, not so much for winter. Woods soap is as good as Bronners if not better being that it is much more affordable. You don&#x27;t need alot to work into a nice lather and it leaves you squeaky clean. I recommend caution around the eyes and mouth areas because of the tea tree oil, extra rinsing is advised to avoid very mild and short lived discomfort. Being a fan of tea tree oil I expected as much, and often being in a hurry liquid soap cuts shower time which also saves on water bills. The last thing I like about these more natural products is the lack of a five mile long ingredient list with unpronouncable chemical additives. I like this soap and will probably switch to using it as most body washes on the market today are overpriced, overpackaged, overscented and leave me feeling greasy. I think it is interesting that you can also use this soap for laundry, but I have not tried that yet.</li>
            <li> My family and I enjoy using this soap.  We love it and will continue to order this items, I am hoping the price stays reasonable too.</li>
            <li> It works well, but the scent is less desirable than others out there. I use it as a body wash.</li>
            <li> This works great as a mild shampoo (4 oz castile soap, 4 oz water, 1/2 teaspoon olive oil).  It doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oils from your hair like regular shampoos do, which contain detergents rather than natural soaps.</li>
            <li> It is a very invigorating soap. I use it every day and love it.</li>
            <li> Worked well on my kids eczema skin.</li>
            <li> This soap was recommended to me by a medical person.  It was to be the answer to all the anti-bacterial soaps on the market..&lt;br /&gt;The soap smells wonderful......and it is good at cleansing.... but if you are used to smoothness; almost a lotion in your soap.....This is not it!!  I use it to wash my hands in the kitchen, when cooking.  I know it is cleansing and i feel that my hands are really clean without  using the anti-bacterial materials.  It is a good healthy soap.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for everything: washing clothes, floors, and even hair. It is has nice scent and you don&#x27;t need much. One bottle lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and bought this to see if it would be helpful. It has a tar like smell but doesn&#x27;t seem to linger. It does appear to be helping the redness and I do not have the break out I had. I also use it as a shampoo, it lathers up well and rinses out leaving my hair very clean feeling. My skin also does not feel dried out after I use it. I have been using this product for a month and am very happy with it and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It worked great for the bath products I was making for Christmas.  It smells really good and allowed me to use other scents if added with essential oil.</li>
            <li> At the time I bought this it was around 8 dollars, 1 dollar cheaper than the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s I usually get from my local Trader Joe&#x27;s. I figured I would try it for a change of fragrance, since peppermint is the only option over there.&lt;br /&gt;While I cannot say for certain that Woods is actually more diluted than Bronner&#x27;s, that is the effect when using it.  It doesn&#x27;t produce anywhere near as many suds and we are, therefore, going through it about twice as fast as Bronner&#x27;s.  Yes, this stuff is cheaper, especially if you are buying Bronner&#x27;s here on Amazon, but you could dilute it quite a bit before you got down to the strength of this Woods fellow. NOT ECONOMICAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as far as that change of fragrance thing I mentioned? The tea tree variety says it is scented with Rosemary, but it smells more like a combination of Pine-sol and turpentine.  Gross.</li>
            <li> Tried this stuff as a slightly more economical substitute for Dr Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree soap.  From the small (industrial and slightly musty) I&#x27;m guessing there is very little tea tree oil in it.  It performed miserably for me, about like not using soap at all.  Dr Bronner&#x27;s may have gotten expensive, but it&#x27;s the real deal.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to use this soap up and switch back.</li>
            <li> I Love this &amp;#34;bath product&amp;#34;. I feel ultra clean and relaxed after I am finished with my bath. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love the tingle and the clean feeling.  Definitely recommended.  Just as good as the competition, no real complaints.  The smell is not intense, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I used that other doctor&#x27;s brand of liquid soap.  I gave this a try and bought two more bottles (almond and peppermint) right away.  I use this as an all in one product.  This is my shampoo, body wash and face wash in the bathroom.  I also used a couple of ounces in a couple of gallons of water to clean the bathrooms and mop floors.  The slight scent that is left behind as it dries is much more pleasant than commercial household cleaning products.  We have four dogs and I feel much better using this on the surfaces with which they come into contact.  This product is just as good as the competition, but the price is much better.</li>
            <li> I love this s product and use it all the time</li>
            <li> Made shampoo and my hair did not dry out as much as before. Easy and cheaper than major brand I bought in store. Shipping was fast. Thank You</li>
            <li> Nice smell and good value soup.</li>
            <li> Love Dr. Woods soap. But have now found a better price.</li>
            <li> Good product wish shipping cost was less.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The price was better than Dr. Bonner&#x27;s and the product was just as good if not better. I put it in a foaming soap dispenser that&#x27;s half filled with water and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Not drying and invigorating.</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase more of Dr. Bronners Magic soap until I came across Dr.Woods which was cheaper and of equal quality to Dr. Bronner. I was actually doing some research and came across this website that has a ton of organic products from bath and beauty to food and house supply. Free shipping over $20 and if you use CGB075 at check out you get $10 off your entire order! The website is&lt;br /&gt;iherb.com. Hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> I like castile soap but usually find tea tree to be too strong a scent, but this is nice. It works well. I use it diluted in foaming soap bottles as handsoap, because it doesn&#x27;t dry my hand like SLS soap does.</li>
            <li> The soap smells really bad. I love Tea Products, but this doesn&#x27;t smell like any other product I use.  All in all, it cleans just like soap is supposed to.</li>
            <li> trying to switch to less chemicals in body products but do not like the smell. makes my skin soft  and hair clean. just wish it didn&#x27;t smell  weird. may try another scent from same product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.. I use it for everything.. It makes my skin nice and soft.. It smells the way I expected it to being that it has tea tree oil in it.. If you&#x27;ve ever smelled tea tree oil then you should know what I mean..</li>
            <li> It helps my psoriasis.  I rotate shampoo&#x27;s and this one does help.</li>
            <li> Have had other brands a bit more concentrated tea tree, but works well for shampoo/bathing and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Love this amazing product! Awesome shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Gives great texture and body!</li>
            <li> All natural soap that does not dry out your skin. I highly recommend this product. Its can be used for a lot of different things. Face, hair and body.</li>
            <li> Gets your hair nice and squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;No oily residue, you can feel that it doesn&#x27;t strip like some harsh silicone soaps.</li>
            <li> love this soap . makes me feel very clean , and healthy. use it on my face and body , never dries me out , or leave me oily , the tea tree oil makes me feel , well , a healthy clean . clean is healthy .</li>
            <li> I got this soap and put it in a foaming soap dispenser diluted with water...and love it...I use it in the shower as shampoo and soap for the body and is great.... I play to take it on a trip overseas and use to was clothes and body and hair.....great buy especially for the price</li>
            <li> This soap will dry the hell out of your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to start making my own shampoo and I LOVED it! It smells great, and my hair feels much healthier without all the harsh chemicals from other shampoos. I&#x27;ve also used this as a bubble bath a couple of times and it&#x27;s very relaxing. I&#x27;ve almost used this up, but I bought a lavender one too and they&#x27;re both wonderful! I&#x27;m never buying shampoo from a store again!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  I was originally using Dr. Woods Pure Black Soap, but after exposure to a hazardous toxic mold environment at a hotel in AR (told they were newly renovated rooms, but found out 4 days later why I was getting so sick -- found all the very toxic molds behind the wallpapered areas in both rooms we were in) which resulted in very high mycotoxin levels (3 of the worse toxins you can have in your body), as well as being highly colonized with three fungal colonies found within me, I started to break out with live fungal sores all over my body, and since tree tea oil is very good for funguses, I started to use Dr. Woods Pure Tea Tree Castile Soap every day.  It has helped with these outbreaks of fungal sores.</li>
            <li> I order this stuff all the time. If you are a camper, this soap works on your body, hair, dishes, laundry, car/boat, and is very ecologically safe. I alternate between this and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but this soap is better for the general purpose cleaning.</li>
            <li> I prefer Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille liquid soap. Woods is too diluted.</li>
            <li> At least as good as Bronners, and I love Bronners! This has a pleasant smell &amp; feel, creates great suds, and works beautifully with my sensitive skin and it&#x27;s issues!</li>
            <li> In my opinion this soap is on of the best on the market. My hair follicles produce too much oil and that other stuff. The stuff that causes dandruff. I have had this problem most of my adult life. Crusty scalp, itching and every thing that goes wit it. Dandruff shampoos would not work. I had asked my barber what I could do. With no solution available. I found this product and it cleared up fast. This product is all I use or will ever use from now on.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. I&#x27;ve enjoyed using all of Dr. Woods products, they are gentle on skin and smell nice. Will definitely keep buying.</li>
