            <li>better Health everyone.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure when I bought it but tried it anyway</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE TO DO YOUR HOME</li>
            <li>ok I guess.  </li>
            <li>I like being able to order this on Amazon, too, instead of driving across town to buy it in the HFS, where they are often out.</li>
            <li>They take their orders from their trade union like most worker bees.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product and providing a book for how to use it -- I wish more health companies did this.</li>
            <li>Informative book, handy dropper, very useful hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>This is important for H2O2 since it reacts with many things.</li>
            <li>Seems very economical and more for the money...</li>
            <li>The delivery was very quick.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased to use as a fruit and veggie rinse and the book had many more useful suggestions</li>
            <li>The book was very informative, and I&#x27;m now using the product as instructed by the many uses in the book!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get to the point right away, but goes into a lengthy criticism of the pharmaceutical industry, which is interesting, but beside the point.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so happy with is the shipping company--UPS (not the USPS) is fine as long as there aren&#x27;t any glitches.</li>
            <li>First, within a week I noticed much more energy but after 3 wks I went back to my doctor and he listen to my lungs again and said I sounded great and wanted to know what I had been doing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty healthy to begin with, so that may be the problem.  </li>
            <li>exactly but once I reached 17 drops three times a day on my way to 25, I could no longer stand the potent taste</li>
            <li>; program using the hydrogen peroxide product has had remarkable benefits in only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It is potent and if diluted properly in distilled water as instructed, hopefully effective.</li>
            <li>We think is for the pool or to clean.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m off to convince as many people as I can to snap out of their brain-washed state, and let&#x27;s really take care of our bodies.</li>
            <li>no bad effects stops cancer in its tracks,</li>
            <li>/&gt;DO NOT ever get flu shots or vaccines Not for mild</li>
            <li>I tried this product based on its bold claim for improved health benefits.</li>
            <li>The real value of this book is that it is being marketed, and therefore more people are being made aware of that information.</li>
            <li>This product came professionally packaged with instructions for storage and strong warnings of the potency not to be taken lightly.</li>
            <li>Not having to use those harsh chemicals makes me happy.  </li>
            <li>The Book is worth the read.</li>
            <li>The One Minute Cure is not as authoritative as I would like.</li>
            <li>Good quantity, the book DID add to my knowledge of the product even after reading other books.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>It was very carefully packaged, the product was very fresh and effective.</li>
            <li>I would say buy the book and go right to the practical application.  </li>
            <li>Right now I have my husband doing the 25 day therapy where I increase the dosage 1 drop per day for 23 days.  </li>
            <li>The peroxide inside was great, but unless you are supplying a small army, or also use the stuff for cleaning and mouthwash, you&#x27;ll never use this stuff up.</li>
            <li>The product arrived exactly as represented on the site.</li>
            <li>It has been an awesome revelation about how something so simple can make such a BIG difference in someone&#x27;s health.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this to take orally, but I also am able to use it for numerous things.</li>
            <li>I use it in my hot tub, for cleaning, laundry, etc.</li>
            <li>I took 9 drops in water the first day on saturday just like the book said to&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my first bottle</li>
            <li>This product is about the book so read the book first.</li>
            <li>I use this in my hot tub</li>
            <li>Once it finally gets to the reason I bought the book, it was easy to understand.  </li>
            <li>The book could cut to the chase a bit more quickly -- or maybe color code the essential sections -- but it&#x27;s full of useful information if you have a little patience.</li>
            <li>There is very valuable information in this book, and everyone who cares about their health should read it.  </li>
            <li>The H2O2 was packaged very well for safety.</li>
            <li>I keep this product in my refrigerator and hope I can recognize if there is too much pressure built up in the unused bottles as was one of the warnings.</li>
            <li>The  one minute cure is put together with proven facts and a guide for using peroxide and is a very valuable bit of information.</li>
            <li>Been using about 6 weeks and can see very pleasing results already.</li>
            <li>The premise of the book is that modern medicine won&#x27;t tell you about the power of H202 because it&#x27;s a profit-driven industry, and the profit margins are miniscule on H202.</li>
            <li>I have been increasing the mixture from 3% to straight 35.</li>
            <li>oncologist just gave her 3-6 months to live and she is doing great with no pain and only a slight cough</li>
            <li>but I have spent way more money on doctors and drugs just to live stabilized with no cure</li>
            <li>I will likely purchase more  such sets.</li>
            <li>The little book that came free with the order has been a hit, among friends including Dentists, Doctors and ll else who saw it.</li>
            <li>Plus I got the little book FREE.</li>
            <li>I feel better, breather better, &amp; my arthritis does not bother me as bad.</li>
            <li>have since found that I can take 5 drops a day with no problem and my 90 year old friend with stage 4 lung cancer can take 3 drops a day without getting diahrreah.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>but so far see no measurable benefit.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s too early to tell</li>
            <li>and WOW what a difference in me.  </li>
            <li>so I just told him I had been doing lung excercises when really all I have done differently is drank H2O2.  </li>
            <li>But anyway I can attest to the strength of the product because once I felt a pin drop&#x27;s worth splash onto my finger and got a little white mark and burning sensation that lasted a minute or so.</li>
            <li>I use this product for all kinds of things including but not limited to the sprouting of seeds and H2O2 in water for a humidifier, etc..</li>
            <li>It spilled all inside my fridge and ate through some other cans making a huge mess.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to go slow and let it clean up my lungs.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Every single person should have this product in their home. Excellent.</li>
            <li> The product arrived exactly as represented on the site. It was well packaged and packed. I&#x27;m not sure what I think of the book though. I used several informational resources before deciding to use this product as a dietary supplement (caution--READ INSTRUCTIONS!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;m not so happy with is the shipping company--UPS (not the USPS) is fine as long as there aren&#x27;t any glitches. But if you have even the slightest problem receiving the package according to what they&#x27;ve arranged, they can&#x27;t deal with it. I would be happier if they used the USPS--besides, they can use our support these days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, just to reiterate--product, great. Seller, great. Book? Not too sure. Shipping method? YUCK! Note to seller--please use USPS in future!</li>
            <li> THE BOOK HAS A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION. LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE RESULTS THEY TALK ABOUT.&lt;br /&gt;A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I received my package sooner than expected! It was very carefully packaged, the product was very fresh and effective. I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Good quantity, the book DID add to my knowledge of the product even after reading other books.&lt;br /&gt;We are flooding our bodies with O2</li>
            <li> Amazing works as it says it does no problems no bad effects stops cancer in its tracks, Has hospis confused scratching there heads.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter, Leela, loves her Beach House Lego set.  I will likely purchase more  such sets.</li>
            <li> This book is OK.  It doesn&#x27;t get to the point right away, but goes into a lengthy criticism of the pharmaceutical industry, which is interesting, but beside the point.  The writing is sloppy, and full of grammatical errors that should have been edited out.  Once it finally gets to the reason I bought the book, it was easy to understand.  There is very valuable information in this book, and everyone who cares about their health should read it.  I would say buy the book and go right to the practical application.  The information about the use of hydrogen peroxide has been around for decades, but was getting little attention before this book came out.  The real value of this book is that it is being marketed, and therefore more people are being made aware of that information.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipment, reliable product. The inclusion of the book is a nice value-add. Can&#x27;t complain. Perhaps just wish it included 2 glass dropper bottles instead of 1.</li>
            <li> And it works.  I dilute often to get larger quantities to soak antique cup, or two.  Very good price and quickly delivered w/o any hazard certification problems.</li>
            <li> No good. It looks like acid it could burned you so i throw it away.</li>
            <li> this is awesome item it does work for do wonder thing for me!!</li>
            <li> I have already got three people on it. One that has COPD.&lt;br /&gt;He grabbed right onto it !!!&lt;br /&gt;I am now on my 18th day.&lt;br /&gt;I have no known problems,&lt;br /&gt;just using it for prevention</li>
            <li> To the best of my research, this product seems to be the real deal.  The book is verbose and should be a &#x27;brochure&#x27; not a bunch of gobbeldy-gook.</li>
            <li> This and the book is definately the answer to many questions in regard to health. Everyone should get educated on FGHP. It is the best medicine on the planet!</li>
            <li> Informative book, handy dropper, very useful hydrogen peroxide. I originally purchased to use as a fruit and veggie rinse and the book had many more useful suggestions</li>
            <li> The little book that came free with the order has been a hit, among friends including Dentists, Doctors and ll else who saw it.</li>
            <li> These bottles weren&#x27;t well designed.  Over the course of a year and a half, the hydrogen peroxide inside ate through the plastic on the bottom.  It spilled all inside my fridge and ate through some other cans making a huge mess.  The peroxide inside was great, but unless you are supplying a small army, or also use the stuff for cleaning and mouthwash, you&#x27;ll never use this stuff up.</li>
            <li> After much research I found this great deal on Amazon. Plus I got the little book FREE. It has been an awesome revelation about how something so simple can make such a BIG difference in someone&#x27;s health.  Right now I have my husband doing the 25 day therapy where I increase the dosage 1 drop per day for 23 days.  He has pseudomonas bacteria permanently taking up residence in one of his lungs so he gets pneumonia often. This therapy is supposed to kill that bacteria.  Will let you know how it works. Meanwhile it&#x27;s a great way to detox the body of all kinds of nastiness. And it&#x27;s really a cheap way too!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to take orally, but I also am able to use it for numerous things. I use it in my hot tub, for cleaning, laundry, etc. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this book and product to everyone whether they have health issues or are perfectly healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Quick Read!</li>
            <li> I shopped around and this is the best buy for a very good product. It is a nice bonus to receive the book and the dropper bottle which I can share with friends. I have repeat ordered this product several times and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This product is very good for cleaning produce, dishwater, and oral care. If you add this to a vaporizer it will discolor your hair.</li>
            <li> Tt is what it is Food grade Peroxide. If you love doing some chemistry and taking care of yourself in a much more effective way than Pharmaceutical Reliance This is what anyone should look into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT ever get flu shots or vaccines Not for mild symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;H2o2 treatments do miracles to cancers and weak Diseases&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add Iodine and GARLIC to your Life and nothing will touch you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel like a million bucks.</li>
            <li> great product. have ordered it many times for self and friends. everybody should take it so they stay healthy. great</li>
            <li> Packaged and shipped well. Everything as described. Excellent deal. Would buy again... Seems very economical and more for the money...</li>
            <li> The delivery was very quick.  The product is great!  Diluted, of course.  There are many uses for all kinds of situations.  Do your research, you&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this peroxide trying to cure my cancer that very likely was caused by exposure to the Toxic Fumes while working at the 9/11 World Trade Center Disaster Site. I won&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working for that yet but it is curing psoriasis I have and who knows what else. Oxygen therapy seems to be a good remedy for what ales you.The H2O2 was packaged very well for safety. The Book is worth the read. Shipping was on time. Take a look at My Page [...] and Like it if you Like it.</li>
            <li> I took 9 drops in water the first day on saturday just like the book said to&lt;br /&gt;Then Sunday at 4 pm I went to the bathroom with no idea what was about to happen.&lt;br /&gt;No cramping or pain but everything in my intestines was liquified and I lost about 10 pounds with that one trip to the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Then Monday I felt like I had the flu with nausea and achiness so I called in sick to work which I have never done.&lt;br /&gt;Then in the middle of the night Monday night the fever broke and I was off and running with no residual achiness&lt;br /&gt;What I thought was the flu was a herximer reaction to the die off&lt;br /&gt;I have since found that I can take 5 drops a day with no problem and my 90 year old friend with stage 4 lung cancer can take 3 drops a day without getting diahrreah.&lt;br /&gt;She was supposed to be dead by now but this and juicing beets and carrots has kept her going&lt;br /&gt;She just scored a 21 on the CA27.29 cancer tumor maker antigen blood test.&lt;br /&gt;Anything below 38 is negative for cancer.&lt;br /&gt;The oncologist just gave her 3-6 months to live and she is doing great with no pain and only a slight cough&lt;br /&gt;At 90 the oncologist said she was too old for chemo and radiation would only slow the spread to her spine which still hasn&#x27;t happened.</li>
            <li> The book was very informative, and I&#x27;m now using the product as instructed by the many uses in the book! Thank You!</li>
            <li> Herbs, Colloidal Silver, Ozone and finally H2O2.  All I have to say is; the results are instant! (literally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it.</li>
            <li> Taking hydrogen peroxide for health benefits is controversial.  If hydrogen peroxide is as beneficial as hyped, then it, along with EDTA, could be a solution for 90% of health problems.  I&#x27;m on my first bottle but so far see no measurable benefit.  I&#x27;m pretty healthy to begin with, so that may be the problem.  The One Minute Cure is not as authoritative as I would like.</li>
            <li> It works, I continue to feel better and better as I use it,&lt;br /&gt;It should work as well for you, follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;The One- Minute Cure an Excellent guide.&lt;br /&gt;to better Health everyone.  ED</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a poison center pharmacist and hope that anyone who is considering buying concentrated hydrogen peroxide (&amp;#62;10%), please think twice or at least take extra precautions...It is highly toxic if misused or if small children drink it. Oxygen forms and creates gas emboli (bubbles) in the body which can be life-threatening. It is also caustic in this concentration, causing burns in the stomach. There are numerous case reports of children and adults who have been seriously affected by swallowing products like this undiluted or in large volumes. Take every precaution to use ONLY as directed and to keep it locked away from small children.</li>
            <li> This product came professionally packaged with instructions for storage and strong warnings of the potency not to be taken lightly. I tried to follow the One Minute Cure program exactly but once I reached 17 drops three times a day on my way to 25, I could no longer stand the potent taste so I&#x27;ve leveled off at 12 drops three times a day. This is not the fault of the product but rather my tolerance of the program. There&#x27;s enough hydrogen peroxide here to last forever taken orally it would seem. I have considered using a cup in warm bath water as an alternative therapy but my tap water reeks of chlorine so I&#x27;m weary of this method. I keep this product in my refrigerator and hope I can recognize if there is too much pressure built up in the unused bottles as was one of the warnings. But anyway I can attest to the strength of the product because once I felt a pin drop&#x27;s worth splash onto my finger and got a little white mark and burning sensation that lasted a minute or so. It is potent and if diluted properly in distilled water as instructed, hopefully effective. I was diagnosed with invasive bladder cancer btw and the only option my urologist gave me was removal of my bladder or I&#x27;d be a goner within the year. I have instead chosen a few alternative therapies including this one, so we&#x27;ll have to see. I&#x27;m not quite a month into this adventure so it&#x27;s too early to tell but I&#x27;m optimistic I can beat this.</li>
            <li> I know this product works.  I wasn&#x27;t sure when I bought it but tried it anyway and WOW what a difference in me.  First, within a week I noticed much more energy but after 3 wks I went back to my doctor and he listen to my lungs again and said I sounded great and wanted to know what I had been doing.  I didnt tell him because I dont want them pushing any harder to get rid of H2O2 so I just told him I had been doing lung excercises when really all I have done differently is drank H2O2.  I have recommended this to any and everyone who says anything to me about any kind of aliment.  I am a firm believer of this now.  Good Luck and God Bless You All.</li>
            <li> The  one minute cure is put together with proven facts and a guide for using peroxide and is a very valuable bit of information.I use 8 drops twice daily to help with my emphysema and you can see your blood oxygen level go up in a few minutes after taking if you have a oximeter.I&#x27;m trying to go slow and let it clean up my lungs. Been using about 6 weeks and can see very pleasing results already.Am very happy with this peoduct.</li>
            <li> This product is about the book so read the book first. The packaging is very good. This is important for H2O2 since it reacts with many things. When I reordered I ordered the quart size and gave the book away.</li>
            <li> I tried this product based on its bold claim for improved health benefits. I was not sold that it would work but I have spent way more money on doctors and drugs just to live stabilized with no cure, I figured I had nothing to lose but the cost of one inhaler by trying this product.  I made the 23 days and saw no real change in the major symptom I was hoping to resolve, so I went for another week of the max dosage, and that was when my stomach went south with sever heart burn. I just had to stop. After every dose my stomach was so upset that it actually hurt. I didn&#x27;t want to eat at all, even with eating 4 hours later or the next day after a dose, I had no stomach relief. So I stopped taking the product. I do plan on trying the recommended protocol again to see if there are any stomach problems but plan to wait 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice an improvement in allergy resistance and breathing (asthma) issues. Most people this year have been complaining about their allergies being real bad, but I have had no problems. For years my wife has had to cut our grass because I can&#x27;t. If I try to cut the grass the fine cut particles in the air shut down my breathing, my eyes turn demon red, swell up, itch and water and the amount of mucus that runs from my face is not pleasant. I would always have my emergency inhaler on hand because of the fear of suffocation and overdose on allergy pills to kill the symptoms. This year I can actually cut the grass and not worry about calling 911 for an oxygen tank for breathing, or run to my emergency inhaler. My eyes still do itch, but no redness or watery issues. I only take one generic allergy pill per day. My coughing fits from asthma are down to a few times per day and not real productive ( if you suffer from it you understand what I mean) which is a real plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my next round, where I hope to complete the cycle, I will update the review.</li>
            <li> MAKE SURE TO DO YOUR HOME IF YOU PLAN ON USING THIS STUFF CORRECTLY</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use and the &amp;#34;One Minute Cure&amp;#34; program using the hydrogen peroxide product has had remarkable benefits in only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hot tub and it&#x27;s doing ok I guess.  Not having to use those harsh chemicals makes me happy.  I like being able to order this on Amazon, too, instead of driving across town to buy it in the HFS, where they are often out.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, good book, good price. The book could cut to the chase a bit more quickly -- or maybe color code the essential sections -- but it&#x27;s full of useful information if you have a little patience. The premise of the book is that modern medicine won&#x27;t tell you about the power of H202 because it&#x27;s a profit-driven industry, and the profit margins are miniscule on H202. Hard to argue with the logic. I would just add this to the story: ALL profit-driven industries are using the technique of hiding the low-profit solutions in favor of the high-profit solutions. It&#x27;s not just medicine, and American doctors are no more corrupt than your average business executive. They take their orders from their trade union like most worker bees. Thanks for a great product and providing a book for how to use it -- I wish more health companies did this.</li>
            <li> I have been increasing the mixture from 3% to straight 35. It is not removing anything yet. It has been a week. It does scab over but will not come off.</li>
            <li> We bought for a project and we needed 35% and this didn&#x27;t get the job done. We tested the product and it looks like is 8%. All water and we don&#x27;t thick is Food Grade Certified. We think is for the pool or to clean.</li>
            <li> my mom had eczema on her hands,elbows and the bottom of both her feet.  wherever the eczema was, cracks would appear in  the skin and put my mom thru a lot of pain, sometimes she was unable to walk due to the pain. my mom tried the doctors option(a cream). didnt work so mom started using 3% hydrogen peroxide which she applied twice a day topically. after almost 18 months, it has all disappeared. the only thing mom used was the peroxide. it is 100 percent gone for over 2 years now.</li>
            <li> The cure is fascinating! I am so glad this knowledge is out there! Now I&#x27;m off to convince as many people as I can to snap out of their brain-washed state, and let&#x27;s really take care of our bodies. We tore this world up.. but let&#x27;s at least take care of our families and friends by saving money that&#x27;s wasted on these corporations&#x27; drugs, drugs, drugs.. and truly heal ourselves. No more people needs to die.. at all! Ohh, thank God..</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I will definitely be ordering again when I run out.  I feel better, breather better, &amp; my arthritis does not bother me as bad.</li>
            <li> I use this product for all kinds of things including but not limited to the sprouting of seeds and H2O2 in water for a humidifier, etc..</li>
    </ol>
