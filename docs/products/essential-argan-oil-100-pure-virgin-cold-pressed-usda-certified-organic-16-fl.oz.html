            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>For the money, I don&#x27;t think you could get a better product.</li>
            <li>I have noticed considerable differences, plus, it just feels so good!  </li>
            <li>The oil from ArganaShop smells - it has a strong rancid rotten smell, nothing like the mild sweet nutty smell I experienced in Morocco.</li>
            <li>Loyal customer for sure!</li>
            <li>I have thinning hair and argon oil helps keep it strong and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, I find it helps reduce fine lines (wrinkles).  </li>
            <li>I took a chance the first time and ordered a 16oz bottle, because I am always looking for better deals!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After the product was shipped, I received an email from the vendor warning me that the product had a strong nutty smell.</li>
            <li>In Morocco, I liked the mild nutty smell of the fresh oil, and how the Argan oil felt on skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing Pura D&#x27;or again - that smells fresh and absorbs better.</li>
            <li>Even my finger nails look fabulous.</li>
            <li>use this product in hydrating conditioners under a steam dry for great absorbency  </li>
            <li>It is very effective for treating dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Nice so far.  </li>
            <li>but that is true about any oil that one would use for either the hair or skin.</li>
            <li>The hair is so silky with tremendous shine.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and does not feel oily.  </li>
            <li>It does not absorb quickly and it smells like baby poop.</li>
            <li>There is a mild Oder to the oil</li>
            <li>The repulsive odor was strongest near the paper seal at the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing for dry skin, I can lather it on without any break outs or problems.  </li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described and pictures and even came in a decorative bag.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>It did ship during extremely hot weather so perhaps this had an effect.</li>
            <li>I love this aragan oil for my face, hair and body daily.</li>
            <li>I love the size of the bottle as it saves me having to replace the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li>Smells funny but was able to mask that with essential oils.</li>
            <li>I have used Essential Argan Oil for a very long time on hair, nails, and body with great results.  </li>
            <li>I use a cocktail of oils argan, jojoba, olive oil, sweet almond oil, and to complete it is MONOI.....</li>
            <li>The oil soaks right in and leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a much brighter complexion.</li>
            <li>That review was meant for another product that wasn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of the naturalness of the oil and how you can virtually use it on your entire body from head to toe (I do-and for various reasons).  </li>
            <li>Amazon has done a great job in delivering this less than expected lead time.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Argan Oil.</li>

            <li>and  now I can&#x27;t live with out it</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had no reaction.</li>
            <li>Had a slight smell, not bad, but just didn&#x27;t seem as clean and pure as other Argan Oil I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>This oil is rich and rivals any of the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>My second order of this large size argan oil....</li>

            <li>It makes your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I switched to all natural soaps to cleanse and aragan oil to moisturise my face, hair and body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sits on my bathroom sink, ready to be use daily.</li>
            <li>The oil works very well on my dry hair and skin.  </li>
            <li>I saw Argan trees in the wild (between Marrakech and Agadir), visited Berber Argan artisans and watched how they produce and package Argan oil in traditional glass bottles.</li>
            <li>Just watch the eye area as it will make your eyes blury if you put too much or if you aren&#x27;t careful when applying it to that area.  </li>
            <li>There is a smell to it, but after applying it the small disappears in a minute or two and soaks right in.</li>

            <li> I originally ordered the non-deodorized version and was not happy with the smell.</li>
            <li> I was buying the most expensive moisturizers from the department store for years because of my dry skin</li>
            <li> Very faint but nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I found this Argan oil to be a wonderfully less expensive alternative to Savaanah&#x27;s, which is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I know there are other brands that have them with a different smell</li>
            <li> I have dry skin but after using this oil for months</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> So to experience Argan oil here in the USA, I ordered the Essential Argan Oil, 100% Pure Virgin Cold Pressed, USDA Certified Organic, 16 Fl.oz from ArganaShop LLC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this oil everyday after a shower, spraying on myself while before I towel dry.  </li>
            <li> it is affordable and works as well as the more expensive brands!!</li>
            <li> not worth</li>
            <li> /&gt;This $59.95 purchase was a waste.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONGGGGG way!</li>
            <li> However, the spray is hard to use and I wind up taking off the cap and pouring the oil on my hand, which can be messy and wasteful.</li>
            <li> I have thrown out all my expensive face creams and only use Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I wrote a bad review last time about this product.</li>
            <li> but I am afraid to try them, because they have been processed and therefore a lower quality.</li>
            <li> This is not nutty smell, it is how oil smells when it goes bad</li>
            <li> I opened it, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> as a therapist I use it as a base oil for my work.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just returned from Morocco after a week of travels. I saw Argan trees in the wild (between Marrakech and Agadir), visited Berber Argan artisans and watched how they produce and package Argan oil in traditional glass bottles. I also experienced Argan oil in a number of ways including Moroccan massage with fresh Argan oil. In Morocco, I liked the mild nutty smell of the fresh oil, and how the Argan oil felt on skin. So to experience Argan oil here in the USA, I ordered the Essential Argan Oil, 100% Pure Virgin Cold Pressed, USDA Certified Organic, 16 Fl.oz from ArganaShop LLC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the product was shipped, I received an email from the vendor warning me that the product had a strong nutty smell. The vendor also mentioned, in the email, that they offer a deodorized version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived on time. The oil is packaged inside a plastic bottle, with a paper seal under the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened it, I was disappointed. The oil from ArganaShop smells - it has a strong rancid rotten smell, nothing like the mild sweet nutty smell I experienced in Morocco. The repulsive odor was strongest near the paper seal at the top of the bottle. This is not nutty smell, it is how oil smells when it goes bad (look up rancidification on internet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This $59.95 purchase was a waste. I will not buy again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a month now &amp; can be seen very good effect on the skin &amp; hair. Amazon has done a great job in delivering this less than expected lead time.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is new to me.  I happened upon it by accident while doing some research on wrinkle creams.  I liked the idea of the naturalness of the oil and how you can virtually use it on your entire body from head to toe (I do-and for various reasons).  I took a chance the first time and ordered a 16oz bottle, because I am always looking for better deals!  Thankfully I did, because I have shared this ArganaShop oil with female and male friends and everyone LOVES it, including me!  It works on my skin, hair, lips and well, just everywhere!  I have noticed considerable differences, plus, it just feels so good!  A little goes a LONGGGGG way!</li>
            <li> The product leave hair silky with Lots of shine a great conditioning agent!&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in hydrating conditioners under a steam dry for great absorbency  The hair is so silky with tremendous shine.  Would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I use this daily and nightly and sometimes in between. The oil soaks right in and leaves your skin very soft. I also put it in my hair when it becomes unruly. Very faint but nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described and pictures and even came in a decorative bag.  Would recommend this product for hair, face and body use.</li>
            <li> My second order of this large size argan oil....the best product at a fantastic price. Also, incredible customer service. Make sure to order the de-odorized product. I originally ordered the non-deodorized version and was not happy with the smell. Customer service promptly swapped it out and paid for the shipping. Loyal customer for sure!</li>
            <li> I found this Argan oil to be a wonderfully less expensive alternative to Savaanah&#x27;s, which is my favorite.  I use this oil every day on my face and in my hair.  I have no complaints.  So why did I give this oil only 4 stars?  Because Savaanah&#x27;s Argan Oil is better.  Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful. Makes my skin so very soft.  I use it in my bath then put it on after my bath.  I&#x27;m very happy with it. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I have used Essential Argan Oil for a very long time on hair, nails, and body with great results.  My hair feels luxurious and has a great shine.  My skin is smooth and hydrated. This oil, used in conjunction with cuticle cream have helped my nails look better.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful for skin conditions, like eczema, rashes and break outs.&lt;br /&gt;Also very nice as a hair conditioner.  as a therapist I use it as a base oil for my work.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality good price.</li>
            <li> I have been usin this argan oil for a month is very good, although it has some smell I can&#x27;t describe.</li>
            <li> I use this oil everyday after a shower, spraying on myself while before I towel dry.  It is very effective for treating dry skin.  However, the spray is hard to use and I wind up taking off the cap and pouring the oil on my hand, which can be messy and wasteful.</li>
            <li> Love this product, will never be without it, my skin looks amazing after using this argan oil.I have recommened this to my sisters and friends, so they are using this now. Love it..........</li>
            <li> The oil works very well on my dry hair and skin.  It absorbs quickly and does not feel oily.  It lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> not worth the $&#x27;s i do not like the smell</li>
            <li> Product just seemed a litlle off.  Had a slight smell, not bad, but just didn&#x27;t seem as clean and pure as other Argan Oil I&#x27;ve used.  It did ship during extremely hot weather so perhaps this had an effect.</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair and argon oil helps keep it strong and healthy.  I have also used the same oil on my face and neck at night as a skin improvement.  I am allergic to most face cream, but not to this oil.  It keeps hair and face soft.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil and this is a great price for it.  It makes your skin soft.  The best value I have gotten on this kind of oil.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this over a year ago and I am ordering my second bottle. I love this aragan oil for my face, hair and body daily. I also use it at night on my hands and feet too. I have dry skin but after using this oil for months I don&#x27;t now. I thought that this would make my skin oily under my make up but I does not. I was buying the most expensive moisturizers from the department store for years because of my dry skin and I was reading about this amazing oil and  now I can&#x27;t live with out it and I tell others when they ask my about my beautiful skin. I switched to all natural soaps to cleanse and aragan oil to moisturise my face, hair and body. I love the 16ozs Bottle with the pump. It&#x27;s sits on my bathroom sink, ready to be use daily.</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite argan oil. It does not absorb quickly and it smells like baby poop. I will be purchasing Pura D&#x27;or again - that smells fresh and absorbs better.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best skin emoluments along with the use of tea tree l available to women who care how their skin looks and feels.&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations  Amazon for your integrity!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for entire body. Skin, hair and bath. I highly recommend Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> It works great on my daughter hair. Will buy again when it runs out. Expensive but worth every penny. You all will love this Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I have to reorder this...  I use a cocktail of oils argan, jojoba, olive oil, sweet almond oil, and to complete it is MONOI..... Must have to reduce wrinkles..</li>
            <li> Love this product, I find it helps reduce fine lines (wrinkles).  Absolutely amazing for dry skin, I can lather it on without any break outs or problems.  I use it in the evening.  Just watch the eye area as it will make your eyes blury if you put too much or if you aren&#x27;t careful when applying it to that area.  Love It.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have thrown out all my expensive face creams and only use Argan oil. My skin looks amazing. I use it on my face, hands, body and hair. Even my finger nails look fabulous. My son started using it on his acne and even that cleared up. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice so far.  I still think is way to soon to grade this product.  Non greasy and also has improved the looking of my skin.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell of it, but I guess there is nothing that I can do about it.  I know there are other brands that have them with a different smell but I am afraid to try them, because they have been processed and therefore a lower quality.</li>
            <li> There is a smell to it, but after applying it the small disappears in a minute or two and soaks right in. If you are not happy with it the customer service is really good. There is also a non smelling oil too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- I have been using this for over a week and I have noticed a much brighter complexion. I have acne prone skin and tons of marks.. This has faded them. In the morning I combine this with the Josie maran SPF day cream, one would think that is way too much oil, but it soaks in perfectly, makeup goes on smoothly.. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife when I was researching another product. She loves it and I have returned many times to renew my order again.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my hair as well as my skin. I have very sensitive skin and have had no reaction. I love the size of the bottle as it saves me having to replace the smaller bottles. There is a mild Oder to the oil but that is true about any oil that one would use for either the hair or skin. This product does wonders for the hair and is not greasy on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shar</li>
            <li> Smells funny but was able to mask that with essential oils. If it wasn&#x27;t for the smell I would have given a five star rating.</li>
            <li> love it best on the market</li>
            <li> this is a good product. I love it it is affordable and works as well as the more expensive brands!!</li>
            <li> I use Argan oil all over all the time.  It&#x27;s great for hair skin and nails. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is very good product for my skin and hair. The best part is it absorbs into the skin and you don&#x27;t feel oily. I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I wrote a bad review last time about this product. That review was meant for another product that wasn&#x27;t real. It was totally my fault. This product is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone. It is truly 100% argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;For the French speakers:&lt;br /&gt;C&#x27;est produit est la meilleur l&#x27; huile d&#x27;argan. Pur et naturelle. Vous pouvez acheter Ce produit sans l&#x27;inquiete.</li>
            <li> This product is the perfect combination of quality and cost. This oil is rich and rivals any of the more expensive brands. The pump works well. I have only used the oil on my body, so I can&#x27;t speak to its use on hair or face. For the money, I don&#x27;t think you could get a better product. This is the one I&#x27;ll be buying for now on.</li>
