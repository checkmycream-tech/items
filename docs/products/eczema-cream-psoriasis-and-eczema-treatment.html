    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never written a review on Amazon, but this excellent product has prompted me to do so!</li>
            <li>This is the best cream I&#x27;ve found in many years for controlling the redness and dryness of my Psoriasis.</li>
            <li>, I have tried aveeno (herbal) moisturiser, and this is good to an extent.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Great product effective as described.</li>
            <li>My doctor gave me steroid cream to use when I get an acute attack, but it causes bleaching/spots and I wanted something I could use all the time as prevention, not just when I have a flare up.</li>
            <li>my routine is warm damp flannels to soften the area...and then rub in this cream....</li>
            <li>the arganorganics  healing touch for eczema and psoriasis is amazing!, Immediatly eases the itch and calms the irritated skin, absorbed without residue, non-oily, smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy like most emolients, which made it easier to apply before going out or going to bed.</li>
            <li>What I like about this cream is that it is light, soothing and smells nice too.</li>
            <li>There are better products on the market for eczema..</li>
            <li>Loved it so much that I&#x27;ve already reordered.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply for wherever needed aswell.</li>
            <li>It also lasts as the consistency is easy to spread.</li>
            <li>I ts easy to apply and does not stain</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this cream.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product....</li>
            <li>So far so good has worked</li>
            <li>bought this product regulary and its an amazing product super fast results after a 1 week use.</li>
            <li>After one week I cant say this product has cured my irritated skin, but there is a significant improvement in the redness and itchiness.</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this product in a more higher manner than to say....</li>
            <li>This cream is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and skin feels lots better.</li>
            <li>The healing touch cream has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>A couple of other good points are it does not damage your clothes and does not make you look greasy....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really just a nice, soothing moisturizer--not actually an eczema fixer.</li>
            <li>Arganorganics Healing Touch brought him some relief from the discmfort quite soon after the first application.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve resorted to the Rx Tropicort, which consistently gets rid of my seasonal eczema).</li>
            <li>Definitely helps her sleep better and</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>The smell is light but not super appealing - almost like yams.</li>
            <li>I can apply it daily to the spots that I know get irritated and flare up easily.</li>
            <li>I like the texture a lot, and the smell is minimal (which I love).</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, a small amount each day soothes and stops the itching all day.</li>
            <li>His main difficulty has been soothing the redness and dryness of his skin which at times burns to the point that he cannot wear clothing.</li>
            <li>The situation would quickly return once regular application ceased.</li>
            <li>Mainly my elbows and forehead, cheeks and eybrow</li>
            <li>After trying various over the shelf and prescribed creams and steroid gels I am now using this product regularly with a lot better results.</li>
            <li>After a week my elbows look nothing more than caloused, and my red face is 90% back to normal....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and will be using from now on.</li>
            <li>It is soothing, calming and moisturizing; and I have an oily T-zone with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s natural, not corticosteroid cream, not greasy</li>
            <li>My 9-year old son has eczema.  </li>
            <li>the relief is near instantaneous, itching stops....</li>
            <li>andw then just in the mornings and at evening when things calm down.</li>

            <li> I have dry psorisis, same as my grandfather, same as his grandfather....</li>
            <li> itching, dry and red eczema calms down with the Healing Touch cream, like no other cream</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this and other products from this company again and again, they have totally gained my trust!!.</li>
            <li> Thought the product was faulty when first received because the instructions said to shake well, which was not possible because the mass was very thick and stuck to one side of the container.</li>
            <li> its gradually got worse over the last 3 years....but not  as bad as many sufferers ( and for that I am lucky)</li>
            <li> the dry skin doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; while she sleeps.</li>
            <li> so that is not really a problem.</li>
            <li> This cream is not what I expected It has a pasty consistency and did not relieve my eczema symptons.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of money</li>
            <li> , goes a very long way a jar lasts me a year, I have bought some recently for my son, who has bad Excema it soothes this very well .</li>
            <li> definitely recommend it to everyone who suffers from eczema and has dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do this on average 3 times a day during a lare up....</li>
            <li> I have had seborrhoeic dermatitis for years and a recent flare-up was proving difficult to treat, especially on the face where steroids must be used with caution.</li>
            <li> Also, no bleaching of the infected area which makes it less noticeable to others (in my mind at least).</li>
            <li> I have a small problem affecting my ears, but.</li>
            <li> Cleared up a couple of small patches and always soothes the itching.</li>
            <li> I have been searching so hard for something that I thought would help.</li>
            <li> only when desperate have I resorted to using steroids on my daughter!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s expensive considering</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed...</li>
            <li> It felt disgusting and went in the garbage..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really enjoy using this cream. I tried different products, but this one worked in a couple of days on my hands. I like that it&#x27;s natural, not corticosteroid cream, not greasy and I use it also like an every day moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it to everyone who suffers from eczema and has dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have had seborrhoeic dermatitis for years and a recent flare-up was proving difficult to treat, especially on the face where steroids must be used with caution. I used the healing touch cream twice a day and the rash almost disappeared within two weeks. I have been using it once daily since then (including on my scalp) to keep the disease under control. It has to be used regularly and if I miss a day I notice the rash starting to return. However, the cream also acts a moisturiser and hair tonic so that is not really a problem. If you notice the oil separate in the jar, just give it a shake.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product....after myself and my daughter have suffered with eczema all our lives....only when desperate have I resorted to using steroids on my daughter!, I have tried aveeno (herbal) moisturiser, and this is good to an extent.&lt;br /&gt;But the arganorganics  healing touch for eczema and psoriasis is amazing!, Immediatly eases the itch and calms the irritated skin, absorbed without residue, non-oily, smells really nice. I will definitely buy this and other products from this company again and again, they have totally gained my trust!!. Highly recommend. Also delivered within two days.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with this purchase. My son has eczema all over his body and has done since he was a baby. He&#x27;s tried all sorts of creams and seen a consultant. His main difficulty has been soothing the redness and dryness of his skin which at times burns to the point that he cannot wear clothing. Arganorganics Healing Touch brought him some relief from the discmfort quite soon after the first application. It both soothed and hydrated the skin. It&#x27;s not greasy like most emolients, which made it easier to apply before going out or going to bed. Since his eczema is literally all over his body I only wish it was sold in bigger jars.</li>
            <li> I have inflammation and irritated/red skin patches on my arms from an autoimmune condition. My doctor gave me steroid cream to use when I get an acute attack, but it causes bleaching/spots and I wanted something I could use all the time as prevention, not just when I have a flare up. This cream is light and absorbs quickly. I can apply it daily to the spots that I know get irritated and flare up easily. The smell is light but not super appealing - almost like yams. Not enough to make me stop using it though. After one week I cant say this product has cured my irritated skin, but there is a significant improvement in the redness and itchiness. Also, no bleaching of the infected area which makes it less noticeable to others (in my mind at least). I still have lots of product left, so I am undecided if I would order again (am considering trying Gold Bonds or Aveeno eczema therapy next).</li>
            <li> I have used various creams such as E45, Dermalex and even Palmers Cocoa Butter to try and treat my psoriasis which I&#x27;ve had in and around my ears and at the nape of my neck but to no avail have they helped it. They either made it sting or were too greasy. What I like about this cream is that it is light, soothing and smells nice too. Easy to apply for wherever needed aswell. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review on Amazon, but this excellent product has prompted me to do so! Everything about it just works for me. I put all over my face, yes, including my eyelids... It is soothing, calming and moisturizing; and I have an oily T-zone with very sensitive skin. I put in on my body and scalp where I also have eczema, itcy patches. It also lasts as the consistency is easy to spread. I wish Amazon brings this back ASAP!!!</li>
            <li> Does provide some relief with unfailing, diligent use. Thought the product was faulty when first received because the instructions said to shake well, which was not possible because the mass was very thick and stuck to one side of the container. However, after a day or two in the bathroom, that softened up and can now be applied with ease and does feel well on the skin. However, it is not a cure. The situation would quickly return once regular application ceased.</li>
            <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t actually help heal eczema (I&#x27;ve resorted to the Rx Tropicort, which consistently gets rid of my seasonal eczema). It does moisturize well and help the itching stop. I like the texture a lot, and the smell is minimal (which I love). But it&#x27;s expensive considering it&#x27;s really just a nice, soothing moisturizer--not actually an eczema fixer.</li>
            <li> This cream is not what I expected It has a pasty consistency and did not relieve my eczema symptons.  There are better products on the market for eczema..</li>
            <li> My 9-year old son has eczema.  We tried everything, including steroid creams.  We found that this helps him the most.&lt;br /&gt;I combine this cream with Emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema/dermatitis on my legs and this combination stops the itching almost instantly.</li>
            <li> I have a small problem affecting my ears, but. This product is amazing, a small amount each day soothes and stops the itching all day. I ts easy to apply and does not stain, goes a very long way a jar lasts me a year, I have bought some recently for my son, who has bad Excema it soothes this very well .</li>
            <li> This cream gives me instant relief of my eczema on my hands and in the face.&lt;br /&gt;My itching, dry and red eczema calms down with the Healing Touch cream, like no other cream I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;Through the winter I always bring this cream with me as rescue medicine.</li>
            <li> Hi. I will once I have a camera post a couple of images.....I have dry psorisis, same as my grandfather, same as his grandfather....its gradually got worse over the last 3 years....but not  as bad as many sufferers ( and for that I am lucky) Mainly my elbows and forehead, cheeks and eybrow area.&lt;br /&gt;I have used just about everything to stop myself looking like a belisha beacon.... Only this cream works... my routine is warm damp flannels to soften the area...and then rub in this cream.... the relief is near instantaneous, itching stops....I do this on average 3 times a day during a lare up....andw then just in the mornings and at evening when things calm down. After a week my elbows look nothing more than caloused, and my red face is 90% back to normal.... A couple of other good points are it does not damage your clothes and does not make you look greasy....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a final note...and as a regular purchaser.... I cannot recommend this product in a more higher manner than to say....it has changed my life.. Thank you</li>
            <li> I think the product works well but the smell it not so pleasing!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I&#x27;ve found in many years for controlling the redness and dryness of my Psoriasis. Loved it so much that I&#x27;ve already reordered. Give it a go.</li>
            <li> After trying various over the shelf and prescribed creams and steroid gels I am now using this product regularly with a lot better results. Highly recommended and will be using from now on.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife. She has psoriasis flare-ups on her hands including cracks and bleeding. The healing touch cream has helped tremendously. It absorbs well and helps keep her hands moist for awhile. She also applies it at night and wears white cotton gloves. Definitely helps her sleep better and the dry skin doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; while she sleeps. We&#x27;ll keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Works well. Cleared up a couple of small patches and always soothes the itching.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and skin feels lots better. Spots are looks clearer, no itching . Great product effective as described. Thanks</li>
            <li> So far so good has worked</li>
            <li> bought this product regulary and its an amazing product super fast results after a 1 week use.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed... My son has severe eczema. I have been searching so hard for something that I thought would help. I saw this and ordered it... When it came in the writing on the label was somewhat rubbed off..then I opened it and no seal at all on it and it looked like it had been dug into... Then I figured maybe I would rub some on me to see how it felt.. It felt disgusting and went in the garbage.. A total waste of money#</li>
