            <li> With all the rave review I was really hoping this would be amazing but it&#x27;s just kinda eh for me. Ive been mixing mineral powders for my brow colors for years which is great except they can be shimmery. I also wanted something that really lasted well. Unfortunately this was a lighter color than what I wanted and lasted about the same as what I had been using.</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent service from Anastasia Beverly Hills . Wife happy.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Same as department store merchandise; authentic</li>
            <li> Best brow powder out there.  Everyone thinks I have naturally perfect brows.  Love it!  Even on days when I don&#x27;t wear other makeup, I will use the lighter side of this duo to just enhance my brows.  Remember, you need frames for the windows of your soul! Have you seen people that don&#x27;t have eyebrows?  There&#x27;s something not right when you look at their face.  You can&#x27;t quite put your finger on it, but you can sense something feels &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;. Add brows and voila! Everything returns to proportion.  Give it a try.  This powder lasts FOREVER!  Make sure you get the applicator and spoolie too.  They work well together!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product. The container has changed, but still the same great product. Don&#x27;t leave home without your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Like all Anastasia Brow Products, this one is great. I use her DipBrow pomade and ordered this to complement it so I can combine them or use either one alone. Her brow products are the best and it is important to use the correct brush. Her brow brush with spoolie is great.</li>
            <li> Great color, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t break apart in compact... do occasionally need to reapply again in addition to the once in the morning.</li>
            <li> been using this product for nearly 5 years. . .does what it is slated to do and is not difficult to apply</li>
            <li> I really like this brow powered and am now eager to try Anastasia&#x27;s Dipbrow pomade.</li>
            <li> Anastasia is the premier brand of eyebrow makeup. I&#x27;m blond and this color is perfect.</li>
            <li> best brow makeup ever</li>
            <li> this is my fav powder duo. the last one i had for 3 years. you need to buy a separate brush but it is really good.</li>
            <li> its a lil bit darker than picture , amazing for medium or thick brow to fill spaces, NOT a light brow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these brow powders for years. I&#x27;ve tried others, but this product lasts all day and the color varieties are super.</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow color combination for blonds!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I would give it a 5 IF only I didn&#x27;t have to waste money each purchase by having no use whatsoever for the 2nd color included. Why can&#x27;t these colors be sold separately? Guess customers wouldn&#x27;t have to buy it as often. EXACTLY.</li>
            <li> The only brow product I ever use</li>
            <li> I got medium brown and it seemed a bit more ashy colored that I was expecting--I almost bought ash brown but am glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, very pigmented, fast shipping</li>
