            <li>Of course, being able to sneak under the gum line to remove food particles is part of the purpose.</li>
            <li>I want more.</li>
            <li>I am a devotee of the ABC Oral Care \\&quot;AFT Multiple Pattern 5 Manual Toothbrushes\\&quot; which are the best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever had--ever.  </li>

            <li>I love these toothbrushes.  </li>

            <li>They really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>quality is excellent and I would definitely buy from them again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the bristles.</li>
            <li>and I like it better than any toothbrush that I have used.</li>
            <li>These were just okay.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Seems more appropriate for childrens sized mouth.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>even those sporting her favorite characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you by this, make sure it is for children.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I would recommend this product to my families, friends and patients.</li>
            <li>I love the result after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I want everyone I care about to use them, is how much I love them.</li>

            <li>and I LOVE them.</li>
            <li>( don&#x27;t let your kids eat too many limes or lemons).</li>
            <li>Just takes a bit more time.</li>
            <li>It removed more plague and food particles from teeth and gums than the electric brush.  </li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice since I received it, but this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li>My last dental checkup was perfect.</li>
            <li>Love these tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the cleaning effect, though.</li>
            <li>These brushes, although soft-feeling, actually do a better job of cleaning my teeth, and the shorter length of the brush allows access without pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love Love Love them,</li>
            <li>Better for enamel.</li>
            <li>do I have to type more than 15 words,</li>
            <li>Some things I still like done manually :)</li>
            <li>With these I am able to brush more vigorously without worrying about hurting my gums and teeth.  </li>
            <li>more frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are my family&#x27;s favorite toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>These are okay.  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>They also feel like they get in-between my teeth better.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find compact head toothbrushes in the stores in my area any more.  </li>
            <li>these are just ok.  </li>
            <li>bought on a whim because i was looking for smaller tooth brush &amp; they turned out to be awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not buying that they get between teeth better.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, especially for children.</li>
            <li>Works better than any brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>They are a great size, the bristles are soft and fine as stated, and they do a great job of getting our teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Has a nice handle \\&quot;feel\\&quot; and I love the fun colors!  </li>
            <li>Best of all, the bristles are pretty gentle, so they won&#x27;t hurt your gums.</li>
            <li>These are pretty good.  </li>
            <li>you first start using them, you&#x27;re gums will tingle, but that goes away fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have no direct proof that this excellent dentist visit was because of these brushes, but I have to assume that is</li>
            <li>They are so soft, which is great for the gums.</li>
            <li>but it seems great so far.  </li>
            <li>Great if you&#x27;re under five, will die in 3 uses if you&#x27;re an adult.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are great for people with sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>these toothbrushes are ideal for people with smaller mouths or who still have all their wisdom teeth-which I have both.</li>
            <li>She loved it so much that she asked about the brand and where did I get it.</li>
            <li>The brushes are truly soft and very effective in brushing.</li>
            <li>The fine soft bristles give you great cleaning all around, and between teeth.</li>
            <li>but they clean better.  </li>
            <li>More important, they are absolutely comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>I gave up on manual toothbrushes a while ago since I got a better clean with an electric, but he still prefers manual.  </li>
            <li>the brush is easy on the gums and tongue, too.</li>
            <li>I have been using these tooth brushes for over a year now and was extremely pleased when my dentist commented on how clean my teeth were.</li>
            <li>Bought more of these to travel with and now my teeth are squeeky clean on vacation.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how much cleaner my family&#x27;s teeth are after using these!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nicely soft, and the pointed bristle tips clean great.</li>
            <li>They provide the best maneuverability I have ever experienced with a toothbrush- maneuverability that large bulky toothbrushes don&#x27;t allow for (spots that are hard to reach are very easily accessible with these toothbrushes).</li>
            <li>Quality is fine.</li>
            <li>I bought them to use as travel toothbrushes, so we don&#x27;t use them every day, but they have done fine when we&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li>It has ultra fine bristles so it doesn&#x27;t hurt my jum.  </li>
            <li>When I demoted the brush to auto detailing duty, it was still holding up fine.</li>
            <li>The ultra fine bristols get in between my teeth and under the gum line.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>although no one did, some said they would probably work just fine.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t like the new brushes that feel more like a stick than a brush; it has fine, soft bristles that can get into the gum line and between teeth to do a very good cleaning.</li>
            <li>ordered these b/c they we so much cheaper than nimbus, wish I&#x27;d known better!</li>
            <li>Best soft toothbrush we bought so far for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Huge fan of these.</li>
            <li>I was hunting for a cheap pack of toothbrushes</li>
            <li>Great brush leaves mouth feeling fresher than regular brushes.  </li>
            <li>Not particularly cheap, but perfect for toddlers-</li>
            <li>package).&lt;br /&gt;7) Fit my travel toothbrush holder that I got at target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Considering that you get 5 of them for cheap</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap in price.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle and extremely effective.  </li>
            <li>they are soft and they feel good on you gums.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush for kids and sensitive gums/tooth enamel.</li>
            <li>Okay, who orders toothbrushes online, right?</li>
            <li>I feel that the fine bristles are getting my teeth really clean.  </li>
            <li>Works great - very gentle and soft for my teeth.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the small (PERFECT) children&#x27;s brush anywhere.</li>
            <li>I like the straightforward efficient design.</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth, so these are perfect for me!</li>
            <li>super fine bristles cleans between teeth and along your gum line.</li>
            <li>These gently clean at the gum-line.  </li>
            <li>Now, I do know how to properly clean my teeth, my dentist is always praising me.</li>
            <li>But I clean my teeth faster with this manual brush than when I am using my electric brush.</li>
            <li>Use these to clean my pups teeth.</li>
            <li>The bristles have a flexibility that I suppose makes them \\&quot;soft\\&quot; but this doesn&#x27;t deter their ability to clean.</li>
            <li>I may have to try more toothbrush to find the really soft ones, but this one is better than the choices I have at the Safeway in my neighborhood.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gets my teeth really clean.  </li>
            <li>my teeth, gums and mouth don&#x27;t feel nearly as clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth do feel clean after use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of electric toothbrushes, and nothing has ever made my teeth feel as clean as these do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does seem to clean</li>
            <li>I have oral Lichen Planus which requires me to keep my gums and teeth continuosly clean to mitigate gum inflamation.  </li>
            <li>They feel good and apparently are doing a super job too.</li>
            <li>They really get my teeth clean and my dentist last time told me to keep up the good work!</li>
            <li>It cleans as good if not better than my electric toothbrush from Oral B Pulsonic which I love!</li>
            <li>The cleaning between the teeth is not as good as flossing, but better than any other brush that I have tried.</li>
            <li>You often twist the handle (e.g. right hand doing right inside, top teeth).</li>
            <li>Anyways... the small head allows perfect access to them with no stretching of my cheeks and no funny faces lol.</li>
            <li>My point is that you still need to remember to brush gently with these, even though they&#x27;re softer than most soft-bristle brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At last I found a good serviceable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The good ones have a short life.</li>
            <li>If the expense of only using 20% of the life of a toothbrush is not a concern, it is a good product.</li>
            <li>i was ready to spend more on brushes, which sell with the title,</li>
            <li>Nice and soft, but still cleans so well.  </li>
            <li>Micro filaments to get into crevices, nice and soft to prevent damage</li>
            <li>The bristles on these seem to be just a tad too soft to be effective and</li>
            <li>She said the brush was so soft that she was getting her own.</li>
            <li>And the price (or at least when I bought it, as Amazon prices fluctuate quite a bit sometimes) was awesome.</li>
            <li>Since she short cut her teeth brushing often, a good brush to compensate for her short-coming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very demanding when it comes to oral hygiene and in my opinion, most of the brushes sold in grocery stores and places like CVS are garbage.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this brush and it feels promising, so for now,  I am satisfied and will continue to use the brush.</li>
            <li>It cleans very well, better than a regular toothbrush and maybe even as good as a sonicare.</li>
            <li>I tried these hoping to making brushing effective but painless and help keep tartar from building near the gumline.  </li>
            <li>The price is not bad at all for the pack.</li>
            <li>The price is not bad either.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for her small mouth!  </li>
            <li>But even without that verification, I do know that the brushes are super soft (even though they are called Medium) and feel great and that my teeth feel very clean after I&#x27;ve brushed (for 2 or 3 minutes) with them.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are much more effictive than the traditional brushes, they clean better arund the gum line and are also alot softer.  </li>
            <li>My FEELING is that they do a good job since the bristles are fine and since the brushes are small you spend more time brushing.</li>
            <li>It is a better clean than even my electric toothbrush, and way, way better than the standard manual brushes.  </li>
            <li>Fine bristles that get in between the teeth and up around the gums, but very gently so.</li>
            <li>: Because the tips of the bristles are so fine, I think the toothbrushes wear out pretty quickly</li>
            <li>I mean OUTSTANDING!!!</li>
            <li>i am very much satisfied with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>non-nylon, tapered, soft, and ultra fine bristles - AFT multiple pattern 5 manual toothbrushes]] - really great.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but get the job done Great for little ones to hold and use on their own</li>
            <li>I say these are excellent because they are wonderfully soft and narrow to fit between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I first learned about tapered bristles 3-4 years ago with a free toothbrush provided on a Korean Air flight... in coach class...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a whole lot of different brushes but these are by far the best on my gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;HOWEVER, the only redeeming quality of this brush is that its great for reaching those &amp;#34;hard to reach&amp;#34; corners of your teeth that regular heads can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li>still, the &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; toothbrushes are nice and soft and do give me a nice change of pace from my power brush, especially when out of town.</li>
            <li>However, I was looking for a new toothbrush and with the good customer reviews, I thought I would try something new.</li>
            <li>I do notice that when they get near the end of their lifespan they do not feel as clean, but they seem to hold up better than the $3-5 toothbrushes at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re</li>
            <li>I have found that these seem to clean my teeth better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and they are ultra-gentle and soft.</li>
            <li>I love the way they clean my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>Very very fine and soft bristles.</li>
            <li>It is soft enough not to hurt gum, a real pleasure to brush my teeth now, which has been more than before just because of the level of comfort now experienced.</li>
            <li>excellent and last a long time.</li>
            <li>The head is also very compact to make it easy to reach the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li>These are far superior to any of the normal supermarket and pharmacy-carried toothbrushes made by Oral B or Colgate.</li>
            <li>They seem to hold up better than all we&#x27;ve had in the past and do a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li>These get my teeth clean while being very gentle to my gums.</li>
            <li>I personally use GUM brand&#x27;s toothbrush with tapered bristles and love it!</li>
            <li>They are pretty too!</li>
            <li>Love these soft toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>The bristles are gentle yet clean better than my other brushes, amazing.</li>
            <li>The tapered bristles do a great job reaching into every little crevice.</li>
            <li>Great tooth brushes for the little ones.</li>
            <li>Perfect for little mouths and healthy gums because they are so much softer than standard brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are great, but they can be harsh on the gums.</li>
            <li>Are more for a child&#x27;s mouth, not an adult.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>The brush is smaller than I prefer (for my own use) but this is my fault for not noticing before I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>We all love this toothbrush, even my 4 year old uses one.</li>
            <li>I have never had issues with pain or bleeding using virtually any toothbrush, including my powerful Sonicarem</li>
            <li>The soft bristles work better at getting into the gum line than the electric brush</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>love the size and soft brushes.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old loves these brushes soo much and is now loving to brush.  </li>
            <li>But if you have a lot of teeth you will find that this one fits even to the back ones quite nicely.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t review this toothbrush right away, as I wanted to use it for a while.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing fancy or automated or computer-programmed about these toothbrushes - they are manually operated which means the user must know how to operate a toothbrush the right way.</li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s right, a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, we&#x27;ve tried all kinds and brands of tooth and these are unique, high quality, and by far our favorite.</li>
            <li>good for when your company forgot to bring a toothbrush or children (head is too small), cheap build</li>
            <li>not even sure how I found them, but I was so surprised after using one of them for the first time.</li>
            <li>No matter what kind of mouth or teeth you have, I heard a long time ago that a small, soft toothbrush head is the best thing for the health your gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are super soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love how these densely packed, soft, fine bristles not only clean my teeth but also allow me to concentrate my efforts on the gumline without any worry of shredding gum tissues.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these brushes and will buy a bunch more in the near future</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for small mouths of children as well.</li>
            <li>If you need the softest toothbrush, then the nimbus is the best and worth a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li>Makes brushing more enjoyable, especially for young children.</li>
            <li>have ordered a number of times now and they are consistently just right.</li>
            <li>almost individually (can&#x27;t get away with much side sweeping, which should probably be avoided anyway), so in that sense it&#x27;ll take more time to get a clean feel.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and clean my teeth amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>It is very soft and comfortable for using.</li>
            <li>Love them for the shape - fits right into my mouth, and also for the softness of bristles and different colors - now I know whose brush is in the travel bag - my boyfriend is not someone who pays attention to the details and before was grubbing mine.</li>
            <li>I have a really tiny mouth and these are very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I received the item today, which was very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, the price is very reasonable at under $3 a piece.</li>
            <li>I like the &amp;#34;blotting brushes&amp;#34; very much and use 2-3 times each day.  </li>
            <li>These are the kind of toothbrushes I&#x27;ve been looking for because they are super soft and they do no further damage.</li>
            <li>I like the bristles in particular because they are soft but their fine points do help clean my teeth better than traditional bristles.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super, super soft.</li>
            <li>And the ultra fine bristles mostly just succeeded in finding their way down in to my gums and hurting.</li>
            <li>But all of those things bother my mouth and gums and my dentist highly recommends most people to use a soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li>just the right size, soft, and whatever the bristles are made of seems to keep them really clean</li>
            <li>i am ordering some more for future use.</li>
            <li>Your teeth will feel cleaner after just the first use.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I gave some to my friends and both ordered more the following day.</li>
            <li>I bled at the first time.</li>
            <li>, my gums bled a lot after the first time I used this brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles is ultra soft end comfortable</li>
            <li>Better than American toothbrush.</li>
            <li>However, these have been consistently growing mold spots after about two months of use.</li>
            <li>I just tried it for the first time, and it seems to do what it claims:  </li>
            <li>My whole family agrees!</li>
            <li>I think the first pack lasted about 5-6 months.</li>
            <li>bristles are thicker, softer, and more resilient than those on a traditional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I really noticed that my mouth felt fresh longer throughout the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it does help with these things, though I won&#x27;t know for sure until I go for my next cleaning.  </li>
            <li>My kids (8 and 10) also like to use them since they have pretty compact heads.  </li>
            <li>And it is not expensive</li>
            <li>: I feel as if these get into the crevices between my teeth and around my gums better than regular brushes do.</li>
            <li>The seller emailed me at the first purchase to let me know it takes a while to get used to if you have not been using brushes that floss - there may be tenderness until you get used to it, just like if you have not been flossing for awhile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Subsequent brushing did not cause any significant bleeding, but my teeth NEVER felt clean after brushing with this brush.</li>
            <li>and I find that the ultra fine bristles are flexible enough to get in between the wires to really get the my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>This product is plain and simply a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Yes, there was tartar to clean, but my gums didn&#x27;t hurt as much during the cleaning, and even my two highly touch-sensitive teeth didn&#x27;t make me see stars when the hygienist had to use the pick on them.  </li>
            <li>These are very good, much softer than normal hard bristle and yet cleans well.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are super clean, fresh breath, teeth look white, and it cleans my tongue really well too (</li>
            <li>i was thinking that long, soft bristles would be the opposite of strong or a good scrub</li>
            <li>We wanted something smaller that can get into hard to reach places and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>love them, soft (but not too soft that they don&#x27;t hold up)</li>
            <li>Until now, I&#x27;ve not recently been able to find a toothbrush that really suits me.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are fine on the top and actually do penetrate in places where it&#x27;s not usually possible.  </li>
            <li>feeling, stick with either the Oral B super soft, Colgate super soft of my personal favorite, Dr. Collins Perio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thought the size of the brush head was good for their small mouths.</li>
            <li>Nice, firm brush hair that does clean well, and yet feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>The soft bristles are gentle on my gums, yet clean my teeth</li>
            <li>They are soft but clean very well.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft but they clean teeth very well and do not injure gum tissue.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my 5 year old, as I find children&#x27;s toothbrushes wear out so quickly.</li>
            <li>item has a tiny brush area, which makes bristles easy to brush one tooth at a time.</li>
            <li>My co-worker told me she found some super soft toothbrushes on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft, so they don&#x27;t hurt my gums and the head of the toothbrush</li>
            <li>Super soft bristles.</li>
            <li>These are like the super soft brushes from the dentist.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>I was expecting them to be a little more firm, but they sure did get my teeth clean anyways!</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I stopped using this brush soon after &amp; am more satisfied using normal brushes (primarily my Sonicare).</li>
            <li>Although, they are small and look rather impotent, they job they do is exceptional.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely looooves her new toothbrushes!!  </li>
            <li>good for you if you want to protect your teeth and not damaging it using hard brushes</li>
            <li>The tapered bristles really do make a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really picky about toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The bristles are so gentle.</li>
            <li>I have a very tender mouth, tender gums.  </li>
            <li>I needed something reasonably priced that does the job.  </li>
            <li>really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re Pam from Archer (who can famously fit several pool balls in her mouth), you&#x27;ll find these somewhat lacking.</li>
            <li>i can really feel the scrubbing in between teeth and between teeth and gum area.</li>
            <li>but they really do penetrate and scrub away.</li>
            <li>I find some toothbrushes too big to use comfortably.</li>
            <li>They look like they would work very well for your children</li>
            <li>I really like how they really do get into the gumline to take out the food and bacteria buildup.</li>
            <li>aren&#x27;t we talking too much already?</li>
            <li>They are labeled as \\&quot;medium\\&quot; but they are much softer than a medium brush bought at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a gentle toothbrush, this is the one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see it as an issue because you can afford to change them out</li>
            <li>Not the softest, but reasonable.</li>
            <li>and they are much gentler on your gums.</li>
            <li>can fit into the nooks-and-crannies of crooked teeth.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>have never been able to buy one this soft at a regular drug store!!!</li>
            <li>The bristols are soft enough I don&#x27;t worry about removing more enamel while still cleaning  well.  </li>
            <li>I threw all of them away after a couple days of using the first one, and bought some adult toothbrushes--for full grown adult jaws--in the nearest store.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well they clean and are very soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are really soft but the size is right for the kids.</li>
            <li>These brushes are much softer and feel better than any other I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I just had a cleaning at the dentist -- my first \\&quot;full cycle\\&quot; in visiting the dentist after starting to use these toothbrushes (a full 6 months between cleanings, and using these brushes twice daily for the whole 6 months).  </li>
            <li>These seem like they&#x27;d be okay for kids, but too my adult mouth, the head seemed too small which means more time brushing, and the bristles felt too soft.  </li>
            <li>the fine, long bristles really dig in there.</li>
            <li>soft bristles, but not so soft it feels like your teeth aren&#x27;t getting clean.</li>
            <li>The beauty of this toothbrush is the strong-soft bristles which clean, do not harm and last for a month and beyond.  </li>
            <li>Big clean smiles all around.</li>
            <li>I used the brush and it didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth or gums, plus it left my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>The smaller head whizzes around the mouth easily; and the finer bristles do a fine job of scrubbing the teeth, gums, tongue, and all other surfaces.</li>
            <li>These bristles really do seem like a whole new technology in oral care.</li>
            <li>Has specially designed bristles that are unlike American toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>you are looking for super soft ones for your sensitive gums, I do not recommend these.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve never had one of those electric toothbrushes, I feel like these are better than a lot of average electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>So glad I read about bass brushes and that led me to this.</li>
            <li>I like them better than anything I&#x27;ve found so far, including several soft kids brushes that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The ultra-fine bristles are able to deep clean the tight spaces and under the gums.</li>
            <li>They are soft and easy on the teeth and gums but unlike conventional soft brushes, these get between teeth well and clean</li>
            <li>The feel of the bristles is good --not too hard and not mushy like some soft brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; bristles do better at getting between the teeth and slightly under the gums.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m German and have had a highly respectable dentist tell me I have a &#x27;&#x27;German jaw&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>But now that I&#x27;m older, I get it.</li>
            <li>head of the toothbrush is smaller than most, but personally, I do not believe it detracts from my brushing experience.</li>
            <li>They do seem to get in areas such as under the gum line better then the standard brush bristles.  </li>
            <li>Top of the package says &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; but the back of the individual toothbrush says &amp;#34;sensitive medium&amp;#34; as you can see in the pic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These tooth brushes are very soft and cleaned very well.  </li>
            <li>And I have also experienced a clean feeling of my gums that I&#x27;ve never experienced with other brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the produt.</li>
            <li>and i felt clean teeth after a long time.  </li>
            <li>soft and fine bristles, no more bleeding while brushing, can clean thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Very soft but cleans better than regular brushes, especially between teeth and gum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult, but I don&#x27;t have a large mouth.</li>
            <li>And because of their small size they are very easily maneuverable in your mouth to get in all crevices.</li>
            <li>so I am used to and like the small head to be able to clean properly around all my teeth, so the size works well for me.</li>
            <li>I saw a similar type of fine bristle toothbrush with a larger head at Whole Foods for $6 each.</li>
            <li>I gave up trying to find a soft toothbrush that cleans really well, just didn&#x27;t exist.</li>
            <li>If you like using the soft brushes for your brushing, I would really recommend these.</li>
            <li>I like them because they&#x27;re soft and gentle on the teeth.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft and gentle to your teeth.</li>
            <li>So far my orthodontist and my dentist have both said that I am taking care of my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>They may be small and suitable for a child&#x27;s hand and mouth</li>
            <li>It is really soft and works very well.  </li>
            <li>Have sensitive teeth &amp; gums and these work very well.</li>
            <li>The bristles are absolutely soft and do not irritate her gentle gums whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Soft yet cleans really well.</li>
            <li>So soft its like a gentle massage for your teeth.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price here for all 5, the bristles feel way different than any manual toothbrush on the market I have tried.</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit concerned because it said Sensitive Medium on the package, yet the description said that they were a soft bristle toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>IMO, if the bleeding goes away in 2-3 days, then it&#x27;s perfectly normal.</li>
            <li>Most toothbrushes are too harsh, and the length of the brush head aggravates the gum issue by not accommodating the curve of my inside teeth.  </li>
            <li>My mouth is too sensitive for the electric-style toothbrushes (don&#x27;t want to spend $140 on sonicare, so not able to comment on that kind).</li>
            <li>I had a junky &#x27;normal&#x27; brush in my travel bag for business trips -- replaced with one of these.  </li>
            <li>And by using small ones, you could brush your teeth more slowly and carefully, which is good!</li>
            <li>I find that the smaller head allows me to get around the back of my molars easily.</li>
            <li>Also, these are some of the softest, most gentle toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever used, which is good for me, because I have receding gums (a result of brushing too hard with tough bristled toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Bristles are extremely gentle for teeth and gums but strong and fine enough to penetrate deep within narrow crevices.</li>
            <li>This has the right amount of brushes to last a year since it is recommended that you get a new one every three months.</li>
            <li>However, Amazon was out of the mutitple-pattern and I needed toothbrushes, so I opted for the \\&quot;New Generation\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>B0049YANBO The new generation US patented,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m someone who brushes too hard, so these are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This little toothbrush CAN clean those areas!</li>
            <li>Soft and strong, small head, which is exactly what I need to deal with my early-stage</li>
            <li>I have all of my teeth and find that I can&#x27;t get the larger style toothbrushes to fit into the back of my mouth where my wisdom teeth are.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are very soft and do not cause any pain while brushing.</li>
            <li>For those who need soft brushes is the alternative, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I want to highly recommand this soft toothbrush to you.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and do not irritate my gums.  </li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>Have tried so many different brands/styles, none are soft, and they just get harder the longer they are used.  </li>
            <li>At first the brush felt prickly, but I could also feel it reaching further below the gumline and between teeth.  </li>
            <li>Proper dental hygiene requires precision brushing and these brushes are the exact instruments for the job.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for SOFT brush,  this is it!</li>
            <li>They must get in the small spaces a lot better than his electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>When I first used one I \\&quot;over\\&quot; brushed and my gums became irritated for a day or two, but after that I had no problems.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft!</li>
            <li>My son has crooked bottom teeth, and yet when we go to the dentist for regular checkup, the dentist marvels at how clean his teeth are</li>
            <li>These brushes wok great, the heads are a little small and will take time to get use too.  </li>
            <li>It not only is soft, it cleans very very well.</li>
            <li>Vary\\&quot; and they are very soft and are adult</li>
            <li>I was expecting very soft brush like nimbus, but these are not that soft.</li>
            <li>You will acutally enjoy brushing with this soft tooth brush and avoid   gum issues down the road.</li>
            <li>I have been told to go easy on the brushing by my dentist, but it is hard to find gentle brushes.  </li>
            <li>By the second day, I was used to the smaller size, and by the third day I appreciated it because it made it easier to reach some areas to clean.  </li>
            <li>Like others have suggested, I coupled these with a novamin based toothpaste (pretty much the only commercial product proven to remineralize teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>People have complained that the heads are small like a child&#x27;s toothbrush, but I think the slightly smaller heads are wonderful.</li>
            <li>Small brush is really good for your teeth, but next time I will go back to Colgate</li>
            <li>When I brushed my teeth for the first time I was surprised at how soft the bristles felt.</li>
            <li>This Sanha brush is a similar design, very soft, and works very well.  </li>
            <li>The soft is better for the gums as it is less likely to push the gums so they recede.  </li>
            <li>At first, you will feel a little discomfort from brushing, but I promise you that&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s cleaning an area that has probably been not so clean before.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft, yet clean well and can get down under my gum line without trashing the tissue.  </li>
            <li>The head of the brush is indeed smaller than regular brushes but one great advantage that this affords is that it makes it easier to brush those hard to reach spots (like those molars at the very back of your mouth).</li>
            <li>And my previous tooth brush couldn&#x27;t clean the crevice thoroughly.</li>
            <li>You can tell after using them that they really clear up any debris around the gum line.  </li>
            <li>received the package of 5 colorful toothbrushes and my first impression was that they were indeed small compared to what I had been used to.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended using a soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These are soft.</li>
            <li>And they are soft, as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I had so many problems with a toothbrush advertising as &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;, but it was at least medium or firmer.  </li>
            <li>I came across this tooth brush in amazon when i was searching for a tooth brush with soft bristles.</li>
            <li>They feel so much softer than traditional bristles</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a soft toothbrush for 4 years.</li>
            <li>I was completely amazed at how well these cleaned my teeth.</li>
            <li>So far, it has exceeded expectations in every way.  </li>
            <li>Because it is so soft, I have suffered no gum irritation either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are really soft and will not hurt your gums if they are tender like mine.  </li>
            <li>Me, my husband, and my two year old</li>
            <li>Since the bristles are so soft, I can brush my sensitive gums without making them bleed.   </li>
            <li>These are no where near as soft.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize until after I used one of the tooth brushes that they were not ultra soft, they were soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li>, I wish I had been told about the benefit of using a soft brush when I was a child</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for children or adults with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>I feel like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are different from all the rest I really like them</li>
            <li>I bought the brushes for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>I have considerable experience with oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>i used to buy expansive Toothbrushes and couldn&#x27;t find soft.</li>
            <li>It seems this toothbrush is marketed to those with sensitive gums, which I have never had.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just too soft.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been to the dentist yet for a professional opinion</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>I need to use sensitive type toothpaste because of tooth sensitivity in that area.</li>
            <li>I have the larger bristles and feel like they are much easier on my gums.</li>
            <li>I am a petite adult with braces.</li>
            <li>My teeth are also sensitive and some of the enamel has come off.  </li>
            <li>Some reviewers complained about the size of the toothbrush, I actually really love the compactness of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Some soft brushes feel as if they are made for toddlers, but these have both strength and softness.</li>
            <li>They are the softest I&#x27;ve found so far, and my boys like the gem-like colors.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my two and five year old.</li>
            <li>These ultra soft bristles do not hurt his sensitive mouth</li>
            <li>And the soft, no electric bristles do not brush away the gums.  </li>
            <li>I also used to have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>not as soft as I&#x27;d hope.</li>
            <li>I prefer the soft bristles.</li>
            <li>These are soft.</li>
            <li>As good as the more expensive brand names I&#x27;ve purchased over the last few years.</li>
            <li>I have tried Perio brushes, which are good, but also expensive.</li>
            <li>This brush will get your teeth super clean without irritating your gums.</li>
            <li>The fine bristles make it ease to clean in between teeth and difficult places.  </li>
            <li>They are smaller than normal toothbrushes, and very soft.  </li>
            <li>With a small head, you can get easily reach every tooth in your head.</li>
            <li>These are supposed to be good because they&#x27;re small and get in to tight places.  </li>
            <li>For the last three months, I have been using a Steripod cover, which seems to be helping, as no mold has developed yet on this particular brush.</li>
            <li>well if I don&#x27;t miss any spots due to the fact that I have an adult male human jaw, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that I get the same--if not better--clean with my old toothbrushes due to the fact that they are made for adult jaw</li>
            <li>I bought these toothbrushes really just because of the odd amount positive reviews for them.</li>
            <li>great, I have a hard time finding small head toothbrushes in the store, I will buy again, they met my expatiations.</li>
            <li>Also, they are extremely thorough in how they clean because the bristles are so thin, pointed, and there are so many bristles per square inch.</li>
            <li>If you like a small brush, or are buying it for a child, then this would be fine.  </li>
            <li>These bristles retain their shape far better than those found on ultra soft nylon brushes, but they do require a few extra seconds of rinsing prior to replacing the toothbrush in its holder to ensure nothing is retained to foul the brush.</li>
            <li>Combine this with daily oil pulling (extra virgin coconut oil) and ayurvedic Super Comfort Rescue tooth powder and you will never need to go to the dentist and you will have really white teeth!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for people with the same issues I have.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles, and a small brush head size make it easy to access back teeth and avoid gum trauma.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush cleans like no other toothbrush I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>The bristles are gentle enough for sensitive gums (and kids), but they do such a thorough job!  </li>
            <li>When I brush with any \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brush, my teeth feel smooth and slick, but after using this, I could never get that feeling</li>
            <li>Pleased to say, they last as long or longer than an average toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still, I love this product, and will not go back to American toothbrushes -- I will just buy the other one they make with a big head --</li>
            <li>In contrast, if you used a normal sized toothbrush (regular heads) it would take a shorter time to brush all your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this as bigger brushes never fit in my smaller sized mouth very well to clean the backs of my front teeth.</li>
            <li>With my new order, I&#x27;ll have a total of 25 of them.</li>
            <li>I had one criticism, I would say that I would like the head of the toothbrush to be a bit larger, but I do see how the smaller head really gets \\&quot;in there and does the job.\\</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very tiny and the bristles are very soft.  </li>
            <li>It reaches places that I didn&#x27;t think was possible for a toothbrush (the bristles are fine enough to reach places I previously thought could only be reached by floss) while still being very soft.  </li>
            <li>The head is fairly small and the brush ends are definitely unique.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten used to the small head quite easily, but your experience may or may not be the same.</li>
            <li>Nobody else in the whole wide world can have these except me.</li>
            <li>No blue dye on the bristles and no smelly soft plastic on the handle.</li>
            <li>The last really soft and long-lasting toothbrush I had</li>
            <li>I have wasted so much money on brushes that \\&quot;say\\&quot; soft, but scratch my (sensitive) gums.</li>
            <li>I would post it in the review, but apparently amazon does not have an option for that.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and gental on my gum, but they work as well as regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>, I know some said it&#x27;s not extra soft.</li>
            <li>My husband would prefer one with a larger head, so I will get those for him, but I will stock up on these for myself and my 6 year old.  </li>
            <li>I decided to change back to old fashioned brushes and gave these a try based on reviews.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft enough that I use them.</li>
            <li>That said, they&#x27;re still just pretty average.</li>
            <li>For complete oral hygiene, you need to use a toothbrush not just on your teeth, but also your tongue, roof of the mouth, inside of the cheeks, and between gums and inner part of the lips.</li>
            <li>When I went to the dentist after using them for six months, I was surprised to find that I had no discomfort at all during the cleaning process, which has never been my experience in prior visits.</li>
            <li>The only brush I found, which is no longer sold in stores or on-line, were the soft, small-head Mentadent brushes.  </li>
            <li>I only use soft toothbrushes and this is one of my favorites that I&#x27;ve re-ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Finally the soft toothbrush I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I guess this toothbrush does a much better job, its smaller size and soft thin fibers</li>
            <li>It is so simple compared to the extremely convoluted modern toothbrushes when all they needed was to make the bristles soft.</li>
            <li>Small head for greater access to tight areas and soft bristles</li>
            <li>Okay, .... so I seriously don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without these toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>The small head reaches the narrowest recesses, including all the way around the back of a wisdom tooth that I have long been concerned about not being able to brush properly.  </li>
            <li>Very soft bristles that aren&#x27;t too long or too</li>
            <li>Unless you have very small teeth, these should not be your primary toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Much softer than other brushes I&#x27;ve used, and I appreciate the compact head.</li>
            <li>At first i thought the toothbrush head is too small for adult</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations because i expected it to be like the more expensive brand of similar brushes, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I received these last week, the good news is the bristles are soft, the bad news is the size of the head must be designed for toddlers.</li>
            <li>The brush head is smaller in size, a bit bigger than a child&#x27;s size brush but smaller than the adult brushes you buy at the local pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>It is a supersoft and small toothbrush, which is suitable for people with small mouth.</li>
            <li>I have dry mouth and these toothbrushes are not harsh on your gums.</li>
            <li>American SOFT toothbrushes are NOT SOFT.  </li>
            <li>Due to this, I usually experience discomfort or minor pain, especially where the gum line has receded the most or where the teeth has lost some of the enamel.  </li>

            <li> I first found this on amazon after reading some great reviews.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is also very smooth and pleasing when brushing.</li>

            <li> This is a very good and soft brush.</li>

            <li> I want more.</li>
            <li> I am a devotee of the ABC Oral Care \\&quot;AFT Multiple Pattern 5 Manual Toothbrushes\\&quot; which are the best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever had--ever.  </li>

            <li> I love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> , why do I love this toothbrush:  </li>
            <li> They really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> quality is excellent and I would definitely buy from them again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the bristles.</li>
            <li> and I like it better than any toothbrush that I have used.</li>
            <li> These were just okay.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Seems more appropriate for childrens sized mouth.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> even those sporting her favorite characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you by this, make sure it is for children.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I would recommend this product to my families, friends and patients.</li>
            <li> I love the result after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I want everyone I care about to use them, is how much I love them.</li>
            <li> Well, I am not using the ones she suggested, but I love the abcOral Care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE them.</li>
            <li> ( don&#x27;t let your kids eat too many limes or lemons).</li>
            <li> Just takes a bit more time.</li>
            <li> It removed more plague and food particles from teeth and gums than the electric brush.  </li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice since I received it, but this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My kids love the size.</li>
            <li> love this brand</li>
            <li> My last dental checkup was perfect.</li>
            <li> Love these tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the cleaning effect, though.</li>
            <li> These brushes, although soft-feeling, actually do a better job of cleaning my teeth, and the shorter length of the brush allows access without pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love Love Love them,</li>
            <li> Better for enamel.</li>
            <li> do I have to type more than 15 words,</li>
            <li> Some things I still like done manually :)</li>
            <li> With these I am able to brush more vigorously without worrying about hurting my gums and teeth.  </li>
            <li> more frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are my family&#x27;s favorite toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> These are okay.  </li>
            <li> These are my favorite toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> They also feel like they get in-between my teeth better.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find compact head toothbrushes in the stores in my area any more.  </li>
            <li> these are just ok.  </li>
            <li> bought on a whim because i was looking for smaller tooth brush &amp; they turned out to be awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not buying that they get between teeth better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, especially for children.</li>
            <li> Works better than any brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> They are a great size, the bristles are soft and fine as stated, and they do a great job of getting our teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Has a nice handle \\&quot;feel\\&quot; and I love the fun colors!  </li>
            <li> Best of all, the bristles are pretty gentle, so they won&#x27;t hurt your gums.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good.  </li>
            <li> you first start using them, you&#x27;re gums will tingle, but that goes away fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no direct proof that this excellent dentist visit was because of these brushes, but I have to assume that is</li>
            <li> They are so soft, which is great for the gums.</li>
            <li> but it seems great so far.  </li>
            <li> Great if you&#x27;re under five, will die in 3 uses if you&#x27;re an adult.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are great for people with sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> these toothbrushes are ideal for people with smaller mouths or who still have all their wisdom teeth-which I have both.</li>
            <li> She loved it so much that she asked about the brand and where did I get it.</li>
            <li> The brushes are truly soft and very effective in brushing.</li>
            <li> The fine soft bristles give you great cleaning all around, and between teeth.</li>
            <li> but they clean better.  </li>
            <li> More important, they are absolutely comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> I gave up on manual toothbrushes a while ago since I got a better clean with an electric, but he still prefers manual.  </li>
            <li> the brush is easy on the gums and tongue, too.</li>
            <li> I have been using these tooth brushes for over a year now and was extremely pleased when my dentist commented on how clean my teeth were.</li>
            <li> Bought more of these to travel with and now my teeth are squeeky clean on vacation.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how much cleaner my family&#x27;s teeth are after using these!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nicely soft, and the pointed bristle tips clean great.</li>
            <li> They provide the best maneuverability I have ever experienced with a toothbrush- maneuverability that large bulky toothbrushes don&#x27;t allow for (spots that are hard to reach are very easily accessible with these toothbrushes).</li>
            <li> Quality is fine.</li>
            <li> I bought them to use as travel toothbrushes, so we don&#x27;t use them every day, but they have done fine when we&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li> It has ultra fine bristles so it doesn&#x27;t hurt my jum.  </li>
            <li> When I demoted the brush to auto detailing duty, it was still holding up fine.</li>
            <li> The ultra fine bristols get in between my teeth and under the gum line.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> although no one did, some said they would probably work just fine.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t like the new brushes that feel more like a stick than a brush; it has fine, soft bristles that can get into the gum line and between teeth to do a very good cleaning.</li>
            <li> ordered these b/c they we so much cheaper than nimbus, wish I&#x27;d known better!</li>
            <li> Best soft toothbrush we bought so far for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Huge fan of these.</li>
            <li> I was hunting for a cheap pack of toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Great brush leaves mouth feeling fresher than regular brushes.  </li>
            <li> Not particularly cheap, but perfect for toddlers-</li>
            <li> package).&lt;br /&gt;7) Fit my travel toothbrush holder that I got at target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Considering that you get 5 of them for cheap</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap in price.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle and extremely effective.  </li>
            <li> they are soft and they feel good on you gums.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush for kids and sensitive gums/tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> Okay, who orders toothbrushes online, right?</li>
            <li> I feel that the fine bristles are getting my teeth really clean.  </li>
            <li> Works great - very gentle and soft for my teeth.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the small (PERFECT) children&#x27;s brush anywhere.</li>
            <li> I like the straightforward efficient design.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, so these are perfect for me!</li>
            <li> super fine bristles cleans between teeth and along your gum line.</li>
            <li> These gently clean at the gum-line.  </li>
            <li> Now, I do know how to properly clean my teeth, my dentist is always praising me.</li>
            <li> But I clean my teeth faster with this manual brush than when I am using my electric brush.</li>
            <li> Use these to clean my pups teeth.</li>
            <li> The bristles have a flexibility that I suppose makes them \\&quot;soft\\&quot; but this doesn&#x27;t deter their ability to clean.</li>
            <li> I may have to try more toothbrush to find the really soft ones, but this one is better than the choices I have at the Safeway in my neighborhood.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gets my teeth really clean.  </li>
            <li> my teeth, gums and mouth don&#x27;t feel nearly as clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth do feel clean after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of electric toothbrushes, and nothing has ever made my teeth feel as clean as these do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does seem to clean</li>
            <li> I have oral Lichen Planus which requires me to keep my gums and teeth continuosly clean to mitigate gum inflamation.  </li>
            <li> They feel good and apparently are doing a super job too.</li>
            <li> They really get my teeth clean and my dentist last time told me to keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> It cleans as good if not better than my electric toothbrush from Oral B Pulsonic which I love!</li>
            <li> The cleaning between the teeth is not as good as flossing, but better than any other brush that I have tried.</li>
            <li> You often twist the handle (e.g. right hand doing right inside, top teeth).</li>
            <li> Anyways... the small head allows perfect access to them with no stretching of my cheeks and no funny faces lol.</li>
            <li> My point is that you still need to remember to brush gently with these, even though they&#x27;re softer than most soft-bristle brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At last I found a good serviceable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The good ones have a short life.</li>
            <li> If the expense of only using 20% of the life of a toothbrush is not a concern, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> i was ready to spend more on brushes, which sell with the title,</li>
            <li> Nice and soft, but still cleans so well.  </li>
            <li> Micro filaments to get into crevices, nice and soft to prevent damage</li>
            <li> The bristles on these seem to be just a tad too soft to be effective and</li>
            <li> She said the brush was so soft that she was getting her own.</li>
            <li> And the price (or at least when I bought it, as Amazon prices fluctuate quite a bit sometimes) was awesome.</li>
            <li> Since she short cut her teeth brushing often, a good brush to compensate for her short-coming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very demanding when it comes to oral hygiene and in my opinion, most of the brushes sold in grocery stores and places like CVS are garbage.  </li>
            <li> I just started using this brush and it feels promising, so for now,  I am satisfied and will continue to use the brush.</li>
            <li> It cleans very well, better than a regular toothbrush and maybe even as good as a sonicare.</li>
            <li> I tried these hoping to making brushing effective but painless and help keep tartar from building near the gumline.  </li>
            <li> The price is not bad at all for the pack.</li>
            <li> The price is not bad either.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for her small mouth!  </li>
            <li> But even without that verification, I do know that the brushes are super soft (even though they are called Medium) and feel great and that my teeth feel very clean after I&#x27;ve brushed (for 2 or 3 minutes) with them.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are much more effictive than the traditional brushes, they clean better arund the gum line and are also alot softer.  </li>
            <li> My FEELING is that they do a good job since the bristles are fine and since the brushes are small you spend more time brushing.</li>
            <li> It is a better clean than even my electric toothbrush, and way, way better than the standard manual brushes.  </li>
            <li> Fine bristles that get in between the teeth and up around the gums, but very gently so.</li>
            <li> : Because the tips of the bristles are so fine, I think the toothbrushes wear out pretty quickly</li>
            <li> I mean OUTSTANDING!!!</li>
            <li> i am very much satisfied with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> non-nylon, tapered, soft, and ultra fine bristles - AFT multiple pattern 5 manual toothbrushes]] - really great.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but get the job done Great for little ones to hold and use on their own</li>
            <li> I say these are excellent because they are wonderfully soft and narrow to fit between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I first learned about tapered bristles 3-4 years ago with a free toothbrush provided on a Korean Air flight... in coach class...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a whole lot of different brushes but these are by far the best on my gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, the only redeeming quality of this brush is that its great for reaching those &amp;#34;hard to reach&amp;#34; corners of your teeth that regular heads can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> still, the &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; toothbrushes are nice and soft and do give me a nice change of pace from my power brush, especially when out of town.</li>
            <li> However, I was looking for a new toothbrush and with the good customer reviews, I thought I would try something new.</li>
            <li> I do notice that when they get near the end of their lifespan they do not feel as clean, but they seem to hold up better than the $3-5 toothbrushes at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re</li>
            <li> I have found that these seem to clean my teeth better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and they are ultra-gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> I love the way they clean my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> Very very fine and soft bristles.</li>
            <li> It is soft enough not to hurt gum, a real pleasure to brush my teeth now, which has been more than before just because of the level of comfort now experienced.</li>
            <li> excellent and last a long time.</li>
            <li> The head is also very compact to make it easy to reach the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> These are far superior to any of the normal supermarket and pharmacy-carried toothbrushes made by Oral B or Colgate.</li>
            <li> They seem to hold up better than all we&#x27;ve had in the past and do a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li> These get my teeth clean while being very gentle to my gums.</li>
            <li> I personally use GUM brand&#x27;s toothbrush with tapered bristles and love it!</li>
            <li> They are pretty too!</li>
            <li> Love these soft toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> The bristles are gentle yet clean better than my other brushes, amazing.</li>
            <li> The tapered bristles do a great job reaching into every little crevice.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brushes for the little ones.</li>
            <li> Perfect for little mouths and healthy gums because they are so much softer than standard brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are great, but they can be harsh on the gums.</li>
            <li> Are more for a child&#x27;s mouth, not an adult.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> The brush is smaller than I prefer (for my own use) but this is my fault for not noticing before I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> We all love this toothbrush, even my 4 year old uses one.</li>
            <li> I have never had issues with pain or bleeding using virtually any toothbrush, including my powerful Sonicarem</li>
            <li> The soft bristles work better at getting into the gum line than the electric brush</li>
            <li> but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> love the size and soft brushes.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old loves these brushes soo much and is now loving to brush.  </li>
            <li> But if you have a lot of teeth you will find that this one fits even to the back ones quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t review this toothbrush right away, as I wanted to use it for a while.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing fancy or automated or computer-programmed about these toothbrushes - they are manually operated which means the user must know how to operate a toothbrush the right way.</li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right, a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, we&#x27;ve tried all kinds and brands of tooth and these are unique, high quality, and by far our favorite.</li>
            <li> good for when your company forgot to bring a toothbrush or children (head is too small), cheap build</li>
            <li> not even sure how I found them, but I was so surprised after using one of them for the first time.</li>
            <li> No matter what kind of mouth or teeth you have, I heard a long time ago that a small, soft toothbrush head is the best thing for the health your gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are super soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I love how these densely packed, soft, fine bristles not only clean my teeth but also allow me to concentrate my efforts on the gumline without any worry of shredding gum tissues.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes and will buy a bunch more in the near future</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for small mouths of children as well.</li>
            <li> If you need the softest toothbrush, then the nimbus is the best and worth a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> Makes brushing more enjoyable, especially for young children.</li>
            <li> have ordered a number of times now and they are consistently just right.</li>
            <li> almost individually (can&#x27;t get away with much side sweeping, which should probably be avoided anyway), so in that sense it&#x27;ll take more time to get a clean feel.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and clean my teeth amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> It is very soft and comfortable for using.</li>
            <li> Love them for the shape - fits right into my mouth, and also for the softness of bristles and different colors - now I know whose brush is in the travel bag - my boyfriend is not someone who pays attention to the details and before was grubbing mine.</li>
            <li> I have a really tiny mouth and these are very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I received the item today, which was very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, the price is very reasonable at under $3 a piece.</li>
            <li> I like the &amp;#34;blotting brushes&amp;#34; very much and use 2-3 times each day.  </li>
            <li> These are the kind of toothbrushes I&#x27;ve been looking for because they are super soft and they do no further damage.</li>
            <li> I like the bristles in particular because they are soft but their fine points do help clean my teeth better than traditional bristles.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super, super soft.</li>
            <li> And the ultra fine bristles mostly just succeeded in finding their way down in to my gums and hurting.</li>
            <li> But all of those things bother my mouth and gums and my dentist highly recommends most people to use a soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li> just the right size, soft, and whatever the bristles are made of seems to keep them really clean</li>
            <li> i am ordering some more for future use.</li>
            <li> Your teeth will feel cleaner after just the first use.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I gave some to my friends and both ordered more the following day.</li>
            <li> I bled at the first time.</li>
            <li> , my gums bled a lot after the first time I used this brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles is ultra soft end comfortable</li>
            <li> Better than American toothbrush.</li>
            <li> However, these have been consistently growing mold spots after about two months of use.</li>
            <li> I just tried it for the first time, and it seems to do what it claims:  </li>
            <li> My whole family agrees!</li>
            <li> I think the first pack lasted about 5-6 months.</li>
            <li> bristles are thicker, softer, and more resilient than those on a traditional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I really noticed that my mouth felt fresh longer throughout the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it does help with these things, though I won&#x27;t know for sure until I go for my next cleaning.  </li>
            <li> My kids (8 and 10) also like to use them since they have pretty compact heads.  </li>
            <li> And it is not expensive</li>
            <li> : I feel as if these get into the crevices between my teeth and around my gums better than regular brushes do.</li>
            <li> The seller emailed me at the first purchase to let me know it takes a while to get used to if you have not been using brushes that floss - there may be tenderness until you get used to it, just like if you have not been flossing for awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Subsequent brushing did not cause any significant bleeding, but my teeth NEVER felt clean after brushing with this brush.</li>
            <li> and I find that the ultra fine bristles are flexible enough to get in between the wires to really get the my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> This product is plain and simply a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Yes, there was tartar to clean, but my gums didn&#x27;t hurt as much during the cleaning, and even my two highly touch-sensitive teeth didn&#x27;t make me see stars when the hygienist had to use the pick on them.  </li>
            <li> These are very good, much softer than normal hard bristle and yet cleans well.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are super clean, fresh breath, teeth look white, and it cleans my tongue really well too (</li>
            <li> i was thinking that long, soft bristles would be the opposite of strong or a good scrub</li>
            <li> We wanted something smaller that can get into hard to reach places and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> love them, soft (but not too soft that they don&#x27;t hold up)</li>
            <li> Until now, I&#x27;ve not recently been able to find a toothbrush that really suits me.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are fine on the top and actually do penetrate in places where it&#x27;s not usually possible.  </li>
            <li> feeling, stick with either the Oral B super soft, Colgate super soft of my personal favorite, Dr. Collins Perio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thought the size of the brush head was good for their small mouths.</li>
            <li> Nice, firm brush hair that does clean well, and yet feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> The soft bristles are gentle on my gums, yet clean my teeth</li>
            <li> They are soft but clean very well.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft but they clean teeth very well and do not injure gum tissue.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 5 year old, as I find children&#x27;s toothbrushes wear out so quickly.</li>
            <li> item has a tiny brush area, which makes bristles easy to brush one tooth at a time.</li>
            <li> My co-worker told me she found some super soft toothbrushes on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft, so they don&#x27;t hurt my gums and the head of the toothbrush</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles.</li>
            <li> These are like the super soft brushes from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I was expecting them to be a little more firm, but they sure did get my teeth clean anyways!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I stopped using this brush soon after &amp; am more satisfied using normal brushes (primarily my Sonicare).</li>
            <li> Although, they are small and look rather impotent, they job they do is exceptional.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely looooves her new toothbrushes!!  </li>
            <li> good for you if you want to protect your teeth and not damaging it using hard brushes</li>
            <li> The tapered bristles really do make a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky about toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The bristles are so gentle.</li>
            <li> I have a very tender mouth, tender gums.  </li>
            <li> I needed something reasonably priced that does the job.  </li>
            <li> really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re Pam from Archer (who can famously fit several pool balls in her mouth), you&#x27;ll find these somewhat lacking.</li>
            <li> i can really feel the scrubbing in between teeth and between teeth and gum area.</li>
            <li> but they really do penetrate and scrub away.</li>
            <li> I find some toothbrushes too big to use comfortably.</li>
            <li> They look like they would work very well for your children</li>
            <li> I really like how they really do get into the gumline to take out the food and bacteria buildup.</li>
            <li> aren&#x27;t we talking too much already?</li>
            <li> They are labeled as \\&quot;medium\\&quot; but they are much softer than a medium brush bought at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a gentle toothbrush, this is the one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see it as an issue because you can afford to change them out</li>
            <li> Not the softest, but reasonable.</li>
            <li> and they are much gentler on your gums.</li>
            <li> can fit into the nooks-and-crannies of crooked teeth.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> have never been able to buy one this soft at a regular drug store!!!</li>
            <li> The bristols are soft enough I don&#x27;t worry about removing more enamel while still cleaning  well.  </li>
            <li> I threw all of them away after a couple days of using the first one, and bought some adult toothbrushes--for full grown adult jaws--in the nearest store.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well they clean and are very soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really soft but the size is right for the kids.</li>
            <li> These brushes are much softer and feel better than any other I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I just had a cleaning at the dentist -- my first \\&quot;full cycle\\&quot; in visiting the dentist after starting to use these toothbrushes (a full 6 months between cleanings, and using these brushes twice daily for the whole 6 months).  </li>
            <li> These seem like they&#x27;d be okay for kids, but too my adult mouth, the head seemed too small which means more time brushing, and the bristles felt too soft.  </li>
            <li> the fine, long bristles really dig in there.</li>
            <li> soft bristles, but not so soft it feels like your teeth aren&#x27;t getting clean.</li>
            <li> The beauty of this toothbrush is the strong-soft bristles which clean, do not harm and last for a month and beyond.  </li>
            <li> Big clean smiles all around.</li>
            <li> I used the brush and it didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth or gums, plus it left my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> The smaller head whizzes around the mouth easily; and the finer bristles do a fine job of scrubbing the teeth, gums, tongue, and all other surfaces.</li>
            <li> These bristles really do seem like a whole new technology in oral care.</li>
            <li> Has specially designed bristles that are unlike American toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> you are looking for super soft ones for your sensitive gums, I do not recommend these.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve never had one of those electric toothbrushes, I feel like these are better than a lot of average electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> So glad I read about bass brushes and that led me to this.</li>
            <li> I like them better than anything I&#x27;ve found so far, including several soft kids brushes that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The ultra-fine bristles are able to deep clean the tight spaces and under the gums.</li>
            <li> They are soft and easy on the teeth and gums but unlike conventional soft brushes, these get between teeth well and clean</li>
            <li> The feel of the bristles is good --not too hard and not mushy like some soft brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; bristles do better at getting between the teeth and slightly under the gums.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m German and have had a highly respectable dentist tell me I have a &#x27;&#x27;German jaw&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> But now that I&#x27;m older, I get it.</li>
            <li> head of the toothbrush is smaller than most, but personally, I do not believe it detracts from my brushing experience.</li>
            <li> They do seem to get in areas such as under the gum line better then the standard brush bristles.  </li>
            <li> Top of the package says &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; but the back of the individual toothbrush says &amp;#34;sensitive medium&amp;#34; as you can see in the pic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These tooth brushes are very soft and cleaned very well.  </li>
            <li> And I have also experienced a clean feeling of my gums that I&#x27;ve never experienced with other brushes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the produt.</li>
            <li> and i felt clean teeth after a long time.  </li>
            <li> soft and fine bristles, no more bleeding while brushing, can clean thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Very soft but cleans better than regular brushes, especially between teeth and gum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult, but I don&#x27;t have a large mouth.</li>
            <li> And because of their small size they are very easily maneuverable in your mouth to get in all crevices.</li>
            <li> so I am used to and like the small head to be able to clean properly around all my teeth, so the size works well for me.</li>
            <li> I saw a similar type of fine bristle toothbrush with a larger head at Whole Foods for $6 each.</li>
            <li> I gave up trying to find a soft toothbrush that cleans really well, just didn&#x27;t exist.</li>
            <li> If you like using the soft brushes for your brushing, I would really recommend these.</li>
            <li> I like them because they&#x27;re soft and gentle on the teeth.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and gentle to your teeth.</li>
            <li> So far my orthodontist and my dentist have both said that I am taking care of my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> They may be small and suitable for a child&#x27;s hand and mouth</li>
            <li> It is really soft and works very well.  </li>
            <li> Have sensitive teeth &amp; gums and these work very well.</li>
            <li> The bristles are absolutely soft and do not irritate her gentle gums whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Soft yet cleans really well.</li>
            <li> So soft its like a gentle massage for your teeth.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price here for all 5, the bristles feel way different than any manual toothbrush on the market I have tried.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit concerned because it said Sensitive Medium on the package, yet the description said that they were a soft bristle toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> IMO, if the bleeding goes away in 2-3 days, then it&#x27;s perfectly normal.</li>
            <li> Most toothbrushes are too harsh, and the length of the brush head aggravates the gum issue by not accommodating the curve of my inside teeth.  </li>
            <li> My mouth is too sensitive for the electric-style toothbrushes (don&#x27;t want to spend $140 on sonicare, so not able to comment on that kind).</li>
            <li> I had a junky &#x27;normal&#x27; brush in my travel bag for business trips -- replaced with one of these.  </li>
            <li> And by using small ones, you could brush your teeth more slowly and carefully, which is good!</li>
            <li> I find that the smaller head allows me to get around the back of my molars easily.</li>
            <li> Also, these are some of the softest, most gentle toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever used, which is good for me, because I have receding gums (a result of brushing too hard with tough bristled toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Bristles are extremely gentle for teeth and gums but strong and fine enough to penetrate deep within narrow crevices.</li>
            <li> This has the right amount of brushes to last a year since it is recommended that you get a new one every three months.</li>
            <li> However, Amazon was out of the mutitple-pattern and I needed toothbrushes, so I opted for the \\&quot;New Generation\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> B0049YANBO The new generation US patented,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who brushes too hard, so these are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This little toothbrush CAN clean those areas!</li>
            <li> Soft and strong, small head, which is exactly what I need to deal with my early-stage</li>
            <li> I have all of my teeth and find that I can&#x27;t get the larger style toothbrushes to fit into the back of my mouth where my wisdom teeth are.</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are very soft and do not cause any pain while brushing.</li>
            <li> For those who need soft brushes is the alternative, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I want to highly recommand this soft toothbrush to you.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and do not irritate my gums.  </li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> Have tried so many different brands/styles, none are soft, and they just get harder the longer they are used.  </li>
            <li> At first the brush felt prickly, but I could also feel it reaching further below the gumline and between teeth.  </li>
            <li> Proper dental hygiene requires precision brushing and these brushes are the exact instruments for the job.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for SOFT brush,  this is it!</li>
            <li> They must get in the small spaces a lot better than his electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When I first used one I \\&quot;over\\&quot; brushed and my gums became irritated for a day or two, but after that I had no problems.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft!</li>
            <li> My son has crooked bottom teeth, and yet when we go to the dentist for regular checkup, the dentist marvels at how clean his teeth are</li>
            <li> These brushes wok great, the heads are a little small and will take time to get use too.  </li>
            <li> It not only is soft, it cleans very very well.</li>
            <li> Vary\\&quot; and they are very soft and are adult</li>
            <li> I was expecting very soft brush like nimbus, but these are not that soft.</li>
            <li> You will acutally enjoy brushing with this soft tooth brush and avoid   gum issues down the road.</li>
            <li> I have been told to go easy on the brushing by my dentist, but it is hard to find gentle brushes.  </li>
            <li> By the second day, I was used to the smaller size, and by the third day I appreciated it because it made it easier to reach some areas to clean.  </li>
            <li> Like others have suggested, I coupled these with a novamin based toothpaste (pretty much the only commercial product proven to remineralize teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> People have complained that the heads are small like a child&#x27;s toothbrush, but I think the slightly smaller heads are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Small brush is really good for your teeth, but next time I will go back to Colgate</li>
            <li> When I brushed my teeth for the first time I was surprised at how soft the bristles felt.</li>
            <li> This Sanha brush is a similar design, very soft, and works very well.  </li>
            <li> The soft is better for the gums as it is less likely to push the gums so they recede.  </li>
            <li> At first, you will feel a little discomfort from brushing, but I promise you that&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s cleaning an area that has probably been not so clean before.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft, yet clean well and can get down under my gum line without trashing the tissue.  </li>
            <li> The head of the brush is indeed smaller than regular brushes but one great advantage that this affords is that it makes it easier to brush those hard to reach spots (like those molars at the very back of your mouth).</li>
            <li> And my previous tooth brush couldn&#x27;t clean the crevice thoroughly.</li>
            <li> You can tell after using them that they really clear up any debris around the gum line.  </li>
            <li> received the package of 5 colorful toothbrushes and my first impression was that they were indeed small compared to what I had been used to.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended using a soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These are soft.</li>
            <li> And they are soft, as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I had so many problems with a toothbrush advertising as &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;, but it was at least medium or firmer.  </li>
            <li> I came across this tooth brush in amazon when i was searching for a tooth brush with soft bristles.</li>
            <li> They feel so much softer than traditional bristles</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a soft toothbrush for 4 years.</li>
            <li> I was completely amazed at how well these cleaned my teeth.</li>
            <li> So far, it has exceeded expectations in every way.  </li>
            <li> Because it is so soft, I have suffered no gum irritation either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are really soft and will not hurt your gums if they are tender like mine.  </li>
            <li> Me, my husband, and my two year old</li>
            <li> Since the bristles are so soft, I can brush my sensitive gums without making them bleed.   </li>
            <li> These are no where near as soft.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize until after I used one of the tooth brushes that they were not ultra soft, they were soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li> , I wish I had been told about the benefit of using a soft brush when I was a child</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for children or adults with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I feel like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are different from all the rest I really like them</li>
            <li> I bought the brushes for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> I have considerable experience with oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> i used to buy expansive Toothbrushes and couldn&#x27;t find soft.</li>
            <li> It seems this toothbrush is marketed to those with sensitive gums, which I have never had.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just too soft.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been to the dentist yet for a professional opinion</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> I need to use sensitive type toothpaste because of tooth sensitivity in that area.</li>
            <li> I have the larger bristles and feel like they are much easier on my gums.</li>
            <li> I am a petite adult with braces.</li>
            <li> My teeth are also sensitive and some of the enamel has come off.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers complained about the size of the toothbrush, I actually really love the compactness of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Some soft brushes feel as if they are made for toddlers, but these have both strength and softness.</li>
            <li> They are the softest I&#x27;ve found so far, and my boys like the gem-like colors.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my two and five year old.</li>
            <li> These ultra soft bristles do not hurt his sensitive mouth</li>
            <li> And the soft, no electric bristles do not brush away the gums.  </li>
            <li> I also used to have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> not as soft as I&#x27;d hope.</li>
            <li> I prefer the soft bristles.</li>
            <li> These are soft.</li>
            <li> As good as the more expensive brand names I&#x27;ve purchased over the last few years.</li>
            <li> I have tried Perio brushes, which are good, but also expensive.</li>
            <li> This brush will get your teeth super clean without irritating your gums.</li>
            <li> The fine bristles make it ease to clean in between teeth and difficult places.  </li>
            <li> They are smaller than normal toothbrushes, and very soft.  </li>
            <li> With a small head, you can get easily reach every tooth in your head.</li>
            <li> These are supposed to be good because they&#x27;re small and get in to tight places.  </li>
            <li> For the last three months, I have been using a Steripod cover, which seems to be helping, as no mold has developed yet on this particular brush.</li>
            <li> well if I don&#x27;t miss any spots due to the fact that I have an adult male human jaw, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that I get the same--if not better--clean with my old toothbrushes due to the fact that they are made for adult jaw</li>
            <li> I bought these toothbrushes really just because of the odd amount positive reviews for them.</li>
            <li> great, I have a hard time finding small head toothbrushes in the store, I will buy again, they met my expatiations.</li>
            <li> Also, they are extremely thorough in how they clean because the bristles are so thin, pointed, and there are so many bristles per square inch.</li>
            <li> If you like a small brush, or are buying it for a child, then this would be fine.  </li>
            <li> These bristles retain their shape far better than those found on ultra soft nylon brushes, but they do require a few extra seconds of rinsing prior to replacing the toothbrush in its holder to ensure nothing is retained to foul the brush.</li>
            <li> Combine this with daily oil pulling (extra virgin coconut oil) and ayurvedic Super Comfort Rescue tooth powder and you will never need to go to the dentist and you will have really white teeth!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for people with the same issues I have.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles, and a small brush head size make it easy to access back teeth and avoid gum trauma.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush cleans like no other toothbrush I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> The bristles are gentle enough for sensitive gums (and kids), but they do such a thorough job!  </li>
            <li> When I brush with any \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brush, my teeth feel smooth and slick, but after using this, I could never get that feeling</li>
            <li> Pleased to say, they last as long or longer than an average toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still, I love this product, and will not go back to American toothbrushes -- I will just buy the other one they make with a big head --</li>
            <li> In contrast, if you used a normal sized toothbrush (regular heads) it would take a shorter time to brush all your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this as bigger brushes never fit in my smaller sized mouth very well to clean the backs of my front teeth.</li>
            <li> With my new order, I&#x27;ll have a total of 25 of them.</li>
            <li> I had one criticism, I would say that I would like the head of the toothbrush to be a bit larger, but I do see how the smaller head really gets \\&quot;in there and does the job.\\</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very tiny and the bristles are very soft.  </li>
            <li> It reaches places that I didn&#x27;t think was possible for a toothbrush (the bristles are fine enough to reach places I previously thought could only be reached by floss) while still being very soft.  </li>
            <li> The head is fairly small and the brush ends are definitely unique.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten used to the small head quite easily, but your experience may or may not be the same.</li>
            <li> Nobody else in the whole wide world can have these except me.</li>
            <li> No blue dye on the bristles and no smelly soft plastic on the handle.</li>
            <li> The last really soft and long-lasting toothbrush I had</li>
            <li> I have wasted so much money on brushes that \\&quot;say\\&quot; soft, but scratch my (sensitive) gums.</li>
            <li> I would post it in the review, but apparently amazon does not have an option for that.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and gental on my gum, but they work as well as regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> , I know some said it&#x27;s not extra soft.</li>
            <li> My husband would prefer one with a larger head, so I will get those for him, but I will stock up on these for myself and my 6 year old.  </li>
            <li> I decided to change back to old fashioned brushes and gave these a try based on reviews.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft enough that I use them.</li>
            <li> That said, they&#x27;re still just pretty average.</li>
            <li> For complete oral hygiene, you need to use a toothbrush not just on your teeth, but also your tongue, roof of the mouth, inside of the cheeks, and between gums and inner part of the lips.</li>
            <li> When I went to the dentist after using them for six months, I was surprised to find that I had no discomfort at all during the cleaning process, which has never been my experience in prior visits.</li>
            <li> The only brush I found, which is no longer sold in stores or on-line, were the soft, small-head Mentadent brushes.  </li>
            <li> I only use soft toothbrushes and this is one of my favorites that I&#x27;ve re-ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Finally the soft toothbrush I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I guess this toothbrush does a much better job, its smaller size and soft thin fibers</li>
            <li> It is so simple compared to the extremely convoluted modern toothbrushes when all they needed was to make the bristles soft.</li>
            <li> Small head for greater access to tight areas and soft bristles</li>
            <li> Okay, .... so I seriously don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without these toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> The small head reaches the narrowest recesses, including all the way around the back of a wisdom tooth that I have long been concerned about not being able to brush properly.  </li>
            <li> Very soft bristles that aren&#x27;t too long or too</li>
            <li> Unless you have very small teeth, these should not be your primary toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Much softer than other brushes I&#x27;ve used, and I appreciate the compact head.</li>
            <li> At first i thought the toothbrush head is too small for adult</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations because i expected it to be like the more expensive brand of similar brushes, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I received these last week, the good news is the bristles are soft, the bad news is the size of the head must be designed for toddlers.</li>
            <li> The brush head is smaller in size, a bit bigger than a child&#x27;s size brush but smaller than the adult brushes you buy at the local pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> It is a supersoft and small toothbrush, which is suitable for people with small mouth.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth and these toothbrushes are not harsh on your gums.</li>
            <li> American SOFT toothbrushes are NOT SOFT.  </li>
            <li> Due to this, I usually experience discomfort or minor pain, especially where the gum line has receded the most or where the teeth has lost some of the enamel.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner, but it takes a long time to clean your teeth because the head is very small on this.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush will seem small to you if you are used to the huge ones that are typical now.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is heaven sent as it completely cleans my teeth where other toothbrushes could not reach.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these toothbrushes for your little ones...at $10 for 5 toothbrushes</li>
            <li> So far 3 of 4 toothbrush handles broke this way despite being very careful.</li>
            <li> Probably to appease the people that think they aren&#x27;t cleaning their teeth properly if not scrubbing their mouth like a toilet bowl.</li>
            <li> I like the small head and the brushes are very \\&quot;feel good\\&quot; against the gums.  </li>
            <li> I used it once and really dislike the small brushhead and handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and knew very well that I was getting a small head on the toothbrush--but even my imagination couldn&#x27;t prepare myself for the truth.</li>
            <li> I hope the brushes last a long time.</li>
            <li> They are a tad bit small though which was fine for me since it can be used for those hard to reach brushing spots with a regular bigger brush.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the bristles are a bit long for kids&#x27; mouths.</li>
            <li> so it takes a LONG time before you can fully brush all your teeth properly.</li>
            <li> This is actually one of the coolest things I have bought in a long time.</li>
            <li> And they last a long time.</li>
            <li> You might not even need a mouthwash after that, depending on your personal physiology, eating habits, and tolerance for slight natural odor (as long as it is not foul smelling, of course).</li>
            <li> They last very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are not super soft as they claim.  </li>
            <li> And because they were soft they only lasted me a few brushings.</li>
            <li> They are also holding up well so far (a few months of regular use).</li>
            <li> The big thing for me is the head size is too small for my preference (adult male).</li>
            <li> The first day I used them, the brush head felt very small in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> They are small, soft and pointed so the bristles can get between my tightly spaced teeth, under my gum line and seem to last longer than regular soft brushes.  </li>
            <li> The head is the size of a small child&#x27;s toothbrush, yet the handle is just as long as a regular adult toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> actually tried to buy it for my husband, but too small for him, save up for my 5 years old son, he loves it.</li>
            <li> They are soft yet firm, and don&#x27;t make you feel like you are brushing your gum tissue away.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my two-year old daughter who has a heavy build up of plaque even though we brush three times a day.</li>
            <li> My daughter just turned 2 and has all of her teeth (minus the very last four molars that should be coming in soon).  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small size might be helpful, in that it forces me to slow down and concentrate more on my brushing technique.</li>
            <li> These tooth brush heads are small enough to clean behind my very last molar without hurting my mouth.</li>
            <li> I thought the heads on these toothbrushes were too small when they arrived, but by the time i got done brushing, my teeth were squeaky clean, even in the hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li> My gums were very sensitive when I first got my braces on, which made using other toothbrushes uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just buy the other ones next time.</li>
            <li> The close up photo shows how the Reach and Crest toothbrush bristles are just one thickness throughout and come to an abrupt end, but the abcOralCare toothbrush looks like it is gradually tapered for it&#x27;s entire length.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for &amp;#62;5 yrs and never going back to other brand.</li>
            <li> They simply reach where other brushes can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding sensitive-softness toothbrushes, so I was excited when I came across these.  </li>
            <li> I would estimate the size as about two peas long and about one pea wide, which was smaller than I had expected from the pictures.  </li>
            <li> The heads are little bigger than a kids toothbrush, but the handle is regular toothbrush size.</li>
            <li> Only toothbrush I&#x27;ll use anymore, after years of other brands including children&#x27;s brushes for softness.</li>
            <li> The long handle and soft, small head does it for me.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive and receding gum line due to years of over brushing and tartar build-up because of my tight teeth.  </li>
            <li> I bought these toothbrushes after reading so many positive reviews but was disappointed to find the toothbrush so small.</li>
            <li> The brissles are really tiny and the scrubbing portion is small, but they are soft, and they seem to get the job done without scratching the gums like other toothbrushes, so I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> About my only complaint is that the brush head could be larger, but I will happily live with that little inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> I like the small head and the soft brushes.</li>
            <li> These are soft, small, and get the job done.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the quality of these toothbrushes, but one thing you have to keep in mind is that because of their smaller than average size you have to focus on each tooth</li>
            <li> I like their small size and soft bristles and the price.  </li>
            <li> Soft and small head on the brush.  </li>
            <li> gave the product 5 stars because they look well made, just because they are not properly described does not mean they are not great.</li>
            <li> With the smaller head, less toothpaste is also used.</li>
            <li> is small so that I can actually reach the back of my mouth</li>
            <li> It seemed like they were expensive at first, until I divided the number of brushes into the total cost.</li>
            <li> The brush head and handle are too narrow for an average adult.</li>
            <li> I have never had this issue with any other toothbrush, ever, have been using the same bathroom for 5+ years, and none of the other toothbrushes concurrently stored in this bathroom have had any mold issues.</li>
            <li> These are definitely bigger than the small head of the MAM toothbrush is, but they are not too big by any means.  </li>
            <li> I tell people about them and they think I&#x27;m nuts, but they do a terrific job of cleaning and leave you with a lot less flossing to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really recommend at least trying these!</li>
            <li> and I still feel a little tiny bit of discomfort</li>
            <li> It takes a little patience because the head is about 60% the size of a regular toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, looks like a little kid&#x27;s toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The soft toothbrushes in the stores felt hard and was torture just using them.</li>
            <li> dentist told me that I needed to start using soft toothbrushes because I was brushing too hard, and my gums were receding.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s increasingly hard to find soft toothbrushes at the pharmacy - they all seem to have tongue scrapers on one side, or plastic nubs for gum massage or who knows what else.</li>
            <li> These are indeed very soft, but they are also VERY small.  </li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, and need a small but gentle toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Arrived in expected time frame.  </li>
            <li> No better than an extra soft you&#x27;d get at the drug store, but too small for my taste.</li>
            <li> Now I have to be really careful.)</li>
            <li> My pack had 2 pinks, 1 purple, 1 blue, and 1 green.</li>
            <li> Thankfully my youngest has no qualms about using a pink toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased these brushes and will keep buying them as they are not available in stores yet.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the bristles start to lose the effect a month after using them, but it&#x27;s worth it to continue buying them.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a soft bristled brush that will clean well without cutting my gums.  </li>
            <li> Very small soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth, so I find it difficult to get standard-sized brush heads to properly clean the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I thought I must be crazy ordering special toothbrushes online</li>
            <li> The rest of you go and buy that other junk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brush head is small enough to manipulate in any way you choose.  </li>
            <li> You will never want to buy other types of brushes again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say other than that.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li> (I have a small mouth and &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; size toothbrushes are too big for me).</li>
            <li> I waited a few months to review this because I wanted to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Only problem is the bristle head seems child-sized, too small for adults.</li>
            <li> They may have a reason for making it so small; maybe it&#x27;s so that children can use the same brushes (?).</li>
            <li> Small brush head allows me to reach the back corners of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> softer than other toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes because they are small and similar to toothbrushes from years ago.</li>
            <li> I threw out my other toothbrushes and replaced my travel toothbrush with one of these as well so that I won&#x27;t be without them.</li>
            <li> I had a hell of a time trying to find a soft-bristled, small head toothbrush that weren&#x27;t kids toothbrushes at your regular stores.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the head size is a bit small</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have commented, you can reach the little hard to get spots with ease and the bristles are soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find toothbrushes that aren&#x27;t giant anymore, these are small enough to reach around anywhere in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why more Dentists do not recommend these brushes because the other non-electric and battery powered brands they do recommend are worthless in comparison.</li>
            <li> I do have a tendency to brush my teeth a little harder than I should.  </li>
            <li> The branded toothbrush i was using was not only hard it couldn&#x27;t reach the corners of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I recently have had issues with a receding gum line, which my dentist says was caused by brushing too hard with my powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and it always felt like my teeth had some hard plaque, no matter how much/how vigorously I brushed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know why the big companies make hard bristled brushes.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I wish the brush head was a little bit bigger, but the smallness of it does make it easier to reach behind the back teeth.</li>
            <li> My gums and teeth are not irritated at all finally like they usually are every time I brush because I brush way too hard and way too long.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers noted the head is very small compared to a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably not as thorough a cleaning as a sonic-care, but a lot less complicated and doesn&#x27;t take up nearly as much space on the vanity</li>
            <li> but then, it can have a better reach in the very back molars where people tend to get cavities and other nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first when I saw the small head of the brush.</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews, I took a chance and tried this brush and what a surprise on their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for half a year.</li>
            <li> I probably will try the bigger size because the small ones are maybe a little too small.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;new generation&#x27; has really small heads, funky bristle material, thin handle that is not comfortable.  </li>
            <li> They get into every little crevice, and leave your mouth feeling fresher than you can imagine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d started to develop receding gums, and so was looking to find a toothbrush that didn&#x27;t just destroy them.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush bristles feel firm and yet soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We discovered this type on a trip to China, and I had trouble finding them in USA</li>
            <li> These are not cheap toothbrushes that are 5 for a dollar.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;ve been using the wrong toothbrushes for so long!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because the handle is too narrow (and rounded), the brush head tends to rotate while brushing.</li>
            <li> He chews, so I think we will be purchasing quite a few of these packs as time goes on.</li>
            <li> A FEW YEARS AGO.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using the Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush for the past decade and now use these toothbrushes about half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are _thin_ at their points, so if you push too hard or at the wrong angles, a bristle might slip uncomfortably far under the gum line and cause a tiny bit of pain.</li>
            <li> The brush head is a little too small though.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, and teeth with a lot of enamel missing in front.</li>
            <li> Sounds corny but give your friends these as little gifts -- they&#x27;ll thank you for it!</li>
            <li> (I tend to brush a little too hard, so that may partly be me).</li>
            <li> They had very little use.  </li>
            <li> Why these are not available in stores (at least in my area) is a mystery.</li>
            <li> They actually have a small brush surface as stated, which make it easier to get into difficult areas.  </li>
            <li> One reviewer says that these brushes are too small.</li>
            <li> The head is on the small side</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t cover my gums when I brush.</li>
            <li> head is small.</li>
            <li> The head of the brush is quite small.</li>
            <li> , small head like my dentist recommended.  </li>
            <li> However, the brush head seems too small for adults.</li>
            <li> I usually use compact brushes, and while these are indeed small, they are powerhouses.</li>
            <li> In the past, even with my electric brush, I&#x27;d have tarter lingering.</li>
            <li> Also I havce a small mouth</li>
            <li> He likes their small size and softness.</li>
            <li> Their brush heads are TOO small (compact)</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and small teeth with sensible gum.</li>
            <li> The head size is rather small and not an issue for me</li>
            <li> This toothbrush reaches into the spaces between teeth without my having to apply excessive pressure to the gums.</li>
            <li> It has a small head</li>
            <li> The small heads and fancy tapered bristles work well for me, and I think they have improved my gum health.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and problems with receding gums.  </li>
            <li> I have a small mouth</li>
            <li> I feel like I didn&#x27;t get all my teeth, because of how small it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> They are small bristles</li>
            <li> These are small.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too small; it takes forever to brush and feel like you&#x27;re getting to everything.  </li>
            <li> The handle below the bristles is very narrow.</li>
            <li> The small brush head makes it easier to access the hard to reach places of the mouth.</li>
            <li> I have really hard to reach molars.</li>
            <li> perhaps was brushing hard, but I noticed that my gumline and my daughter&#x27;s was being reduced by using these.</li>
            <li> I have receding gums in one area from brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I recently had to use a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothbrush and it felt so awkward.</li>
            <li> The regular toddler brushes weren&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> packaging is confusing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mean the bristle is hurting</li>
            <li> I usually use Dr Collins Perio toothbrushes, which are AH-Mazng!  </li>
            <li> I found it a little uncomfortable to brush because of it&#x27;s small size.</li>
            <li> Toothebrushes are ridiculous these days.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too stiff or weird and trash my gums.  </li>
            <li> I like to change the toothbrushes often, especially if she happens to be sick.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a Nimbus toothbrush, but they are just getting too expensive</li>
            <li> These have a super-fine bristle with hair thin tips on them.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too thin for me.</li>
            <li> but for whatever reason (maybe the thin bristles stabbed into the space between my gums &amp; teeth?)</li>
            <li> I used to hate brushing my teeth, but after using these toothbrushes, I actually look forward to brushing my teeth now.</li>
            <li> My husband is a dentist but isn&#x27;t as picky about toothbrushes as I am (probably since I have a few spots where my gums are receding and are sometimes painful, and he doesn&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still extremely skeptical about the benefits of the &amp;#34;pearl coating&amp;#34; on the black-bristle variety, which is why I got the Shaha 5 white-bristle variety, but after one try I immediately recommended these to friends.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, for one.</li>
            <li> It is anti bacterial and does not stain even after brushing my tongue after having drunk coffee.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The tapered bristles really do make a difference. I&#x27;m still extremely skeptical about the benefits of the &amp;#34;pearl coating&amp;#34; on the black-bristle variety, which is why I got the Shaha 5 white-bristle variety, but after one try I immediately recommended these to friends. Soft and strong, small head, which is exactly what I need to deal with my early-stage periodontitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are _thin_ at their points, so if you push too hard or at the wrong angles, a bristle might slip uncomfortably far under the gum line and cause a tiny bit of pain. Of course, being able to sneak under the gum line to remove food particles is part of the purpose. My point is that you still need to remember to brush gently with these, even though they&#x27;re softer than most soft-bristle brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was _very_ happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> good for you if you want to protect your teeth and not damaging it using hard brushes</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Are more for a child&#x27;s mouth, not an adult.  Disappointing.  Do not recommend unless want them for a child.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brushes. My dentist recommended using a soft toothbrush. Purchased these toothbrushes based on the reviews and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The BEST toothbrush I have ever owned at the age of 57. I mean OUTSTANDING!!! No matter what kind of mouth or teeth you have, I heard a long time ago that a small, soft toothbrush head is the best thing for the health your gums and teeth. THIS is it. The handle is PERFECTLY designed. Whoever designed this toothbrush SHOULD be a millionaire by now. With my new order, I&#x27;ll have a total of 25 of them. My last two brushes, a children&#x27;s style and size, wore out after 10 years of use. That&#x27;s right, I used the same toothbrushes for over 10 years. I couldn&#x27;t find the small (PERFECT) children&#x27;s brush anywhere. Well, I just did. Buy it or be a LOSER!!! NO, don&#x27;t buy it. I want more. Nobody else in the whole wide world can have these except me. The rest of you go and buy that other junk.</li>
            <li> These are soft. Works great for kids.&lt;br /&gt;Better than some of the kids&#x27; brushes on the market.&lt;br /&gt;My kids stopped complaining about brushing after switching to these brushes.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price. I had higher expectations because i expected it to be like the more expensive brand of similar brushes, but you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ll just buy the other ones next time.</li>
            <li> Finally, a toothbrush that actually works for me.  It&#x27;s brush head is small enough to manipulate in any way you choose.  The bristles are fine on the top and actually do penetrate in places where it&#x27;s not usually possible.  This is the brush for me and I&#x27;m happy with the way it works.  Why these are not available in stores (at least in my area) is a mystery.</li>
            <li> I am a devotee of the ABC Oral Care \\&quot;AFT Multiple Pattern 5 Manual Toothbrushes\\&quot; which are the best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever had--ever.  I&#x27;m really picky about toothbrushes.  However, Amazon was out of the mutitple-pattern and I needed toothbrushes, so I opted for the \\&quot;New Generation\\&quot;.  Ugh.  Not the same.  The &#x27;new generation&#x27; has really small heads, funky bristle material, thin handle that is not comfortable.  Please-please-please, bring back the AFT Multiple Pattern 5 Manual Toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> These are great!  They actually have a small brush surface as stated, which make it easier to get into difficult areas.  The &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; bristles do better at getting between the teeth and slightly under the gums.  And they are soft, as advertised.  I had so many problems with a toothbrush advertising as &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;, but it was at least medium or firmer.  The soft is better for the gums as it is less likely to push the gums so they recede.  These gently clean at the gum-line.  I even bragged to my dentist about these.  I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> At last I found a good serviceable toothbrush. No blue dye on the bristles and no smelly soft plastic on the handle. The soft bristles are gentle on my gums, yet clean my teeth well. Sometimes I wish the brush head was a little bit bigger, but the smallness of it does make it easier to reach behind the back teeth.</li>
            <li> American SOFT toothbrushes are NOT SOFT.  Have tried so many different brands/styles, none are soft, and they just get harder the longer they are used.  I usually run them under hot tap water just before using to soften the bristles.  The last really soft and long-lasting toothbrush I had was several years ago made by Crest (not Oral-B), and it cleaned well.    I first learned about tapered bristles 3-4 years ago with a free toothbrush provided on a Korean Air flight... in coach class... after eating my in-flight meal!  At first the brush felt prickly, but I could also feel it reaching further below the gumline and between teeth.  This Sanha brush is a similar design, very soft, and works very well.  Never realized Korea had a patent on the tapered bristle design, and never thought to look in the stores here.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is child-sized. Other than that it is a good toothbrush. Very soft. I usually use a Nimbus toothbrush, but they are just getting too expensive so i decided to try this one. I am going to order the larger size.</li>
            <li> The branded toothbrush i was using was not only hard it couldn&#x27;t reach the corners of my mouth.  I came across this tooth brush in amazon when i was searching for a tooth brush with soft bristles. After reading the reviews i thought i shall give it a try and ordered one pack.  i received the package in time and in perfect condition. At first i thought the toothbrush head is too small for adult but after using it i understood its the perfect size to reach the corners and i felt clean teeth after a long time.  i am very much satisfied with this product and highly recommend it. i am ordering some more for future use.</li>
            <li> My gums bleed no matter what I do, so a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrush is critical.  The good ones have a short life. The beauty of this toothbrush is the strong-soft bristles which clean, do not harm and last for a month and beyond.  All this at an amazing price -- love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. Designed &amp; built well. I like the straightforward efficient design. The big thing for me is the head size is too small for my preference (adult male). This would be an awesome choice for a child&#x27;s or person with a smaller mouth&#x27;s toothbrush. I ended up getting the Dr. Perio brushes and it&#x27;s much better sized for me, fwiw.</li>
            <li> One reviewer says that these brushes are too small. The head of the brush is indeed smaller than regular brushes but one great advantage that this affords is that it makes it easier to brush those hard to reach spots (like those molars at the very back of your mouth). Proper dental hygiene requires precision brushing and these brushes are the exact instruments for the job.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes. They feel so much softer than traditional bristles but they clean better.  My teeth feels polished after I brush them with these.</li>
            <li> love them, soft (but not too soft that they don&#x27;t hold up)</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to (the softness) though.</li>
            <li> Good,ship quick,I like it price is not high,I will buy next time,everybody said it is perfect, everybody all like it</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 5 year old, as I find children&#x27;s toothbrushes wear out so quickly. He was pleased &amp; so was I. Great size for a child.</li>
            <li> I have a really tiny mouth and these are very comfortable to use. I recently had to use a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothbrush and it felt so awkward.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a soft toothbrush for 4 years. I have wasted so much money on brushes that \\&quot;say\\&quot; soft, but scratch my (sensitive) gums. I don&#x27;t have to look any further!!</li>
            <li> I gave up trying to find a soft toothbrush that cleans really well, just didn&#x27;t exist. And because they were soft they only lasted me a few brushings. This toothbrush is FANTASTIC!!!! It not only is soft, it cleans very very well. My gums and teeth are not irritated at all finally like they usually are every time I brush because I brush way too hard and way too long. It cleans as good if not better than my electric toothbrush from Oral B Pulsonic which I love! My teeth and gums are super clean, fresh breath, teeth look white, and it cleans my tongue really well too (and I use 2 different types of tongue cleaners in addition to a toothbrush). It is like a dentist cleaning. Now, I do know how to properly clean my teeth, my dentist is always praising me. So you do have to put in the work since it is a manual toothbrush. But I clean my teeth faster with this manual brush than when I am using my electric brush. The head on this is the same size as my Oral B Pulsonic so I am used to and like the small head to be able to clean properly around all my teeth, so the size works well for me. But if you have bigger teeth and a bigger mouth then you should probably get the larger size brushes by this same brand with the white bristles. I may have to try those too just to see. I hope the brushes last a long time. Well worth the price here for all 5, the bristles feel way different than any manual toothbrush on the market I have tried.</li>
            <li> I received the item today, which was very fast delivery.  The item is as described, very soft bristle with tapered shape and this is the best toothbrush I ever used.  Will only order/buy these toothbrushes from now on.</li>
            <li> These tooth brushes are very soft and cleaned very well.  I gave them to my mom and she loves them too. If you like using the soft brushes for your brushing, I would really recommend these. You will never want to buy other types of brushes again.</li>
            <li> UNTIL... I got these. I was a bit skeptical at first when I saw the small head of the brush. I&#x27;m German and have had a highly respectable dentist tell me I have a &#x27;&#x27;German jaw&#x27;&#x27; lol.. I laughed and was like &#x27;yeah OK&#x27;, But now that I&#x27;m older, I get it. I have really hard to reach molars. In fact, I had to have my jaw dislocated in order for wisdom teeth extraction. Anyways... the small head allows perfect access to them with no stretching of my cheeks and no funny faces lol. The bristles are so gentle. I was completely amazed at how well these cleaned my teeth. At first, you will feel a little discomfort from brushing, but I promise you that&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s cleaning an area that has probably been not so clean before. I have used them for two days and two nights now and I still feel a little tiny bit of discomfort but nothing bad at all. I absolutely love these brushes and will buy a bunch more in the near future so I will always have some.     I bet they would make a great stocking stuffer!! :)    Hopefully this helped enough.. Thank you abcOralCare for finally creating the best toothbrush, EVER!</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner, but it takes a long time to clean your teeth because the head is very small on this. Still, I love this product, and will not go back to American toothbrushes -- I will just buy the other one they make with a big head -- [[ASIN:B0049YANBO The new generation US patented, non-nylon, tapered, soft, and ultra fine bristles - AFT multiple pattern 5 manual toothbrushes]] - really great.</li>
            <li> I have a very tender mouth, tender gums.  I needed something reasonably priced that does the job.  It meets all my needs and is inexpensive as well.  Win, win.</li>
            <li> These brushes wok great, the heads are a little small and will take time to get use too.  The bristles are much more effictive than the traditional brushes, they clean better arund the gum line and are also alot softer.  Your teeth will feel cleaner after just the first use.  The price is not bad at all for the pack.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes! They are so soft, which is great for the gums. Our daughter gave us some, and we are hooked!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  I&#x27;d started to develop receding gums, and so was looking to find a toothbrush that didn&#x27;t just destroy them.  These brushes are much softer and feel better than any other I&#x27;ve used.  My gums stopped deteriorating, it seems.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for someone else.  Arrived in expected time frame.  Recipient is very happy with the product.  Great product at a great price.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This has been an unexpectedly pleasant brushing experience! I love how these densely packed, soft, fine bristles not only clean my teeth but also allow me to concentrate my efforts on the gumline without any worry of shredding gum tissues. The compact head facilitates access to all areas inside my mouth. These bristles retain their shape far better than those found on ultra soft nylon brushes, but they do require a few extra seconds of rinsing prior to replacing the toothbrush in its holder to ensure nothing is retained to foul the brush. I wholeheartedly recommend these toothbrushes for anyone wishing to preserve the enamel on their teeth and for those especially concerned with gingivitis.</li>
            <li> The handle below the bristles is very narrow. You often twist the handle (e.g. right hand doing right inside, top teeth). So far 3 of 4 toothbrush handles broke this way despite being very careful. They had very little use.  My FEELING is that they do a good job since the bristles are fine and since the brushes are small you spend more time brushing. If the expense of only using 20% of the life of a toothbrush is not a concern, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I waited several weeks to post a review, so to ensure the product&#x27;s durability.  So far, it has exceeded expectations in every way.  It reaches places that I didn&#x27;t think was possible for a toothbrush (the bristles are fine enough to reach places I previously thought could only be reached by floss) while still being very soft.  Because it is so soft, I have suffered no gum irritation either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head of the toothbrush is smaller than most, but personally, I do not believe it detracts from my brushing experience.</li>
            <li> I have never used a toothbrush that cleans as well as these do. I even use them on my dog. The only reason I would buy another brand is if these are no longer made.</li>
            <li> I only had this abcOralCare 3 days but it seems great so far.  The toothbrush bristles feel firm and yet soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I took a close-up photo for a comparison between a bristle from a Reach Toothbrush, Crest Toothbrush and the abcOralCare Toothbrush.  I would post it in the review, but apparently amazon does not have an option for that.  The close up photo shows how the Reach and Crest toothbrush bristles are just one thickness throughout and come to an abrupt end, but the abcOralCare toothbrush looks like it is gradually tapered for it&#x27;s entire length.  It looks like a precision bristle and it functions like one as well.</li>
            <li> love these toothbrushes!! they are soft and they feel good on you gums. you actually feel like you are accomplishing something when you use these.</li>
            <li> The brush is smaller than I prefer (for my own use) but this is my fault for not noticing before I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> These are great quality brushes for the price. These have a super-fine bristle with hair thin tips on them. They are soft and easy on the teeth and gums but unlike conventional soft brushes, these get between teeth well and clean really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the nicest tootbrushes I&#x27;ve ever used. We discovered this type on a trip to China, and I had trouble finding them in USA but this is it! The toothbrush re-invented, I love it!</li>
            <li> Well, I think my mouth is somewhat fresher after I use it. I like the small head and the brushes are very \\&quot;feel good\\&quot; against the gums.  With the smaller head, less toothpaste is also used. Handle also feels good in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good buy.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are really soft and will not hurt your gums if they are tender like mine.  They are a tad bit small though which was fine for me since it can be used for those hard to reach brushing spots with a regular bigger brush.</li>
            <li> If you have a tiny, tiny mouth these may be the toothbrush for you. If you&#x27;re Pam from Archer (who can famously fit several pool balls in her mouth), you&#x27;ll find these somewhat lacking. Quality is fine.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great cause.  I was looking for packs of toothbrushes to give to Samaritan&#x27;s Purse Operation Christmas Child.  This was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll manage to hold on to this brand from now on. im very happy w/ it. item has a tiny brush area, which makes bristles easy to brush one tooth at a time. i can really feel the scrubbing in between teeth and between teeth and gum area. the fine, long bristles really dig in there. i was thinking that long, soft bristles would be the opposite of strong or a good scrub but they really do penetrate and scrub away. im very pleased with this item. i was ready to spend more on brushes, which sell with the title, \\&quot;Dr.\\&quot; on them, not anymore. Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Really nice. Me, my husband, and my two year old all use these without any problems. We wanted something smaller that can get into hard to reach places and it works perfectly. It&#x27;s great for small mouths of children as well.</li>
            <li> It is the second time I purchase these toothbrushes. I like the small head and the soft brushes. I feel they are good quality toothbrushes. They last very long.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes.  They are soft and gental on my gum, but they work as well as regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t review this toothbrush right away, as I wanted to use it for a while.  At first I was a bit concerned because it said Sensitive Medium on the package, yet the description said that they were a soft bristle toothbrush.  I have an electric toothbrush and these were ordered for an international trip.  But I decided to try one out before I packed it.&lt;br /&gt;So, why do I love this toothbrush:  Nice and soft, but still cleans so well.  Has a nice handle \\&quot;feel\\&quot; and I love the fun colors!  Packaged individually, so you can just open one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;If I had one criticism, I would say that I would like the head of the toothbrush to be a bit larger, but I do see how the smaller head really gets \\&quot;in there and does the job.\\&quot;  I would definitely buy these toothbrushes again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a gift.  They really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft.  The head is fairly small and the brush ends are definitely unique.  I prefer a stiffer toothbrush though.</li>
            <li> Use these to clean my pups teeth. He digs it and they don&#x27;t hurt his gums.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I got this in the mail and it said \\&quot;medium\\&quot; bristles.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I started brushing my teeth with it, it was the SOPFTEST bristled toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used!!&lt;br /&gt;The quality is excellent and I would definitely buy from them again.&lt;br /&gt;I have never been able to buy one this soft at a regular drug store!!!</li>
            <li> These are great toothbrushes! I purchased them in December and have been using them. I love the bristles. They are soft but clean very well. The tapered bristles do a great job reaching into every little crevice. Since the bristles are so soft, I can brush my sensitive gums without making them bleed.   These are great!</li>
            <li> good for when your company forgot to bring a toothbrush or children (head is too small), cheap build</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush for 3 months and I like it better than any toothbrush that I have used. I gave some to my friends and both ordered more the following day. This is very effective on \\&quot;uneven\\&quot; teeth. Furthermore, the price is very reasonable at under $3 a piece.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing fancy or automated or computer-programmed about these toothbrushes - they are manually operated which means the user must know how to operate a toothbrush the right way. They are a great size, the bristles are soft and fine as stated, and they do a great job of getting our teeth clean. My family approves.</li>
            <li> ordered these b/c they we so much cheaper than nimbus, wish I&#x27;d known better! These are no where near as soft. If you need the softest toothbrush, then the nimbus is the best and worth a few extra bucks. These were just okay. No better than an extra soft you&#x27;d get at the drug store, but too small for my taste.</li>
            <li> We all love this toothbrush, even my 4 year old uses one. The head is on the small side but this allows it to go everywhere in your mouth without causing discomfort. The bristles have a flexibility that I suppose makes them \\&quot;soft\\&quot; but this doesn&#x27;t deter their ability to clean. And I have also experienced a clean feeling of my gums that I&#x27;ve never experienced with other brushes. The toothbrush has a great shape, perfect weight, and great length. A really great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I thought I was purchasing &amp;#34;Ultra Soft&amp;#34; tooth brushes, which I need desperately... I didn&#x27;t realize until after I used one of the tooth brushes that they were not ultra soft, they were soft.  I did like the size of the brush, it&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t cover my gums when I brush.</li>
            <li> they are soft and very good.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because of the good reviews. I like them because they&#x27;re soft and gentle on the teeth. Very good quality. My wife also likes them. Can&#x27;t say other than that.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!!! It is very soft and comfortable for using. I will definitely recommend my friends buy it!</li>
            <li> I bled at the first time. But there&#x27;s a obvious reason: I haven&#x27;t flossed for a week. And my previous tooth brush couldn&#x27;t clean the crevice thoroughly. This little toothbrush CAN clean those areas! And that&#x27;s the reason I bled. IMO, if the bleeding goes away in 2-3 days, then it&#x27;s perfectly normal. It doesn&#x27;t mean the bristle is hurting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft, I know some said it&#x27;s not extra soft. I may have to try more toothbrush to find the really soft ones, but this one is better than the choices I have at the Safeway in my neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is small. For me, it&#x27;s okay. But I may not recommend it to my guy friends.</li>
            <li> great, I have a hard time finding small head toothbrushes in the store, I will buy again, they met my expatiations.</li>
            <li> Very small soft bristles.  Seems more appropriate for childrens sized mouth.</li>
            <li> My dentist says that any toothbrush that someone uses consistently is more effective than not brushing. I like the size of these toothbrushes. I&#x27;m an adult, but I don&#x27;t have a large mouth. I find some toothbrushes too big to use comfortably. The feel of the bristles is good --not too hard and not mushy like some soft brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is with the non-nylon bristles --Eastman Eastar</li>
            <li> These are child sized and should be noted as such.  They look like they would work very well for your children, I wish I had been told about the benefit of using a soft brush when I was a child so now you have the chance to help your children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried the Pack of 5 Nimbus microfine toothbrush REGULAR size \\&quot;Colors Vary\\&quot; and they are very soft and are adult sized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product 5 stars because they look well made, just because they are not properly described does not mean they are not great.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this brush.  It&#x27;s hard to find toothbrushes that aren&#x27;t giant anymore, these are small enough to reach around anywhere in your mouth.  I doubt I will ever use another brush again.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are super soft and comfortable. People have complained that the heads are small like a child&#x27;s toothbrush, but I think the slightly smaller heads are wonderful. They provide the best maneuverability I have ever experienced with a toothbrush- maneuverability that large bulky toothbrushes don&#x27;t allow for (spots that are hard to reach are very easily accessible with these toothbrushes). Also, these are some of the softest, most gentle toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever used, which is good for me, because I have receding gums (a result of brushing too hard with tough bristled toothbrushes. Now I have to be really careful.) I recommend these to anyone if you want the best cleaning, most comfortable, safest-on-your-gums toothbrushes available.</li>
            <li> This is a very good and soft brush. I would recommend it for children or adults with sensitive gums. The head of the brush is quite small.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and gentle to your teeth. They also do a good just cleaning. The price is not bad either.</li>
            <li> This product is plain and simply a good toothbrush. It isn&#x27;t like the new brushes that feel more like a stick than a brush; it has fine, soft bristles that can get into the gum line and between teeth to do a very good cleaning.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these toothbrushes.  Very important--they are beautiful to look at.  More important, they are absolutely comfortable to use.  The smaller head whizzes around the mouth easily; and the finer bristles do a fine job of scrubbing the teeth, gums, tongue, and all other surfaces.</li>
            <li> excellent and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Will be switching to these permanently.</li>
            <li> My husband bought these on a fluke.  I gave up on manual toothbrushes a while ago since I got a better clean with an electric, but he still prefers manual.  I grabbed one of these &amp; tried it out, and I love it!  It is a better clean than even my electric toothbrush, and way, way better than the standard manual brushes.  My husband would prefer one with a larger head, so I will get those for him, but I will stock up on these for myself and my 6 year old.  The bristles are gentle enough for sensitive gums (and kids), but they do such a thorough job!  I feel like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned.  I find that the smaller head allows me to get around the back of my molars easily.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes. So soft. Makes brushing more enjoyable, especially for young children. Would buy again. Might get for stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever.  Micro filaments to get into crevices, nice and soft to prevent damage, small head like my dentist recommended.  Gets my teeth really clean.  I bought tons of them to stock up, in case they stop making them.</li>
            <li> I recently have had issues with a receding gum line, which my dentist says was caused by brushing too hard with my powered toothbrush. I decided to change back to old fashioned brushes and gave these a try based on reviews. They&#x27;re nicely soft, and the pointed bristle tips clean great. They&#x27;re inexpensive, so I&#x27;m sold. Big clean smiles all around.</li>
            <li> I decided to try these since they do not use nylon bristles.  I usually use Dr Collins Perio toothbrushes, which are AH-Mazng!  The bristles on these seem to be just a tad too soft to be effective and my teeth, gums and mouth don&#x27;t feel nearly as clean.  I will continue using these until my Dr Collins Perios arrive in the mail.  After that, I will probably use these as detailing brushes for my car or something.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are different from all the rest I really like them The bristles are soft but get the job done Great for little ones to hold and use on their own</li>
            <li> I bought the brushes for my 4 year old. The brushes are truly soft and very effective in brushing. Best soft toothbrush we bought so far for my daughter. The only downside is that the bristles are a bit long for kids&#x27; mouths. I wish they made a children&#x27;s version with shorter bristles. My daughter still prefers this toothbrush to others; even those sporting her favorite characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I bought it for my kid, I didn&#x27;t use the brushes myself. So I can&#x27;t comment on their effectiveness for adults. However, the brush head seems too small for adults. I personally use GUM brand&#x27;s toothbrush with tapered bristles and love it!</li>
            <li> The bristles are really soft but the size is right for the kids. I found it a little uncomfortable to brush because of it&#x27;s small size.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had at 55 years of figuring this out...  Consider what your  store options are, which over the years, leaves grooves at the gum line which requires surgery if  you want to keep your teeth. You will acutally enjoy brushing with this soft tooth brush and avoid   gum issues down the road.</li>
            <li> The long handle and soft, small head does it for me. The price is good too. Being 68 I have considerable experience with oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;Plus the brush is easy on the gums and tongue, too.</li>
            <li> i used to buy expansive Toothbrushes and couldn&#x27;t find soft. these are seems to be perfect to me and inexpansive</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, and need a small but gentle toothbrush.  This is my second order, and I will order again.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush for kids and sensitive gums/tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> If you by this, make sure it is for children. Not recommended for adults. Bristles are too thin for me.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for SOFT brush,  this is it! Each brush is tapered towards the end so it effectively cleans between your teeth but softer on your gums. I have been using this for &amp;#62;5 yrs and never going back to other brand.</li>
            <li> These are not cheap toothbrushes that are 5 for a dollar.  I really like how they really do get into the gumline to take out the food and bacteria buildup. Although I&#x27;ve never had one of those electric toothbrushes, I feel like these are better than a lot of average electric toothbrushes. Best of all, the bristles are pretty gentle, so they won&#x27;t hurt your gums.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I would recommend this product to my families, friends and patients. I love the result after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> These are the only brushes I will now use!  They&#x27;re very tiny and the bristles are very soft.  You can tell after using them that they really clear up any debris around the gum line.  They simply reach where other brushes can&#x27;t.  They&#x27;re the greatest! I want everyone I care about to use them, is how much I love them.</li>
            <li> This is the best soft-bristled tooth brush for my sensitive gums.  I&#x27;ve tried a whole lot of different brushes but these are by far the best on my gums.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and satisfied with the product and prompt delivery.  This has been used to help with the oral hygiene of my son after his orthognathic surgery.</li>
            <li> I have been using these tooth brushes for over a year now and was extremely pleased when my dentist commented on how clean my teeth were. They feel good and apparently are doing a super job too.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a soft bristled brush that will clean well without cutting my gums.  Using these toothbrushes (and my SLS-free toothpaste), I seem to get fewer canker sores.  My husband also prefers them, and they work well for my grandchildren...ages 5 and 7.</li>
            <li> It seems this toothbrush is marketed to those with sensitive gums, which I have never had. However, I was looking for a new toothbrush and with the good customer reviews, I thought I would try something new. I have never had issues with pain or bleeding using virtually any toothbrush, including my powerful Sonicarem but for whatever reason (maybe the thin bristles stabbed into the space between my gums &amp; teeth?), my gums bled a lot after the first time I used this brush. I don&#x27;t floss, and when I do, I bleed, so maybe that is a factor. Subsequent brushing did not cause any significant bleeding, but my teeth NEVER felt clean after brushing with this brush. Maybe it&#x27;s just too soft. When I brush with any \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brush, my teeth feel smooth and slick, but after using this, I could never get that feeling and it always felt like my teeth had some hard plaque, no matter how much/how vigorously I brushed. Needless to say, I stopped using this brush soon after &amp; am more satisfied using normal brushes (primarily my Sonicare).</li>
            <li> They are holding up well after 3 months of use. Both my kids and I like them. My pack had 2 pinks, 1 purple, 1 blue, and 1 green. As a mom of 3 boys, I wish there had been fewer &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34; colors for them to choose from. Thankfully my youngest has no qualms about using a pink toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other 5 star reviews.  The toothbrush head is petite, but very effective.  They are no smaller than an Oral-B or Sonicare toothbrush head.  They are soft yet firm, and don&#x27;t make you feel like you are brushing your gum tissue away.  My teeth do feel clean after use.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price. They seem to do the job quite nicely.  I bought them to use as travel toothbrushes, so we don&#x27;t use them every day, but they have done fine when we&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth. The soft toothbrushes in the stores felt hard and was torture just using them. My co-worker told me she found some super soft toothbrushes on Amazon. Well, I am not using the ones she suggested, but I love the abcOral Care. These toothbrushes are very soft and do not cause any pain while brushing. Recently I gave my daughter asked for toothbrush.  I was out the regular ones, so I gave her one of mine. She loved it so much that she asked about the brand and where did I get it. She said the brush was so soft that she was getting her own.</li>
            <li> Wonderful toothbrushes.  My dentist noticed the beginning of gum erosion.  I do have a tendency to brush my teeth a little harder than I should.  These get my teeth clean while being very gentle to my gums. I am wearing braces now and I find that the ultra fine bristles are flexible enough to get in between the wires to really get the my teeth clean.  So far my orthodontist and my dentist have both said that I am taking care of my teeth very well.  Have repurchased several times and will definitely continue to.</li>
            <li> The bristles is ultra soft end comfortable but they started to bend after 3 weeks.Small brush is really good for your teeth, but next time I will go back to Colgate</li>
            <li> Love them for the shape - fits right into my mouth, and also for the softness of bristles and different colors - now I know whose brush is in the travel bag - my boyfriend is not someone who pays attention to the details and before was grubbing mine. Will continue buying them.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brushes for the little ones.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my two-year old daughter who has a heavy build up of plaque even though we brush three times a day. The regular toddler brushes weren&#x27;t cutting it. These work wonderfully and she doesn&#x27;t complain when I use them. The brushes are soft enough that I use them. I usually use compact brushes, and while these are indeed small, they are powerhouses. In the past, even with my electric brush, I&#x27;d have tarter lingering. With these brushes, I have no tarter afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I perhaps was brushing hard, but I noticed that my gumline and my daughter&#x27;s was being reduced by using these. The brushes are great, but they can be harsh on the gums. I have stopped using them.</li>
            <li> I like the &amp;#34;blotting brushes&amp;#34; very much and use 2-3 times each day.  However, the item received was not the item ordered. The Shaha brush has a smaller head than the ones I received.  The brushes sent were $2.00 cheaper in price, but I did not receive credit for the price difference.  The upside is that they work as I had hoped.  I will look for another supplier next time I purchase.  Purchase expectations for this item is 5 times per year.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;large size&amp;#34; that they are referring to is the height of the bristles.  That said, they&#x27;re still just pretty average.</li>
            <li> Toothebrushes are ridiculous these days. Too expensive, for one. Also I havce a small mouth and I had to resort at last to buying children&#x27;s toothbrushes. These are soft, small, and get the job done. Haven&#x27;t been to the dentist yet for a professional opinion but I like these, and it&#x27;s a great price for a quality product. I probably will try the bigger size because the small ones are maybe a little too small. Bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> My husband will only use these toothbrushes.  He likes their small size and softness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying using this toothbrush.  The small head reaches the narrowest recesses, including all the way around the back of a wisdom tooth that I have long been concerned about not being able to brush properly.  I feel that the fine bristles are getting my teeth really clean.  I would certainly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I was hunting for a cheap pack of toothbrushes and I stumbled on this gem. These brushes are perfect for me. The bristles are super soft, so they don&#x27;t hurt my gums and the head of the toothbrush is small so that I can actually reach the back of my mouth (I have a small mouth and &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; size toothbrushes are too big for me). They are pretty too! And the price (or at least when I bought it, as Amazon prices fluctuate quite a bit sometimes) was awesome. They are low enough in cost that it doesn&#x27;t strain my college student size budget to give one to a houseguest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> Unless you have very small teeth, these should not be your primary toothbrush. Their brush heads are TOO small (compact) so it takes a LONG time before you can fully brush all your teeth properly. In contrast, if you used a normal sized toothbrush (regular heads) it would take a shorter time to brush all your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the only redeeming quality of this brush is that its great for reaching those &amp;#34;hard to reach&amp;#34; corners of your teeth that regular heads can&#x27;t reach. I currently switched to Nimbus toothbrush and I LOVE them. Definitely recommend checking those brushes out.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super, super soft. Great if you&#x27;re under five, will die in 3 uses if you&#x27;re an adult.</li>
            <li> The fine soft bristles give you great cleaning all around, and between teeth. The cleaning between the teeth is not as good as flossing, but better than any other brush that I have tried. I waited a few months to review this because I wanted to see how long it lasts. Pleased to say, they last as long or longer than an average toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note: For complete oral hygiene, you need to use a toothbrush not just on your teeth, but also your tongue, roof of the mouth, inside of the cheeks, and between gums and inner part of the lips. Basically, on all surfaces inside the mouth. No separate tongue cleaners needed. You might not even need a mouthwash after that, depending on your personal physiology, eating habits, and tolerance for slight natural odor (as long as it is not foul smelling, of course).</li>
            <li> Best.Toothbrush.Ever.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the quality of these toothbrushes, but one thing you have to keep in mind is that because of their smaller than average size you have to focus on each tooth almost individually (can&#x27;t get away with much side sweeping, which should probably be avoided anyway), so in that sense it&#x27;ll take more time to get a clean feel. I like the bristles, the grip, and that there&#x27;s a color variety. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Very very fine and soft bristles. They are very effective at cleaning your gum line. The head is also very compact to make it easy to reach the nooks and crannies. The plastic is also very smooth and pleasing when brushing. These are far superior to any of the normal supermarket and pharmacy-carried toothbrushes made by Oral B or Colgate. I will never go back to using those after discovering these.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations for softness nor head size.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and small teeth with sensible gum. Food has always lodged under the molars, creating pockets at time and being quite painful. This toothbrush is heaven sent as it completely cleans my teeth where other toothbrushes could not reach. It is anti bacterial and does not stain even after brushing my tongue after having drunk coffee. It is soft enough not to hurt gum, a real pleasure to brush my teeth now, which has been more than before just because of the level of comfort now experienced.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, and teeth with a lot of enamel missing in front.( don&#x27;t let your kids eat too many limes or lemons). These tooth brush heads are small enough to clean behind my very last molar without hurting my mouth. The bristols are soft enough I don&#x27;t worry about removing more enamel while still cleaning  well.  For me they are great.  It seemed like they were expensive at first, until I divided the number of brushes into the total cost.</li>
            <li> Huge fan of these. They&#x27;re a bit smaller than the others ones by abcoralcare but they do the job just as good. Just takes a bit more time.</li>
            <li> Great brush leaves mouth feeling fresher than regular brushes.  Only problem is the bristle head seems child-sized, too small for adults.</li>
            <li> I have receding gums in one area from brushing too hard. I need to use sensitive type toothpaste because of tooth sensitivity in that area. These are the kind of toothbrushes I&#x27;ve been looking for because they are super soft and they do no further damage. Also, they are extremely thorough in how they clean because the bristles are so thin, pointed, and there are so many bristles per square inch. The head size is rather small and not an issue for me but if you prefer a larger head buy the &amp;#34;Ranhee 5&amp;#34; version instead of the &amp;#34;Shaha 5&amp;#34;...they are made with the same bristles but have a larger head. I highly recommend these for people with the same issues I have.</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews, I took a chance and tried this brush and what a surprise on their effectiveness. I brush and floss daily but my teeth always get plague which requires a Dentist cleaning every three months.  We have an electric toothbrush and Waterpik.  The soft bristles work better at getting into the gum line than the electric brush and it does not tear the gum tissues.  It removed more plague and food particles from teeth and gums than the electric brush.  I don&#x27;t understand why more Dentists do not recommend these brushes because the other non-electric and battery powered brands they do recommend are worthless in comparison.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;ve been using the wrong toothbrushes for so long!&lt;br /&gt;My dentist told me that I needed to start using soft toothbrushes because I was brushing too hard, and my gums were receding. These feel really good on my gums (they don&#x27;t hurt!) and they leave me with a fresher teeth cleaning feeling. I will be buying these from now on! Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes. I like how you can take them apart one at a time. The colors are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice since I received it, but this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. I have a very small mouth, so I find it difficult to get standard-sized brush heads to properly clean the back of my mouth. This one does the trick, and is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The brush head and handle are too narrow for an average adult. Because the handle is too narrow (and rounded), the brush head tends to rotate while brushing. When this happens, it feels like the sides of the bristles are scraping the teeth instead of the tips.</li>
            <li> Not particularly cheap, but perfect for toddlers- just the right size, soft, and whatever the bristles are made of seems to keep them really clean</li>
            <li> Love this! So glad I read about bass brushes and that led me to this. I&#x27;ll not go back to regular toothbrushes again. Fine bristles that get in between the teeth and up around the gums, but very gently so. Goes great with the homemade toothpaste made with calcium carbonate.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are great for people with sensitive gums.  The fine bristles make it ease to clean in between teeth and difficult places.  Combine this with daily oil pulling (extra virgin coconut oil) and ayurvedic Super Comfort Rescue tooth powder and you will never need to go to the dentist and you will have really white teeth!</li>
            <li> abcOralCare&#x27;s Sanha toothbrush is the perfect replacement for the discontinued G-U-M Ultra Soft.  This toothbrush reaches into the spaces between teeth without my having to apply excessive pressure to the gums. About my only complaint is that the brush head could be larger, but I will happily live with that little inconvenience.  Until now, I&#x27;ve not recently been able to find a toothbrush that really suits me.  Thank you abcOralCare!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! They may be small and suitable for a child&#x27;s hand and mouth but they sure do a good job in my mouth! Bristles are soft but they clean teeth very well and do not injure gum tissue. And because of their small size they are very easily maneuverable in your mouth to get in all crevices.</li>
            <li> Have sore gums and these are just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Stopped my gum-bleeding. The best toothbrush I ever used. It is so simple compared to the extremely convoluted modern toothbrushes when all they needed was to make the bristles soft. It has a small head but that&#x27;s a goo.d thing as it can reach in corners well.</li>
            <li> Better than American toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles. My kids love the size. I have the larger bristles and feel like they are much easier on my gums.</li>
            <li> I bought these toothbrushes to use on my two Shih Tzus.....because they were advertised as being for children.  But they are WAY too big for my dogs&#x27; mouths.  We now use them for ourselves!</li>
            <li> For those who need soft brushes is the alternative, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice, firm brush hair that does clean well, and yet feel very soft.  My daughter is using this brush from now on.  Since she short cut her teeth brushing often, a good brush to compensate for her short-coming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for half a year. Works great - very gentle and soft for my teeth.</li>
            <li> soft and fine bristles, no more bleeding while brushing, can clean thoroughly. love this brand</li>
            <li> Bristles are extremely gentle for teeth and gums but strong and fine enough to penetrate deep within narrow crevices.</li>
            <li> These are the Best toothbrushes of ever used. My last dental checkup was perfect. She was very impressed.</li>
            <li> I like the way these feel brushing my teeth. The small heads and fancy tapered bristles work well for me, and I think they have improved my gum health. When I went to the dentist after using them for six months, I was surprised to find that I had no discomfort at all during the cleaning process, which has never been my experience in prior visits. However, these have been consistently growing mold spots after about two months of use. I have never had this issue with any other toothbrush, ever, have been using the same bathroom for 5+ years, and none of the other toothbrushes concurrently stored in this bathroom have had any mold issues. For the last three months, I have been using a Steripod cover, which seems to be helping, as no mold has developed yet on this particular brush.</li>
            <li> I received these last week, the good news is the bristles are soft, the bad news is the size of the head must be designed for toddlers. I feel like I am brushing my teeth with a baby&#x27;s toothbrush. I will try another brush.</li>
            <li> Love these tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> I just tried it for the first time, and it seems to do what it claims:  The ultra-fine bristles are able to deep clean the tight spaces and under the gums. It takes a little patience because the head is about 60% the size of a regular toothbrush head. They may have a reason for making it so small; maybe it&#x27;s so that children can use the same brushes (?). I&#x27;m pleased with the cleaning effect, though. The small size might be helpful, in that it forces me to slow down and concentrate more on my brushing technique.I think it would be impossible to hurt your gums with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very demanding when it comes to oral hygiene and in my opinion, most of the brushes sold in grocery stores and places like CVS are garbage.  They&#x27;re too stiff or weird and trash my gums.  The only brush I found, which is no longer sold in stores or on-line, were the soft, small-head Mentadent brushes.  I can&#x27;t find them anymore, so I tried these.  Awesome brushes!  They&#x27;re soft, yet clean well and can get down under my gum line without trashing the tissue.  Great job abc, keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and problems with receding gums.  Most toothbrushes are too harsh, and the length of the brush head aggravates the gum issue by not accommodating the curve of my inside teeth.  These brushes, although soft-feeling, actually do a better job of cleaning my teeth, and the shorter length of the brush allows access without pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope they don&#x27;t stop making these brushes!</li>
            <li> I thought the heads on these toothbrushes were too small when they arrived, but by the time i got done brushing, my teeth were squeaky clean, even in the hard to reach spots.  The bristles are gentle yet clean better than my other brushes, amazing.</li>
            <li> Excellent Toothbrush -- will always be using this moving forward.  I bought this about 3 months ago and everyone in the family loves it.</li>
            <li> Much softer than other brushes I&#x27;ve used, and I appreciate the compact head. I am a petite adult with braces. My gums were very sensitive when I first got my braces on, which made using other toothbrushes uncomfortable. These are great. They are also holding up well so far (a few months of regular use).</li>
            <li> Addicted to these toothbrushes! I thought I must be crazy ordering special toothbrushes online but it is totally worth it. Love Love Love them,</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Very soft bristles that aren&#x27;t too long or too short.&lt;br /&gt;2) No fancy or stupid bristle design that makes you facepalm.&lt;br /&gt;3) Doesn&#x27;t hurt your teeth and requires no breaking in period/hot water for the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;4) Small brush head allows me to reach the back corners of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;5) Toothbrush handle design is simple and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;6) Parts were made in Korea and Japan (says on the back of the package).&lt;br /&gt;7) Fit my travel toothbrush holder that I got at target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) They weren&#x27;t free.&lt;br /&gt;2) They won&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li> What a difference a brush makes! I love these! They are super soft and clean my teeth amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;Much softer than other toothbrushes. Better for enamel.</li>
            <li> I bought these toothbrushes after reading so many positive reviews but was disappointed to find the toothbrush so small. I used it once and really dislike the small brushhead and handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Okay, .... so I seriously don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without these toothbrushes! It is amazing how much cleaner my family&#x27;s teeth are after using these! I went on vacation and went back to the travel toothbrush and it was such a difference, I felt like I was using a stick to brush with! Bought more of these to travel with and now my teeth are squeeky clean on vacation. Like other reviewers have commented, you can reach the little hard to get spots with ease and the bristles are soft yet they actually feel like a power scrub. By far the very best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. My whole family agrees! Very happy we switched over to these. They&#x27;re amazing.</li>
            <li> I finally have found a go-to brand of toothbrush! I saw a similar type of fine bristle toothbrush with a larger head at Whole Foods for $6 each. I have a small mouth, so these are perfect for me! I also have started using them for my toddler son. He chews, so I think we will be purchasing quite a few of these packs as time goes on. I&#x27;m someone who brushes too hard, so these are nice and soft. I have also noticed that my husband&#x27;s breath is fresher after using this toothbrush. They must get in the small spaces a lot better than his electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive and receding gum line due to years of over brushing and tartar build-up because of my tight teeth.  My teeth are also sensitive and some of the enamel has come off.  Due to this, I usually experience discomfort or minor pain, especially where the gum line has receded the most or where the teeth has lost some of the enamel.  I used the brush and it didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth or gums, plus it left my teeth clean.  And I didn&#x27;t experience any soreness after brushing.  I just started using this brush and it feels promising, so for now,  I am satisfied and will continue to use the brush.</li>
            <li> As a dentist I endorse this toothbrush. Very soft bristles, and a small brush head size make it easy to access back teeth and avoid gum trauma.</li>
            <li> These are indeed very soft, but they are also VERY small.  The head is the size of a small child&#x27;s toothbrush, yet the handle is just as long as a regular adult toothbrush.  I&#x27;m not sure who these are for exactly.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these toothbrushes!  They are smaller than normal toothbrushes, and very soft.  I ran out and bought a &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrush at the drugstore and it was like brushing my teeth with a brillo pad.  Now I keep a good supply of these so I never run out!</li>
            <li> these toothbrushes are ideal for people with smaller mouths or who still have all their wisdom teeth-which I have both. My mouth is too sensitive for the electric-style toothbrushes (don&#x27;t want to spend $140 on sonicare, so not able to comment on that kind). These, for some reason I can&#x27;t figure out, are awesome. I think the first pack lasted about 5-6 months. I&#x27;m on my second. I do notice that when they get near the end of their lifespan they do not feel as clean, but they seem to hold up better than the $3-5 toothbrushes at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great. I wish you could subscribe and save to them. I would definitely do that. I don&#x27;t see any reason to look for another toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These are perfect! love the size and soft brushes.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes because they are small and similar to toothbrushes from years ago. I can get to all my teeth with these without gagging myself.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding sensitive-softness toothbrushes, so I was excited when I came across these.  They did not disappoint.  The first day I used them, the brush head felt very small in my mouth.  I would estimate the size as about two peas long and about one pea wide, which was smaller than I had expected from the pictures.  By the second day, I was used to the smaller size, and by the third day I appreciated it because it made it easier to reach some areas to clean.  I threw out my other toothbrushes and replaced my travel toothbrush with one of these as well so that I won&#x27;t be without them.</li>
            <li> Very soft but cleans better than regular brushes, especially between teeth and gum.&lt;br /&gt;Why do I have to type more than 15 words, aren&#x27;t we talking too much already? Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> It is really soft and works very well.  It has ultra fine bristles so it doesn&#x27;t hurt my jum.  I want to highly recommand this soft toothbrush to you.</li>
            <li> I used to hate brushing my teeth, but after using these toothbrushes, I actually look forward to brushing my teeth now. Some reviewers complained about the size of the toothbrush, I actually really love the compactness of the toothbrush. The small brush head makes it easier to access the hard to reach places of the mouth. The softness of the toothbrush is also ideal for cleaning retainers with. This toothbrush does a great job at cleaning your mouth. you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased these brushes and will keep buying them as they are not available in stores yet.  They are small, soft and pointed so the bristles can get between my tightly spaced teeth, under my gum line and seem to last longer than regular soft brushes.  They are labeled as \\&quot;medium\\&quot; but they are much softer than a medium brush bought at the drugstore.  My husband uses them as well.    When I first used one I \\&quot;over\\&quot; brushed and my gums became irritated for a day or two, but after that I had no problems.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a gentle toothbrush, this is the one. I have found that these seem to clean my teeth better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and they are ultra-gentle and soft. Some soft brushes feel as if they are made for toddlers, but these have both strength and softness. I have ordered them multiple times, and I keep them on hand all the time.</li>
            <li> Okay, who orders toothbrushes online, right? I do now. These toothbrushes are freakin&#x27; amazing. I bought them on a whim, not even sure how I found them, but I was so surprised after using one of them for the first time. I&#x27;ve used all kinds of electric toothbrushes, and nothing has ever made my teeth feel as clean as these do. They get into every little crevice, and leave your mouth feeling fresher than you can imagine.</li>
            <li> This is actually one of the coolest things I have bought in a long time. Yes, that&#x27;s right, a toothbrush. It cleans very well, better than a regular toothbrush and maybe even as good as a sonicare. It also seems to get in between the teeth as well. The coolest thing was that when I was brushing, I couldn&#x27;t even feel the brush against my gums and teeth. These bristles really do seem like a whole new technology in oral care.</li>
            <li> I only use soft toothbrushes and this is one of my favorites that I&#x27;ve re-ordered from Amazon. The only thing I wish it had is a tongue scraper on the back.</li>
            <li> My go to toothbrush.  Some things I still like done manually :)</li>
            <li> With these I am able to brush more vigorously without worrying about hurting my gums and teeth.  My mouth definitely feels cleaner afterwards.  Like others have suggested, I coupled these with a novamin based toothpaste (pretty much the only commercial product proven to remineralize teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are thicker, softer, and more resilient than those on a traditional toothbrush.  I use a UV based sanitizer and I&#x27;ve gotten 9 months of use out of one of these brushes no problem.  When I demoted the brush to auto detailing duty, it was still holding up fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect brushes for me. Have sensitive teeth &amp; gums and these work very well.</li>
            <li> BEST TOOTHBRUSHES. THESE ARE THE ONLY ONES I USE EVER SINCE THE 1ST BATCH A FEW YEARS AGO.</li>
            <li> I like their small size and soft bristles and the price.  I have dry mouth and these toothbrushes are not harsh on your gums.</li>
            <li> I bought these toothbrushes really just because of the odd amount positive reviews for them. I figured I may as well see for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the package of 5 colorful toothbrushes and my first impression was that they were indeed small compared to what I had been used to. Not a big deal in my opinion. When I brushed my teeth for the first time I was surprised at how soft the bristles felt. I was expecting them to be a little more firm, but they sure did get my teeth clean anyways! I really noticed that my mouth felt fresh longer throughout the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For once I am very glad I bought into the hype on a product and that they turned out so pleasant. I will be using these as my teeth brushing solution from now on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I can think of is that the bristles seem like they will start wearing and fraying a bit quicker than regular toothbrushes. Considering that you get 5 of them for cheap I don&#x27;t really see it as an issue because you can afford to change them out more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend at least trying these!</li>
            <li> These are my family&#x27;s favorite toothbrushes.  They are the softest I&#x27;ve found so far, and my boys like the gem-like colors.</li>
            <li> I like the bristles in particular because they are soft but their fine points do help clean my teeth better than traditional bristles. As other reviewers noted the head is very small compared to a traditional toothbrush. I have a small mouth and I&#x27;ve gotten used to the small head quite easily, but your experience may or may not be the same.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and knew very well that I was getting a small head on the toothbrush--but even my imagination couldn&#x27;t prepare myself for the truth. The simple fact of the matter is that there is very low surface-contact from this brush. It is literally the size of a toddler&#x27;s brush. I feel like I didn&#x27;t get all my teeth, because of how small it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to clean well if I don&#x27;t miss any spots due to the fact that I have an adult male human jaw, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that I get the same--if not better--clean with my old toothbrushes due to the fact that they are made for adult jaw sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great concept and idea but I feel the pros don&#x27;t outweigh the cons. I threw all of them away after a couple days of using the first one, and bought some adult toothbrushes--for full grown adult jaws--in the nearest store.</li>
            <li> My husband is a dentist but isn&#x27;t as picky about toothbrushes as I am (probably since I have a few spots where my gums are receding and are sometimes painful, and he doesn&#x27;t).  I tried these hoping to making brushing effective but painless and help keep tartar from building near the gumline.  I think it does help with these things, though I won&#x27;t know for sure until I go for my next cleaning.  But even without that verification, I do know that the brushes are super soft (even though they are called Medium) and feel great and that my teeth feel very clean after I&#x27;ve brushed (for 2 or 3 minutes) with them.  My kids (8 and 10) also like to use them since they have pretty compact heads.  I like them better than anything I&#x27;ve found so far, including several soft kids brushes that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> These are okay.  They&#x27;re cheap in price.  They do seem to get in areas such as under the gum line better then the standard brush bristles.  I will probably go back to using the newer model brushes with gum simulators and bigger heads and what not.</li>
            <li> not like the one i had before but it was a freebie and i can&#x27;t figure out which it was. still, the &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; toothbrushes are nice and soft and do give me a nice change of pace from my power brush, especially when out of town.</li>
            <li> I have oral Lichen Planus which requires me to keep my gums and teeth continuosly clean to mitigate gum inflamation.  I have tried Perio brushes, which are good, but also expensive. The ABC toothbrushes are the best I have tried to date, and they are inexpensive.  Although, they are small and look rather impotent, they job they do is exceptional.  The ultra fine bristols get in between my teeth and under the gum line.  After brushing with this toothbrush using Toms toothpaste my mouth feels as though I have just had my teeth cleaned by a Hygenist.</li>
            <li> I was looking for nimbus toothbrushes, but found this ones good deal. I was expecting very soft brush like nimbus, but these are not that soft. To me, it is medium.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is confusing. Top of the package says &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; but the back of the individual toothbrush says &amp;#34;sensitive medium&amp;#34; as you can see in the pic.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for super soft ones for your sensitive gums, I do not recommend these. Still softer than what you can find at drugstores.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush! This toothbrush cleans like no other toothbrush I have ever used!  It is gentle and extremely effective.  It removes stains and gets into tiny nooks. My teeth feel smooth and look great!</li>
            <li> I used to buy the biggest, hardest toothbrush I could find. Tried these based on reviews and won&#x27;t ever go back.</li>
            <li> Just what the Dentist ordered! the softer brushes are actually better for your teeth, aspecially being a senior who need to keep the teeth I have!!</li>
            <li> These are really good tooth brushes. I was pleasantly surprised at how well they clean and are very soft. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> actually tried to buy it for my husband, but too small for him, save up for my 5 years old son, he loves it.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my two and five year old. The bristles are so soft! Thought the size of the brush head was good for their small mouths. My husband and I started using them too. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> As good as the more expensive brand names I&#x27;ve purchased over the last few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them since my dentist recommended them and they are perfect for sensitive teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;The price and quality is really good.</li>
            <li> These are amazing toothbrushes for the money. Will never use another toothbrush again. I had a hell of a time trying to find a soft-bristled, small head toothbrush that weren&#x27;t kids toothbrushes at your regular stores. Small head for greater access to tight areas and soft bristles so they don&#x27;t damage your gums - these types of toothbrushes are what dentists always recommend. I don&#x27;t even know why the big companies make hard bristled brushes. Probably to appease the people that think they aren&#x27;t cleaning their teeth properly if not scrubbing their mouth like a toilet bowl.</li>
            <li> this is the best tooth brush I have used ever. the size, the material etc. very nice for your gum.</li>
            <li> It is a supersoft and small toothbrush, which is suitable for people with small mouth. And by using small ones, you could brush your teeth more slowly and carefully, which is good! And it is not expensive</li>
            <li> This brush will get your teeth super clean without irritating your gums. The smaller head allows you to reach everywhere.</li>
            <li> These are one of the best toothbrushes.  I love the way they clean my sensitive teeth.  My 7 year old loves these brushes soo much and is now loving to brush.  These ultra soft bristles do not hurt his sensitive mouth</li>
            <li> These are my favorite toothbrushes.  The bristles are very soft and do not irritate my gums.  They also feel like they get in-between my teeth better.  The brush head is smaller in size, a bit bigger than a child&#x27;s size brush but smaller than the adult brushes you buy at the local pharmacy.  I like this as bigger brushes never fit in my smaller sized mouth very well to clean the backs of my front teeth.</li>
            <li> I say these are excellent because they are wonderfully soft and narrow to fit between the teeth.  And the soft, no electric bristles do not brush away the gums.  Thus preventing receding gums.  I learned about these toothbrushes from the book KissYour Dentist Goodbye.  I also used to have sensitive teeth.  But after following the book&#x27;s regime, that is gone.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find compact head toothbrushes in the stores in my area any more.  I&#x27;m not sure why but they seem to be getting bigger and bigger. I have all of my teeth and find that I can&#x27;t get the larger style toothbrushes to fit into the back of my mouth where my wisdom teeth are. This toothbrush will seem small to you if you are used to the huge ones that are typical now. But if you have a lot of teeth you will find that this one fits even to the back ones quite nicely. Plus the bristles seem great for cleaning at the gum line with their tapered design. I am very happy with these and will buy them again.</li>
            <li> The brissles are really tiny and the scrubbing portion is small, but they are soft, and they seem to get the job done without scratching the gums like other toothbrushes, so I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, looks like a little kid&#x27;s toothbrush.  Other than that it&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s a toothbrush.  It does what it needs to do.  Won&#x27;t buy again because of the size, but I do like the bristles.</li>
            <li> I read all of the wonderful reviews for these toothbrushes and asked the reviewers if any of them had used these with toddlers...although no one did, some said they would probably work just fine.  Well, they DO indeed.  My daughter just turned 2 and has all of her teeth (minus the very last four molars that should be coming in soon).  She absolutely looooves her new toothbrushes!!  They are perfect for her small mouth!  I used to buy the MAM Training Toothbrush, but that could set you back $6-$10 each!  I like to change the toothbrushes often, especially if she happens to be sick.  These are definitely bigger than the small head of the MAM toothbrush is, but they are not too big by any means.  The bristles are absolutely soft and do not irritate her gentle gums whatsoever.  I highly recommend these toothbrushes for your little ones...at $10 for 5 toothbrushes it&#x27;s an awesome price for great quality!</li>
            <li> Korean toothbrushes that will make your teeth feel nice and clean! Has specially designed bristles that are unlike American toothbrushes. The only drawback is that the head size is a bit small but then, it can have a better reach in the very back molars where people tend to get cavities and other nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> These are like the super soft brushes from the dentist. Wife and I agree they feel so good on the gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes!! They really get my teeth clean and my dentist last time told me to keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> These are very good, much softer than normal hard bristle and yet cleans well. And they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!  Finally the soft toothbrush I was looking for.  Shared some with the rest of the family and they loved it too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for people with sensitive gums that dislike electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Love these soft toothbrushes! It&#x27;s increasingly hard to find soft toothbrushes at the pharmacy - they all seem to have tongue scrapers on one side, or plastic nubs for gum massage or who knows what else. But all of those things bother my mouth and gums and my dentist highly recommends most people to use a soft toothbrush. This is a great package and will save you annoyance at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I have been told to go easy on the brushing by my dentist, but it is hard to find gentle brushes.  These are pretty good.  Not the softest, but reasonable.</li>
            <li> these are just ok.  not as soft as I&#x27;d hope.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft! And they do a really great job of brushing. Unfortunately, the bristles start to lose the effect a month after using them, but it&#x27;s worth it to continue buying them.</li>
            <li> This has the right amount of brushes to last a year since it is recommended that you get a new one every three months. It helps out as an extra when guests stay and someone left theirs at home. I highly recommend the produt. I prefer the soft bristles.</li>
            <li> These are great toothbrushes.  They are small bristles so it allows for them to get between your teeth and they are much gentler on your gums.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. Very soft. The brush head is a little too small though.</li>
            <li> These are small. These are soft. That is what your tooth brush is supposed to be anyway. The heads are little bigger than a kids toothbrush, but the handle is regular toothbrush size. With a small head, you can get easily reach every tooth in your head.</li>
            <li> Teeth brush is awesome!</li>
            <li> If you like a small brush, or are buying it for a child, then this would be fine.  There is a photo on the website comparing the size to Oral  B and Colgate brushes.  The handles are about the same, but the head of this brush is even smaller than it looks.</li>
            <li> Brush works well. Kids like it.</li>
            <li> Pros: I feel as if these get into the crevices between my teeth and around my gums better than regular brushes do. The brush head is pretty small, which suits me well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Because the tips of the bristles are so fine, I think the toothbrushes wear out pretty quickly (I tend to brush a little too hard, so that may partly be me). It would be nice if the handles were made from recycled/recyclable material.</li>
            <li> Only toothbrush I&#x27;ll use anymore, after years of other brands including children&#x27;s brushes for softness. I stocked up on these and hope they keep offering them - have ordered a number of times now and they are consistently just right. The seller emailed me at the first purchase to let me know it takes a while to get used to if you have not been using brushes that floss - there may be tenderness until you get used to it, just like if you have not been flossing for awhile. But I never had any tenderness with these brushes. very comfortable feel in hands too.</li>
            <li> These are supposed to be good because they&#x27;re small and get in to tight places.  I don&#x27;t like them.  They&#x27;re too small; it takes forever to brush and feel like you&#x27;re getting to everything.  And the ultra fine bristles mostly just succeeded in finding their way down in to my gums and hurting.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both use these and agree that they&#x27;re great.  We&#x27;ve been using the Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush for the past decade and now use these toothbrushes about half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The super fine bristles cleans between teeth and along your gum line. They&#x27;re long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first start using them, you&#x27;re gums will tingle, but that goes away fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we&#x27;ve tried all kinds and brands of tooth and these are unique, high quality, and by far our favorite.</li>
            <li> Perfect for little mouths and healthy gums because they are so much softer than standard brushes.  No complaints from my two kids</li>
            <li> I just had a cleaning at the dentist -- my first \\&quot;full cycle\\&quot; in visiting the dentist after starting to use these toothbrushes (a full 6 months between cleanings, and using these brushes twice daily for the whole 6 months).  I had the fastest and most pain-free cleaning I&#x27;ve had in years!  Yes, there was tartar to clean, but my gums didn&#x27;t hurt as much during the cleaning, and even my two highly touch-sensitive teeth didn&#x27;t make me see stars when the hygienist had to use the pick on them.  I have no direct proof that this excellent dentist visit was because of these brushes, but I have to assume that is the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate being without these brushes.  I had a junky &#x27;normal&#x27; brush in my travel bag for business trips -- replaced with one of these.  Sounds corny but give your friends these as little gifts -- they&#x27;ll thank you for it!</li>
            <li> Bought these based on great reviews and we love them.  They seem to hold up better than all we&#x27;ve had in the past and do a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li> These are awesome toothbrushes.  I have problems with my gums (receding) and my teeth (enamel is cracked).  These toothbrushes feel like pillows on your teeth but at the same time you feel them working.  I would keep buying these for my family.</li>
            <li> Soft and small head on the brush.  It works best for me.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Soft yet cleans really well. Would purchase again but the price seems to go up every time I check this item. Used to be a must buy but not anymore.</li>
            <li> They get the job done. Good value</li>
            <li> So soft its like a gentle massage for your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of the Dr. Collins toothbrushes.  They have worked for me for years.  I have issues with receding gumlines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was here on Amazon to buy some and i came across the OralCare and decided to just try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are not super soft as they claim.  They are simply \\&quot;OK\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads on these things though are tiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may like that, but these brushes are not for me.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feeling, stick with either the Oral B super soft, Colgate super soft of my personal favorite, Dr. Collins Perio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> these turned out to be really nice toothbrushes. bought on a whim because i was looking for smaller tooth brush &amp; they turned out to be awesome. soft bristles, but not so soft it feels like your teeth aren&#x27;t getting clean.</li>
            <li> My son has been using these toothbrushes for two years. I first found this on amazon after reading some great reviews.  My son has crooked bottom teeth, and yet when we go to the dentist for regular checkup, the dentist marvels at how clean his teeth are and he has no cavities etc.  I guess this toothbrush does a much better job, its smaller size and soft thin fibers can fit into the nooks-and-crannies of crooked teeth.</li>
            <li> These seem like they&#x27;d be okay for kids, but too my adult mouth, the head seemed too small which means more time brushing, and the bristles felt too soft.  These kind of feel like a tooth brush that&#x27;s already worn out. I&#x27;m not buying that they get between teeth better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, especially for children. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Works better than any brush I&#x27;ve used. I tell people about them and they think I&#x27;m nuts, but they do a terrific job of cleaning and leave you with a lot less flossing to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably not as thorough a cleaning as a sonic-care, but a lot less complicated and doesn&#x27;t take up nearly as much space on the vanity (I hate crap on the vanity).</li>
