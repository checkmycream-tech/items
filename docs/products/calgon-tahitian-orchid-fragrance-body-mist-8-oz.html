            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I have received many compliments while wearing this.  </li>
            <li>, I bought it in the store years ago, but I wanted to write a quick review as it was amazing.</li>
            <li>other than that, calgon is awesome.</li>
            <li>Also, most of the Calgon body sprays I&#x27;ve tried in the past were awesome too.</li>
            <li>but she put that Morning Glory spray on and it smelled super!</li>
            <li>Light and fruity.</li>
            <li>Great to spray it all day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly thrilled to have this big ol&#x27; bottle of my favorite perfume ðŸ˜Š.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very fresh,with a bit exotic.</li>
            <li>I loved this spray, Tahitian Orchid, and I remember this blue one that I used to have called Morning Glory.</li>
            <li>Not a bad mist just did not like this as much as I thought I did.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite scents</li>
            <li>The newer scent is the same but seems like you ahve to wear more of it</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this stuff and thought for sure they wouldn&#x27;t carry it anymore since its been so long.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>that one is much better in my opinion especially if u have sensitive allergies to smells of the thats pictured.</li>
            <li>So years later I stumbled apon it on amazon and was so excited..</li>
            <li>It is delicate without smelling too sweet or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>A few I don&#x27;t like that are too sweet as I just want a light scent and not a scent that is overpowering where everyone smells it.</li>
            <li>I was wrong in the best possible way!</li>
            <li>This is the one with the missing top</li>
            <li>smells to overtly sugared like brown sugar &amp; so strong it gives me headaches, i have another bottle of calgon tahitian orchid but its in a different shaped bottle with purpilish colored orchids, and that one doesnt bother me at all, the only difference u can tell between the two if youre going to get one,</li>
            <li>I bought a small, travel size bottle of this many years ago at Wal-Mart and, of course, used it all.</li>
            <li>picture shows it as being clear, but when I received the item, the liquid was purple.</li>
            <li>It is soft and remainded me of a far away places.    </li>
            <li>Arrived early.</li>
            <li>I wanted the old one, (the one that is displayed in the picture).</li>
            <li>so that was a waste of money, but I am definitely in search of this spray and going to check online if another Walmart has it as there&#x27;s many around.</li>
            <li>It is exactly the same fragrance just different packaging.</li>
            <li>I own quiet a few more expensive sprays</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the scent has changed since I had it last, but it was a clear spray, not colored.</li>
            <li>Item arrived with a broken top which cannot be swapped out because of the size.</li>
            <li>not sure i got the right one..or and up dated spray?</li>

            <li> Now, I was at first psyched to find at least the body cream, so at least that was something, so I bought it at a local Walmart.</li>
            <li> Even my husband, who I&#x27;ve found is so tough to find a perfume or body spray that he really likes.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday anyway.</li>
            <li> I am not one for heavy perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Problem is, last few times I&#x27;ve been in Walmart, I&#x27;m disappointed that scent isn&#x27;t in the store.</li>
            <li> I even just asked my husband a few days ago, what he thought of the scent as I put a little on my hand, and you should have seen the look on his face, he hated it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad that I&#x27;m throwing it out</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> my mom, she passed away, but years ago when she was staying at my place, she never ever ever wears (wore) any perfume, she hated that, she hated scented candles</li>
            <li> The body cream smells absolutely disgusting.</li>

            <li> I love the smell of this product! I couldnt find it anywhere and I found it here! I love it so much. Wear it everywhere I Go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture shows it as being clear, but when I received the item, the liquid was purple. Thats the only thing! Otherwise, I love it!</li>
            <li> It is perfect for the mornings !!!!!!!!!    It is soft and remainded me of a far away places.    Great to spray it all day long.</li>
            <li> As always, a great product.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite scents but it seems like it doesn&#x27;t last. It dissipates immediately after I spray it. Oh well. I use it everyday anyway. Once its gone I&#x27;ll probably go back to VS or Bath &amp; Body Works sprays.</li>
            <li> I bought a small, travel size bottle of this many years ago at Wal-Mart and, of course, used it all. I absolutely adore this stuff and thought for sure they wouldn&#x27;t carry it anymore since its been so long. I was wrong in the best possible way! It is exactly the same fragrance just different packaging. I&#x27;m incredibly thrilled to have this big ol&#x27; bottle of my favorite perfume ðŸ˜Š. Packaged very secure so it wouldnt break open and leak. Arrived early. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite body spray</li>
            <li> I hope Calgon never stops making this.  I am not one for heavy perfumes.  I like a lightly-scented body spray and this one is my favorite.  Perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> This is the one with the missing top</li>
            <li> I love this body splash. The fragrance is very fresh,with a bit exotic. It is delicate without smelling too sweet or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> smells to overtly sugared like brown sugar &amp; so strong it gives me headaches, i have another bottle of calgon tahitian orchid but its in a different shaped bottle with purpilish colored orchids, and that one doesnt bother me at all, the only difference u can tell between the two if youre going to get one, the one thats in this picture has a white orchid, so i wouldnt suggest that, get the one with the goldish cap and that has the purplish flowers on it. that one is much better in my opinion especially if u have sensitive allergies to smells of the thats pictured. other than that, calgon is awesome. i might try their bath pearls sometime.</li>
            <li> I love this body spray! I own quiet a few more expensive sprays and I always find myself going back to this one. I wore it all the time when I was a teenager and one day my local walmart didn&#x27;t have it anymore! So years later I stumbled apon it on amazon and was so excited.. I received it today and it smells just as good as I remember!</li>
            <li> The spray is amazing, but I would never recommend the body cream of this scent. I didn&#x27;t buy this online, I bought it in the store years ago, but I wanted to write a quick review as it was amazing. I loved how someone described it as sultry, and I agree 100%. Even my husband, who I&#x27;ve found is so tough to find a perfume or body spray that he really likes. Usually it&#x27;s &#x27;eh it&#x27;s ok&#x27; but this one he really liked. Problem is, last few times I&#x27;ve been in Walmart, I&#x27;m disappointed that scent isn&#x27;t in the store. I don&#x27;t know if the scent has changed since I had it last, but it was a clear spray, not colored. Anyways, the scent is sexy. Now, I was at first psyched to find at least the body cream, so at least that was something, so I bought it at a local Walmart. The body cream smells absolutely disgusting. I even just asked my husband a few days ago, what he thought of the scent as I put a little on my hand, and you should have seen the look on his face, he hated it. It&#x27;s so bad that I&#x27;m throwing it out so that was a waste of money, but I am definitely in search of this spray and going to check online if another Walmart has it as there&#x27;s many around. So an A+ on the body mist, F for the body cream. Also, most of the Calgon body sprays I&#x27;ve tried in the past were awesome too. A few I don&#x27;t like that are too sweet as I just want a light scent and not a scent that is overpowering where everyone smells it. I loved this spray, Tahitian Orchid, and I remember this blue one that I used to have called Morning Glory. Get this....my mom, she passed away, but years ago when she was staying at my place, she never ever ever wears (wore) any perfume, she hated that, she hated scented candles etc. but she put that Morning Glory spray on and it smelled super!</li>
            <li> This item came in the same bottle that I could buy today at Wal-Mart. I wanted the old one, (the one that is displayed in the picture). The newer scent is the same but seems like you ahve to wear more of it</li>
            <li> Smells great. Light and fruity. People tap me on the shoulder often to ask \\&quot;What are you wearing?\\&quot;. Love it.</li>
            <li> i loved it.....but the bottles are not as i am looking at it......this bottle is white and mine is pink.......not sure i got the right one..or and up dated spray?</li>
            <li> Not a bad mist just did not like this as much as I thought I did. It has a nice smell but smells like a drier sheet to me.</li>
            <li> my favorite body spary</li>
            <li> Like this stuff and one of my sisters loves this too. I bought 2 and will give her one of them. she will be pleased. I know I&#x27;m dating myself when I say this but Calgon is kick ass for the money.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.  Fast delivery. Will defiantly continue to order.</li>
            <li> Item arrived with a broken top which cannot be swapped out because of the size. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  I have received many compliments while wearing this.  However, I discovered I can buy it locally for half the price I paid here.</li>
