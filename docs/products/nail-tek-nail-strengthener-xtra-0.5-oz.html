            <li>Have tried to grow my own nails forever.</li>
            <li>It was shipped very quickly and the price was good as well.  </li>
            <li>I always used this product when I had my own Manucurist business many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li>I just think this is the greatest as my nails finally are growing.</li>
            <li>This product is the best to strengthen your nails, especially if you  had acrylic nails....  </li>
            <li>I love AMAZON.</li>
            <li>NOTHING worked for me and I tried as many products as there on the market.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff and will continue to order it from Amazon since I cannot find it in any stores here in Florida.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love Nailtek items.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found this.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for more than week and have followed all the directions stated.  </li>
            <li>but this one sure did, couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve ordered two more bottles and when they run out will order more.</li>
            <li>I had to combat my urge to bit them as they grew, but once I saw how they were growing out beautifully, strong and healthy, that urge went away.     </li>
            <li>Over time, you may be able to apply just one coat of Nailtek Xtra to keep your nails strong and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the product that helps &amp; makes my nails strong.  </li>
            <li>This product help keep my nails strong.</li>
            <li>keeps my nail strong and longer</li>
            <li>But I bought the product because I figured I&#x27;d give the dream of having long, beautiful and strong nails one more try.</li>
            <li>Used nail tek foundation ll for several months and my nails were beautiful.</li>
            <li>I visit Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply just to look and see what&#x27;s new and if there is anything that might be good for my nails.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s fine, because it works either way.  </li>
            <li>I am so very, very happy with my long nails now -- I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.  </li>
            <li>Since using nail tek products ,I now have long beautiful nails.</li>
            <li>It helps so much with the peeling, helps them grow in healthy, and my nails are strong.</li>
            <li>You do have to stay on top of it at first and keep applying</li>
            <li>I tried many many nail products and nothing helped me grow even short strong nails.  </li>
            <li>the Nailtek Foundation Extra gives good results.</li>
            <li>For many years I&#x27;ve been cursed with very soft nails!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants long, beautiful, easy to care for nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced less peeling and breaking of my nails with this product and it seems to stay on longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my nails the first week!</li>
            <li>I was a bit reluctant to spend more than $5 on yet another clear coat</li>
            <li>Too early to be sure it is working.</li>
            <li>My nails are finally growing long and strong - even my husband commented on how great my nails are looking and in in 22 years of marriage - that&#x27;s the first time he&#x27;s told me that!</li>
            <li>They will be long, strong and  healthy.</li>
            <li>It dries super quick, with a shine that I have not found in any other top coat - and believe me, I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL!</li>
            <li>I became aware of Nailtek Xtra through a friend of mine and I am FINALLY able to grow strong nails - even long nails if that&#x27;s what I want!  </li>
            <li>I was not very optimistic at all since nothing else worked for me, but I am so very glad I tried this one....</li>
            <li>they are nice and long</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why anyone with weak nails doesn&#x27;t use this as it&#x27;s the absolute best!</li>
            <li>Extra clear polish, My nails are long, beautiful and strong.</li>
            <li>You are supposed to apply one coat, then two coats of polish, then another top coat for total protection, and apply another coat every day.  </li>
            <li>The stuff i had last time worked better.  </li>
            <li>You put 2 coats on the first day (and can add polish if you choose between the two coats); then you add one coat each day after that up to seven days.</li>
            <li>You will see the difference in your nails within a first week.</li>
            <li>After the first week of use, there was a&lt;br /&gt;big difference.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to let them dry thoroughly, because the more coats you put on, the more likely it is to smudge if they don&#x27;t dry all of the way between layers.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I had an issue with is that it does not come with instructions, but those are easy to find on Google.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really helps nails &amp; easily visible only after 24hrs.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and even makes cheap nail polish last longer.</li>
            <li>I have really brittle peeling nails that won&#x27;t grow.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this product, withing one month, my nails are fully grown and</li>
            <li>They grow so well that people ask if they are my real fingernails.  </li>
            <li>the transaction went smoothly and no extra work or worries were needed</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I wore acrylic nails for ten years and when I decided to grow my own nails back, nothing worked....</li>
            <li>To get the best results, I reapply at least one coat every other day.  </li>
            <li>works pretty okay, but not better than some others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I now have decent looking nails again.</li>
            <li>I have learned to use a file rather than clippers, and so I use a crystal file that I find to be particularly pleasing.</li>
            <li>I must say I generally only do the full deal once a week and get a little chipping before the next manicure, but overall it does a great job.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>of the main reasons was it took forever to dry and was peeled much too quickly.</li>
            <li>If your nails are in trouble or you have never been able to get them to grow, this is the product you have been looking for.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about a year but could not find any in the area where I live</li>
            <li>I mean remove existing coat(s), trim or file your nails (and remember to use a very fine grit nail file and file in only one direction), and reapply 2 coats, but it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>No breakage and my nails are now more th.an 1/4 past my finger tip.</li>
            <li>However, for the first time in years I actually have to trim my nails instead of watching them split/peal/tear.</li>
            <li>For the first time my nails look like i had tips put on and are growing stronger daily</li>
            <li>and I bought a ceramic nail file to finely file the tiny rough edges that come up.  </li>
            <li>the polish starts to peel off of and three of my nails so far has broke.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY ONE THAT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that I could purchase it over the Internet and pay just about retail even with shipping.</li>
            <li>My nails have always been very brittle and I&#x27;m constantly having to file them.  </li>
            <li>I had the acrylics done once, 6 years ago and it completely destroyed my nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27; m65 years in age always had soft peeling nails.</li>
            <li>I am on Instagram and post frequent photos of my nails,</li>
            <li>I apply one coat every other day and my polish lasts for a week (also a first for me!)</li>
            <li>After reading so many positive reviews of the Nail Tek brand, I decided to take the risk and go for the Xtra formula since I have had very little luck with other nail strengtheners/hardeners.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptic at first, my nails are extremely brittle they break, bend and take every opportunity to chip.</li>
            <li>Ordering it online is much cheaper than the store - I paid 12$ for this little thing, and even at much more expensive rate it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I use this as my top coat (I use the Nail Tek Extra Foundation on top of CND Stickey as my base coat).</li>
            <li>It dried very fast.</li>
            <li>This product hardens my nails; and, they look very healthy (within two months of use - had damage from artificial nails), with normal pink under the nail</li>
            <li>the beginning of the year that I was going to let my real nails grow after wearing acrylics for half my life</li>
            <li>Instead of just peeling the whole nail started splitting down the middle!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as a clear coat for a few weeks now, and so far it&#x27;s working!  </li>
            <li>I try to wear gloves as much as I can, but believe me you will be amazed how little that would matter to your nails.</li>

            <li> If your nails are in trouble or you have never been able to get them to grow, this is the product you have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year but could not find any in the area where I live</li>
            <li> I mean remove existing coat(s), trim or file your nails (and remember to use a very fine grit nail file and file in only one direction), and reapply 2 coats, but it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> No breakage and my nails are now more th.an 1/4 past my finger tip.</li>
            <li> However, for the first time in years I actually have to trim my nails instead of watching them split/peal/tear.</li>
            <li> For the first time my nails look like i had tips put on and are growing stronger daily</li>
            <li> and I bought a ceramic nail file to finely file the tiny rough edges that come up.  </li>
            <li> the polish starts to peel off of and three of my nails so far has broke.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY ONE THAT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that I could purchase it over the Internet and pay just about retail even with shipping.</li>
            <li> My nails have always been very brittle and I&#x27;m constantly having to file them.  </li>
            <li> I had the acrylics done once, 6 years ago and it completely destroyed my nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27; m65 years in age always had soft peeling nails.</li>
            <li> I am on Instagram and post frequent photos of my nails,</li>
            <li> I apply one coat every other day and my polish lasts for a week (also a first for me!)</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews of the Nail Tek brand, I decided to take the risk and go for the Xtra formula since I have had very little luck with other nail strengtheners/hardeners.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptic at first, my nails are extremely brittle they break, bend and take every opportunity to chip.</li>
            <li> Ordering it online is much cheaper than the store - I paid 12$ for this little thing, and even at much more expensive rate it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I use this as my top coat (I use the Nail Tek Extra Foundation on top of CND Stickey as my base coat).</li>
            <li> It dried very fast.</li>
            <li> This product hardens my nails; and, they look very healthy (within two months of use - had damage from artificial nails), with normal pink under the nail</li>
            <li> the beginning of the year that I was going to let my real nails grow after wearing acrylics for half my life</li>
            <li> Instead of just peeling the whole nail started splitting down the middle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a clear coat for a few weeks now, and so far it&#x27;s working!  </li>
            <li> I try to wear gloves as much as I can, but believe me you will be amazed how little that would matter to your nails.</li>
            <li> My only problem I have now is having to cut and file my nails often to keep them from getting so long</li>
            <li> Almost immediately after applying this, they were much harder and weren&#x27;t constantly getting raggedy like before.  </li>
            <li> Did not stay on nails as long as I anticipated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one product you just have to try if you cannot grow your nails long.  </li>
            <li> I tried other nail strengtheners (even the \\&quot;other\\&quot; one with the similar name)</li>
            <li> After about 4 months, my nails have grown out long and they grow like weeds!</li>
            <li> But I am a nailart fanatic, and so I polish them frequently even though they&#x27;re short.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money, I&#x27;m going back to Nail Tek 2.</li>
            <li> A few years back I commented on a friends nails.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who has flaking/peeling or thin nails--especially if you feel like you have tried almost every type of strengthener or hardener polish.</li>
            <li> We purchased the XTRA for difficult resistant nails and absolutely done nothing for either of us.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no improvement - a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I cut my nails down and decided to let them grow with the help of Nail Tek.</li>
            <li> This Extra is especially helpful to someone who has very thin nails.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> My poor lil nails needed some help and are finally getting it.</li>
            <li> Saw results in as few as three weeks.</li>
            <li> Even though I am not faithfully applying everyday, 2-3 times is doing the trick</li>
            <li> I found the Nailtek Xtra (must use the \\&quot;Xtra\\&quot; version for trouble nails) almost a year ago and figured I&#x27;d try it since I&#x27;ve tried other products that were $27 for a very small bottle (that did not work for me).  </li>
            <li> My nails are dry, flaky, brittle and thin and trying to get them to grow longer than the edge of my nail bed is a losing battle.  </li>
            <li> I have used it in the past.</li>
            <li> No more ridges or \\&quot;wavy\\&quot; nails.</li>
            <li> No more split nails either.</li>
            <li> I have thin nails due to thyroid problems, and they would bend over my fingertips or break off.</li>
            <li> Made my nails hard but didn&#x27;t stop the spitting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be hard to find and when I ran out in a mid-sized city I turned to the Internet.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been at least 3 years since I had them removed.  </li>
            <li> and now I have to use the nail files for acrylic nails because mine are so hard!  </li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of base coats and grow formulas but none helped me until I picked up this product last week at</li>
            <li> Splitting,peeling,weak and thin.</li>
            <li> Like the rest of the commenters, my nails have always been difficult to grow, very thin, flimsy and peeling.</li>
            <li> my nails were weak, brittle and just plain awful...</li>
            <li> This stops it cold!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I take it to my manicurist and she uses it as my base coat; then as the topcoat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible and painful.</li>
            <li> I always hated it.</li>
            <li> Had terrible nails.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I bough is because my nails were chipping and breaking.  I followed directions and I now have longer nails which I can polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.I have really brittle peeling nails that won&#x27;t grow. With faithful use of the Nail Tek System, foundation II and the Nail Tek Extra clear polish, My nails are long, beautiful and strong. I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just think this is the greatest as my nails finally are growing.My nails always chipped and broke now they are nice and long</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do what it states once applied within two days the polish starts to peel off of and three of my nails so far has broke.  This was a waste of money, I&#x27;m going back to Nail Tek 2.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  No breakage and my nails are now more th.an 1/4 past my finger tip.</li>
            <li> This product is the best to strengthen your nails, especially if you  had acrylic nails....  I wore acrylic nails for ten years and when I decided to grow my own nails back, nothing worked....my nails were weak, brittle and just plain awful... I tried every product I could find until someone told me about this Nail Tek......  Thanks to this product, withing one month, my nails are fully grown and now people \\&quot;think\\&quot; they are arcrylic !!  This IS the BEST product on the market !!  Thank you...</li>
            <li> Made my nails hard but didn&#x27;t stop the spitting. Instead of just peeling the whole nail started splitting down the middle! It&#x27;s horrible and painful.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year but could not find any in the area where I live so I ordered it off Amazon.  It was shipped very quickly and the price was good as well.  Nail Tek is a great product.  I love AMAZON.</li>
            <li> This product has lasting power and helps my fragile nails keep from shredding..</li>
            <li> NOTHING worked for me and I tried as many products as there on the market. This is the ONLY ONE THAT REALLY WORKS. My nails are strong and beautiful. My only question is do I continue with this one forever or do I need to switch to a maintenance formula?</li>
            <li> I decided @ the beginning of the year that I was going to let my real nails grow after wearing acrylics for half my life (I&#x27;m in my 30s). I was also a chronic nail biter and the ONLY way my nails grew were to put on acrylics. Well, enter Nail Tek.     Someone recommended this product and I haven&#x27;t looked back since. I tried other nail strengtheners (even the \\&quot;other\\&quot; one with the similar name) but they just didn&#x27;t stand up to this product. I cut my nails down and decided to let them grow with the help of Nail Tek. I had to combat my urge to bit them as they grew, but once I saw how they were growing out beautifully, strong and healthy, that urge went away.     After about 4 months, my nails have grown out long and they grow like weeds! I&#x27;ve even had people ask me if I had an overlay on my nails! I take that as the ultimate compliment considering the condition they were in at the beginning of the year!     If you are looking for a nail strengthener that does what it says plus more, please add this to your collection! It will definitely bring your nails back to life!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Wish I had found it years ago my nails have grown in two weeks &amp;have thicken up (yay) I will order again. Only wish the bottle was bigger &amp;my bottle doesn&#x27;t look like the one on the picture ....</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product I have found for my nails! My nails are paper-thin, crack, peel, and split. I use this as my top coat (I use the Nail Tek Extra Foundation on top of CND Stickey as my base coat). It dries super quick, with a shine that I have not found in any other top coat - and believe me, I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL! The shine stays even through dishes, swimming, typing, etc. I apply one coat every other day and my polish lasts for a week (also a first for me!) My nails are finally growing long and strong - even my husband commented on how great my nails are looking and in in 22 years of marriage - that&#x27;s the first time he&#x27;s told me that! I LOVE this stuff and will continue to order it from Amazon since I cannot find it in any stores here in Florida.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nail Tek XTRA for years because, with regular use, my fingernails are stronger and stop flaking and breaking.  They grow so well that people ask if they are my real fingernails.  I started using it over 10 years ago because my mother&#x27;s fingernails looked so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be hard to find and when I ran out in a mid-sized city I turned to the Internet.  I was surprised to find that I could purchase it over the Internet and pay just about retail even with shipping.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this product, recommended to her by her manicurist.  My nails have always been very brittle and I&#x27;m constantly having to file them.  Almost immediately after applying this, they were much harder and weren&#x27;t constantly getting raggedy like before.  You are supposed to apply one coat, then two coats of polish, then another top coat for total protection, and apply another coat every day.  I must say I generally only do the full deal once a week and get a little chipping before the next manicure, but overall it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I had the acrylics done once, 6 years ago and it completely destroyed my nails.  I&#x27;d given up on trying to grow them out, they peeled, flaked and I was embarrassed to show my hands.  I&#x27;ve used this product for 6 months and now I have to use the nail files for acrylic nails because mine are so hard!  I&#x27;ve not had one nail to peel, chip or break since day one.  You do have to stay on top of it at first and keep applying but now, once a week or so does the trick.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It keeps my nails breaking and splitting.  It dried very fast.</li>
            <li> Does not keep well.  Will go back to Sally Hansen and used as directions tell you on Nailtek Extra (apply every day).  However, for the first time in years I actually have to trim my nails instead of watching them split/peal/tear.</li>
            <li> Did not stay on nails as long as I anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;To give this item a fair review I would have had to use this item for an extended time and I did not do that.&lt;br /&gt;One of the main reasons was it took forever to dry and was peeled much too quickly.</li>
            <li> It is the product that helps &amp; makes my nails strong.  I always used this product when I had my own Manucurist business many years ago.  I am so happy I fount  this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Only product that has every improved my nails!  Awesome stuff!  Will use till I die.</li>
            <li> I Have Brittle nails that crack and peal.  A few years back I commented on a friends nails.&lt;br /&gt;This is what she used so I stated using it also.  It works wonders...I give it a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> The stuff i had last time worked better.  This was thinner.</li>
            <li> Perfect quality. Really helps nails &amp; easily visible only after 24hrs. I love it. Price awesome!!!! Hardens nails remarkably, beyond one&#x27;s imagination.</li>
            <li> I was a bit reluctant to spend more than $5 on yet another clear coat that &amp;#34;promised&amp;#34; to treat my peeling, breaking nails.  After reading so many positive reviews of the Nail Tek brand, I decided to take the risk and go for the Xtra formula since I have had very little luck with other nail strengtheners/hardeners.  I&#x27;ve been using this as a clear coat for a few weeks now, and so far it&#x27;s working!  My job requires a lot of hand washing and contact with cleaners, but Nailtek holds up against it all!  My nails are longer, stronger, and--most importantly--do NOT flake and peel!  To get the best results, I reapply at least one coat every other day.  Be sure to let them dry thoroughly, because the more coats you put on, the more likely it is to smudge if they don&#x27;t dry all of the way between layers.  I highly recommend this product for anyone who has flaking/peeling or thin nails--especially if you feel like you have tried almost every type of strengthener or hardener polish.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it is the only one I have found that actually works and stays on.</li>
            <li> works pretty okay, but not better than some others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Used nail tek foundation ll for several months and my nails were beautiful. My mother had the same results. We purchased the XTRA for difficult resistant nails and absolutely done nothing for either of us. Our nails actually stopped growing and started to break and peel. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> it works!! great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why anyone with weak nails doesn&#x27;t use this as it&#x27;s the absolute best! I now have decent looking nails again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27; m65 years in age always had soft peeling nails. They were like tissue paper. Since using nail tek products ,I now have long beautiful nails. ITS been 5weeks since i started using nail tek. And i,m in amazement.</li>
            <li> This product help keep my nails strong. I have used it in the past. I would purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails for years and it&#x27;s been at least 3 years since I had them removed.  I tried many many nail products and nothing helped me grow even short strong nails.  I then tried weekly manicures and insisted the nail tech use a glass nail file and file my nails in one direction only - not back and forth - so that my nails didn&#x27;t tear. Still no luck.  I became aware of Nailtek Xtra through a friend of mine and I am FINALLY able to grow strong nails - even long nails if that&#x27;s what I want!  It may take several applications before it begins to work, and by application I mean remove existing coat(s), trim or file your nails (and remember to use a very fine grit nail file and file in only one direction), and reapply 2 coats, but it will be worth it. Over time, you may be able to apply just one coat of Nailtek Xtra to keep your nails strong and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is wonderful and I plan to use it forever.</li>
            <li> my item came as i thought it would and was as advertised. the transaction went smoothly and no extra work or worries were needed</li>
            <li> I love Nailtek items.  This Extra is especially helpful to someone who has very thin nails. Using it with the Nailtek Foundation Extra gives good results.</li>
            <li> Like the rest of the commenters, my nails have always been difficult to grow, very thin, flimsy and peeling. But I am a nailart fanatic, and so I polish them frequently even though they&#x27;re short. I visit Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply just to look and see what&#x27;s new and if there is anything that might be good for my nails. I have learned that I should always use cuticle oil between manicures, which I do. I have learned to use a file rather than clippers, and so I use a crystal file that I find to be particularly pleasing. I have tried all kinds of base coats and grow formulas but none helped me until I picked up this product last week at Sally&#x27;s I will be buying on Amazon in the future, but couldn&#x27;t see a reason to hold off providing a review now. People! If your nails are in trouble or you have never been able to get them to grow, this is the product you have been looking for. Try it just once. I have been using it for a week, and I already notice the difference in my nails. So give it a try. You won&#x27;t regret it. I am on Instagram and post frequent photos of my nails, so you can check me out there @palemoontwilight...or just look at the attached photo. My poor lil nails needed some help and are finally getting it.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever used!!  My nails NEVER grew till I used this.  I have used every product imaginable including bone meal, calcium, and all products you put on your nails as well and NOTHING worked until now.  I started using Nail Tek Xtra Maximum Strength and now my nail are growing.  I constantly get compliments on my nail now.  I never dreamed that MY nails would grow.  This product is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve a fingernail that insists upon splitting.  This stops it cold!</li>
            <li> This is one product you just have to try if you cannot grow your nails long.  My nails are dry, flaky, brittle and thin and trying to get them to grow longer than the edge of my nail bed is a losing battle.  I found the Nailtek Xtra (must use the \\&quot;Xtra\\&quot; version for trouble nails) almost a year ago and figured I&#x27;d try it since I&#x27;ve tried other products that were $27 for a very small bottle (that did not work for me).  I was not very optimistic at all since nothing else worked for me, but I am so very glad I tried this one....it works!  You put 2 coats on the first day (and can add polish if you choose between the two coats); then you add one coat each day after that up to seven days. At that point, you remove all with nail polish remover and start over with two coats, etc. up to seven days again.  This product hardens my nails; and, they look very healthy (within two months of use - had damage from artificial nails), with normal pink under the nail and I bought a ceramic nail file to finely file the tiny rough edges that come up.  I am so very, very happy with my long nails now -- I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.  My only problem I have now is having to cut and file my nails often to keep them from getting so long I constantly knock things over when reaching for something (like my coffee cup). lol  Would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants long, beautiful, easy to care for nails.  You will be delighted with this product; I&#x27;m sure of it.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and it&#x27;s actually working. My nails have stopped peeling and they&#x27;re looking healthier. So glad I found this.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for more than week and have followed all the directions stated.  Too early to be sure it is working.</li>
            <li> keeps my nail strong and longer</li>
            <li> For many years I&#x27;ve been cursed with very soft nails! Tried just about everything out there, nothing seemed to work for me....until I tried this. The regular nailtex didn&#x27;t do it but this one sure did, couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I discovered  if you add a coat every day for 3-5 days it works great.</li>
            <li> This is a product that truly lives up to it&#x27;s claims. Had terrible nails. Splitting,peeling,weak and thin. Saw results in as few as three weeks. No more ridges or \\&quot;wavy\\&quot; nails. I use it under and over polish. Now have strong beautiful nails. Will never stop using it. Amazing</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever. I take it to my manicurist and she uses it as my base coat; then as the topcoat. I apply it as an additional topcoat every 3 days and, voila, my manicure lasts 2 weeks without a chip. No more split nails either. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used in attempts to get my nails in better shape. It helps so much with the peeling, helps them grow in healthy, and my nails are strong. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Product has a great reputation. Have tried to grow my own nails forever. Hopefully this does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I accidentally stumbled upon this wonderful product in one of the stores. I was skeptic at first, my nails are extremely brittle they break, bend and take every opportunity to chip. I always hated it. But I bought the product because I figured I&#x27;d give the dream of having long, beautiful and strong nails one more try. Am I glad I did! This product is simply amazing. It&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle. I don&#x27;t know what else to call it! I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my nails the first week! They became stronger, they grew faster, they didn&#x27;t bend or chip! The instructions say to put a coat, nail polish and another coat and then add a coat every day. I don&#x27;t do that. I sometimes forget. Sometimes when I have extra time I put two or three coats at once. And it&#x27;s fine, because it works either way.  I cannot be more pleased with a product that has successfully done what nothing else had managed to do for years! I will tell you, I am not being paid for this review! I recommended this to all of my friends, I sing praises to it every chance I get. Get it. Try it out. Ordering it online is much cheaper than the store - I paid 12$ for this little thing, and even at much more expensive rate it was worth every penny. Since I&#x27;ve ordered two more bottles and when they run out will order more. It is a wonderful product. You will see the difference in your nails within a first week. I also do a lot of cooking and washing and my hands are in the water/dealing with cleaning agents a lot. I try to wear gloves as much as I can, but believe me you will be amazed how little that would matter to your nails. They will be long, strong and  healthy. So get it. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is the best product I&#x27;ve used for splitting nails.  It isn&#x27;t perfect&#x27; however, I haven&#x27;t found anything that is and I&#x27;ve tried almost every product.  This is my second bottle from Amazon.</li>
            <li> After having wraps for years my nails were a disaster. This works!!!</li>
            <li> I tried Nailtex on the recommendation of a friend.  I&#x27;ve experienced less peeling and breaking of my nails with this product and it seems to stay on longer.</li>
            <li> My nails were thrashed from just shellac manicures.  After the first week of use, there was a&lt;br /&gt;big difference.  Even though I am not faithfully applying everyday, 2-3 times is doing the trick&lt;br /&gt;for me.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it contained formaldehyde.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product, following the instructions faithfully, for approx. 3 weeks and my nails are still splitting, peeling and breaking.  Absolutely no improvement - a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> For the first time my nails look like i had tips put on and are growing stronger daily</li>
            <li> I have thin nails due to thyroid problems, and they would bend over my fingertips or break off. Traditional nail hardeners would either not work or peel off in water (such as showering or doing the dishes). Not this stuff! It dries fast and even makes cheap nail polish last longer. The only thing I had an issue with is that it does not come with instructions, but those are easy to find on Google.&lt;br /&gt;I now have longer, stronger nails with no breaks!</li>
