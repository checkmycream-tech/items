            <li>I have to admit, they are BETTER!  </li>
            <li>With so many amazing reviews I thought it would be way better.</li>
            <li>The tweezers are very precise.</li>
            <li>They hold up well and maintain their alignment over many years.</li>
            <li>I have read about this tweezer -- it&#x27;s always one of the top listed products by beauty experts.</li>
            <li>Also many times when pulling the hair these tweezers cut the hair instead of pulling it because of their sharpness.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok but not pass that.</li>
            <li>This time I have to aim many times to get results.</li>
            <li>They pull out hair better than my Revlon tweezers.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought 2 for me and a pair for each daughter.  </li>
            <li>These are much, much better tweezers than what you find in convenience stores or the discount department stores.</li>
            <li>Always bought what I thought were top notch, brand name tweezers, but since using Tweezerman....</li>
            <li>Fantastic tweezers - if you want to have top quality tweezers, this is the only brand and option I&#x27;ve found that will always grab even the finest of hair or child&#x27;s sliver... perfect tweezers.</li>
            <li>The slant tweezers are the best because thy get out those stubborn ingrown hairs with minimal damage to the skin.</li>
            <li>the smallest hairs and are easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>The tip of the tweezers are not 100% smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using tweezerman when the maintenance was free.</li>
            <li>They are precise and lightweight.</li>
            <li>After reading that these are the be all end all tweezers I was excited to try them.</li>
            <li>Great product, doesn&#x27;t rust, and sharp edges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as excited as I thought I would be about them, but they do get the job done better than my old ones do.</li>
            <li>They are good for singling out single brow hairs.</li>
            <li>Never cutting, catches items without frustration.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth the $$.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>The grip isn&#x27;t as great as what I got in the past with Tweezerman.</li>
            <li>MUCH better than the ones you can buy at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li>I really thought this was worth the money, but I don&#x27;t think so anymore.</li>
            <li>those I had before I would just aim at a hair and the tweezer found it, first try.  </li>
            <li>Great tweezers--but don&#x27;t stay sharp for long.</li>
            <li>I wish I had known sooner, I would have saved so much money on eyebrow waxes.</li>
            <li>but, these tweezers make the whole difference because the grab so well.</li>
            <li>I own a Revlon one as one, which works relatively well but does not grasp the smaller hairs.</li>
            <li>My brows grow back so quickly, I couldn&#x27;t afford it and just didn&#x27;t like tweezing because it hurt too much</li>
            <li>The tweezers allow such precision that I was able to remove all of the tiny slivers of wood without having to dig with a needle.  </li>
            <li>They would be great if they cost only $5.00 but definitely are not worth this price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Tweezerman brand.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on cheap ones; buy these!</li>
            <li>I love this little guy!</li>
            <li>I became a raving fan years ago when my baby (now one of the tweezer stealers) walked in mulch and got about 20 splinters in his tender 1 year old feet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a vast collection of tweezers, many of which were simply included in a set, but I had no idea what I was missing until now.</li>
            <li>It does grabs fine hair (most of the time) but is really painful and makes my face irritate.</li>
            <li>These are exactly like the ones the lady at the salon uses but for FAR less expense!</li>
            <li>I have had a pair of these tweezers for several years, and I have bought a pair for all of my daughters as they get old enough to pluck their eyebrows.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t grab hairs very well, and tend to cut hair in half rather than pull it out.</li>

            <li> I have been a fan of tweezerman tweezers for over 20 years.  This is my 3rd purchase. (my offspring like them too)  I became a raving fan years ago when my baby (now one of the tweezer stealers) walked in mulch and got about 20 splinters in his tender 1 year old feet.  The tweezers allow such precision that I was able to remove all of the tiny slivers of wood without having to dig with a needle.  These grip even  the smallest hairs and are easy to handle.  They hold up well and maintain their alignment over many years.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have read about this tweezer -- it&#x27;s always one of the top listed products by beauty experts. I own a Revlon one as one, which works relatively well but does not grasp the smaller hairs. I got an Amazon gift certificate, so I decided to splurge on this tweezer. I have to say, it works great! I would say 9/10 it grasps the small hairs and gets them out.</li>
            <li> After having these tweezers for about a year, I have decided I like them, but they didn&#x27;t stay sharp very long. The tweezers were kept in my makeup bag, not cluttered. And I used the plastic cap over the tip for a long while.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend Tweezerman brand.  Use them in the past.  Also bought other brands. I am sticking with this brand.  Never cutting, catches items without frustration.</li>
            <li> I have had a pair of these tweezers for several years, and I have bought a pair for all of my daughters as they get old enough to pluck their eyebrows. They are the best! Don&#x27;t waste your money on cheap ones; buy these!</li>
            <li> I wish I had known sooner, I would have saved so much money on eyebrow waxes. My brows grow back so quickly, I couldn&#x27;t afford it and just didn&#x27;t like tweezing because it hurt too much but, these tweezers make the whole difference because the grab so well.</li>
            <li> These are exactly like the ones the lady at the salon uses but for FAR less expense! MUCH better than the ones you can buy at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Why all the rave reviews? I find these tweezers unpleasant to use. They are very sharp and I actually have a few little scabs on my skin from using them. They don&#x27;t grab hairs very well, and tend to cut hair in half rather than pull it out. Especially the stubborn ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the $$.</li>
            <li> These are expensive as tweezers go but after reading the reviews I decided to purchase.  They are sharp and if you use them to tweeze your eyebrows or pull a stray chin hair they cut your skin.  Also many times when pulling the hair these tweezers cut the hair instead of pulling it because of their sharpness.  They would be great if they cost only $5.00 but definitely are not worth this price. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I waited so long to buy these. Awesome accuracy.</li>
            <li> This product is ok but not pass that. With so many amazing reviews I thought it would be way better. It does grabs fine hair (most of the time) but is really painful and makes my face irritate. It also breaks the hair instead of pulling it because of is sharpness. The tip of the tweezers are not 100% smooth. I really thought this was worth the money, but I don&#x27;t think so anymore. DISAPPOINTED by the quality and performance compared to the price of it.</li>
            <li> I am amazed that this tweezer is not of the same quality as those I have had in the past.  I will keep it but maybe your manufacturer&#x27; has changed.&lt;br /&gt;With those I had before I would just aim at a hair and the tweezer found it, first try.  This time I have to aim many times to get results.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers--but don&#x27;t stay sharp for long.</li>
            <li> Does&#x27;t pick up anything!</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this brand. I&#x27;ve been using tweezerman when the maintenance was free. Great product, doesn&#x27;t rust, and sharp edges.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are very precise. they are sharp unlike other dull ones I have purchased before. definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> After reading that these are the be all end all tweezers I was excited to try them. They are precise and lightweight. They pull out hair better than my Revlon tweezers. I&#x27;m not as excited as I thought I would be about them, but they do get the job done better than my old ones do.</li>
            <li> Fantastic tweezers - if you want to have top quality tweezers, this is the only brand and option I&#x27;ve found that will always grab even the finest of hair or child&#x27;s sliver... perfect tweezers.</li>
            <li> These tweezers will get short hairs started but they don&#x27;t grip to pull it out all the way. They are good for singling out single brow hairs. Have to be careful because these babies are sharp and sometimes cuts the hair you&#x27;re pulling out.  I like these for getting the hair up but to pull it out you can&#x27;t beat the tweezers I bought in Austria. Don&#x27;t know what they are called but they grip and don&#x27;t let go. They&#x27;re the best and I&#x27;m glad I bought 2 for me and a pair for each daughter.  Tweezerman doesn&#x27;t hang on to hair to pull it out.</li>
            <li> This is a Tweezerman product that won&#x27;t disappoint you.&lt;br /&gt;But it can be dangerous so careful when you use it. You may hurt yourself!</li>
            <li> Love tweezerman! These tweezers are great just like the rest of their products! The slant tweezers are the best because thy get out those stubborn ingrown hairs with minimal damage to the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a vast collection of tweezers, many of which were simply included in a set, but I had no idea what I was missing until now. I love this little guy!</li>
            <li> Best tweezer product you can buy! If you are a daily plucker of those unwanted hairs, this is what you are looking for! These are much, much better tweezers than what you find in convenience stores or the discount department stores. Once you try these, you&#x27;ll never want to go back to anything else!</li>
            <li> The grip isn&#x27;t as great as what I got in the past with Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and Service</li>
            <li> Best tweeezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Always bought what I thought were top notch, brand name tweezers, but since using Tweezerman....I have to admit, they are BETTER!  Try them, you&#x27;ll like them!</li>
