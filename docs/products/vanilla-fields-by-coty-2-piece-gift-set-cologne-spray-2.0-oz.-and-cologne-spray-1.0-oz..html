            <li> This is only perfume that I wear. I love it.</li>
            <li> Vanilla Fields is the only scent my allergies can tolerate.  I love it.</li>
            <li> would like to be able to buy the lotion</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance. I love it. Great price too !!</li>
            <li> Purchase went very smoothly.  Item was as stated.  Excellent seller!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and great price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite! I love two different sizes, one for home and one for travel. It&#x27;s hard to find, other than on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This product from the Amazon LLC shipper is spoiled. And guess what, they don&#x27;t allow returns on perfume! It&#x27;s considered a hazardous material! Perfume must be handled carefully, don&#x27;t waste your money from this shipper!</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this cologne is that it is almost impossible to find at stores. That mystifies me because this stuff smells better than most of the perfume out there for 2 or 3 times the price. Wonderful fragrance. Grab it if you can!</li>
            <li> The best cologne ever made.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife after searching every store ever!! Its her favorite and she was so thrilled to have it !</li>
            <li> Met expectations. Same product as in box store.</li>
            <li> Timely and just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Our daughter has been using Vanilla Fields for years and she has found it&#x27;s getting more difficult to find this scent in local stores.  This was on her Christmas list and she was absolutely thrilled with it.  It was packed well and arrived in one piece.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vanilla Fields for maybe 10 years, since a friend gave me a bottle for Christmas.  I love the aroma and people always complement on my scent.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Vanilla&#x27; scented perfume seems to be one of the least gag-inducing. Since I like the smell of vanilla anyway &amp; SO MANY people are sensitive to perfume smells, I decided to give up the lovely, heavy, oriental perfumes I love (eg: Passion, Poison, Opium, Bal a Versailles, etc) &amp; go with Vanilla Fields. I get lots of &#x27;Oh, you smell nice&#x27;. I&#x27;ve been wearing &amp;#34;VF&amp;#34; for years now &amp; discovered that the stores only sell it @ Christmas time but Amazon sells it all year, any time I need to replenish my supply.</li>
            <li> Fast service and product quality as expected</li>
            <li> I found this cologne set on Amazon after looking at every store in the city. My mom really wanted it and thought it was discontinued. I was excited when I found it on Amazon. It made her Christmas very special. She was like a little kid when she opened it!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife who was underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff smells great buy this all the time would buy again normally stock up at Christmas bye</li>

            <li> Wonderful scent. Good value.</li>
            <li> I purchased the set for my daughter-in-law as part of her Christmas present.I priced it at local retailers,but what they had to offer vs value/price was disappointing! Its the only fragrance she will wear,so there was no other option.I found this and she really loves that there was a purse size for on the go,and a regular size for everyday use.She wants more for her Birthday in a few months.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom and she LOVES it!</li>
