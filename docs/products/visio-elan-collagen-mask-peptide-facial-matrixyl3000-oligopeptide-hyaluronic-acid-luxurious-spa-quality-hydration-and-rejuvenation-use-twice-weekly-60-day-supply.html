            <li>It made me feel good from the minute I opened the box (because of the elegant jars and pumps) all the way to the end of toweling dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what extended use will do for my age lines.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love my new skin care.  </li>

            <li>You will see the fine lines and help with those who have larger pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This really hydrates your skin.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have dry skin, so I was happy that I wasn&#x27;t dried out after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting, but it honestly has no smell.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different well known and expensive brands of skin care, but this is &amp;#34;hands down&amp;#34; the best.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth (and I mean baby butt smooth) with diminished lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love that because being asthmatic, I have a lot of problem with heavy perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Visio explained to me that the effects of that can affect a new product.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, yet I can use all of Visio Élan products.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>First time trying this Collagen Mask Peptide Facial.</li>
            <li>This is one of the way I think you can help with reducing the sign of aging and giving back that elasticity to skin and supporting hydration.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel so soft!</li>
            <li>The mask is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel so tight you can hardly stand it while drying as so many masks tend to do.  </li>
            <li>I leave it on for a few hours and when I take it off, my skin is soft and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>I have used it 3 times so far.</li>
            <li>When I was young</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had no problems using it.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I used this mask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After washing it off, my face was soft.</li>
            <li>The areas around the eyes and nose for me are critical and that is where I have most of m trouble when summer is here</li>
            <li>I love this fluffy white stuff.</li>
            <li>It is a thick, white cream that was very easy to spread over my face.</li>
            <li>However, this mask did not give much of a feeling of hydration to my dry cheeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see and feel what my skin will be like in a few months!</li>
            <li>I am a 62 year old woman with the usual fine lines and wrinkles and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a soft milky texture and it leaves my skin feeling the same way.</li>
            <li>They told me it can take 2-4 weeks for the previous products to clear out of my skin, and allow it to get back to the normal state.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First time trying this Collagen Mask Peptide Facial. I didn&#x27;t really see any difference. I have used it 3 times so far. Probably will not purchase again. Also too pricey.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product and the information that they had on it.  I used it after a micro dermabrasion treatment. I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I am a 62 year old woman with the usual fine lines and wrinkles and dry skin.  When I was young I had beautiful skin that people would actually compliment but those days have gone by.  My pores are more noticeable now and I sometimes tend to redness.  Today I pampered myself with the Visio Elan Collagen Mask and I am very, very pleased with the results.  The mask is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel so tight you can hardly stand it while drying as so many masks tend to do.  It rinses fairly easily with tepid water.  The results for me were immediate.  My skin is smooth (and I mean baby butt smooth) with diminished lines and wrinkles.  What was my skin&#x27;s tendency to be red has now tamed to a healthy glow.  I&#x27;m very impressed.  I feel like I got a glimpse of the girl with the beautiful complexion I once had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review.  Thank you so much of the opportunity to try your wonderful product!</li>
            <li> used it yesterday for the first time, and I felt the difference, softer skin.</li>
            <li> I did receive the Collagen Peptide Hydrating Mask and I used last Friday and it is an amazing product.  I never had that experience before with any mask.  I am derma rolling my face and my body once a month,  so the mask left my face very smooth like a baby.  Thank you for an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I think it is better for oily skin with blackheads. I came to this conclusion because I have combination skin with an oily T-zone. I have some small blackheads at my T-zone, and this mask is very good at clearing them out. However, this mask did not give much of a feeling of hydration to my dry cheeks. So I only started applying it to my T-zone and use a different hydrating mask on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> .  I spoke with Visio Elan, and we talked about my previous line of skin care.  One of the anti-aging products I used previously has 3 different alcohols in it.  Visio explained to me that the effects of that can affect a new product.  They told me it can take 2-4 weeks for the previous products to clear out of my skin, and allow it to get back to the normal state.  So, I will just have to be patient and see what happens.  They also explained to me that their products do not contain anything that would cause burning.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time at night while watching TV. I leave it on for a few hours and when I take it off, my skin is soft and smooth feeling. Love it.</li>
            <li> Once you get this Visio Elan wash your face and then dry off you can then apply the Visio Elan to your skin. Leave on for about 15 minutes then wash off you will have another step in you at home spa treatment to yourself.  This is one of the way I think you can help with reducing the sign of aging and giving back that elasticity to skin and supporting hydration. You will see the fine lines and help with those who have larger pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Sesame oil and safflower along with Mango Butter this helps moisturizers the skin and help to reduce inflammation. The areas around the eyes and nose for me are critical and that is where I have most of m trouble when summer is here but in the winter that is not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vision Elan gave me Visio Elan collagen mask for free for my review of the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I received it within 2 days and I have been using it for over a week and a half. I started to see small changes after a couple of times using it. I have sensitive skin and had no problems using it. It left my skin refreshed, soothed and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;It is true what they say you pay for what you get. Even though this product could be expensive it will be well worth the price. I will be ordering more products in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review. Thank you so much of the opportunity to try your wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I used this mask. It is a thick, white cream that was very easy to spread over my face. It wasn&#x27;t at all greasy and it didn&#x27;t dry out to be crunchy. It has the texture of a thick lotion. It was very easy to wipe off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit surprised to see that it has absolutely no smell. I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting, but it honestly has no smell. I actually liked that my face didn&#x27;t smell like a peppermint for the rest of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing it off, my face was soft. I tend to have dry skin, so I was happy that I wasn&#x27;t dried out after using it. I&#x27;m excited to see what extended use will do for my age lines. Even after only a few times using it, I can tell a difference. I love it and will use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased and honest review. These opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new skin care.  It made me feel good from the minute I opened the box (because of the elegant jars and pumps) all the way to the end of toweling dry.  I have used a lot of different well known and expensive brands of skin care, but this is &amp;#34;hands down&amp;#34; the best.  My skin has never had such a healthy glow and it&#x27;s so smooth.  Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to repeat what I wrote for the microdermabrasion facial scrub since the great results I&#x27;m getting are attributed to all the wonderful visio élan products.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product shipped as  promised.”</li>
            <li> I love this fluffy white stuff. I put it on my face and neck for 10 minutes. I wash it off with tepid water as recommended, but finish with a cold rinse. it really firms my skin and gives it a nice finish. I find that makeup goes on so smoothly when put on after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this twice and plan to make it a regular part of my skin care.&lt;br /&gt;I love this jar too. And the name. Be Glorious, everyone!.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, yet I can use all of Visio Élan products. This mask is an added plus to an already superb line of products. This mask, does not burn or irritate my skin at all. It&#x27;s not like the typical mask that dry up and you peel off. It has a soft milky texture and it leaves my skin feeling the same way. I would recommend and buy again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they donate a dollar to a charity. Not many companies are giving back so I like to support them. As for the product, it&#x27;s pretty good. The ingredients are impressive and you get a 2 month supply. It feels like all of the other beauty masks on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> Results are very good. Makes my skin very soft.  Using it with Serum and Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:b3e163bc2ed5384f2e50a278c427f43b]]his is my video review for Visio Elan Be Glorious Collagen Mask which is fabulous!  It&#x27;s spa quality and I&#x27;ve saved a lot of money doing this at home.  Apply a small amount around your face and neck then wait about 15 minutes.  Wash off with tepid water and your skin will be radiant and glowing.  It has collagen, peptides and hyaluronic acid which is very similar to a mask I&#x27;ve paid $85 for in a spa.  This really hydrates your skin.  The jar lasts me about 2 - 3months and I use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> This mask is delightful.  It has the faintest hint of a wonderful fragrance.  I love that because being asthmatic, I have a lot of problem with heavy perfumes.  It is like a heavy night cream but is a mask.  I thought my skin felt better moisturized after using it.  It is so easy to apply and remove.  It is amazing because it can go on the whole face including the neck, lips and around the eyes.  I also love the idea that is it made of Vitamin C and Aloe Vera.  Absolutely awesome!  I received this product in return for my honest review and I say give it a try.</li>
            <li> Its a thick zinc-oxide cream. Meh.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so soft! I struggle with skin imperfections but by using this product a couple times a week (for the past two weeks) in the morning I have noticed a change in my skin already. I&#x27;m excited to see and feel what my skin will be like in a few months!</li>
