            <li>So after that, I learned to make a pony tail first and it worked great and made a nice bun.  </li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I also found that if I left it in my hair for a day and then slept on it, or even just a day or night, it gave me beautiful, bouncy curls, and I didn&#x27;t have to do anything with a curling iron!</li>
            <li>I love that element but the one thing I didn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>is better (but 20x the price.)</li>

            <li>ONE ROD ON TOP AND ONE ON BOTTOM TO EVENLY DISTRIBUTE IT.</li>
            <li>The bun does an ok job on my hair.  </li>

            <li>and I love the results</li>
            <li>This magic bun maker is made out of foam.</li>

            <li>there are many how to&#x27;s &amp; tutorials on YouTube for the people saying they can&#x27;t figure out how to use it</li>

            <li>I love how my hair curls at the ends when I take it out:)</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t LOVE this product</li>
            <li>Love what this is supposed to do, but can&#x27;t make it work.</li>

            <li>Magic?</li>
            <li>I like the product and it would&#x27;ve been more helpful if the instructions are in detail.</li>
            <li>Magic Hair Bun Sponge Maker</li>
            <li>I might want to get couple more for backup.</li>
            <li>Look for better solutions.</li>
            <li>This my friend, is better then the donut shaped hair bun shaper in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This is flimsy and won&#x27;t stay in place without many bobby pins and won&#x27;t hold shape.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I always wear my hair in a ponytail and thie magic sponge</li>
            <li>but my sister has and its pretty good and what not :)</li>
            <li>This one is very cheap and easy to use.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use and very light.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>, my bun stays perfectly intact all day long with this item.  </li>
            <li>holds my hair in many ways and very easy to use also easy to wash and keep clean will order more</li>
            <li>In the true, I&#x27;m already trying to use this! :-)</li>
            <li>I have very long hair as well, so it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li>It would help this product is it came with a more easily read piece of the directions as to how to use it.</li>
            <li>My hair refused to follow these directions at all, and no matter how many faces I made during the process, I couldn&#x27;t get the magic hair bun sponge maker to contort in such a way that it would hold all of my hair in and make a beautiful bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can do FAR more things with your hair, and get very nice looking buns, including braided.</li>
            <li>Seems like ot would be very cool...</li>
            <li>It came 2 weeks early and it works great.</li>
            <li>Works great on my 3 year old, held through her performances with hair spray and pins</li>
            <li>shipping was fast and the price is fair.</li>
            <li>and it really really looks good</li>
            <li>and it really really looks good</li>
            <li>But its really unnoticeable and on a good day</li>
            <li>My bestie loved it so much</li>
            <li>but it actually work really good!</li>
            <li>I tried it again to get a smaller one, but after that i couldn&#x27;t do another good bun!</li>
            <li>Takes longer than most items on Amazon to ship but worth it!</li>
            <li>but no biggie, it&#x27;s easy to work around</li>
            <li>makes buns easy but did not come with booklet and flower.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Definetly makes making buns easy</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to put on and stays their.</li>
            <li>Buy multiples as the foam does break easily.</li>
            <li>I think if I cut a few inches from my hair I&#x27;d be able to get the best use out of it.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t fall for this \\&quot;easy to use\\&quot; stuff ever again.  </li>
            <li>Its so easy to use</li>
            <li>i liked this product very much it works</li>
            <li>My cats apparently thought the material was a great chew toy</li>
            <li>This is super easy to use and comes in handy when you need to do your hair quickly or even for a night out.</li>
            <li>purchased a similar product from a trade show, worked beautifully ,</li>
            <li>that is FINE, and that just didn&#x27;t work with this...which is why I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>It is okay it just isn&#x27;t great for long hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work on baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>so she could do a super cute sleek bun for school.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and good quality hair pins</li>
            <li>and I love it so very much!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure If this would work or not, but it was super cheap, so I decided to try.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely perfect if you have kids and don&#x27;t want to have your little ones tug on your hair.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect fit but must be played with a little so that the product part does not show through,</li>
            <li>I just fold the ends in and they are not visible and my hair stays in place all day after I secure the bun with bobby pins.  </li>
            <li>this product is cheap and doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s so light weight, you don&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it would have been great if there were hooks at the ends</li>
            <li>if you have light colored hair...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and would not hold in.</li>
            <li>This is made cheaply and will not work like the orginal Hairdini.  </li>
            <li>This takes some practice but it does work and was comfortable for my daughter to wear.</li>
            <li>It was cheap...</li>
            <li>and I love shopping on Amazon, so it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>THIS SHOULD HAVE COST 25 CENTS, WITH FREE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>It was cheap</li>
            <li>But, not too upset since it was soo cheap.</li>
            <li>Although it looks cheap, I did not mind using it.</li>
            <li>Cheap does not even begin to describe it.</li>
            <li>I &#x27; ve used it several times and the bun looks great each time.</li>
            <li>But it is cheap</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>But other than that, it looks great. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was also cut off after the first use!!</li>
            <li>this hair piece is so very amazing and gives me an extra hair style</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful for hair up</li>
            <li>This product is very smart and super easy to use!</li>
            <li>Quick and easy updo.</li>
            <li>it was easy to order and came in quickly.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s a super nice item/idea and works VERY well on shorter hair.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m pretty sure it works and stuff, i just don&#x27;t know how to put it on.</li>
            <li>I love these sponge maker,at first</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Better if I had fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>She loves wearing her hair in a bun and this helps her make a bun that looks clean.</li>
            <li>This is easy and fun to do.</li>
            <li>I have yet to try on dry hair, but it&#x27;s definitely great buy.</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t knock off a star for that because loose buns are really attractive.</li>
            <li>While it arrived far more quickly than estimated, my hopes and dreams for an elegant updo were dashed as soon as I opened the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If we used a large number of bobby pins, we might be able to make it stay in place, but it just flops.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing it right now too!</li>
            <li>It really works just as specified on the package--I just followed the cutely drawn instructions.  </li>
            <li>It really works just as specified on the package--I just followed the cutely drawn instructions.</li>
            <li>I also like that the item is affordable and package so i can get free shipping which is awesome one thing I wish they would put the how to use in different language especially English</li>
            <li>I tried using it and it came out with a good bun, but a very very big one.</li>
            <li>The product itself is not bad.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much and found it easy to use and mold.  </li>
            <li>right on the first try  :)</li>
            <li>Cannot get it to work right, than cannot secure</li>
            <li>and it make super cool buns</li>
            <li>They are super chaep but do take a while to get here</li>
            <li>This product gave me super powers.</li>
            <li>It shipped quick</li>
            <li>This product is a joke, the product is super flemsy &amp; is already about to break..</li>
            <li>, my hair rolls right around it without slipping, and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>it is made out of cheap material, snapped and broke when I first got it</li>
            <li>bun maker works OK, but the foam is very soft and I expect it will fray rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more like the hot buns, but there really isn&#x27;t anything to it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!  </li>
            <li>The other version [plastic with hooks at the end] worked spectacularly well!</li>
            <li>However, my best friend has very long non-layered blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much with this because of how cheap it cost.</li>
            <li>and it was just too much even for this huge thing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used yesterday and I liked, it looks like only my hair, we cannot see the stuff there.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would be a nice one for short hair!</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>and these are the only kind that work in my hair.</li>
            <li>but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>But useful</li>
            <li>NOT EVEN WORTH $4.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it for the price I paid</li>
            <li>and you can try different styles using it and develop your own technique.</li>
            <li>This is not even worth 1cent.</li>
            <li>There is no way I could ever make such a nice bun without this product because of the thiness of my hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the smell, but worth the money.</li>
            <li>Over all worth the buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy &amp; cheap &amp; it had also didn&#x27;t take very long for it to arrive to my house.</li>
            <li>This little thing has gone to conferences parties meetings very nice.</li>
            <li>Very user friendly.</li>
            <li>For the most part it looks and fits great however the only down fall to it</li>
            <li>But, it just falls right out</li>
            <li>I have it in right now</li>
            <li>One time I did it right</li>
            <li>Bought this and it shipped right when it was supposed to</li>
            <li>If you do buy these, you&#x27;ll just end up with two very large garbage bag ties...</li>
            <li>If I kind of \\&quot;fold\\&quot; my hair in half then start winding, I can MAYBE make a bun and have it stay put, but that&#x27;s a HUGE maybe.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and was a good price just worried about how long it will last before breaking.</li>
            <li>Seems easy to use but really is&#x27;nt, and the donut bun gives me better results for my long hair.</li>
            <li>I love that it is gentle on my long hair and so easy to work into any style I desire..</li>
            <li>its great.its only good for long hair and medium lenth.it does not work good on short hair.</li>
            <li>Great, I love this simple product, makes elegant updo or big messy bun.</li>
            <li>Thanks so very much!</li>
            <li>I took a chance and bought this since it didn&#x27;t cost very much</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth buying, just get the donut looking one, or use socks.</li>
            <li>Its exactly like the one I used to have.</li>
            <li>The foam tore away on the first use.  </li>
            <li>but i was willing to try because of the price to me</li>
            <li>it is exactly what I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>looks exactly like the item in the picture.</li>
            <li>i kind of expected it to be like the snap bracelets that wrap around your arm.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I was a bit scared at first because when I received it ,it did look on the cheapo side.</li>
            <li>The bun comes exactly as shown and it also comes with it&#x27;s step showing you how to do it.</li>
            <li>First one tore while twisting and</li>
            <li>Love it for my short hair..</li>
            <li>I bought the &amp;#34;hot buns&amp;#34; online first for 10x</li>
            <li>as much, what a waist of money!</li>
            <li>Overall I was well pleased with the process, the purchase, and the ease of the experience.</li>
            <li>I purchased the magic hair bun sponge maker when my hair wouldn&#x27;t go up in a proper bun after I had cut it.  </li>
            <li>i have one similar but its wayyyyy better.</li>
            <li>Love this, wish I would have ordered this way back.</li>
            <li>When I first got it..</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>exactly as pictured, held stronger than i thought it would.</li>
            <li>Either I have too much hair or something because I just couldn&#x27;t get this thing to work!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as shown in the pic.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering another and keeping that one for myself as I love to wear my hair in protective styles especially buns.</li>
            <li>This product would work good for a &#x27;messy&#x27; bun look but that&#x27;s not what I needed at all.</li>
            <li>All with no messy product or hot curling irons!!</li>
            <li>I have very long, very fine slippery hair and most gizmos designed to help put hair up in a bun or french pleat</li>
            <li>I have very long, very fine slippery hair and most gizmos designed to help put hair up in a bun or french pleat</li>
            <li>it works just fine to me , i like the little cute bun it makes.</li>
            <li>so maybe thats why this product was not mad particularly for my type of hair</li>
            <li>Its a great first step in helping us military women bun up our hair properly and neatly.[[ASIN</li>
            <li>She could use the black color and just get the bun right in place and perfect in just a few seconds.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave this a 3 Star is because it works fine in my sisters hair, she has straight fine hair, I on the other hand have layered curls.</li>
            <li>I think it would work better on all one length hair, not layered and long like mine.</li>
            <li>I really love this bun maker, but I found out after the fact that my hair is just WAY tooooo long for it to work the way it should.</li>
            <li>My hair is waist-length and just too long to be able to wrap it all with the item and then still have room to fold ANY amount of it over to hold the hair in place.</li>
            <li>I would recommend and did recommend this to my friends with long hair who have tried to copy many of my hairstyles.</li>
            <li>This makes it so easy to put my hair in a french twist.  </li>
            <li>but It actually was really easy</li>
            <li>is, I kind of wish that it had some sort of hidden hook so that the bun sponge stays in place</li>
            <li>I have fine light blonde hair that is just barely shoulder length.</li>
            <li>There are videos on you tube to show you how to use it but for me it just wasn&#x27;t strong enough</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NOT EVEN STRONG ENOUGH TO GRAB ALL OF MY HAIR</li>
            <li>worked fine for my hair, which falls to about the middle of my chest.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used several times and is fine</li>
            <li>I remove it and my hair has perfect, messy fluffy curls.</li>
            <li>I am happy the cost was so low, as I threw it out as a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li>I would have spent it better if I&#x27;d just thrown it in the street and walked away.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>I really needed something like this since I&#x27;ve had my baby</li>
            <li>Either I have too much hair</li>
            <li>The foam holds up really well for all day weat.  </li>
            <li>As figured, my hair was too much for it to handle.</li>
            <li>I did not believe it would really work</li>
            <li>I did not believe it would really work</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really understand how it worked either until I tried it out.</li>
            <li>and it holds my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really make out the steps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap looking spongy fabric covering a bendable piece of metal with an opening in the middle...</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really show, but</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t hold the donut shape very well</li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t work out for me very well.</li>
            <li>and this really works to make a neat bun.  </li>
            <li>I really, really like this thing.</li>
            <li>For 54 cents I can&#x27;t really expect much, I guess.</li>
            <li>I really did try but it never would hold my hair in a bun.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for bobby pins or clips that much.  </li>
            <li>This device is both simple and comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t bend very well either</li>
            <li>it works for me and  makes workingwith curly haired  grandchild&#x27;s hair  much easier.</li>
            <li>but this item is a life saver ..and not only that is really cheap</li>
            <li>We go straight from school</li>
            <li>so there isn&#x27;t much time to spend fixing hair.</li>
            <li>It is very flimsy, I thought it would be sturdier.</li>
            <li>so it did not work very well for me.</li>
            <li>Seems to hold hair really well, even on my daughter when she is running around and playing.</li>
            <li>After trying so much the bun maker got so bent out of shape, so now it sits in the corner collecting dust.</li>
            <li>i like it so much.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tricky and it takes many tries sometimes to make it work.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Received fast, like the product.</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing that it promises.</li>
            <li>The price is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I searched tutorial for hair bun on youtube and made a really neat hair bun.</li>
            <li>This product helps me make a great looking bun with my straight thin hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is way to thick, would be good for thinner hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve needed something easy to use to keep my long hair off my neck.  </li>
            <li>and I have a nice tight bun with no pins whatsoever!</li>
            <li>but I was so excited to open it</li>
            <li>In my opinion it works way better than those other products advertised on TV to make a hair bun, you know, the wrap, snap and go thingie?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly looking for new and improved ways to easily accomplish classic looks, and when I saw the &amp;#34;Magic Hair Bun Sponge Maker&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Thick hair, just get hot buns, they&#x27;re amazing.</li>
            <li>It works just fine, as long as I put a couple bobby pins in where the two ends connect when I wrap it around my hair.</li>
            <li>wow, pretty fool proof.  </li>
            <li>I remember getting similar items to this one at a craft fair when I was little and have been using them for some time.</li>
            <li>But I have learned to harness my new powers and my life is forever changed!</li>
            <li>and it was less then .50 and free shipping!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended seller.</li>
            <li>I would do a high ponytail then roll my ends off to the side roll it</li>
            <li>If you really want to look good, spend the extra money and get a quality bun maker - this one is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this please!!</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li>This is great for making supercute buns (don&#x27;t think wrong there :3)&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>i really like it so far</li>
            <li>It pretty much tells me that the reviewers simply did not know how to use this product.</li>
            <li>and I have really long hair and have tried many different ones.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to do it either.</li>
            <li>worked great on my hair, which is medium thickness and length, and on my roomates hair, which is extremely thick and very long.</li>
            <li>The bun won&#x27;t be as tight as if you were making one with wet hair and pulling it tight but for ballet practice it is quick and easy for the most part.</li>
            <li>well it come in handy on a bad hair day and thank you:)</li>
            <li>50 years old and haven&#x27;t found a decent \\&quot;hair accessory\\&quot; yet.</li>
            <li>Okay so the item is weirdly shaped and only does good on really long hair if that.</li>
            <li>Steer clear!  </li>
            <li>Most likely I&#x27;ll buy another one but from a different source in the future.</li>
            <li>This may take some practice to get better, but I don&#x27;t think it is god as the curly q bobby pins I usually use.</li>
            <li>while i applaud the general IDEA of it, it wasn&#x27;t very well conceived.</li>
            <li>It is a MUST HAVE especially in the summertime when it is hot</li>
            <li>Just get the as seen on tv hot buns this product over a vey very short period of times becomes undone because nothing is holding it shut.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>IT DOES NOT WORK &amp; TORE APART SO EASILY!!!!!!! :(</li>
            <li>THE ONE I HAD IN THE PAST IS INFINITY TIMES BETTER THAN THIS WHICH LOOKS</li>
            <li>Anyway the thing first wasnt cut all the way through the middle</li>
            <li>I even jazz it up a bit by either pinning a flower next to my bun or putting a pretty scrunchie around it.</li>
            <li>I have some pretty long hair (past my bum), so I did find it&#x27;s easier to not get a loose feeling bun if I put my hair in to a ponytail first, but it&#x27;s not needed to get a nice bun.</li>
            <li>The idea of this was to save time by having a quick and easy way to pull my hair up and get it out of the way, but if I have to try and try then try some more and still maybe not make it happen, then that&#x27;s not saving any time at all and just creating a mess of tangled hair and a lot of needless stress.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few days now and have found it easy to use</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few days now and have found it easy to use, my...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and its comes a little below the shoulder.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT get the ones that have that little hole in the bottom of them, those are cheap imitations.</li>
            <li>Otherwise this is fine for the price -  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have long hair, as my hair is long and this wasn&#x27;t large enough.</li>
            <li>but i had to do a little extra work with making sure everything was tucked in.</li>
            <li>Overall in excited to use it on dry hair soon.</li>
            <li>I DIDN&#x27;T SPEND 5 BUCKS ON THIS SPONGE THAT WILL CLEARLY DECLINE IN QUALITY</li>
            <li>I like what it did as far as making the bun</li>
            <li>I was so surprised</li>
            <li>I was so surprised</li>
            <li>but I really thought the bun it make would be a lot bigger</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter uses this every day.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair which reaches my butt.  </li>
            <li>she wants a different look.  </li>
            <li>its from somewhere far far away</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li>The wire never bent completely around</li>
            <li>WAS SO CHEAP THAT THE THING WAS A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li>THAT IS NEARLY UP TO MY ARMPITS.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WHEN YOU COMPLETE THE BUN IN THE POSITION DESIRED.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with my old standby, the hair donut.</li>
            <li>She says it pulls on her hair and only uses it when we need a fast bun.</li>
            <li>but its just like my old old</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work for me so far.</li>
            <li>Gets old after a couple uses</li>
            <li>I would not waste your money on this one</li>
            <li>Personally, I say save your money, or spend your $$ and buy a Topsy tail (Real one, by</li>
            <li>It would probably work better with someone who has thick hair.</li>
            <li>this product was okay, but it didn&#x27;t really work in my hair, and the quality was poor because it broke after like 5 minutes &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li>This stays in the hair  and is nice for someone who has thin hair and want to wear it up</li>
            <li>I expected my first attempt to be a failure, but my first &amp;#34;sock&amp;#34; bun actually came out cute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the military and needed a product to make my bun as clean and neat as possible.</li>
            <li>Decent enough product.</li>
            <li>(my hair is mid length not thick)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a spongy tool that even with my long hair, I can&#x27;t get the very end covered when I have my hair in a bun.</li>
            <li>While it makes a bun as stated it doesn&#x27;t work with something that has very think hair because it is not long enough.</li>
            <li>It came without the rose photographed in the picture, but the device does work well to make a bun, I have extra long hair (past my waist)</li>
            <li>For the price I&#x27;m not unhappy, but the inner wire is not particularly strong and will open up unless held and pinned very firmly - which can be something of a trick to do when doing your own hair.  </li>
            <li>this product works really well on long hair!</li>
            <li>I had one of these for years, then my dog decided it needed a new chew toy, and I have been looking for this for the last year!  </li>
            <li>and they ended up chewing a big portion off the end, and it didn&#x27;t work so well after that because while we could still roll the hair, the end didn&#x27;t allow for the extra hair to roll over the exposed part very well.</li>
            <li>It came with no instructions, which isnt a major problem because i already know how to use them</li>
            <li>It does not close the whole way on my hair and loose when I move.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At work it&#x27;s a little loose feeling after a lot of moving, so I&#x27;d recommend pinning it in place for extra security, but it&#x27;s fantastic otherwise!</li>
            <li>I think maybe a more expensive (higher quality) version of this product might work and perhaps work only on specific hair types.</li>
            <li>A classy look in an instant!</li>
            <li>My 5 year old daughter is currently enrolled in Ballet classes and this works wonders for her bun!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Honestly it seems useless to me</li>
            <li>You might be able to get this hair bun to do what they have done in the picture if you had thin hair, but you can&#x27;t make a bun with it because the ends don&#x27;t come together.</li>
            <li>My hair is ling and thick and this is strong enough to hold it up.</li>
            <li>I recommend this over the other bun maker because this product is much easier to use and it is also softer</li>
            <li>Extremely hard to make an actual bun, the material is so cheap</li>
            <li>do&#x27;s as you can use it not only to create an entire bun but also a half bun just on top of your head, leaving the rest down.</li>
            <li>She is 3 years old and has hair to the middle of her back.</li>
            <li>I CAN MAKE A BUB OR GO A DIFFERENT WAY AND MAKE A FRENCH ROLL WITH NO TROUBLE.</li>
            <li>but I had to go buy pictures mainly, the product left loose buns</li>
            <li>The ones I bought a long time ago are getting old</li>
            <li>It worked well, so long as you could get the hair near the end and keep the hair from falling out as you are rolling it.</li>
            <li>This barely works for my daughter who has thin fine hair.  </li>
            <li>however my hair&#x27;s too long right now to use it properly-we&#x27;re talking halfway down my back.</li>
            <li>How can you really complain about something that costs less than fifty cents?</li>
            <li>It made it much easier than using the typical donut accessory.</li>
            <li>This problem was really no fault of the seller, although maybe it should be mentioned in the item description that it doesn&#x27;t work much at all with REALLY LONG hair.</li>
            <li>really long, really thick hair won&#x27;t fit it all neatly.</li>
            <li>The wire frame is easily bendable and with thin hair stays in place without the need for bobby pins.</li>
            <li>This is not for girls with super thick hair.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my little sister&#x27;s hair, which is pretty long</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, so I guess I expected something a little more heavy duty..</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re a bit of an airhead like me, get something a little but more simple, or something with instructions at least.</li>

            <li> I really liked this product.  </li>

            <li> So after that, I learned to make a pony tail first and it worked great and made a nice bun.  </li>
            <li> I do have VERY fine hair</li>
            <li> These are the best styling tool I ever had for my fine straight hair, I use it every morning after drying my hair.</li>

            <li> I was very cheap, stays in well</li>
            <li> it just seems cheap but it may be better for people who dont even know how to gather a pony tell something for a lil girl to use on a doll!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best hair bun maker around it is so easy to use just put your hair in a ponytail and use the bun maker it stays in all day and so comfortable.</li>
            <li> My daughter love it.</li>
            <li> if you have layered hair because the short ends would fall out and this works best on medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Literally takes about a min to give yourself a cute hair do.  </li>

            <li> I wish they made the product with hooks or something that holds it in place more.</li>

            <li> Love what this is supposed to do, but can&#x27;t make it work.</li>
            <li> Most hair thingy&#x27;s don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love this product I would buy it again and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought as many as I did , may be ok for hair that is not cut in layers .</li>
            <li> Needs more practice.</li>
            <li> Magic?</li>
            <li> I like the product and it would&#x27;ve been more helpful if the instructions are in detail.</li>
            <li> Magic Hair Bun Sponge Maker</li>
            <li> I might want to get couple more for backup.</li>
            <li> Look for better solutions.</li>
            <li> This my friend, is better then the donut shaped hair bun shaper in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is flimsy and won&#x27;t stay in place without many bobby pins and won&#x27;t hold shape.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I always wear my hair in a ponytail and thie magic sponge</li>
            <li> but my sister has and its pretty good and what not :)</li>
            <li> This one is very cheap and easy to use.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to use and very light.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li> , my bun stays perfectly intact all day long with this item.  </li>
            <li> holds my hair in many ways and very easy to use also easy to wash and keep clean will order more</li>
            <li> In the true, I&#x27;m already trying to use this! :-)</li>
            <li> I have very long hair as well, so it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li> It would help this product is it came with a more easily read piece of the directions as to how to use it.</li>
            <li> My hair refused to follow these directions at all, and no matter how many faces I made during the process, I couldn&#x27;t get the magic hair bun sponge maker to contort in such a way that it would hold all of my hair in and make a beautiful bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can do FAR more things with your hair, and get very nice looking buns, including braided.</li>
            <li> Seems like ot would be very cool...</li>
            <li> It came 2 weeks early and it works great.</li>
            <li> Works great on my 3 year old, held through her performances with hair spray and pins</li>
            <li> shipping was fast and the price is fair.</li>
            <li> and it really really looks good</li>
            <li> and it really really looks good</li>
            <li> But its really unnoticeable and on a good day</li>
            <li> My bestie loved it so much</li>
            <li> but it actually work really good!</li>
            <li> I tried it again to get a smaller one, but after that i couldn&#x27;t do another good bun!</li>
            <li> Takes longer than most items on Amazon to ship but worth it!</li>
            <li> but no biggie, it&#x27;s easy to work around</li>
            <li> makes buns easy but did not come with booklet and flower.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Definetly makes making buns easy</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to put on and stays their.</li>
            <li> Buy multiples as the foam does break easily.</li>
            <li> I think if I cut a few inches from my hair I&#x27;d be able to get the best use out of it.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t fall for this \\&quot;easy to use\\&quot; stuff ever again.  </li>
            <li> Its so easy to use</li>
            <li> i liked this product very much it works</li>
            <li> My cats apparently thought the material was a great chew toy</li>
            <li> This is super easy to use and comes in handy when you need to do your hair quickly or even for a night out.</li>
            <li> purchased a similar product from a trade show, worked beautifully ,</li>
            <li> that is FINE, and that just didn&#x27;t work with this...which is why I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> It is okay it just isn&#x27;t great for long hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> so she could do a super cute sleek bun for school.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and good quality hair pins</li>
            <li> and I love it so very much!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure If this would work or not, but it was super cheap, so I decided to try.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely perfect if you have kids and don&#x27;t want to have your little ones tug on your hair.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect fit but must be played with a little so that the product part does not show through,</li>
            <li> I just fold the ends in and they are not visible and my hair stays in place all day after I secure the bun with bobby pins.  </li>
            <li> this product is cheap and doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so light weight, you don&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it would have been great if there were hooks at the ends</li>
            <li> if you have light colored hair...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and would not hold in.</li>
            <li> This is made cheaply and will not work like the orginal Hairdini.  </li>
            <li> This takes some practice but it does work and was comfortable for my daughter to wear.</li>
            <li> It was cheap...</li>
            <li> and I love shopping on Amazon, so it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Cheap</li>
            <li> THIS SHOULD HAVE COST 25 CENTS, WITH FREE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> It was cheap</li>
            <li> But, not too upset since it was soo cheap.</li>
            <li> Although it looks cheap, I did not mind using it.</li>
            <li> Cheap does not even begin to describe it.</li>
            <li> I &#x27; ve used it several times and the bun looks great each time.</li>
            <li> But it is cheap</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> But other than that, it looks great. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was also cut off after the first use!!</li>
            <li> this hair piece is so very amazing and gives me an extra hair style</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful for hair up</li>
            <li> This product is very smart and super easy to use!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy updo.</li>
            <li> it was easy to order and came in quickly.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s a super nice item/idea and works VERY well on shorter hair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m pretty sure it works and stuff, i just don&#x27;t know how to put it on.</li>
            <li> I love these sponge maker,at first</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Better if I had fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> She loves wearing her hair in a bun and this helps her make a bun that looks clean.</li>
            <li> This is easy and fun to do.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try on dry hair, but it&#x27;s definitely great buy.</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t knock off a star for that because loose buns are really attractive.</li>
            <li> While it arrived far more quickly than estimated, my hopes and dreams for an elegant updo were dashed as soon as I opened the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If we used a large number of bobby pins, we might be able to make it stay in place, but it just flops.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing it right now too!</li>
            <li> It really works just as specified on the package--I just followed the cutely drawn instructions.  </li>
            <li> It really works just as specified on the package--I just followed the cutely drawn instructions.</li>
            <li> I also like that the item is affordable and package so i can get free shipping which is awesome one thing I wish they would put the how to use in different language especially English</li>
            <li> I tried using it and it came out with a good bun, but a very very big one.</li>
            <li> The product itself is not bad.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much and found it easy to use and mold.  </li>
            <li> right on the first try  :)</li>
            <li> Cannot get it to work right, than cannot secure</li>
            <li> and it make super cool buns</li>
            <li> They are super chaep but do take a while to get here</li>
            <li> This product gave me super powers.</li>
            <li> It shipped quick</li>
            <li> This product is a joke, the product is super flemsy &amp; is already about to break..</li>
            <li> , my hair rolls right around it without slipping, and it looks great.  </li>
            <li> it is made out of cheap material, snapped and broke when I first got it</li>
            <li> bun maker works OK, but the foam is very soft and I expect it will fray rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more like the hot buns, but there really isn&#x27;t anything to it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!  </li>
            <li> The other version [plastic with hooks at the end] worked spectacularly well!</li>
            <li> However, my best friend has very long non-layered blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much with this because of how cheap it cost.</li>
            <li> and it was just too much even for this huge thing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used yesterday and I liked, it looks like only my hair, we cannot see the stuff there.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would be a nice one for short hair!</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> and these are the only kind that work in my hair.</li>
            <li> but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> But useful</li>
            <li> NOT EVEN WORTH $4.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it for the price I paid</li>
            <li> and you can try different styles using it and develop your own technique.</li>
            <li> This is not even worth 1cent.</li>
            <li> There is no way I could ever make such a nice bun without this product because of the thiness of my hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell, but worth the money.</li>
            <li> Over all worth the buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy &amp; cheap &amp; it had also didn&#x27;t take very long for it to arrive to my house.</li>
            <li> This little thing has gone to conferences parties meetings very nice.</li>
            <li> Very user friendly.</li>
            <li> For the most part it looks and fits great however the only down fall to it</li>
            <li> But, it just falls right out</li>
            <li> I have it in right now</li>
            <li> One time I did it right</li>
            <li> Bought this and it shipped right when it was supposed to</li>
            <li> If you do buy these, you&#x27;ll just end up with two very large garbage bag ties...</li>
            <li> If I kind of \\&quot;fold\\&quot; my hair in half then start winding, I can MAYBE make a bun and have it stay put, but that&#x27;s a HUGE maybe.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and was a good price just worried about how long it will last before breaking.</li>
            <li> Seems easy to use but really is&#x27;nt, and the donut bun gives me better results for my long hair.</li>
            <li> I love that it is gentle on my long hair and so easy to work into any style I desire..</li>
            <li> its great.its only good for long hair and medium lenth.it does not work good on short hair.</li>
            <li> Great, I love this simple product, makes elegant updo or big messy bun.</li>
            <li> Thanks so very much!</li>
            <li> I took a chance and bought this since it didn&#x27;t cost very much</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth buying, just get the donut looking one, or use socks.</li>
            <li> Its exactly like the one I used to have.</li>
            <li> The foam tore away on the first use.  </li>
            <li> but i was willing to try because of the price to me</li>
            <li> it is exactly what I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> looks exactly like the item in the picture.</li>
            <li> i kind of expected it to be like the snap bracelets that wrap around your arm.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a bit scared at first because when I received it ,it did look on the cheapo side.</li>
            <li> The bun comes exactly as shown and it also comes with it&#x27;s step showing you how to do it.</li>
            <li> First one tore while twisting and</li>
            <li> Love it for my short hair..</li>
            <li> I bought the &amp;#34;hot buns&amp;#34; online first for 10x</li>
            <li> as much, what a waist of money!</li>
            <li> Overall I was well pleased with the process, the purchase, and the ease of the experience.</li>
            <li> I purchased the magic hair bun sponge maker when my hair wouldn&#x27;t go up in a proper bun after I had cut it.  </li>
            <li> i have one similar but its wayyyyy better.</li>
            <li> Love this, wish I would have ordered this way back.</li>
            <li> When I first got it..</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> exactly as pictured, held stronger than i thought it would.</li>
            <li> Either I have too much hair or something because I just couldn&#x27;t get this thing to work!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as shown in the pic.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering another and keeping that one for myself as I love to wear my hair in protective styles especially buns.</li>
            <li> This product would work good for a &#x27;messy&#x27; bun look but that&#x27;s not what I needed at all.</li>
            <li> All with no messy product or hot curling irons!!</li>
            <li> I have very long, very fine slippery hair and most gizmos designed to help put hair up in a bun or french pleat</li>
            <li> I have very long, very fine slippery hair and most gizmos designed to help put hair up in a bun or french pleat</li>
            <li> it works just fine to me , i like the little cute bun it makes.</li>
            <li> so maybe thats why this product was not mad particularly for my type of hair</li>
            <li> Its a great first step in helping us military women bun up our hair properly and neatly.[[ASIN</li>
            <li> She could use the black color and just get the bun right in place and perfect in just a few seconds.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this a 3 Star is because it works fine in my sisters hair, she has straight fine hair, I on the other hand have layered curls.</li>
            <li> I think it would work better on all one length hair, not layered and long like mine.</li>
            <li> I really love this bun maker, but I found out after the fact that my hair is just WAY tooooo long for it to work the way it should.</li>
            <li> My hair is waist-length and just too long to be able to wrap it all with the item and then still have room to fold ANY amount of it over to hold the hair in place.</li>
            <li> I would recommend and did recommend this to my friends with long hair who have tried to copy many of my hairstyles.</li>
            <li> This makes it so easy to put my hair in a french twist.  </li>
            <li> but It actually was really easy</li>
            <li> is, I kind of wish that it had some sort of hidden hook so that the bun sponge stays in place</li>
            <li> I have fine light blonde hair that is just barely shoulder length.</li>
            <li> There are videos on you tube to show you how to use it but for me it just wasn&#x27;t strong enough</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT EVEN STRONG ENOUGH TO GRAB ALL OF MY HAIR</li>
            <li> worked fine for my hair, which falls to about the middle of my chest.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used several times and is fine</li>
            <li> I remove it and my hair has perfect, messy fluffy curls.</li>
            <li> I am happy the cost was so low, as I threw it out as a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I would have spent it better if I&#x27;d just thrown it in the street and walked away.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> I really needed something like this since I&#x27;ve had my baby</li>
            <li> Either I have too much hair</li>
            <li> The foam holds up really well for all day weat.  </li>
            <li> As figured, my hair was too much for it to handle.</li>
            <li> I did not believe it would really work</li>
            <li> I did not believe it would really work</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really understand how it worked either until I tried it out.</li>
            <li> and it holds my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really make out the steps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap looking spongy fabric covering a bendable piece of metal with an opening in the middle...</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really show, but</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t hold the donut shape very well</li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t work out for me very well.</li>
            <li> and this really works to make a neat bun.  </li>
            <li> I really, really like this thing.</li>
            <li> For 54 cents I can&#x27;t really expect much, I guess.</li>
            <li> I really did try but it never would hold my hair in a bun.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for bobby pins or clips that much.  </li>
            <li> This device is both simple and comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t bend very well either</li>
            <li> it works for me and  makes workingwith curly haired  grandchild&#x27;s hair  much easier.</li>
            <li> but this item is a life saver ..and not only that is really cheap</li>
            <li> We go straight from school</li>
            <li> so there isn&#x27;t much time to spend fixing hair.</li>
            <li> It is very flimsy, I thought it would be sturdier.</li>
            <li> so it did not work very well for me.</li>
            <li> Seems to hold hair really well, even on my daughter when she is running around and playing.</li>
            <li> After trying so much the bun maker got so bent out of shape, so now it sits in the corner collecting dust.</li>
            <li> i like it so much.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tricky and it takes many tries sometimes to make it work.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Received fast, like the product.</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing that it promises.</li>
            <li> The price is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I searched tutorial for hair bun on youtube and made a really neat hair bun.</li>
            <li> This product helps me make a great looking bun with my straight thin hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is way to thick, would be good for thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve needed something easy to use to keep my long hair off my neck.  </li>
            <li> and I have a nice tight bun with no pins whatsoever!</li>
            <li> but I was so excited to open it</li>
            <li> In my opinion it works way better than those other products advertised on TV to make a hair bun, you know, the wrap, snap and go thingie?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly looking for new and improved ways to easily accomplish classic looks, and when I saw the &amp;#34;Magic Hair Bun Sponge Maker&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Thick hair, just get hot buns, they&#x27;re amazing.</li>
            <li> It works just fine, as long as I put a couple bobby pins in where the two ends connect when I wrap it around my hair.</li>
            <li> wow, pretty fool proof.  </li>
            <li> I remember getting similar items to this one at a craft fair when I was little and have been using them for some time.</li>
            <li> But I have learned to harness my new powers and my life is forever changed!</li>
            <li> and it was less then .50 and free shipping!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended seller.</li>
            <li> I would do a high ponytail then roll my ends off to the side roll it</li>
            <li> If you really want to look good, spend the extra money and get a quality bun maker - this one is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this please!!</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li> This is great for making supercute buns (don&#x27;t think wrong there :3)&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> i really like it so far</li>
            <li> It pretty much tells me that the reviewers simply did not know how to use this product.</li>
            <li> and I have really long hair and have tried many different ones.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to do it either.</li>
            <li> worked great on my hair, which is medium thickness and length, and on my roomates hair, which is extremely thick and very long.</li>
            <li> The bun won&#x27;t be as tight as if you were making one with wet hair and pulling it tight but for ballet practice it is quick and easy for the most part.</li>
            <li> well it come in handy on a bad hair day and thank you:)</li>
            <li> 50 years old and haven&#x27;t found a decent \\&quot;hair accessory\\&quot; yet.</li>
            <li> Okay so the item is weirdly shaped and only does good on really long hair if that.</li>
            <li> Steer clear!  </li>
            <li> Most likely I&#x27;ll buy another one but from a different source in the future.</li>
            <li> This may take some practice to get better, but I don&#x27;t think it is god as the curly q bobby pins I usually use.</li>
            <li> while i applaud the general IDEA of it, it wasn&#x27;t very well conceived.</li>
            <li> It is a MUST HAVE especially in the summertime when it is hot</li>
            <li> Just get the as seen on tv hot buns this product over a vey very short period of times becomes undone because nothing is holding it shut.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT WORK &amp; TORE APART SO EASILY!!!!!!! :(</li>
            <li> THE ONE I HAD IN THE PAST IS INFINITY TIMES BETTER THAN THIS WHICH LOOKS</li>
            <li> Anyway the thing first wasnt cut all the way through the middle</li>
            <li> I even jazz it up a bit by either pinning a flower next to my bun or putting a pretty scrunchie around it.</li>
            <li> I have some pretty long hair (past my bum), so I did find it&#x27;s easier to not get a loose feeling bun if I put my hair in to a ponytail first, but it&#x27;s not needed to get a nice bun.</li>
            <li> The idea of this was to save time by having a quick and easy way to pull my hair up and get it out of the way, but if I have to try and try then try some more and still maybe not make it happen, then that&#x27;s not saving any time at all and just creating a mess of tangled hair and a lot of needless stress.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days now and have found it easy to use</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days now and have found it easy to use, my...</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and its comes a little below the shoulder.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT get the ones that have that little hole in the bottom of them, those are cheap imitations.</li>
            <li> Otherwise this is fine for the price -  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have long hair, as my hair is long and this wasn&#x27;t large enough.</li>
            <li> but i had to do a little extra work with making sure everything was tucked in.</li>
            <li> Overall in excited to use it on dry hair soon.</li>
            <li> I DIDN&#x27;T SPEND 5 BUCKS ON THIS SPONGE THAT WILL CLEARLY DECLINE IN QUALITY</li>
            <li> I like what it did as far as making the bun</li>
            <li> I was so surprised</li>
            <li> I was so surprised</li>
            <li> but I really thought the bun it make would be a lot bigger</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter uses this every day.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair which reaches my butt.  </li>
            <li> she wants a different look.  </li>
            <li> its from somewhere far far away</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> The wire never bent completely around</li>
            <li> WAS SO CHEAP THAT THE THING WAS A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> THAT IS NEARLY UP TO MY ARMPITS.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WHEN YOU COMPLETE THE BUN IN THE POSITION DESIRED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with my old standby, the hair donut.</li>
            <li> She says it pulls on her hair and only uses it when we need a fast bun.</li>
            <li> but its just like my old old</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me so far.</li>
            <li> Gets old after a couple uses</li>
            <li> I would not waste your money on this one</li>
            <li> Personally, I say save your money, or spend your $$ and buy a Topsy tail (Real one, by</li>
            <li> It would probably work better with someone who has thick hair.</li>
            <li> this product was okay, but it didn&#x27;t really work in my hair, and the quality was poor because it broke after like 5 minutes &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> This stays in the hair  and is nice for someone who has thin hair and want to wear it up</li>
            <li> I expected my first attempt to be a failure, but my first &amp;#34;sock&amp;#34; bun actually came out cute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military and needed a product to make my bun as clean and neat as possible.</li>
            <li> Decent enough product.</li>
            <li> (my hair is mid length not thick)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a spongy tool that even with my long hair, I can&#x27;t get the very end covered when I have my hair in a bun.</li>
            <li> While it makes a bun as stated it doesn&#x27;t work with something that has very think hair because it is not long enough.</li>
            <li> It came without the rose photographed in the picture, but the device does work well to make a bun, I have extra long hair (past my waist)</li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;m not unhappy, but the inner wire is not particularly strong and will open up unless held and pinned very firmly - which can be something of a trick to do when doing your own hair.  </li>
            <li> this product works really well on long hair!</li>
            <li> I had one of these for years, then my dog decided it needed a new chew toy, and I have been looking for this for the last year!  </li>
            <li> and they ended up chewing a big portion off the end, and it didn&#x27;t work so well after that because while we could still roll the hair, the end didn&#x27;t allow for the extra hair to roll over the exposed part very well.</li>
            <li> It came with no instructions, which isnt a major problem because i already know how to use them</li>
            <li> It does not close the whole way on my hair and loose when I move.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At work it&#x27;s a little loose feeling after a lot of moving, so I&#x27;d recommend pinning it in place for extra security, but it&#x27;s fantastic otherwise!</li>
            <li> I think maybe a more expensive (higher quality) version of this product might work and perhaps work only on specific hair types.</li>
            <li> A classy look in an instant!</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter is currently enrolled in Ballet classes and this works wonders for her bun!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly it seems useless to me</li>
            <li> You might be able to get this hair bun to do what they have done in the picture if you had thin hair, but you can&#x27;t make a bun with it because the ends don&#x27;t come together.</li>
            <li> My hair is ling and thick and this is strong enough to hold it up.</li>
            <li> I recommend this over the other bun maker because this product is much easier to use and it is also softer</li>
            <li> Extremely hard to make an actual bun, the material is so cheap</li>
            <li> do&#x27;s as you can use it not only to create an entire bun but also a half bun just on top of your head, leaving the rest down.</li>
            <li> She is 3 years old and has hair to the middle of her back.</li>
            <li> I CAN MAKE A BUB OR GO A DIFFERENT WAY AND MAKE A FRENCH ROLL WITH NO TROUBLE.</li>
            <li> but I had to go buy pictures mainly, the product left loose buns</li>
            <li> The ones I bought a long time ago are getting old</li>
            <li> It worked well, so long as you could get the hair near the end and keep the hair from falling out as you are rolling it.</li>
            <li> This barely works for my daughter who has thin fine hair.  </li>
            <li> however my hair&#x27;s too long right now to use it properly-we&#x27;re talking halfway down my back.</li>
            <li> How can you really complain about something that costs less than fifty cents?</li>
            <li> It made it much easier than using the typical donut accessory.</li>
            <li> This problem was really no fault of the seller, although maybe it should be mentioned in the item description that it doesn&#x27;t work much at all with REALLY LONG hair.</li>
            <li> really long, really thick hair won&#x27;t fit it all neatly.</li>
            <li> The wire frame is easily bendable and with thin hair stays in place without the need for bobby pins.</li>
            <li> This is not for girls with super thick hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my little sister&#x27;s hair, which is pretty long</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, so I guess I expected something a little more heavy duty..</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re a bit of an airhead like me, get something a little but more simple, or something with instructions at least.</li>
            <li> so I can only use it when I straighten it or for half of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s for thin straight hair only but not a bad product.</li>
            <li> The outside of the flat envelope is in Chinese except for &#x27;your&#x27; address.</li>
            <li> By the time you pull the piece back a little layers are everywhere and if you have long layers you wind up with too much hair sticking out of the bottom.</li>
            <li> This product would be good of you had thin hair, but my wife had really thick, long hair</li>
            <li> Also, because my hair is long and kind of thick, it makes my buns really big, but i wouldn&#x27;t worry about that unless you have long or thick hair and don&#x27;t like big buns!</li>
            <li> I had figured when I bought it that it may not work for long hair, but I thought that I&#x27;d give it a try, especially since it was so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and I bought several of these.  </li>
            <li> THE ONE I HAD WERE TWO CLOTH SHEATHED METAL FLAT RODS ATTACHED TO ONE PIECE OF FELT CLOTH.  </li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> well is if you have extra long hair!</li>
            <li> This is very long and should be marketed only for people with shoulder length hair or longer.</li>
            <li> I think the sponge helps with soaking up extra moisture and adding moisture for dry</li>
            <li> It is a waste of my money, at least it was cheap too.</li>
            <li> The product arrived with the black foam bit completely torn on one side with the silver metal portion exposed and it doesn&#x27;t work on my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use, despite how easy it looks on the instructions.</li>
            <li> Probably because I have long thick hair, I had to put it up in ponytail first, then twist, and make a bun out of it.</li>
            <li> really bad product, doesnt make any sense, my own fault should have done the research on the company</li>
            <li> , then I&#x27;ll just buy another one!&lt;br /&gt;Another important note, I&#x27;ts difficult to cover all the bun maker where the extremities meet</li>
            <li> What I actually do is if Im going out at night I take a shower in the morning and put my hair up in it while its still wet.</li>
            <li> took a long time to receive.</li>
            <li> My hair will look like a bun; however, it simply does not have the strength to stay closed.</li>
            <li> I have really long long hair</li>
            <li> It also is not really flexible enough to make a bun.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this item was flimsy and would not hold the finished style.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if its taking long bc</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter we were looking for something like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s long.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected and iv bought similar ones.</li>
            <li> then I spent on the actual item.</li>
            <li> mine is layered and long</li>
            <li> I tried it on my friends long straigt hair.</li>
            <li> it just took too long to get it.</li>
            <li> my hair has gotten too long for it</li>
            <li> My hair must&#x27;ve been too long, because I could not get the item to stay in a circle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it didnt work for my hair because it was too long and when I tried to bend it, it wouldnt stay.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have long, layered hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is way too long to use this by itself</li>
            <li> Holds my thick hair up really well.</li>
            <li> It is very thin and light weight.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t know how long it will hold up!</li>
            <li> and this is NOT for long hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is what you call \\&quot;poker straight\\&quot; and has never held a curl with any product or amount of curling irons - with this tiny little sponge my curls last until I brush them out!!</li>
            <li> You are to feed your ponytail through this, do some twisty magic, make a weird face (according to the diagram), and voila - neato bun!</li>
            <li> The shipping on this product took a very long time (shipped from China).  </li>
            <li> Maybe very long.  </li>
            <li> If you ladies don&#x27;t have very long hair, you can give it a try.</li>
            <li> I think you need very long hair with NO LAYERS.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very long, but layered, and when I roll it up in this, the layers stick out everywhere.</li>
            <li> Then I keep it in all day and by the time night comes, my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long (1/2 way down my back) and I can put it all up in a bun</li>
            <li> The bun is kinda loose</li>
            <li> I tried it out and my bun is really loose.  </li>
            <li> but it was loose and would need to be reinforced with a hair tie or some hair pins.</li>
            <li> I ACTUALLY HAD TO DIVIDE MY HAIR IN HALF HORIZONTALLY JUST TO HAVE THE BOTTOM LOOSE</li>
            <li> I have long, thick and layered hair and have no trouble with sponge holding all of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Spend a few dollars and get the real one, which came with a small book, and the junior Topsy tail.).</li>
            <li> The shipping was during the expected time, but the expected date range is a very long time from when you order it.</li>
            <li> You are very limited with what you can do with this bun</li>
            <li> If there was one a little smaller than this</li>
            <li> It shows a little bit on the bottom where I just don&#x27;t have enough hair to cover it all up.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this product doesn&#x27;t seem to really do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> It simply takes a little practice, not much though.</li>
            <li> it is a little awkward, it dose work, when using it, it makes the bun look as if you have more hair in the bun than you do.</li>
            <li> I have long hair past my waist, and this device doesn&#x27;t hold up enough hair to do anything with.</li>
            <li> not really what i was expecting</li>
            <li> unfortunatly it doesnt stay closed all the way</li>
            <li> The foam splits in the center to allow the hair to go through.</li>
            <li> Total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> However the price was minimal</li>
            <li> The possible creations are a few.</li>
            <li> Ready/shipped fine/better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get it to stay closed</li>
            <li> Its not at all what i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Arrived without directions, so wife has absolutely no idea how to use it.</li>
            <li> Even though it doesn&#x27;t really work for my long,layered, thick, heavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants that french twisted bun in the picture!</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it, I use it, I might not be using it right, but no product issue.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other user but its not really work on mine .not</li>
            <li> I wrap sections of my hair in spirals around these then bend the end flaps down to hold it in place for loose curls</li>
            <li> i have long (chest length) and thick hair (all around the same length), this contraption does not hold it all up, let alone make a bun.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a difficult time with it on the first use.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no hook on the bun to attach it to the other end.</li>
            <li> It has these wings you see in the picture, these make it quite difficult to use, I had to cut them off and hot glue</li>
            <li> did&#x27;nt know how to roll my long hair in the sponge,just a few tricks and wollaw</li>
            <li> You are better off cutting off the tip of a sock, rolling it up into a doughnut and using that for a bun!</li>
            <li> got them in the mail the other day.</li>
            <li> easier to do it for other people.</li>
            <li> Not too tight and not too loose.</li>
            <li> I used one and went to work where i was active.</li>
            <li> This is not for long, thick hair.. or even just long hair I don&#x27;t think.</li>
            <li> It is pretty difficult to use and if you have thick hair I would recommend a different one</li>
            <li> I broke down after a few months and first tried on wet hair.it held up, but was difficult.</li>
            <li> This bun maker comes with little instructions but its so way to use , it&#x27;s really not needed .</li>
            <li> only negative thing that I could think of is that it did take a month, from when I ordered it, for it to get to me.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not really worth buying.</li>
            <li> I know that it&#x27;s quite inexpensive, but it&#x27;s still not worth buying.</li>
            <li> BUT I was still hoping I could get something that would last at least once.. that would work..</li>
            <li> its cheap,still not worth it.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if those with thick hair will have the same experience.</li>
            <li> I also have trouble spreading the hair over it because the hair is held in the center.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair, in fact quite the opposite.</li>
            <li> IT IS SIMILAR TO A THICK MEASURING TAPE THAT SNAPS SHUT</li>
            <li> I think it might work well for short, bra strap length hair that is not too thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> all the way Down</li>
            <li> but I find that since it&#x27;s black just like my hair</li>
            <li> WOULD GIVE THIS HALF A STAR</li>
            <li> My hair is long, almost to my waist, but I don&#x27;t have thick hair, so it doesn&#x27;t cover all the way to the ends.  </li>
            <li> but for long thick hair, DON&amp;#34;T. just...don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but I have extremely long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and it is thick...</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think It will work on long thick.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair with some layers and this is too flimsy to do anything with.  </li>
            <li> My hair is too thick and too long.</li>
            <li> and I can imagine it works well with any hair type unless you have extremely long thick hair</li>
            <li> Not for long and thick or layered hair.</li>
            <li> but you need thick or quite long hair to cover the sponge after wrapping.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on my thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> Doesnt hide the sponge or keeps it tight.  </li>
            <li> she was not able to use it, it is like for a little girl with not much hair or a doll.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only a small weak wire in the center and will not hold up.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair, and like the dozens of barrettes, banana clips,</li>
            <li> If your hair&#x27;s super long-good luck-you&#x27;ll need pins to anchor this bad boy in.</li>
            <li> i have really thick long hair and it will not, i repeat, WILL NOT hold up my hair in a bun for longer than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I was unfortunately disappointed, but for only $1.25, it doesn&#x27;t sting that much.</li>
            <li> It was hard to use, took too much time in the morning to put on, and didn&#x27;t look nearly as squared away as a sock bun does. :(</li>
            <li> It will take a little practice, but don&#x27;t give up.  </li>
            <li> It requires a little fixing at the end to cover any gaps but that is all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product I was expecting the form to be a little thicker</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t keep your hair  tight either this is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> But it still works I have a little trouble spreading my hair to cover it though...</li>
            <li> This apparatus is covered (in the shape you see advertised) with thin foam rubber, which is also guaranteed to effectuate the &amp;#34;ruin-nation&amp;#34; of any type of human hair.</li>
            <li> The quality is not what I have expected, but I have thick hair and it kept my hair up.</li>
            <li> This is with out a doubt the biggest piece of junk that I have ever wasted $0.46 on in my life.</li>
            <li> is just a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars, because I have slightly thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t cover all of the product.</li>
            <li> and I have been using it almost everyday</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT TWO, JUST A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this</li>
            <li> I always have trouble doing the bun</li>
            <li> I suggest using a pin or two to hold it up if you have heavy hair.</li>
            <li> I think this product is easier than the one that is round like a donut.  </li>
            <li> Did not fit well.</li>
            <li> so im not upset i wasted a $1.</li>
            <li> Overall, not a great product, don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> this may work for slightly thinner hair (not to mention some patience to deal with it!)</li>
            <li> Sponge is so thin and metal inside so hard you can barely maneuver it.</li>
            <li> The inside is made of a very thin apparatus about the length and width of a popsicle stick, and the edges are too sharp for any type of human hair.</li>
            <li> I have long very thick hair</li>
            <li> This hair bun maker was very hard to use with very long hair.  </li>
            <li> It does what it says but my thin though long hair will not hold it in.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have thick hair, it&#x27;s not worth considering.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I get for having thick hair &amp;#62;.&amp;#60; It would come down.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold very tight and it slips out after maybe 5 mins.</li>
            <li> Useless piece of foam not strong enough to hold any hair.</li>
            <li> but any just past the shoulder and not super thick it should work.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE HARD TO USE</li>
            <li> they say these are &amp;#34;large&amp;#34;, but they are kinda small....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this like a beast this past weekend since getting it, &amp; have had no issues.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure what to do with it since i will NOT do with my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is just past my shoulders</li>
            <li> unless... I can fashion one of my kitty&#x27;s tails into a slick bun... and maybe, just maybe, when I&#x27;m 90, it&#x27;ll work on my thinner-in-the-future hair.</li>
            <li> This works just as well if not better</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was soo small</li>
            <li> It is NOT like the Hardinis I bought in the past.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m going to keep playing with it to see if I can get past my &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> even not sure about that but its just a trash ..</li>
            <li> The wire is VERY thin and surely won&#x27;t last, and the sponge-type covering is already peeling off.  </li>
            <li> but seriously, dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I make a high ponytail, slide it in the bun maker, slide the bun towards the end of my hair, and start rolling it  up tightly towards the base of my ponytail, then I bring the sides together under  my ponytail.</li>
            <li> it very stiff.</li>
            <li> but it was little weak</li>
            <li> but I intend to use the little sucker until it turns to shreds!</li>
            <li> We got this for a kiddo who has long, thick hair, and it&#x27;s basically useless to her.  </li>
            <li> its impossible ot actually make a bun don&#x27;t waste ur itme or money</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my longer hair complicates the wrapping process so that I have exposed ends or a less than firm hold.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time figuring out how to use the item.</li>
            <li> but if i&#x27;m not wearing my extensions its hard to cover the spongey clip.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with instructions and it was hard to put on</li>
            <li> It is hard to finish the bun because the ends where there is no flexible aluminum wire always come undone.</li>
            <li> was that it was hard to close because there is no way to attach the ends.</li>
            <li> hard for me to pin in</li>
            <li> I just have a hard time doing it for myself.</li>
            <li> Hard to put on, would not recommend product</li>
            <li> and the instructions are so hard to read</li>
            <li> Very poor quality,took a very long time to receive and it smell&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I got this and have no clue how it works so confusing came with no instructions</li>
            <li> and I gave  them to the people as their late chrismas gifts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to look online and see if I can find some directions, but after waiting 6 saturdays for this to arrive, it should have at least came with directions.</li>
            <li> one time at least.</li>
            <li> Her hair is really thick and it still works well</li>
            <li> The shipping was slow and when it did arrive, there were no instructions.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really thick</li>
            <li> but it is thick hair</li>
            <li> If your hair is too thick, it might not work for you. .</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I have about shoulder length really thick hair</li>
            <li> I like this product, I mean for 57 cents you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> Too small to roll my hair!</li>
            <li> Not good 4 thick hair</li>
            <li> This item is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous product.  </li>
            <li> not good quality, i did not know it would not hold up my hair well</li>
            <li> The images make it look like it&#x27;ll stay in your hair but even if you have thick, thin or whatever hair it just won&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> I have short and thin hair, this is a bad idea to to buy if u got my hair.</li>
            <li> Too weak</li>
            <li> This product SUCKS!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be very hard to use</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and medium length.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is too thin but this just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy about this product at all.  </li>
            <li> poor quality.</li>
            <li> (ad nauseum)that went before it, it&#x27;s just another thing to hold thin hair, and will have to be discarded/recycled...</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if it works for thin haired people.  </li>
            <li> POOR QUALITY</li>
            <li> POOR DESIGN</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S THAT POOR IN QUALITY.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S RIDGED AND INFLEXIBLE</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I don&#x27;t recommend it for people with thick hair, which I have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have troed to follow the instruction but still not happy with the results.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not impressed with how it works maybe our hair is to thick</li>
            <li> poorly maded.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, so this is hard for me.  </li>
            <li> I am a complete moron when it comes to doing my hair, but this was a snap!</li>
            <li> let alone hold up my hair even though I followed the vague picture directions.</li>
            <li> I could be using it wrong</li>
            <li> USELESS</li>
            <li> unfortunately I ordered this on</li>
            <li> guess I should have been skeptical of a hair product sold by CellularFactory, but I decided to throw caution to the wind and give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is the worst possible</li>
            <li> Maybe I was using it wrong</li>
            <li> but it didnt do any thing it smells weird.. and its just a piece of trash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult concealing it, but some practice, it&#x27;s becomes easier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I was wrong but</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the item!</li>
            <li> but iit is very thin</li>
            <li> No more bad hair day!</li>
            <li> My hair is too thin to get the effect I wanted &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting the edges of the sponge of in the process of opening it.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I have no clue on how to!</li>
            <li> Maybe it;s just because I started doing sock buns, but I found this product to be very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and annoyed with this product.</li>
            <li> I eat all bad buns</li>
            <li> Grrrr</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked that Amazon would sell something like this..</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I ordered two of these for stocking stuffers for each of my sisters -- they never showed.  :(</li>
            <li> I was ver disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> This is so complicated to use I don&#x27;t recommend it!!</li>
            <li> you could always see the stupid spongy ends sticking out.</li>
            <li> omg that&#x27;s so stupid ..</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest piece of crap I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> This item is a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t hate it either.</li>

            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I got this, I was very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is TERRIBLE!!! it does not do what it claims at all!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth buying, just get the donut looking one, or use socks.</li>
            <li> I thought this was well constructed like a former product released back in the 80&#x27;s by the name of Houdini.  Not even close. The inside is made of a very thin apparatus about the length and width of a popsicle stick, and the edges are too sharp for any type of human hair. This apparatus is covered (in the shape you see advertised) with thin foam rubber, which is also guaranteed to effectuate the &amp;#34;ruin-nation&amp;#34; of any type of human hair. Made in and shipped from China with no return label or receipt. The outside of the flat envelope is in Chinese except for &#x27;your&#x27; address. The envelope should be bulky. (I&#x27;m just trying to demonstrate to you how flimsy these things are.) Buyer beware -- please DO NOT PURCHASE! If you do buy these, you&#x27;ll just end up with two very large garbage bag ties...</li>
            <li> I had a hard time figuring out how to use the item. It didin&#x27;t quite work on my hair, maybe my sister can use it.</li>
            <li> I like what it did as far as making the bun but it was little weak considering I only paid 1$ for who cares but I found another one that was the same price that was sturdy.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She want to change hair style sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is good for changing hair style. My daughter love it.</li>
            <li> Its exactly like the one I used to have. I lost it years ago and I haven&#x27;t found another until I found this one. It works great and its a good price too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used yesterday and I liked, it looks like only my hair, we cannot see the stuff there. In the true, I&#x27;m already trying to use this! :-)</li>
            <li> i have long (chest length) and thick hair (all around the same length), this contraption does not hold it all up, let alone make a bun.</li>
            <li> I wrap sections of my hair in spirals around these then bend the end flaps down to hold it in place for loose curls</li>
            <li> The shipping on this product took a very long time (shipped from China).  The foam tore away on the first use.  I would not recommend it again.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very fine slippery hair and most gizmos designed to help put hair up in a bun or french pleat just won&#x27;t work on my hair.  I was very pleased with this Magic hair bun maker, however.  It really works just as specified on the package--I just followed the cutely drawn instructions.  I have been using it for a few days now and have found it easy to use, my hair rolls right around it without slipping, and it looks great.  Only stipulation is that you may need a hairpin or two to anchor it, or it sags a bit.  Not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> The product itself is not bad. However, when I open the package, it&#x27;s all scratched up. Looks like somebody used a knife. Most likely I&#x27;ll buy another one but from a different source in the future.</li>
            <li> Does not stay in hair well. Instructions suck like Hoover.</li>
            <li> I was having doubts when I ordered this, because it was so cheap, but upon receiving this in the mail and trying it out, this just made the best bun I ever did in my life! The bun is kinda loose but I won&#x27;t knock off a star for that because loose buns are really attractive. It wouldn&#x27;t work for you if you have layered hair because the short ends would fall out and this works best on medium length hair. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly. I made beautiful bun for my daughter.</li>
            <li> So flexible,  could not use it even one time! Maybe it would be a nice one for short hair!</li>
            <li> The wire is so flimsy it won&#x27;t stay in place unless you pin yourself to death.  At that point, you might as well not even bother with the bun maker at all because the pins push through the foam and tear it apart.  It&#x27;s not going to last any time at all.  It takes forever to ship, too.  You get what you pay for!  If you really want to look good, spend the extra money and get a quality bun maker - this one is a complete waste of money.  I would have spent it better if I&#x27;d just thrown it in the street and walked away.</li>
            <li> Honestly it seems useless to me but i was willing to try because of the price to me it just seems cheap but it may be better for people who dont even know how to gather a pony tell something for a lil girl to use on a doll!</li>
            <li> The quality is not what I have expected, but I have thick hair and it kept my hair up. It did the job.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very fine slippery hair and most gizmos designed to help put hair up in a bun or french pleat just won&#x27;t work on my hair. I was very pleased with this Magic hair bun maker, however. It really works just as specified on the package--I just followed the cutely drawn instructions.

            <li> they say these are &amp;#34;large&amp;#34;, but they are kinda small....not really what i was expecting but I think they will work. took a while to get here, but they got here today.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military and needed a product to make my bun as clean and neat as possible.This product would work good for a &#x27;messy&#x27; bun look but that&#x27;s not what I needed at all. It was hard to use, took too much time in the morning to put on, and didn&#x27;t look nearly as squared away as a sock bun does. :(</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!  It will take a little practice, but don&#x27;t give up.  It really works.  Great buy.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it I don&#x27;t know how to use it and it needs a clip -.- don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> This one is very cheap and easy to use. I used it before I went to nursing labs and clinicals.</li>
            <li> We got this for a kiddo who has long, thick hair, and it&#x27;s basically useless to her.  If we used a large number of bobby pins, we might be able to make it stay in place, but it just flops.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these before-they work perfectly-however my hair&#x27;s too long right now to use it properly-we&#x27;re talking halfway down my back. If your hair&#x27;s super long-good luck-you&#x27;ll need pins to anchor this bad boy in.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this product doesn&#x27;t seem to really do the trick for me. There are videos on you tube to show you how to use it but for me it just wasn&#x27;t strong enough</li>
            <li> When I got this, I was very disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t make a bun for me and it didn&#x27;t come with directions.  When I finally thought to get back on Amazon and look at it again, the directions were on the Amazon site.  So after that, I learned to make a pony tail first and it worked great and made a nice bun.  My hair is long, almost to my waist, but I don&#x27;t have thick hair, so it doesn&#x27;t cover all the way to the ends.  I just fold the ends in and they are not visible and my hair stays in place all day after I secure the bun with bobby pins.  I use this often and will order another one.</li>
            <li> So awesome! Literally takes about a min to give yourself a cute hair do.  I really needed something like this since I&#x27;ve had my baby I have lived in a ponytail but this is much better and so easy! I wish the two ends would connect somehow but no biggie, it&#x27;s easy to work around and it was less then .50 and free shipping! Ill try that French twist next :)</li>
            <li> This little thing has gone to conferences parties meetings very nice. I like the hair bun sponge maker thank you !</li>
            <li> Have layers? Forget about it. This works well for someone who doesn&#x27;t have any layers at all.</li>
            <li> for an item that what so inexpensive it is exactly what I thought it would be.  I tried it out and my bun is really loose.  I wear my hair in a bun a lot.  This may take some practice to get better, but I don&#x27;t think it is god as the curly q bobby pins I usually use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this like a beast this past weekend since getting it, &amp; have had no issues. At work it&#x27;s a little loose feeling after a lot of moving, so I&#x27;d recommend pinning it in place for extra security, but it&#x27;s fantastic otherwise! I have some pretty long hair (past my bum), so I did find it&#x27;s easier to not get a loose feeling bun if I put my hair in to a ponytail first, but it&#x27;s not needed to get a nice bun.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that I could use to do my own hair into a bun.  I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to work with this product.  Either I have too much hair or you need someone else to do it.</li>
            <li> I love this and it make super cool buns but if i&#x27;m not wearing my extensions its hard to cover the spongey clip. I love this product and would recommend it to anyone with shoulder length hair!</li>
            <li> They are easy to work with, They do not pull hair and most of all my daughters love them too!!</li>
            <li> After recieving this item I was baffled by some of its reviews. It pretty much tells me that the reviewers simply did not know how to use this product. I remember getting similar items to this one at a craft fair when I was little and have been using them for some time. The ones I bought a long time ago are getting old so I went in search of news ones. These ones are different material. I would prefer them to be cloth but the foam works just as good. It simply takes a little practice, not much though. I can keep my hair in this from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep and it never falls out. They keep your hair in place no matter what you&#x27;re doing. I always excercise and hike as well. I love these and it doesnt ruin your hair or make kinks in it like a rubber band or tie would. What I actually do is if Im going out at night I take a shower in the morning and put my hair up in it while its still wet. Then I keep it in all day and by the time night comes, my hair is dry. I remove it and my hair has perfect, messy fluffy curls. I love doing that; it makes a very awesome hairdo. All in all, would prefer fabric but I still love this product!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and is very easy to use. The foam holds up really well for all day weat.  shipping was fast and the price is fair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, so I guess I expected something a little more heavy duty..a good product for finer hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is very easy to use and you can make very elegant styles with it. I absolutly love it!</li>
            <li> I had figured when I bought it that it may not work for long hair, but I thought that I&#x27;d give it a try, especially since it was so inexpensive. As figured, my hair was too much for it to handle. If you hair goes to your mid-back or longer, I&#x27;d look elsewhere for a bun sponge.</li>
            <li> My niece works with an airline and she had purchased the hair bun. It is an excellent tool for her hair, however, she is always stopped at the X-Ray machines in airports because of the metal built in it. It would be great if they could manufacture it without metal,perhaps some kind of rubber to hold the hair. It is a nightmare in airports. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in part because the ad stated it ships from the US.  It came from Hong Kong.&lt;br /&gt;The bun maker works OK, but the foam is very soft and I expect it will fray rather quickly.</li>
            <li> This is with out a doubt the biggest piece of junk that I have ever wasted $0.46 on in my life.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long (1/2 way down my back) and I can put it all up in a bun is just a few seconds.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make a very good bun.  Doesnt hide the sponge or keeps it tight.  But it is great for creating beautiful curls or waves.  I think the sponge helps with soaking up extra moisture and adding moisture for dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After yoga class it alwayd looks great.  Do i think a litttle bit of moisure helps</li>
            <li> I did not believe it would really work but it did I was so surprised and it really really looks good I did not believe it would really work but it did I was so surprised and it really really looks good</li>
            <li> This Iteam is greate I really like it but I really thought the bun it make would be a lot bigger</li>
            <li> This is great for making supercute buns (don&#x27;t think wrong there :3)&lt;br /&gt;but the material feels like it&#x27;s gonna break. It didn&#x27;t break yet though.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I need so many bobby pins to keep it into place!! Grrrr</li>
            <li> Nice product but i don&#x27;t know how long it will hold up! Maybe very long.  It works great! I was surprised how good it works!! and i tried because of the priceI Would recommend!! and going to get more for family and friends!!!</li>
            <li> looks exactly like the item in the picture. unfortunatly it doesnt stay closed all the way when im doing my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars, because I have slightly thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t cover all of the product. If you have thicker hair this will work for you.</li>
            <li> makes buns easy but did not come with booklet and flower. I bought two, one needs to be cut in the middle in order to use.</li>
            <li> These are very cheap to buy and seem to work according to my wife. They are super chaep but do take a while to get here are they were shipped from China, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I hate it. It puts knots in my hair! AND MY HAIR NEVER KNOTS!!! EVER. this product is cheap and doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much with this because of how cheap it cost. I gave it a try anyways. I didn&#x27;t really understand how it worked either until I tried it out. It&#x27;s just a piece of cheap foam covering a thin metal stick. The foam splits in the center to allow the hair to go through. After I rolled it up I just bent it into a circle and it holds my hair very well. Not too tight and not too loose. Because it&#x27;s so light weight, you don&#x27;t feel it. It is absolutely perfect if you have kids and don&#x27;t want to have your little ones tug on your hair. I can go outside on a windy day and don&#x27;t have to worry about it. I do have VERY fine hair so I don&#x27;t know if those with thick hair will have the same experience. I have very long hair as well, so it&#x27;s perfect for me. I am ordering a bunch more! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing that I could think of is that it did take a month, from when I ordered it, for it to get to me. I almost forgot all about it.</li>
            <li> How can you really complain about something that costs less than fifty cents? It works. I didn&#x27;t have a difficult time with it on the first use. I expected my first attempt to be a failure, but my first &amp;#34;sock&amp;#34; bun actually came out cute. After one use however, the foam already has a tear in it. Then again, maybe it was there before I used it and I just didn&#x27;t notice it. Regardless, for the cost, I would probably buy another one.</li>
            <li> Worth the price&lt;br /&gt;Definetly makes making buns easy&lt;br /&gt;Will prob buy one for my sis and mom too&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and easy!!</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter uses this every day. She loves wearing her hair in a bun and this helps her make a bun that looks clean. Her hair is really thick and it still works well jist wish it was a bit bigger so she could close it without using bobby pins</li>
            <li> while i applaud the general IDEA of it, it wasn&#x27;t very well conceived. it&#x27;s rather flimsy but you get what you paid for. i&#x27;m not sure what to do with it since i will NOT do with my hair.  i read some of the reviews before buying and thought i&#x27;d give it a shot. nope. not doing it for me. i have really thick long hair and it will not, i repeat, WILL NOT hold up my hair in a bun for longer than a few minutes. this may work for slightly thinner hair (not to mention some patience to deal with it!) but for long thick hair, DON&amp;#34;T. just...don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> it is just foamy material around wires. i kind of expected it to be like the snap bracelets that wrap around your arm. But you have to bend the wire around and bobby pin it to try and stay. After that it does look good in</li>
            <li> But after about 4 uses it&#x27;s bent out of shape unusable.  Son&#x27;t buy if you have really long, really thick hair won&#x27;t fit it all neatly. Also gonna clog landfills with this.</li>
            <li> took a long time to receive. I also like that the item is affordable and package so i can get free shipping which is awesome one thing I wish they would put the how to use in different language especially English</li>
            <li> It does not work. It doesn&#x27;t stay in place. There&#x27;s no hook on the bun to attach it to the other end. It also doesn&#x27;t work for people who has layers in their hair</li>
            <li> This product gave me super powers. As soon as I pit it in my hair I became Bun Woman! I eat all bad buns then I dedicate this product! I am both amazed and scared. But I have learned to harness my new powers and my life is forever changed! Don&#x27;t forget though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With great power comes great responsibility&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am BUN WOMAN!</li>
            <li> It came without the rose photographed in the picture, but the device does work well to make a bun, I have extra long hair (past my waist) and these are the only kind that work in my hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair dos with this item and I love it.  Very easy to use and makes very elegant hair styles.</li>
            <li> i still don&#x27;t know how to use it. if you&#x27;re a bit of an airhead like me, get something a little but more simple, or something with instructions at least. i&#x27;m pretty sure it works and stuff, i just don&#x27;t know how to put it on. it just makes no sense.</li>
            <li> never can figure out how to use this product. i have silky hair - doesnt work will with it ...</li>
            <li> This showed up with no directions and never having owned one before I had no idea what to do with it. Seems like perhaps it would behoove them to include the sheet that&#x27;s shown online, which is so faded I can&#x27;t really make out the steps. I wanted to love it. Oh well...</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just not for me but my friend took it and she just love it uses that all of time Great prize fast shipping no complaints... Thank you</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t hold my hair. I couldn&#x27;t use it :(</li>
            <li> This works better than most and I have really long hair and have tried many different ones.  I like that my hair is curly after I take it out too.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Just got it and I have been using it almost everyday, Took me a couple of trials to figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy. I have to admit I was a bit scared at first because when I received it ,it did look on the cheapo side. It&#x27;s a cheap looking spongy fabric covering a bendable piece of metal with an opening in the middle...but it actually work really good! I make a high ponytail, slide it in the bun maker, slide the bun towards the end of my hair, and start rolling it  up tightly towards the base of my ponytail, then I bring the sides together under  my ponytail. My only wish is that it would have been great if there were hooks at the ends so no hair could escape. Then I slide some hair around to cover the bun maker and I&#x27;m done. Quick and easy updo. All I have to do is fix my bangs and tadaaaa!!! No more bad hair day! And it holds all day without touchup!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think is going to last for years but I intend to use the little sucker until it turns to shreds!, then I&#x27;ll just buy another one!&lt;br /&gt;Another important note, I&#x27;ts difficult to cover all the bun maker where the extremities meet but I find that since it&#x27;s black just like my hair it doesn&#x27;t really show, but if you have light colored hair...I dunno</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold your hair. The images make it look like it&#x27;ll stay in your hair but even if you have thick, thin or whatever hair it just won&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with instructions and it was hard to put on it doesn&#x27;t keep your hair  tight either this is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> it is a little awkward, it dose work, when using it, it makes the bun look as if you have more hair in the bun than you do.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and was a good price just worried about how long it will last before breaking. This helps you make a bun in no time it was easy to order and came in quickly.</li>
            <li> It has these wings you see in the picture, these make it quite difficult to use, I had to cut them off and hot glue the padding shut, but after that they worked well</li>
            <li> I love the way it holds my hair in a ponytail.  Did not like that it didn&#x27;t come with instructions.</li>
            <li> It does what it says but my thin though long hair will not hold it in. I have to use hair pins to hold it in. I also have trouble spreading the hair over it because the hair is held in the center.</li>
            <li> Bought bun maker for a friend.  It was very easy for her to use and she got the bun right on the first try  :)</li>
            <li> In theory  this would work great but I have extremely long, thick hair. My hair will look like a bun; however, it simply does not have the strength to stay closed.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  I love putting my hair up in a bun for work and this is the fastest and easiest way to do it.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this a 3 Star is because it works fine in my sisters hair, she has straight fine hair, I on the other hand have layered curls. My sister loves it and wears it all the time.</li>
            <li> really bad product, doesnt make any sense, my own fault should have done the research on the company but it doesnt even work</li>
            <li> worked well liked it alot</li>
            <li> This didnt work at all</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all. Total waste of my money. You get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I was happy to receive my bun maker, but I was a bit elated when I saw the quality of the product. I tried using it and it came out with a good bun, but a very very big one. I tried it again to get a smaller one, but after that i couldn&#x27;t do another good bun! It is hard to finish the bun because the ends where there is no flexible aluminum wire always come undone. I wish they made the product with hooks or something that holds it in place more. The shipping was during the expected time, but the expected date range is a very long time from when you order it. Overall, not a great product, don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Dont even do it</li>
            <li> This product broke attempting to use it just once.  I would not recommend this to anyone, keep looking for a better product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this handy at all. I tried repeatedly to achieve what that picture shows, never happened.  If anything it added extra weight which made my hair slide downward.  Nope, hated it.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is too thin but this just doesn&#x27;t work. And it doesn&#x27;t hold the donut shape very well</li>
            <li> it should be a great help for ladies. I have pretty long hair which reaches my butt.  So it doesn&#x27;t work out for me very well. If you ladies don&#x27;t have very long hair, you can give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have really long long hair and this is NOT for long hair! Med size length maybe, MAYBE! So I use it on my daughters hair. Perfect for her. She is 3 years old and has hair to the middle of her back.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I mean for 57 cents you cannot beat the price. Mine did not have any chemical smells to it whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.  The shipping was slow and when it did arrive, there were no instructions.  However the price was minimal so sometimes you get what you pay for.  However, my daughter loves it!  She figured out how to use it and wears it anytime she wants a different look.  At 11 she is constantly changing clothes and hairstyles and this product gives her options for her hair.  She would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, so this is hard for me.  I would recommend it for people with LOTS of hair!</li>
            <li> The bun comes exactly as shown and it also comes with it&#x27;s step showing you how to do it. It&#x27;s not hard to do it either.</li>
            <li> Nope never going to buy it .</li>
            <li> just a wad of hair in a net doesnt help a bit in make a bun or twist save your money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy about this product at all.  Feels gross and it came with no instructions. I have no idea how to twist my hair up.</li>
            <li> This is very long and should be marketed only for people with shoulder length hair or longer. It also is not really flexible enough to make a bun.</li>
            <li> i liee it its very easily to put in since i aave thickband layered hair becuase tee dounuts ones my hair had some fly aways i love this way better buyy  IT</li>
            <li> This works for mine and my nieces hair. It is the perfect fit but must be played with a little so that the product part does not show through,</li>
            <li> It did not work as the picture described. I could not get it to stay shut let alone hold up my hair even though I followed the vague picture directions. It&#x27;s flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and would not hold in. hair. First one tore while twisting and second one just wont hold. I guess for the price I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember if this arrived on time or not but I was so excited to open it I ended up cutting the edges of the sponge of in the process of opening it. Opps! But it still works I have a little trouble spreading my hair to cover it though...</li>
            <li> This does not work at all, and all you get it the sponge thing not the hair clip shown as well.</li>
            <li> I liked it but I have curly hair so I can only use it when I straighten it or for half of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s for thin straight hair only but not a bad product.</li>
            <li> This is easy and fun to do. Holds my thick hair up really well. Would order again some more from here.</li>
            <li> I love these sponge maker,at first did&#x27;nt know how to roll my long hair in the sponge,just a few tricks and wollaw my hair buns are perfect with these sponges,thanks magic hair!!</li>
            <li> Too lose to make the hair stay. would not buy again. It doesnt hold my hair up at all. Too weak</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this item was flimsy and would not hold the finished style. Not for anyone with hair below shoulder length.</li>
            <li> i never got my product... how can i say more?? i don&#x27;t know if its taking long bc its from somewhere far far away...... but i never got it :(((((((</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best nor the strongest I&#x27;ve used. The material was FLIMSY and tore thru sponge after one use.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.  I could have taken a sponge from the store and did the very same thing this did.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I could be using it wrong but I have plenty of hair and you could always see the stupid spongy ends sticking out. You are better off cutting off the tip of a sock, rolling it up into a doughnut and using that for a bun!</li>
            <li> I wasnt really impressed with this particullary product and i&#x27;ve used ones like this before. It is to rigid in spots where it should be flexible and vise versa. This is not for girls with super thick hair.</li>
            <li> This product would be good of you had thin hair, but my wife had really thick, long hair and it just wouldn&#x27;t hold her hair up.</li>
            <li> wow, pretty fool proof.  this makes the perfect bun. My hair is just past my shoulders and this really works to make a neat bun.  It requires a little fixing at the end to cover any gaps but that is all. great product!</li>
            <li> Useless piece of foam not strong enough to hold any hair. It is a waste of my money, at least it was cheap too.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of sponge with no structure to it what-so-ever.  There is nothing there to hold it in your hair, or make it take a shape.  Nothing.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 versions of this item and I just couldn&#x27;t make this one work properly. The wire never bent completely around and I couldn&#x27;t make it stay in my hair. The other version [plastic with hooks at the end] worked spectacularly well! I finally just gave this one to a friend because I knew I would never make it work. I haven&#x27;t seen it in her hair yet either. LOL</li>
            <li> poor quality. Form separates from metal inside form. But, I got it so inexpensively it was not a big deal.</li>
            <li> This sponge bun maker is great! It holds great and stays put until you want it taken out! Love it for my short hair.. Helps keep the hair away from the face! Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> it works just fine to me , i like the little cute bun it makes. thank you guys for everything .</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick so I wasn&#x27;t really able to use it, but it is as described...Decent enough product.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and I bought several of these.  It is a MUST HAVE especially in the summertime when it is hot and you want to put your hair up.  Easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> This is made cheaply and will not work like the orginal Hairdini.  There&#x27;s only a small weak wire in the center and will not hold up.</li>
            <li> This cheaply made \\&quot;good idea\\&quot; is just that... a good idea and nothing more.  I have very long thick hair, and like the dozens of barrettes, banana clips, (ad nauseum)that went before it, it&#x27;s just another thing to hold thin hair, and will have to be discarded/recycled... unless... I can fashion one of my kitty&#x27;s tails into a slick bun... and maybe, just maybe, when I&#x27;m 90, it&#x27;ll work on my thinner-in-the-future hair. Hmpff.  50 years old and haven&#x27;t found a decent \\&quot;hair accessory\\&quot; yet. Sigh. Back in a braid it goes...</li>
            <li> Too small to roll my hair!</li>
            <li> I love these and will be ordering more. Best way to curl your hair!! And it looks great up as well.... Very happy</li>
            <li> I orederd this bun maker and it came 8 days earlier but when i opend the package it was just stiting there . wasnts covered up. it had no directions amd it it very stiff. great for the price though just needes better packaging.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this thing. It&#x27;s very useful for hair up do&#x27;s as you can use it not only to create an entire bun but also a half bun just on top of your head, leaving the rest down. The possible creations are a few. Love it.</li>
            <li> I Love these more and more every day- and i use them every day, very easy and does not pull my hair! I keep them handy every where, also good to have on hand in the car, keeps my hair out if my eyes when driving.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed by it. But, it was for my Mother and she says she liked it. For 54 cents I can&#x27;t really expect much, I guess.</li>
            <li> I recommend this over the other bun maker because this product is much easier to use and it is also softer</li>
            <li> I bought the &amp;#34;hot buns&amp;#34; online first for 10x as much, what a waist of money! This works just as well if not better bc it holds tighter! I feel its even easier than &amp;#34;hot buns&amp;#34; to use too!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me. I really did try but it never would hold my hair in a bun. It&#x27;s made well I guess it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> omg that&#x27;s so stupid ..it doesnt do anything</li>
            <li> My hair is too thin to get the effect I wanted &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Got this and it didnt work. Im so upset.</li>
            <li> This hair bun maker was very hard to use with very long hair.  But it is manageable, just takes time and patience. It will be perfect for shorter length hair. Mine is almost to my waist.</li>
            <li> I bought Magic Hair Bun Sponge Maker my wife and satisfied. It is very soft and good quality hair pins</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter we were looking for something like this for a long time. There was a time many years ago where you were able to find these things anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;It was soo small she was not able to use it, it is like for a little girl with not much hair or a doll.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing a YouTube guru mention this. I broke down after a few months and first tried on wet hair.it held up, but was difficult. I have yet to try on dry hair, but it&#x27;s definitely great buy. I tried the sock bun, but my hair just didn&#x27;t work with it especially with layers and it&#x27;s long. Overall in excited to use it on dry hair soon.</li>
            <li> It worked well, so long as you could get the hair near the end and keep the hair from falling out as you are rolling it. We only got to use it the one time. My cats apparently thought the material was a great chew toy and they ended up chewing a big portion off the end, and it didn&#x27;t work so well after that because while we could still roll the hair, the end didn&#x27;t allow for the extra hair to roll over the exposed part very well. This takes some practice but it does work and was comfortable for my daughter to wear. The bun won&#x27;t be as tight as if you were making one with wet hair and pulling it tight but for ballet practice it is quick and easy for the most part.</li>
            <li> This is super easy to use and comes in handy when you need to do your hair quickly or even for a night out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve needed something easy to use to keep my long hair off my neck.  I don&#x27;t care for bobby pins or clips that much.  This device is both simple and comfortable to wear.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it, I use it, I might not be using it right, but no product issue. Works well enough for me.</li>
            <li> The product arrived before it was supposed to but it had no instructions. It is pretty difficult to use and if you have thick hair I would recommend a different one</li>
            <li> Ready/shipped fine/better quality than I expected. Overall I was well pleased with the process, the purchase, and the ease of the experience.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product I was expecting the form to be a little thicker and it didn&#x27;t bend very well either</li>
            <li> This would not hold in my hair even if I had used superglue and spackle! It is the biggest piece of crap I have ever bought on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Very user friendly.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and it is thick...but it is thick hair that is FINE, and that just didn&#x27;t work with this...which is why I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars.  It would probably work better with someone who has thick hair.</li>
            <li> Just get the as seen on tv hot buns this product over a vey very short period of times becomes undone because nothing is holding it shut.  I have very thick hair so I don&#x27;t know if it works for thin haired people.  Thick hair, just get hot buns, they&#x27;re amazing.</li>
            <li> These are the best styling tool I ever had for my fine straight hair, I use it every morning after drying my hair. Roll it into the bun and then after a couple hours I can take it out and have the most wonderful curls I have ever seen! All with no messy product or hot curling irons!! My hair is what you call \\&quot;poker straight\\&quot; and has never held a curl with any product or amount of curling irons - with this tiny little sponge my curls last until I brush them out!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A HAIRDINI AND THE MATERIALS ARE FLOPPY AND DONT WORK THE WAY I NEED THEM TOO.  USELESS I BOUGHT TWO, JUST A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> Does not work properly</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I saw this! Seems like ot would be very cool...unfortunately I ordered this on dec.17th nd I still havent revieved it nd its now jan.15!! No tracking onfo nd havent heard anything from the seller.</li>
            <li> I got this and have no clue how it works so confusing came with no instructions and I don&#x27;t think It will work on long thick. Hair. (Ps. Got it stuck in my hair)</li>
            <li> This product is very smart and super easy to use! I also found that if I left it in my hair for a day and then slept on it, or even just a day or night, it gave me beautiful, bouncy curls, and I didn&#x27;t have to do anything with a curling iron! I love that element but the one thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it was hard to close because there is no way to attach the ends. But you could always buy a snap clip from somewhere and glue it on, and then that would fix it. Also, because my hair is long and kind of thick, it makes my buns really big, but i wouldn&#x27;t worry about that unless you have long or thick hair and don&#x27;t like big buns!</li>
            <li> Seems easy to use but really is&#x27;nt, and the donut bun gives me better results for my long hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this</li>
            <li> This does not produce a bun as shown.  It doesn&#x27;t hold its shape.</li>
            <li> takes a wile to get to you but it is well worth it. and always makes my buts look great</li>
            <li> Wow! it works for me and  makes workingwith curly haired  grandchild&#x27;s hair  much easier. Thanks for a great prodct!</li>
            <li> Good for the price, just what my daughter wanted and the pic is what your getting. Came in good time and no damage.</li>
            <li> I love this item! It came 2 weeks early and it works great. I would recommend it to everyone. It&#x27;s really easy to put on and stays their.</li>
            <li> Do the work. It is also adjustable. If your hair is too thick, it might not work for you. .</li>
            <li> NEVER BUY!!!! WAS SO CHEAP THAT THE THING WAS A WASTE OF MONEY. IT DOES NOT WORK &amp; TORE APART SO EASILY!!!!!!! :(</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like it shows the hair doesn&#x27;t slide so its impossible ot actually make a bun don&#x27;t waste ur itme or money</li>
            <li> Did not work at all!  I cannot get this thing to work!  I think you need very long hair with NO LAYERS.  My hair is very long, but layered, and when I roll it up in this, the layers stick out everywhere. It simply won&#x27;t work.  If you have layered hair, DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;m not unhappy, but the inner wire is not particularly strong and will open up unless held and pinned very firmly - which can be something of a trick to do when doing your own hair.  Sarah Potempa Wrap Up is better (but 20x the price.)</li>
            <li> This product came with instructions but I had to go buy pictures mainly, the product left loose buns i have curly nappy hair so maybe thats why this product was not mad particularly for my type of hair</li>
            <li> It would Nice to have some instructions. I would love to use it but unfortunately I have no clue on how to!</li>
            <li> I have no idea how to use this product!  It didn&#x27;t come with any instructions and I tried to &amp;#34;wing&amp;#34; it but I can&#x27;t get it to stay closed so my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out.  Horrible product, don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
            <li> The description seems very interesting so I decided to try.  When I got the sponge maker, I cannot make it worked at all.  I ended up returning it...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use it....</li>
            <li> I have long hair past my waist, and this device doesn&#x27;t hold up enough hair to do anything with. I am happy the cost was so low, as I threw it out as a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t work out for my hair. I don&#x27;t have thick hair, in fact quite the opposite. But, it just falls right out and I cannot get it to stay clasped together. I think I&#x27;ll stick with the Hairagami for now on.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and doesn&#x27;t work well.  It would probably be easier to use if I understood the Chinese directions. I knew it was coming from China when I ordered it though...</li>
            <li> Works great! I bought this for my daughter so she could do a super cute sleek bun for school. It&#x27;s soo easy to use and it matches her hair color perfectly!</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to use this thing.  It shipped quick and hopefully I have the patience to play with it and learn how to use it properly.  It was cheap...and I love shopping on Amazon, so it was worth it.</li>
            <li> in the vegas heat this is a great way to keep you cool</li>
            <li> Cheap yes. But useful No. I have short and thin hair, this is a bad idea to to buy if u got my hair.</li>
            <li> POOR QUALITY IT&#x27;S NOT EVEN FABRIC AS IN THE PHOTO! IT&#x27;S RINKY DINKY CHEAP SPONGE! POOR DESIGN IT&#x27;S NOT EVEN FLEXIBLE ENOUGH FOR ME TO PUT MY HAIR THROUGH IT AND I LOST MOST OF MY HAIR BEFORE USING THIS PRODUCT. IT DOES NOT CLOSE PROPERLY. I ACTUALLY HAD TO DIVIDE MY HAIR IN HALF HORIZONTALLY JUST TO HAVE THE BOTTOM LOOSE AND THE TOP WITH THE \\&quot;MAGIC\\&quot; SPONGE, WHICH LOOKED NICE BUT IT IS VISIBLE AT THE BOTTOM. I GOT THIS TO GIVE THE ILLUSION OF MORE HAIR AND I HAD TO DIVIDE IT WHICH IS NOT WHAT I WANTED TO DO. IT&#x27;S NOT EVEN STRONG ENOUGH TO GRAB ALL OF MY HAIR THAT IS NEARLY UP TO MY ARMPITS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD GIVE THIS HALF A STAR IF I COULD. THANK GOODNESS I DIDN&#x27;T SPEND 5 BUCKS ON THIS SPONGE THAT WILL CLEARLY DECLINE IN QUALITY THE MORE IT IS USED, IT LOOKS LIKE PIECES OF IT WILL BREAK OFF EVENTUALLY. IT&#x27;S THAT POOR IN QUALITY. IT&#x27;S RIDGED AND INFLEXIBLE, I HAD TO FORCE IT OPEN; AND WHEN I DO IT FREEZES IN THE POSITION UNTIL I TAKE IT OFF AND BEND IT BACK. THIS SHOULD HAVE COST 25 CENTS, WITH FREE SHIPPING. IT&#x27;S THAT CHEAP LOOKING! NOT EVEN WORTH $4. I COULD HAVE BOUGHT A MEAL OUTSIDE WITH THAT MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH MY GOSH, THE ONE I HAD IN THE PAST IS INFINITY TIMES BETTER THAN THIS WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT CAME FROM A CEREAL BOX PRIZE. THE ONE I HAD WERE TWO CLOTH SHEATHED METAL FLAT RODS ATTACHED TO ONE PIECE OF FELT CLOTH.  YOU PUT YOUR HAIR IN BETWEEN THE TWO. ONE ROD ON TOP AND ONE ON BOTTOM TO EVENLY DISTRIBUTE IT. IT IS SIMILAR TO A THICK MEASURING TAPE THAT SNAPS SHUT WHEN YOU COMPLETE THE BUN IN THE POSITION DESIRED. IF I COULD ONLY REMEMBER THE NAME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT NOW I HAVE TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE...(MUTTERS)</li>
            <li> Not what I expected and iv bought similar ones.</li>
            <li> Need to practice. Kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for years, then my dog decided it needed a new chew toy, and I have been looking for this for the last year!  Perfect way to do a quick elegant updo!</li>
            <li> I purchased the magic hair bun sponge maker when my hair wouldn&#x27;t go up in a proper bun after I had cut it.  I have fine hair and its comes a little below the shoulder.  The bun does an ok job on my hair.  It would be better if you had longer or a bit thicker hair.  If there was one a little smaller than this it would have been  perfect for me.  It shows a little bit on the bottom where I just don&#x27;t have enough hair to cover it all up.  But its really unnoticeable and on a good day can&#x27;t see it at all.  Its a great first step in helping us military women bun up our hair properly and neatly.[[ASIN:B004WDV2XA Magic Hair Bun Sponge Maker]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly looking for new and improved ways to easily accomplish classic looks, and when I saw the &amp;#34;Magic Hair Bun Sponge Maker&amp;#34; I thought I may have truly found an awesome new product to play with. While it arrived far more quickly than estimated, my hopes and dreams for an elegant updo were dashed as soon as I opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is basically a coat hanger-sized gauge of wire wrapped in foam. You are to feed your ponytail through this, do some twisty magic, make a weird face (according to the diagram), and voila - neato bun! My hair refused to follow these directions at all, and no matter how many faces I made during the process, I couldn&#x27;t get the magic hair bun sponge maker to contort in such a way that it would hold all of my hair in and make a beautiful bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should have been skeptical of a hair product sold by CellularFactory, but I decided to throw caution to the wind and give it a try. I was unfortunately disappointed, but for only $1.25, it doesn&#x27;t sting that much. I&#x27;ll stick with my old standby, the hair donut.</li>
            <li> Had to give it one star because it wouldn&#x27;t accept none. This is the worst possible s*** you could buy on amazon. I don&#x27;t know what was running through my mind when I bought this</li>
            <li> Crappy.  Doesn&#x27;t stay together when you try to close the bun</li>
            <li> This product is a joke, the product is super flemsy &amp; is already about to break.. It didn&#x27;t even come with directions!!!</li>
            <li> trying to figure this one out</li>
            <li> Just okay. Better if I had fine straight hair. Buy multiples as the foam does break easily.</li>
            <li> This makes it so easy to put my hair in a french twist.  My husband puts it in for me and that is saying something.</li>
            <li> Best bun maker ..I love it .. I always have trouble doing the bun but this item is a life saver ..and not only that is really cheap</li>
            <li> Maybe it;s just because I started doing sock buns, but I found this product to be very difficult to use. My hair is very thick and medium length. I think the only way you could make this work well is if you have extra long hair!</li>
            <li> I got this hoping it would help with buns for dance.  She says it pulls on her hair and only uses it when we need a fast bun.</li>
            <li> Its okay but iit is very thin I feel if I could break it when I turn it to do my bun but its just like my old old but it was worth it for the price I paid</li>
            <li> How am I supposed to translate the insturctions and ideas if they&#x27;re witten in chineese?????  I can&#x27;t even follow the picture instructions because they&#x27;re so tiny!!  Horrible!!</li>
            <li> this hair piece is so very amazing and gives me an extra hair style and I love it so very much!</li>
            <li> I Searched for &amp;#34;Hardini&amp;#34;, and it brought this product up.  It is NOT like the Hardinis I bought in the past.  The wire is VERY thin and surely won&#x27;t last, and the sponge-type covering is already peeling off.  Plus, it took a month to arrive!</li>
            <li> This item is ridiculous. Does not make a bun as it shows in the picture. I tried to return it and I was asked to ship it Hong Kong... it would cost more to ship it then I spent on the actual item. She did offer me a discount so that was definitely better than nothing but seriously, dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use on my hair</li>
            <li> I never even received it.  I ordered two of these for stocking stuffers for each of my sisters -- they never showed.  :(</li>
            <li> this is best on all one length hair. mine is layered and long so it did okay, but i had to do a little extra work with making sure everything was tucked in. would be nice to have a hook or something on the end to hold it together after you roll it.</li>
            <li> shows instruction, none came. packed so when I cut the packaging to open I cut the product and now cant gift it</li>
            <li> I have 2 dancers. We have to have hair in a bun EVERY WEEK. We go straight from school so there isn&#x27;t much time to spend fixing hair. These are so simple... Pony tail... Slip it on... Slide it to end... Roll... Bend... Spread hair out... Done.  INSTANT ballerina bun.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and bought this since it didn&#x27;t cost very much and I wanted something to make a good hair bun. It is very flimsy, I thought it would be sturdier. I have thick curly hair so it did not work very well for me. I tried it on my friends long straigt hair. It made a cute bun but it was loose and would need to be reinforced with a hair tie or some hair pins. Not really worth buying.</li>
            <li> Overall using this bun maker is easier than a sock or sponge bun but unfortunately I don&#x27;t recommend it for people with thick hair, which I have. It&#x27;d be perfect for someone with medium length, smooth, thinish hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be very hard to use but It actually was really easy and I love the results</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other user but its not really work on mine .not impressed.never used again after tried on</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair in place. That&#x27;s what I get for having thick hair &amp;#62;.&amp;#60; It would come down. This magic bun maker is made out of foam. I thought I would break it.There&#x27;s some metal inside but the metal can get worn out. It made my bun look too big o.o&lt;br /&gt;There wasn&#x27;t any instructions that came with the product. It was cheap so I give it credit for that. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this though, so I&#x27;ll give it to my friend, perhaps.</li>
            <li> Magic Hair Bun Sponge Maker ,Magic Hair Bun Sponge Maker ,Magic Hair Bun SpongMagic Hair Bun Sponge Makere Maker ,</li>
            <li> there are many how to&#x27;s &amp; tutorials on YouTube for the people saying they can&#x27;t figure out how to use it</li>
            <li> Great, I love this simple product, makes elegant updo or big messy bun. Very easy to use. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Okay so the item is weirdly shaped and only does good on really long hair if that. I guess you  get it for the price!</li>
            <li> I think it would work better on all one length hair, not layered and long like mine. It could be improved by having something on the end to hold it together after you roll it.</li>
            <li> Works just like it is advertised. Seems to hold hair really well, even on my daughter when she is running around and playing.</li>
            <li> I know that it&#x27;s quite inexpensive, but it&#x27;s still not worth buying. The product arrived with the black foam bit completely torn on one side with the silver metal portion exposed and it doesn&#x27;t work on my hair at all. I think maybe a more expensive (higher quality) version of this product might work and perhaps work only on specific hair types. I have long thick hair with some layers and this is too flimsy to do anything with.  But, not too upset since it was soo cheap.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much and found it easy to use and mold.  Unfortunately, my longer hair complicates the wrapping process so that I have exposed ends or a less than firm hold.  I think if I cut a few inches from my hair I&#x27;d be able to get the best use out of it.  But I&#x27;m going to keep playing with it to see if I can get past my &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; hair problem.  I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants that french twisted bun in the picture!</li>
            <li> Make a sock bun with ease! Love this tool. Whip up you hair in seconds with just a couple of bobby pins. Takes longer than most items on Amazon to ship but worth it!</li>
            <li> This product SUCKS! it is made out of cheap material, snapped and broke when I first got it (my hair is mid length not thick)</li>
            <li> product is great and I gave  them to the people as their late chrismas gifts.  It was not the product...it just took too long to get it.</li>
            <li> Although it looks cheap, I did not mind using it. I will not appear under my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But, it did not function well. It does not close the whole way on my hair and loose when I move.&lt;br /&gt;It was also cut off after the first use!!</li>
            <li> I tried it on my little sister&#x27;s hair, which is pretty long but it did not work. After trying so much the bun maker got so bent out of shape, so now it sits in the corner collecting dust. Well I only paid .69 cents for it, so what can I expect?</li>
            <li> It would help this product is it came with a more easily read piece of the directions as to how to use it.</li>
            <li> Just got it in the mail today! For the most part it looks and fits great however the only down fall to it is, I kind of wish that it had some sort of hidden hook so that the bun sponge stays in place and you don&#x27;t have to keep adjusting it. But other than that, it looks great. :)</li>
            <li> i liked this product very much it works well it come in handy on a bad hair day and thank you:)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure If this would work or not, but it was super cheap, so I decided to try.  It works GREAT!  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was using it wrong but I couldn&#x27;t get it to do a nice neat bun. It did make a bun of some sort it just wasn&#x27;t presentable</li>
            <li> Its not at all what i expected it to be. It came with no instructions, which isnt a major problem because i already know how to use them i have one similar but its wayyyyy better. Anyway the thing first wasnt cut all the way through the middle so i had to cut/pull it and then the stuff on the outside ripped off so i couldnt use it. And if you have short hair its not gunna work for you btw</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so simple to use. i like it so much. if you want to have a stylish hair like me hurry up.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me so far. I thought it would be more like the hot buns, but there really isn&#x27;t anything to it.</li>
            <li> my hair has gotten too long for it but any just past the shoulder and not super thick it should work.</li>
            <li> Love this, wish I would have ordered this way back. My hair is ling and thick and this is strong enough to hold it up.</li>
            <li> While it makes a bun as stated it doesn&#x27;t work with something that has very think hair because it is not long enough.</li>
            <li> That is what I call this...I love that it is gentle on my long hair and so easy to work into any style I desire..Highly recommend..</li>
            <li> This is so complicated to use I don&#x27;t recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest piece of crap I have ever purchased. I should have saved my money and known it was too good to be true. It fell apart within seconds. It doesn&#x27;t even begin to hold up any of my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how to use this. My hair, when I do succeed in doing something with the sponge maker, looks nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> It was great! It made it much easier than using the typical donut accessory. It also was very cheap, which is also a plus!</li>
            <li> When I first got it.. I didn&#x27;t know what to do with it. Was I suppose to take the middle apart? It&#x27;s a good product. Gets old after a couple uses</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use, and yields great results. It only takes seconds to do a perfect looking bun. I love it!</li>
            <li> Ridiculous product.  Doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Threw it away.  Wouldn&#x27;t order it if I were you.  This is a product that shouldn&#x27;t be ordered online</li>
            <li> My wife  loves it. Said that it works and does what it said it would. She saids she wished it had a clip so you can tie it and not have to u use bobby pins. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is unusable, it is to short and will not roll smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a similar product from a trade show, worked beautifully , I was ver disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Do not buy. This product is not even usable. Cheap does not even begin to describe it. It arrived and was immediately thrown in the trash.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced. product is as described. I&#x27;m having a problem figuring out how to use. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s me not the product. If you are good with hair gadgets, buy it.</li>
            <li> very cheap quality item... and just a piece of trash, i tried alot to make a bun by following their procedure which is in the picture but it didnt do any thing it smells weird.. and its just a piece of trash. buyers beware .. i have medium-long hair length but it didt work for me .. i dont know about the longest lenght of hair if u have hair like below your waist then it might work . even not sure about that but its just a trash ..</li>
            <li> I found this item to be so perfect that I reordered and will likely order again. I LOVE this thing! My entire experience was absolutely perfect! Thanks so very much!</li>
            <li> this product was okay, but it didn&#x27;t really work in my hair, and the quality was poor because it broke after like 5 minutes &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best hair bun maker around it is so easy to use just put your hair in a ponytail and use the bun maker it stays in all day and so comfortable. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to put in any way and you can try different styles using it and develop your own technique.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described. Very easy to use, even for beginners. I suggest using a pin or two to hold it up if you have heavy hair.</li>
            <li> I still havnt figured out how to use it.....but my sister has and its pretty good and what not :)</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to do anything in my hair. I love the idea, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay.</li>
            <li> Good tool for making beautiful hair styles. The quality is not the best but for the price, another one can be bought.</li>
            <li> This item is a piece of crap. It broke within 2 days of using it and it was so confusing to use!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> exactly as pictured, held stronger than i thought it would. worked fine for my hair, which falls to about the middle of my chest. worked great on my hair, which is medium thickness and length, and on my roomates hair, which is extremely thick and very long.</li>
            <li> Fell apart after using it twice! I&#x27;m very disappointed and annoyed with this product. I will not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really love this bun maker, but I found out after the fact that my hair is just WAY tooooo long for it to work the way it should. My hair is waist-length and just too long to be able to wrap it all with the item and then still have room to fold ANY amount of it over to hold the hair in place. If I kind of \\&quot;fold\\&quot; my hair in half then start winding, I can MAYBE make a bun and have it stay put, but that&#x27;s a HUGE maybe. It&#x27;s tricky and it takes many tries sometimes to make it work. The idea of this was to save time by having a quick and easy way to pull my hair up and get it out of the way, but if I have to try and try then try some more and still maybe not make it happen, then that&#x27;s not saving any time at all and just creating a mess of tangled hair and a lot of needless stress. Anyway, it&#x27;s a super nice item/idea and works VERY well on shorter hair. It will be put to good use by my daughter and granddaughter too I&#x27;m sure. This problem was really no fault of the seller, although maybe it should be mentioned in the item description that it doesn&#x27;t work much at all with REALLY LONG hair. Thanks so much. Highly recommended seller.</li>
            <li> My hair must&#x27;ve been too long, because I could not get the item to stay in a circle. There&#x27;s no hook on the end to keep it together, so it&#x27;s just a floppy almost-doughnut on the head.</li>
            <li> this product works really well on long hair! I&#x27;m wearing it right now too! It&#x27;s very easy &amp; cheap &amp; it had also didn&#x27;t take very long for it to arrive to my house.</li>
            <li> This works well. It&#x27;s a bit difficult concealing it, but some practice, it&#x27;s becomes easier. I love how my hair curls at the ends when I take it out:)</li>
            <li> This thing is good, just need something to keep it together when folded. but I&#x27;ve used several times and is fine</li>
            <li> Threw it away, I couldn&#x27;t wrap my hair with this to save my life.</li>
            <li> Not good 4 thick hair</li>
            <li> A LITTLE HARD TO USE BUT I LIKE IT</li>
            <li> A classy look in an instant! Fantastic|!</li>
            <li> Either I have too much hair or something because I just couldn&#x27;t get this thing to work! I would do a high ponytail then roll my ends off to the side roll it all the way Down and it would just fall back! So I couldn&#x27;t do it I don&#x27;t know if I was wrong but whatever.</li>
            <li> This product is the easiest way I have found to get a perfect bun.  I only wish I would have found this sooner as I was a ballet dance for about 20 years and this would have made putting my hair into a bun a snap!  I have long, thick and layered hair and have no trouble with sponge holding all of my hair.  I also love that I dont need to use a thousand bobby pins to hold it together, my bun stays perfectly intact all day long with this item.  I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive this product was for how well it does what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work in my hair. My hair is too thick and too long.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. I don&#x27;t LOVE this product but I don&#x27;t hate it either. It works just fine, as long as I put a couple bobby pins in where the two ends connect when I wrap it around my hair. I have about shoulder length really thick hair and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine light blonde hair that is just barely shoulder length. I am a complete moron when it comes to doing my hair, but this was a snap! In my opinion it works way better than those other products advertised on TV to make a hair bun, you know, the wrap, snap and go thingie? I have it in right now and I have a nice tight bun with no pins whatsoever! I even jazz it up a bit by either pinning a flower next to my bun or putting a pretty scrunchie around it. There are tons of videos on youtube on how to use this product if you can&#x27;t get the pictorial instructions.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew how to use this product.</li>
            <li> i really like it so far its great.its only good for long hair and medium lenth.it does not work good on short hair.</li>
            <li> This is not even worth 1cent. As soon as I opened it ,it broke I did not even get to use it. I would not waste your money on this one</li>
            <li> I have long very thick hair and it was just too much even for this huge thing.  Won&#x27;t fall for this \\&quot;easy to use\\&quot; stuff ever again.  I&#x27;ll stick to hair pins.</li>
            <li> Arrived without directions, so wife has absolutely no idea how to use it. I&#x27;m going to look online and see if I can find some directions, but after waiting 6 saturdays for this to arrive, it should have at least came with directions.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use, despite how easy it looks on the instructions. Only use? To tie the trash bag and to throw it out.</li>
            <li> This product was ruined the the night I got it. The product fell apart and didn&#x27;t even keep by hair up.</li>
            <li> i like how this makes my bun, no extra hair is looming around trying to come out of the bun</li>
            <li> This bun maker comes with little instructions but its so way to use , it&#x27;s really not needed . I &#x27; ve used it several times and the bun looks great each time.</li>
            <li> Love what this is supposed to do, but can&#x27;t make it work. Wish there would have been directions. So sad.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work well, maybe for longer hair but didn&#x27;t work on mine. I threw it away and won&#x27;t buy items like this anymore before handling it.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THAT I CAN MAKE A BUB OR GO A DIFFERENT WAY AND MAKE A FRENCH ROLL WITH NO TROUBLE.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.  Even though it doesn&#x27;t really work for my long,layered, thick, heavy hair.  Most hair thingy&#x27;s don&#x27;t. I will need to get my &#x27;summer haircut&#x27; which equates to shorter hair for me, and hopefully it&#x27;ll work then!  I think this product is easier than the one that is round like a donut.  There are YT videos for this product if you need to see how it works.</li>
            <li> got them in the mail the other day. I just tossed them into my trash. Way too flimsy, cannot hold my hair at all.</li>
            <li> hard for me to pin in</li>
            <li> Dumbest thing I ever bought</li>
            <li> This product helps me make a great looking bun with my straight thin hair. When I wear this at work everyone calls me ballerina because it really makes the perfect ballerina bun.There is no way I could ever make such a nice bun without this product because of the thiness of my hair. Its so easy to use and I can imagine it works well with any hair type unless you have extremely long thick hair the bun would probably be gigantic. Love this product I would buy it again and recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works well. I used one and went to work where i was active. At the end of the night, my hair was still in place and the bun maker hadn&#x27;t budged. I would recommend and did recommend this to my friends with long hair who have tried to copy many of my hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Unless you have waist length hair forget using this.... it is too big and bulky for people with shorter hair.Good concept though.</li>
            <li> The hole in the middle necessary to use this item was still sealed and I had to figure out how to cut it myself which was a pain. Otherwise this is fine for the price -  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have long hair, as my hair is long and this wasn&#x27;t large enough.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get my hair to stay up in it. Have tried several times to follow the instructions that came. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for my hair</li>
            <li> This stays in the hair  and is nice for someone who has thin hair and want to wear it up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as shown in the pic. Though I am not used to it. The quality is not the best but it alright.</li>
            <li> It is okay it just isn&#x27;t great for long hair. It doesn&#x27;t hold very tight and it slips out after maybe 5 mins.</li>
            <li> Not for long and thick or layered hair. By the time you pull the piece back a little layers are everywhere and if you have long layers you wind up with too much hair sticking out of the bottom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea but you need thick or quite long hair to cover the sponge after wrapping. Takes some practice to get the hang of it. It&#x27;s a great value too because you get more than one to practice with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get how to use this. Maybe it is me but the bun doesn&#x27;t clip together at the end.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t hold my hair. I know, I know--my dad repeated it to me THROUGHOUT my childhood--you get what you pay for...BUT I was still hoping I could get something that would last at least once.. that would work..like.. one time at least. This is not for long, thick hair.. or even just long hair I don&#x27;t think. I think it might work well for short, bra strap length hair that is not too thick. if it is--it might not hold. Idk---maybe its made in Asian countries because its made with Asian hair in mind. Their hair seems to be nice and fine, and I think that hair would work best in these hair doo dad ;)</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought as many as I did , may be ok for hair that is not cut in layers .</li>
            <li> My hair is way to thick, would be good for thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it didnt work for my hair because it was too long and when I tried to bend it, it wouldnt stay. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I just have a hard time doing it for myself. Needs more practice. One time I did it right but it ends up lose. easier to do it for other people.</li>
            <li> I was very cheap, stays in well and I have no problems with it. If you are blonde, you might want to get the lighter one it might show through.</li>
            <li> Works great on my 3 year old, held through her performances with hair spray and pins</li>
            <li> Received fast, like the product. But it has an odor, must be the sponge material that smells like oil. Don&#x27;t like the smell, but worth the money.</li>
            <li> Cannot get it to work right, than cannot secure</li>
            <li> Did not fit well. Hard to put on, would not recommend product</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have thick hair, it&#x27;s not worth considering.  Otherwise, it seems like a great product.  It&#x27;s just not for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, layered hair. I found that I had pat my hair into place every time I rolled the bun. It ended up taking about 10-15 minutes, but looked great afterwards. However, my best friend has very long non-layered blonde hair. She could use the black color and just get the bun right in place and perfect in just a few seconds.</li>
            <li> You might be able to get this hair bun to do what they have done in the picture if you had thin hair, but you can&#x27;t make a bun with it because the ends don&#x27;t come together.</li>
            <li> I have troed to follow the instruction but still not happy with the results. Price was good so im not upset i wasted a $1.</li>
            <li> holds my hair in many ways and very easy to use also easy to wash and keep clean will order more</li>
            <li> Bought this and it shipped right when it was supposed to but I&#x27;m not impressed with how it works maybe our hair is to thick</li>
            <li> This item is piece of trash. Steer clear!  Does absolutely nothing that it promises. Sponge is so thin and metal inside so hard you can barely maneuver it. Magic? Make it disappear.</li>
            <li> I never used this before.. Thought of trying this.. It&#x27;s really good.. I liked it&lt;br /&gt;Did various hairstyle in it</li>
            <li> Extremely hard to make an actual bun, the material is so cheap and I can&#x27;t make it correctly and the instructions are so hard to read</li>
            <li> I like the product and it would&#x27;ve been more helpful if the instructions are in detail. Over all worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on my thick, long hair. I would definitely reccomend this to any one who wanted to but it.</li>
            <li> Magic Hair Bun Sponge Maker, it&#x27;s easy to use and very light. I might want to get couple more for backup.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me. You tube did not help.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this please!! It does not hold any of the hair in. Or stay in place at all. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I didnt like this at all.&lt;br /&gt;Very poorly maded. and it ended up making your hair look like crap&lt;br /&gt;I just ended up throwing it away.&lt;br /&gt;even tho its cheap,still not worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it. It&#x27;s a spongy tool that even with my long hair, I can&#x27;t get the very end covered when I have my hair in a bun. Personally, I say save your money, or spend your $$ and buy a Topsy tail (Real one, by I believe it is Conair now, used to be Scrunchie. DO NOT get the ones that have that little hole in the bottom of them, those are cheap imitations. Spend a few dollars and get the real one, which came with a small book, and the junior Topsy tail.). You can do FAR more things with your hair, and get very nice looking buns, including braided. You are very limited with what you can do with this bun maker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. Look for better solutions.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter is currently enrolled in Ballet classes and this works wonders for her bun!!!!!! It&#x27;s super easy to put in even she can do it herself!!!!! Shipping was a breeze because it actually showed up wayyyyyy before the shipping date. I plan on ordering another and keeping that one for myself as I love to wear my hair in protective styles especially buns. Thanks for such a great product!!!!!!!! Buy this people!!! You won&#x27;t regret it :D</li>
            <li> This my friend, is better then the donut shaped hair bun shaper in my opinion. It was WAY easier for me to do this. Probably because I have long thick hair, I had to put it up in ponytail first, then twist, and make a bun out of it. My bestie loved it so much I let her keep it. But it is cheap so it won&#x27;t last long. The ends fell eventually (like after a couple of months). You can probably put superglue to fix it.</li>
            <li> I guess it could work for curling hair. But I on-the-other-hand cannot use this period. It doesn&#x27;t work well with shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li> Great concept.  Material holds hair well.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I had to take a minute to figure out how to use this. It is very thin and light weight. The wire frame is easily bendable and with thin hair stays in place without the need for bobby pins. My hair is way too long to use this by itself but they work great for my daughters</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money if you have much hair.  This is flimsy and won&#x27;t stay in place without many bobby pins and won&#x27;t hold shape.  This barely works for my daughter who has thin fine hair.  Still requires pins for her as well.</li>
            <li> not good quality, i did not know it would not hold up my hair well, do not get if you have layers</li>
            <li> I would tell buyer&#x27;s NOT to buy this item.Very poor quality,took a very long time to receive and it smell&#x27;s. I would not put this in my hair even after letting it air out for two day&#x27;s.I&#x27;m shocked that Amazon would sell something like this..</li>
            <li> I bought this because I always wear my hair in a ponytail and thie magic sponge lets me do my hair several different ways, it is a must have in every women&#x27;s collection</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and it doesnt come wut the instruction like the others i have bought. Not happy with the item!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet but it looks the same as the picture online. Can not wait to use this product as I like doing different things with my hair.</li>
            <li> The price is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the product didn&#x27;t come with an instruction. So I searched tutorial for hair bun on youtube and made a really neat hair bun.</li>
