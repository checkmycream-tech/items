    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect size for that purpose.</li>
            <li>Serves its purpose but not the best quality.</li>
            <li>awesome brush.</li>
            <li>Great brush to apply glycolic acid with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just great and has a variety of uses.</li>
            <li>This product works great for glycolic peels.</li>
            <li>This product was a great asset, it works wondering in applying the Pumpkin crème I had purchased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>and I got it at a great price.</li>
            <li>I use this brush to apply a peel on my skin and think it works great.</li>
            <li>This brush was perfect and I am glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>And in a way this is good, because if it was to maintain a fan shape it would be difficule to manipulate the brush around your eyes and nose.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Otherwise this is good but to apply evenly a better method is needed.</li>
            <li>Certain beauty products sure are best used with an applicator.</li>
            <li>I think that the brush looks better this way.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Instead of using a cotton ball (that is recommended), I thought the brush provides more even distrubution.</li>
            <li>My esthetician recommended purchasing a product like this to make application easier and to keep the jars more sanitary.</li>
            <li>I need to dilute the acid more.</li>
            <li>and yet another brush--will add more on these brushes after use</li>
            <li>I ended up trimming the corners to give it a more rounded shape, that way I can take more caution when avoiding the eye area.</li>
            <li>I bought this to apply a salicylic mask and it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>It washes out clean and can be used for many applications</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this was the cheapest fan brush I could find for my salicylic acid chemical peels, and it sure feels that way.</li>
            <li>So far the brush is good.</li>
            <li>I have had services provided in professional clinic and this brush and the peels are great to cuts the high cost of salon services.</li>
            <li>Although the brush has a lovely feel on the skin, you really need a dip cup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for spreading liquids on your face, but not at all luxurious or gentle.</li>
            <li>would give it 0 stars (if it was possible) for the laugh, but the fan brush is rather pleasant against the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own acid peels for 4 years now, after a dermatology nurse taught me how, and have not tried many other diff brands of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It cleans easily and drys fast.</li>
            <li>If I had to use it more than once a week I&#x27;d probably have to buy something a little more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>use it for applying acid facial peels and it does the job quite nicely.</li>
            <li>The metal casing holding the fan brush just parted right off the holding stick as though it had been attached using an elementary glue-stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is broad so may not be very detailed where you apply it, but if you are halfway coordinated, it should do fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, when putting the gel on the brush, it slips right through.</li>
            <li>Like a lot of brushes it can dry kind of &#x27;clumped&#x27;</li>
            <li>Product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have bought a lot of these types of brushes for applying peels.  </li>
            <li>It will take several more uses to determine its value through longevity.</li>
            <li>You can find another facial brush that is more reliable.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be a return customer! :-)</li>
            <li>I think it picks up too much solution as my face was burning as soon as I put it on</li>
            <li>It could be that I need to be more careful when dipping the brush in any solution.</li>
            <li>The brush has held up very well, and any bristles have yet to fall out.</li>
            <li>A cotton pad may be used for acid application but the brush is a much nicer choice.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much for it, perhaps a more expensive brush would do a better job.  </li>
            <li>I use this for acid peel application...has held up and is as new as the day I got it months ago!</li>
            <li>The application was decent but the peel needs to be poured into something else before using the brush since most peel containers have a narrow opening.</li>
            <li>When I first started using the fan brush for my facial chemical peels, it seemed to drip no matter how much &amp;#34;tapping&amp;#34; I did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely course and pokey, but it&#x27;s fine for getting the job done.</li>
            <li>The picture makes it look like it is much thicker than it actually is.  </li>
            <li>Guess it can deserve a crummy old star.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and seem like they are not going to fall out.</li>
            <li>I would say to go over the same spot a few times to make sure everything is spread around evenly.</li>
            <li>I rinse with hot water and let air dry.</li>
            <li>I hope it last as long as other purchasers, two years or more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this brush once so far with Skin Laboratory GlycoLac 60.</li>
            <li>This item just came in the mail today, I was barely using it to apply a weekly peel of salicylic acid when it broke 3 seconds in.</li>
            <li>I have tried to lay it flat on the counter to dry after washing it to see if this would help alleviate the issue, but it doesn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>Bristles are super stiff, not soft at all.</li>
            <li>Wears out quickly, thus the 4 stars, but I don&#x27;t know if that is common with brushes.</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t use for long before metal surrounding the fan began to bend.  </li>
            <li> This brush is not nearly as soft as I&#x27;d hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that when it gets wet, it tends to separate too much which causes slightly uneven application results.</li>
            <li> I have never found one that does not separate when wet.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> Not very useful.</li>
            <li> I have a few times dipped it in alcohol or peroxide, then rinsed and let air dry.</li>
            <li> The bristles were too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this brush not just for applying acid peel liquid but for serums and other liquids and lotions that require thin even coverage without rubbing or massaging the skin.</li>
            <li> The seller was even worse.</li>
            <li> He has to be one of the worse seller on amazon that I ever encounter.</li>
            <li> Than again the bristles are thin, so i probably wasn&#x27;t using it for its intended purposes.</li>
            <li> But since I bought it and I&#x27;m horrible with returns, I decided to stick with it.</li>

            <li> Product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I&#x27;ve washed the product about a dozen times and the bristles are not falling out. The white paint chips,but I think that the brush looks better this way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush once so far with Skin Laboratory GlycoLac 60. The application was decent but the peel needs to be poured into something else before using the brush since most peel containers have a narrow opening.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have bought a lot of these types of brushes for applying peels.  I have never found one that does not separate when wet.  And in a way this is good, because if it was to maintain a fan shape it would be difficule to manipulate the brush around your eyes and nose.  You won&#x27;t be disappoined, and for the price you can;t beat it.</li>
            <li> This product works well with my peels. It cleans easily and drys fast. The bristles have shown no sign of wear or tear and still looks brand new after a month and half of use. I rinse with hot water and let air dry. I have a few times dipped it in alcohol or peroxide, then rinsed and let air dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use with glycolic acid so I could do my skin peels at home.  It is just so-so.  The picture makes it look like it is much thicker than it actually is.  The brush separates quite a lot while using it. I have tried to lay it flat on the counter to dry after washing it to see if this would help alleviate the issue, but it doesn&#x27;t really help. I didn&#x27;t pay much for it, perhaps a more expensive brush would do a better job.  Overall it works okay and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Great brush to apply glycolic acid with. Wears out quickly, thus the 4 stars, but I don&#x27;t know if that is common with brushes. I&#x27;ve been doing my own acid peels for 4 years now, after a dermatology nurse taught me how, and have not tried many other diff brands of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;This brush works well!</li>

Guess it can deserve a crummy old star.</li>
            <li> I use this for applying my glycolic peel. The brush has held up very well, and any bristles have yet to fall out. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while with a lactic acid peel and it has all its bristles.  I use it with a clay mask too and it still performs well.</li>
            <li> I have had services provided in professional clinic and this brush and the peels are great to cuts the high cost of salon services.</li>
            <li> So far the brush is good. It will take several more uses to determine its value through longevity. Not positive if it is better than a lesser expensive brush.</li>

            <li> Not much to say. It performs. Like a lot of brushes it can dry kind of &#x27;clumped&#x27; but I dont fault this brush for that. Certain beauty products sure are best used with an applicator.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for acid application. This is a perfect size for that purpose. Bristles are soft and seem like they are not going to fall out. A cotton pad may be used for acid application but the brush is a much nicer choice.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use for long before metal surrounding the fan began to bend.  Then the brush began to fall out.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Well made.  Allows acid peels to spread evenly on face. I hope it last as long as other purchasers, two years or more.</li>
            <li> This product works great for glycolic peels. Instead of using a cotton ball (that is recommended), I thought the brush provides more even distrubution.</li>

I would say to go over the same spot a few times to make sure everything is spread around evenly.</li>
            <li> Works well, I have used it several times and it doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li> Although the brush has a lovely feel on the skin, you really need a dip cup. Otherwise, when putting the gel on the brush, it slips right through. You&#x27;d have to pour just enough gel into a mini cup to avoid having to pour remaning back into bottle. Not very useful.</li>
            <li> You can find another facial brush that is more reliable. The bristles were too harsh on my skin. The brush just seemed really fragile. The seller was even worse. He has to be one of the worse seller on amazon that I ever encounter.</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose but not the best quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this to apply a salicylic acid peel. Bristles are super stiff, not soft at all. But since I bought it and I&#x27;m horrible with returns, I decided to stick with it. After using it from April-August, I&#x27;ve finally had enough. Tossed it. Do NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to apply peels and masques.  My esthetician recommended purchasing a product like this to make application easier and to keep the jars more sanitary.</li>
            <li> I got this and used it on a thicker face mask, it worked to spread over my face, but not as i was hoping it would. Than again the bristles are thin, so i probably wasn&#x27;t using it for its intended purposes. Still like it and would order again, but lets hope i don&#x27;t have to. Longevity is key!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this was the cheapest fan brush I could find for my salicylic acid chemical peels, and it sure feels that way. It&#x27;s extremely course and pokey, but it&#x27;s fine for getting the job done. If I had to use it more than once a week I&#x27;d probably have to buy something a little more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> INEXPENSIVE &amp; DOES THE JOB.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for applying acid facial peels and it does the job quite nicely. It is broad so may not be very detailed where you apply it, but if you are halfway coordinated, it should do fine.&lt;br /&gt;The construction seems sturdy and should last awhile.</li>
            <li> This brush was perfect and I am glad I purchased it.  It washes out clean and can be used for many applications</li>
            <li> This product was a great asset, it works wondering in applying the Pumpkin crème I had purchased with this product.  Would recommend this product and company to anyone, if they are needing this type of product.</li>
            <li> This brush is not nearly as soft as I&#x27;d hoped it would be. It&#x27;s ok for spreading liquids on your face, but not at all luxurious or gentle.</li>
            <li> I need to dilute the acid more. Otherwise this is good but to apply evenly a better method is needed.</li>
            <li> awesome brush. I use it to apply chemical peels and enzymes. Works great and I got it at a great price. I will definitely be a return customer! :-)</li>
            <li> When I first started using the fan brush for my facial chemical peels, it seemed to drip no matter how much &amp;#34;tapping&amp;#34; I did.  Now, I just run it along the bridge of the bowl to remove excess acid and it works like a charm.  Love it!</li>
            <li> and yet another brush--will add more on these brushes after use</li>
            <li> I use this brush to apply a peel on my skin and think it works great. I ended up trimming the corners to give it a more rounded shape, that way I can take more caution when avoiding the eye area.</li>
