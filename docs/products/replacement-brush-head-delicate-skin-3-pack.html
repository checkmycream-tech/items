            <li>Much better though since it&#x27;s a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely amazing heads.</li>
            <li>but it was so amazing for my skin that I just bit the bullet and kept buying them.</li>
            <li>These do the job, although not quite as nice feeling as the brand name brushes.</li>

            <li>The bristles feel soft and you sure cannot beat the price!!!</li>
            <li>Although they are generic, they fit my Clarisonic perfectly and works just as good as the ones I&#x27;ve been buying from Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>Wish they would of worked better.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal and quality!</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?  </li>
            <li>Love these and they appear to be authentic.</li>
            <li>I am really glad that I found these.  </li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!  </li>
            <li>Heads don&#x27;t fit on the clarasonic Mia like the originals do !</li>
            <li>and this works nice for a every day clean,</li>
            <li>my wife says they are as good as the real ones!</li>
            <li>The fit is great and they clean very well.  </li>
            <li>Like more abrasive than the original &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush head I got with the Clarisonic even though they are supposed to be gentler.</li>
            <li>no problems, I like the way it makes the soap foam, feel like im getting a better clean.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>so I used her Mia with my brush head and it fit fine, no fuss at all.</li>
            <li>It seems that these brush heads may fit, but they do not spin like they are suppose to.</li>
            <li>My skin is fabulous, just as it was when I was using the brand name brush heads.</li>
            <li>They fit the Clairsonic Mia, but they don&#x27;t appear to rotate with the unit as well as those made specifically for the Mia.  </li>
            <li>So you can imagine how happy I was when I discovered these generic brush heads.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t fit my Clarisonic  Mia.</li>
            <li>No difference with the original ones</li>
            <li>These have worked just as well as the original Clarisonic heads for my Mia 2.</li>
            <li>These are great, feel exactly the same as the clarisonic but for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Great value, expected quality for pricing.</li>
            <li>i love it, it is really do work.</li>
            <li>however, this was such a good purchase.</li>
            <li>My Clarisonic brush head isn&#x27;t even the sensitive skin kind yet still doesn&#x27;t hurt me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got them quickly, they fit right into the Clarisonic and are 1/2 the price we would have paid walking into the beauty store to get them.  </li>
            <li>I find the cleansing just as good as a Clarisonic, but these do spray a little more of my cleanser around - splashes on mirror from outer ring of brush, that never happens with Clarisonic</li>
            <li>I guess I thought I had just gotten a super deal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis, however, I love these. :)</li>
            <li>These are super abrasive.  </li>
            <li>star merchant  quick delivery time.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I just got my first 3 pack of these in and am amazed at the quality!</li>
            <li>I very rarely review products (esp positively) but wanted to in this case.</li>
            <li>But certainly worth it for the price if you&#x27;re not picky.</li>
            <li>These were definitely worth a try, though.</li>
            <li>When I first got my clarisonic last holiday I was very excited about having spa like treatment available at home.</li>
            <li>nice and soft for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>VERY fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Feels exactly like the real thing!</li>
            <li>Also, I had just has my first baby</li>
            <li>I will most definitely purchase again and my mom is now going to start purchasing these.</li>
            <li>Love them and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>I should have know better, only $7 for 3 brushes, including tax and shipping.</li>
            <li>I threw them all in the trash as it would cost me more to send them back, some place in China.</li>
            <li>If you are on a tight budget - they will work fine, but for the better result with the unit - spend the money on those made specifically for Mia.</li>
            <li>Having purchased and used these, I find that they leave my skin much less red and am able to use them several times a week- my skin feels and looks great.</li>
            <li>Finally the icing on the cake was that I got my product within 3-4 days of ordering it, so I wasn&#x27;t even expecting to receive it so quickly!</li>
            <li>I really like these for the savings it provides by not purchasing the name brand brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Although it fits my Clarisonic, it doesn&#x27;t work like the real thing.</li>
            <li>They almost feel as if they don&#x27;t quite fit, then they finally twist on and seat correctly, but the brushes do nothing when you turn the Clarisonic on.</li>
            <li>I was expecting that is wouldn&#x27;t fit the same of the brush</li>
            <li>Received my order fast.  </li>
            <li>do lock onto the Mia, but it still wiggles around, unlike the actual brush heads made by Clarisonic that securely fasten 100%.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking maybe since they don&#x27;t fit quite right, it&#x27;s working harder to spin?</li>
            <li>Just right for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They need a little more of a jiggle to get them on my Mia 2 securely but no big deal.  </li>
            <li>They are much more abrasive and feel different than the authentic delicate heads.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought the replacement the price nearly made me rethink using my Clarisonic</li>
            <li>Discounted brush, at a decent price.</li>
            <li>The hinges and bristles are exactly the same between the genuine and generic brands.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>These brush heads seem to work fine, and the price is a no-brainer, but there really is no substitute for the quality of the clarisonic heads.  </li>
            <li>I think they work a little better just because i got them for cheaper, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i already owned a genuine clarisonic head which would&#x27;ve costed me $20 to replace, and upon careful probing and checking today</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clean as well as I had hoped, so I broke down and just purchased the real thing.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them to anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I ordered these exact same brush heads through a Groupon deal and they do NOT work with the Mia 2.</li>
            <li>Works the exact same as Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li>These are exactly the same item at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY THE SAME as the one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered they&#x27;re quite literally the same exact flipping thing.</li>
            <li>So fast forward to two years later...</li>
            <li>Also, my sonicare makes a different noise with these heads on, and seemed to run out of battery much faster.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Clarisonic&#x27;s sensitive replacement brush heads since I got my Clarisonic in 2011 and the brush head needed replacing.</li>
            <li>and I knew my sensitive skin would not react well.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t want to have to spend so much on the real Clarisonic brush heads, but these are simply not the proper replacements.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very same quality as the original more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend, same as the brand product.</li>
            <li>The bristles for the generic one are a little longer but other than that, there honestly was NO difference.</li>
            <li>If there is a difference between the more expensive brush heads and these, I certainly can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>After using it a couple of times I found that although it cleaned my skin deeply as advertised it also left it very red and patchy, so I used it very infrequently</li>
            <li>The vibrations feel off (barely there) and doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s cleaning.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and definitely work well.</li>
            <li>i bought this with skepticism, as many &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; i.e., counterfeit products are poorly constructed and thus cheaper to manufacture and sell.</li>
            <li>As a result, the center circle of brushes are barely vibrating/spinning, thus not really doing anything useful on my skin</li>
            <li>My only complaint about these generic brushes is that they make your claresonic super loud, probably 5X louder than when you use with brand name brush</li>
            <li>I just received them earlier than expected and there is seriously no difference.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of five is because it shed a little at first</li>

            <li> I ordered these exact same brush heads through a Groupon deal and they do NOT work with the Mia 2.</li>
            <li> Works the exact same as Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> These are exactly the same item at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> EXACTLY THE SAME as the one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered they&#x27;re quite literally the same exact flipping thing.</li>
            <li> So fast forward to two years later...</li>
            <li> Also, my sonicare makes a different noise with these heads on, and seemed to run out of battery much faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clarisonic&#x27;s sensitive replacement brush heads since I got my Clarisonic in 2011 and the brush head needed replacing.</li>
            <li> and I knew my sensitive skin would not react well.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t want to have to spend so much on the real Clarisonic brush heads, but these are simply not the proper replacements.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very same quality as the original more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend, same as the brand product.</li>
            <li> The bristles for the generic one are a little longer but other than that, there honestly was NO difference.</li>
            <li> If there is a difference between the more expensive brush heads and these, I certainly can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> After using it a couple of times I found that although it cleaned my skin deeply as advertised it also left it very red and patchy, so I used it very infrequently</li>
            <li> The vibrations feel off (barely there) and doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s cleaning.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and definitely work well.</li>
            <li> i bought this with skepticism, as many &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; i.e., counterfeit products are poorly constructed and thus cheaper to manufacture and sell.</li>
            <li> As a result, the center circle of brushes are barely vibrating/spinning, thus not really doing anything useful on my skin</li>
            <li> My only complaint about these generic brushes is that they make your claresonic super loud, probably 5X louder than when you use with brand name brush</li>
            <li> I just received them earlier than expected and there is seriously no difference.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of five is because it shed a little at first</li>
            <li> I switched to the delicate because I read some reviews saying the generic were more stiff</li>
            <li> I feel like a total fool paying for the name brand heads for so long.  </li>
            <li> While I feel the brush won&#x27;t last as long as the name brand one would, I can&#x27;t beat the cost.</li>
            <li> I see absolutely no difference between these and the name-brand refills, except the plastic casing is blue instead of white.</li>
            <li> Skeptical but worth a shot for the price, I have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the real ones at all!</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no excess flimsiness or space for the bristles or parts to move around, and the sides are removable so you can do spot cleaning just like with the regular heads.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little different, but not enough to matter to me.</li>
            <li> Even when I barely applied the brush on my face, my face felt like it was being scrubbed too hard and was left stinging.</li>
            <li> I have a Clarisonic Mia and have purchased other clarisonic compatible heads from Amazon in the past that were more expensive and  were scratchy, even though they were supposed to be &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;ll deal with a little extra buzzing.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin prone to rosecea, I ordered the pack of 3 DELICATE Skin.</li>
            <li> I thought something was wrong with my clarisonic, however when I went and purchased real clarisonic replacement brush heads, the inner and outer parts of the brush both rotated (which is the correct way).</li>
            <li> I cannot find anything different with these brushes other than the color is just a little lighter.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical as you usually get what you pay for and this is significantly cheaper than the Clarisonic brand replacement brush heads that I have bought and used for almost 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I actually got my Mia as a present, and had no idea how I was going to afford the ridiculously expensive refills.</li>
            <li> If the standard heads are a little too abrasive for you, i suggest the delicate ones, which feel like little clouds are rubbing your dead skin cells off.</li>
            <li> There are a few bristles that might need a little trim</li>
            <li> I was literally in shock and slightly annoyed that on where in the description did it say GENERIC.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Too harsh for my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a few months now and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> I decided to try these gentle skin brushes - but did not want to pay for name brand brushes since they were very expensive and might have been just as abrasive.</li>
            <li> A little bit hard for me.</li>
            <li> But there is always those people out there that are never satisfied.</li>
            <li> the above two complaints combined, they render these replacement brush heads utterly useless.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the fit of the brush on my Clarisonic device.  </li>
            <li> so when I received them and they weren&#x27;t in the Clarisonic packaging boxes, I was sleep deprived and out of sorts to say the least.</li>
            <li> And they are def delicate but not too delicate where you think it may not work.</li>
            <li> These are supposed to be the delicate heads, and they still hurt.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than the Clairsonic brand.  </li>
            <li> The center of the brush feels like a thorn when it&#x27;s running so there is something  very wrong!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the weird thing...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews where people are complaining about water spraying out of it, dirty and smelly &amp; not rotating correctly.</li>
            <li> The people with bad reviews must have accidentally received a faulty pack or something.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed</li>
            <li> Horrible quality brush.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great value, fits my Clarisonic perfectly at a fraction of the cost of other brands. Just right for sensitive skin. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Feels exactly like the real thing!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the fit of the brush on my Clarisonic device.  It didn&#x27;t clean as well as I had hoped, so I broke down and just purchased the real thing.</li>
            <li> These do the job, although not quite as nice feeling as the brand name brushes. But certainly worth it for the price if you&#x27;re not picky.</li>
            <li> These brush heads seem to work fine, and the price is a no-brainer, but there really is no substitute for the quality of the clarisonic heads.  These were definitely worth a try, though.</li>
            <li> It seems that these brush heads may fit, but they do not spin like they are suppose to. The brush just vibrates in place. Wish they would of worked better. Clarisonic brand seems to be the only one that works properly.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the weird thing...when I purchased these 2 years ago, I had no idea I had bought &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; brush heads. I guess I thought I had just gotten a super deal. Also, I had just has my first baby so when I received them and they weren&#x27;t in the Clarisonic packaging boxes, I was sleep deprived and out of sorts to say the least. So fast forward to two years later...I&#x27;m looking through my ordering history on here and BAM I see these are generic and I cannot believe I I never knew this entire time. I was literally in shock and slightly annoyed that on where in the description did it say GENERIC. They had sent me 9 or 10 and they&#x27;ve lasted me two years +. I visited my mom who has the Clarisonic Mia and I compared my brush head with hers. The bristles for the generic one are a little longer but other than that, there honestly was NO difference. I was sleeping over there so I used her Mia with my brush head and it fit fine, no fuss at all. I have the Aria I think (3 speed). I&#x27;ve read reviews where people are complaining about water spraying out of it, dirty and smelly &amp; not rotating correctly. I can happily report that I have never had any of those issues. I wash my brush head once a week with alcohol. I change my brush head every 3 months. My skin is fabulous, just as it was when I was using the brand name brush heads. I will most definitely purchase again and my mom is now going to start purchasing these. I&#x27;m telling all my friends!!</li>
            <li> Such a great deal and quality! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like these for the savings it provides by not purchasing the name brand brushes. I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis, however, I love these. :)</li>
            <li> i love it, it is really do work.</li>
            <li> Second time purchasing them. No mechanical issues. They work great.</li>
            <li> They work just like the Clarisonic brand heads on my Mia 2.</li>
            <li> I just got my first 3 pack of these in and am amazed at the quality! You can&#x27;t beat the price. Really happy to have found these!</li>
            <li> They work great! There are a few bristles that might need a little trim but overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?  It fits perfectly on my Mia 2.  The bristles feel soft and you sure cannot beat the price!!!</li>
            <li> I very rarely review products (esp positively) but wanted to in this case. When I first got my clarisonic last holiday I was very excited about having spa like treatment available at home. After using it a couple of times I found that although it cleaned my skin deeply as advertised it also left it very red and patchy, so I used it very infrequently afterwards- maybe 1x month. I decided to try these gentle skin brushes - but did not want to pay for name brand brushes since they were very expensive and might have been just as abrasive. Having purchased and used these, I find that they leave my skin much less red and am able to use them several times a week- my skin feels and looks great. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I see no difference in the effectiveness or feel of these brush heads compared to the name brand ones.  These brush heads fit perfectly on the Mia that I have and work flawlessly.  Will definitely reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the real ones at all! I would recommend them to anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Very good! No difference with the original ones</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than the Clairsonic brand.  Maybe a little different, but not enough to matter to me.</li>
            <li> Although it fits my Clarisonic, it doesn&#x27;t work like the real thing. The vibrations feel off (barely there) and doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s cleaning. I&#x27;ll be throwing these away.</li>
            <li> I ordered these exact same brush heads through a Groupon deal and they do NOT work with the Mia 2. They almost feel as if they don&#x27;t quite fit, then they finally twist on and seat correctly, but the brushes do nothing when you turn the Clarisonic on. Lesson learned, buy the name-brand brushes so you know they work.</li>
            <li> Works the exact same as Clarisonic brand. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> an affordable alternative</li>
            <li> I feel like a total fool paying for the name brand heads for so long.  These are exactly the same item at a fraction of the cost.  I was expecting that is wouldn&#x27;t fit the same of the brush be a lesser quality....nope.  EXACTLY THE SAME as the one&#x27;s I was paying $25 a piece for at the department store.</li>
            <li> my wife says they are as good as the real ones!</li>
            <li> Love these and they appear to be authentic.</li>
            <li> good quality! VERY fast shipping. nice and soft for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical as you usually get what you pay for and this is significantly cheaper than the Clarisonic brand replacement brush heads that I have bought and used for almost 2 years.  Wish I would have found this option sooner and saved myself some money.  No discernible difference from the name brand.</li>
            <li> I work in the beauty industry, so I have dealt with clarisonics a lot! I used these with my Mia1 and I had no problems. The only difference was the plastic was a cheaper quality but that&#x27;s fine. No difference in bristle length like some had stated. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have a Clarisonic Mia and have purchased other clarisonic compatible heads from Amazon in the past that were more expensive and  were scratchy, even though they were supposed to be &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34;.  These ones are the way the &amp;#34;delicates&amp;#34; should be and they fit perfectly.  Very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the name brand version, which I used for years. I wish I&#x27;d found these sooner!</li>
            <li> I decided to try these off-brand heads for my sonicare to save money... Guess I got what I paid for! They are much more abrasive and feel different than the authentic delicate heads. Also, my sonicare makes a different noise with these heads on, and seemed to run out of battery much faster. I&#x27;m thinking maybe since they don&#x27;t fit quite right, it&#x27;s working harder to spin? I will finish using these but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as Clarisonic brush heads but a fraction of the price!!</li>
            <li> I feel like this doesn&#x27;t QUITE attach to the clarisonic correctly but it does work.  For the price I&#x27;ll deal with a little extra buzzing.</li>
            <li> They fit the Clairsonic Mia, but they don&#x27;t appear to rotate with the unit as well as those made specifically for the Mia.  If you are on a tight budget - they will work fine, but for the better result with the unit - spend the money on those made specifically for Mia.</li>
            <li> These are super abrasive.  Like more abrasive than the original &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush head I got with the Clarisonic even though they are supposed to be gentler.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to ge the generic version but no longer! These are great, feel exactly the same as the clarisonic but for a fraction of the price. My skin and wallet are very happy!! I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Inner brush pops out of the outer brush leaving the unit inoperable.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Amazing price &amp; quality!</li>
            <li> My only complaint about these generic brushes is that they make your claresonic super loud, probably 5X louder than when you use with brand name brush</li>
            <li> Having used the brand name for a couple of years, I gave these a try. After using these for a week I see no difference in performance AND what a savings! Having sensitive skin prone to rosecea, I ordered the pack of 3 DELICATE Skin.</li>
            <li> Received my order fast.  These brush heads fit my Clarsonic Mia perfectly.  Will never pay $25ea again!  Love them and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I am really glad that I found these.  Although they are generic, they fit my Clarisonic perfectly and works just as good as the ones I&#x27;ve been buying from Clarisonic.  I am saving money by ordering these. They came on time there was no problem with the packaging so I definitely will use this seller again.</li>
            <li> Whoa! Talk about a good deal. I see absolutely no difference between these and the name-brand refills, except the plastic casing is blue instead of white. I actually got my Mia as a present, and had no idea how I was going to afford the ridiculously expensive refills. Thank you for making my fave beauty tool affordable!</li>
            <li> same as clarisonic at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> Skeptical but worth a shot for the price, I have been pleasantly surprised.  They need a little more of a jiggle to get them on my Mia 2 securely but no big deal.  I find the cleansing just as good as a Clarisonic, but these do spray a little more of my cleanser around - splashes on mirror from outer ring of brush, that never happens with Clarisonic but so what - I can have 12 of these brush heads for the price of one Clarisonic!  Very happy, will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Love these. I just received them earlier than expected and there is seriously no difference. They fit great and work perfectly as if they were clarisionic brand. And they are def delicate but not too delicate where you think it may not work. Plus I thought I was getting 3 for $4.98 but they sent me 9. Score! 100% recommend and I just told everyone on Facebook about them. The people with bad reviews must have accidentally received a faulty pack or something. But there is always those people out there that are never satisfied.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend, same as the brand product.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!  Got them quickly, they fit right into the Clarisonic and are 1/2 the price we would have paid walking into the beauty store to get them.  They come three to a pack and I loaded up and got four packs because the price was so good!</li>
            <li> Horrible quality brush. only the outer parts of the brush head was rotating when I used this on my clarisonic. I thought something was wrong with my clarisonic, however when I went and purchased real clarisonic replacement brush heads, the inner and outer parts of the brush both rotated (which is the correct way).</li>
            <li> This is my second order. If there is a difference between the more expensive brush heads and these, I certainly can&#x27;t tell. This is wonderful bargain. Don&#x27;t hesitate, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed</li>
            <li> i bought this with skepticism, as many &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; i.e., counterfeit products are poorly constructed and thus cheaper to manufacture and sell. however, this was such a good purchase. i already owned a genuine clarisonic head which would&#x27;ve costed me $20 to replace, and upon careful probing and checking today I&#x27;ve discovered they&#x27;re quite literally the same exact flipping thing. These heads are 85% cheaper than MSRP and do the same job! I think they work a little better just because i got them for cheaper, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely amazing heads. If the standard heads are a little too abrasive for you, i suggest the delicate ones, which feel like little clouds are rubbing your dead skin cells off.I checked how the plastic structure is molded, etc. The hinges and bristles are exactly the same between the genuine and generic brands. There is absolutely no excess flimsiness or space for the bristles or parts to move around, and the sides are removable so you can do spot cleaning just like with the regular heads. Finally the icing on the cake was that I got my product within 3-4 days of ordering it, so I wasn&#x27;t even expecting to receive it so quickly! If i could give this a bajillion stars I would; I am over the moon with the price and quality of these heads. They last forever! MUST BUY</li>
            <li> Heads don&#x27;t fit on the clarasonic Mia like the originals do ! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend them !</li>
            <li> I notice no difference between this and the name brand, oh except for all the money im saving. I have moody skin and this works nice for a every day clean, no problems, I like the way it makes the soap foam, feel like im getting a better clean.</li>
            <li> Works with my clarisonic plus</li>
            <li> They are just like the clairisonic brushes!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! A duplicate to a Clarisonic brand head.</li>
            <li> Already tried these on my Clarisonic Mia 2. The fit is great and they clean very well.  Very pleased that I ordered them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clarisonic&#x27;s sensitive replacement brush heads since I got my Clarisonic in 2011 and the brush head needed replacing. The first time I bought the replacement the price nearly made me rethink using my Clarisonic but it was so amazing for my skin that I just bit the bullet and kept buying them. So you can imagine how happy I was when I discovered these generic brush heads. They&#x27;re great for the price!!! I switched to the delicate because I read some reviews saying the generic were more stiff and I knew my sensitive skin would not react well. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of five is because it shed a little at first but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. Would recommend for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these replacement heads for about a month, and I&#x27;ve attempted to use it about 3 times now.&lt;br /&gt;Complaints:&lt;br /&gt;-They do lock onto the Mia, but it still wiggles around, unlike the actual brush heads made by Clarisonic that securely fasten 100%. As a result, the center circle of brushes are barely vibrating/spinning, thus not really doing anything useful on my skin&lt;br /&gt;-Too harsh for my face. Even when I barely applied the brush on my face, my face felt like it was being scrubbed too hard and was left stinging. These are supposed to be the delicate heads, and they still hurt. My Clarisonic brush head isn&#x27;t even the sensitive skin kind yet still doesn&#x27;t hurt me.&lt;br /&gt;-With the above two complaints combined, they render these replacement brush heads utterly useless. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m returning them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to have to spend so much on the real Clarisonic brush heads, but these are simply not the proper replacements.</li>
            <li> I got this but it doesn&#x27;t fit my Clarisonic  Mia. Have to return it. Save time and don&#x27;t give it a try.</li>
            <li> A little bit hard for me.</li>
            <li> Great value, expected quality for pricing. I have sensitive skin. So, I have read the reviews, but I also thought hey, give it a shot. It will work or it won&#x27;t. While I feel the brush won&#x27;t last as long as the name brand one would, I can&#x27;t beat the cost. So for that I will give it 5 starts. I won&#x27;t fault a product for what it is. Discounted brush, at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Very same quality as the original more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Just like the brand version. The bristles are soft and definitely work well.</li>
            <li> These have worked just as well as the original Clarisonic heads for my Mia 2. Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Was so happy to find these. the three pack will last me for awhile .5  star merchant  quick delivery time.</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THESE &amp;#34;CHEAP&amp;#34; REPLACEMENT BRUSHES! I should have know better, only $7 for 3 brushes, including tax and shipping. I threw them all in the trash as it would cost me more to send them back, some place in China. While they appear to be the same as Clarisonic, they are NOT. The center of the brush feels like a thorn when it&#x27;s running so there is something  very wrong! I went out and bought a 2-pack for $44 plus tax.</li>
            <li> Comparable to Clarisonic.  But way cheaper.</li>
            <li> I cannot find anything different with these brushes other than the color is just a little lighter. I&#x27;ve been using them for a few months now and have had no problems. It is a great savings.</li>
            <li> Did my Clarisonic &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; perfectly. You hold the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; brush and this brush side by side and there is no difference.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell a difference from the actual Clarisonic brushes.  Much better though since it&#x27;s a fraction of the price!</li>
