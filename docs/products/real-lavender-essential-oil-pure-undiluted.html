            <li>I use this oil in my diffusers but also I apply a drop or two of it along with a drop or two of Frankincense oil each morning to my freshly washed face, neck, and chest - it is calming, refreshing, and healing for acne and scarring and also works nicely for reducing anxiety and stress.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the box the room  was filled with the most lovely fragrance</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there is fine print somewhere, but I didn&#x27;t see it.</li>

            <li>I use lavender in my dryer as I love the light fragrance of it.</li>
            <li>I love how they place calls and check up on you to make sure the product is working to its full ability....</li>
            <li>What a difference in the Nature&#x27;s Own Essence product vs. the complimentary bottle.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much I had to buy two.</li>
            <li>Some oils are way too strong, this one is light and so much appropriate for my lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is an excellent essential oil and the deep lavender fragrance is superior to many that I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>My boss started looking around for other brands, saw the wonderful reviews on Amazon and gave this one a try.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m excited to learn more.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of lavender and was excited to try this oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The company provided me with a sample of their lavender oil, and being an true fan of good quality of essential oils, I simply loved this one.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I have jumped on the essential oils bandwagon, and I am a happy passenger.  </li>

            <li>Yep I&#x27;m a happy customer and will be back for more although it may take a while to use it all.</li>
            <li>I used a quarter ounce in making a a pound of soap and it still smells strong after two months of drying.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is strong.</li>
            <li>But I think the smell is a bit strong, I think it will take time to get used to the sharpness.</li>
            <li>Being someone who has always enjoyed lavender oil, I was pretty excited when I found Nature&#x27;s Own Essence Lavender Oil on Amazon.</li>

            <li>This is a great brand with a hearty scent that is unique from other brands I have tried-</li>
            <li>Good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It truely works.</li>
            <li>but I  enjoyed this product so much</li>
            <li>I thought that I would have run out, but it is so potent you never need much so that 2oz bottle lasts forever</li>

            <li>Love the oil, working very well.</li>

            <li>While I was a bit worried about the fragrance, I have no clue how anyone could say this isn&#x27;t fragrant, it has a very powerful smell that you would expect from fresh oils.</li>
            <li>Premium European Lavender is the best and I am hooked on it moreover, the many uses for Lavender is endless.</li>
            <li>Lavender is my favorite scent of all the essential oils, and I was thrilled to find a bit larger bottle at a reasonable price from Nature&#x27;s Own Essence!  </li>

            <li>I enjoy about Nature&#x27;s Own Essence Lavender Essential Oil</li>
            <li>It has helped my ADHD son replace his medicine, &amp; my mildly OCD son to break those habits.</li>
            <li>A tiny drop on my hands makes them feel amazing - smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>Until I make those soaps, I learned I can add Essential oils to cleaning products to make my home smell nice, and, it will also help me enjoy my cleaning.  </li>
            <li>One of the first signs of cheap, synthetic oils is a plastic bottle.</li>
            <li>very much for this product!</li>
            <li>And most important, it does not provide the calming relief that genuine organic lavender (i.e. French Lavender) does.  </li>
            <li>At many levels, lavender oils and diffusing lavender into the room can help promote calm, restful nights and actually help a person regain some life energy by gaining sleep that is more restful.  </li>
            <li>I feel very satisfied with this company especially knowing they offer a GUARANTEE on their product.</li>
            <li>Good quality essential oil, but I could have done without all the subsequent emails from Nature&#x27;s Own Essence.</li>
            <li>A few drops in my wash makes my sheets smell beautiful.  </li>

            <li>suggest this as your first choice!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of lavender, this is my favorite by far!  </li>
            <li>I am not calling it a &amp;#34;miracle worker&amp;#34; but it is a lovely natural product that I would recommend to others!</li>
            <li>and it helps keep them happy little campers.</li>

            <li>Useful in crowded areas like planes or subways to carve out your own personal oasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Well I was impressed and decided to do a little research to see exactly what else I could do with this all natural extract.  </li>
            <li>It does not have a pure clean smell of lavender.  </li>
            <li>The seller has been good about sending notes on other uses I had not considered.</li>

            <li>Carrying a bottle of lavender around with you is like having your own personal first aid kit, perfume, and pick-me</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s such a true Lavender scent - sometimes I just take the top off the bottle and take in a whiff of it - helps me relax but also perks me up too</li>

            <li>I also put few drops of Lavender on own home made shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was forwarded several bottles of Natures Own Essence Lavender Essential Oil to review.</li>
            <li>Although doTerra claims you can take their essential oils internally, Natures Own Essence does not recommend this with their products.</li>
            <li>Lavender Oil is by far my favorite of all Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m NOT suggesting you start replacing your medicine, for natural products !!!</li>
            <li>I will be buying my lavender oil direct from this company from now on!!!</li>
            <li>I use lavender as a sleep aid by enjoying the scent for a few moments right before bedtime.</li>
            <li>Winding down before bed as an adult or assisting with sleep disorders - Many adults suffer from sleep disturbances and sleep disorders that range from mild to severe.  </li>
            <li>After surgery pain relief - Although there have been more reported testimonials, one study done on biopsy patients (reported at the University of Maryland Medical Center) for after surgery pain relief showed significant pain decrease in patients who received oxygen with Lavender aromatherapy versus those who just received oxygen without aromatherapy in post-operative scenarios.&lt;br</li>

            <li>This is a great product; very concentrated, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t quite place it, but it&#x27;s not as enjoyable to smell as other lavender oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I have provided a list of some of the many uses for Lavender Oil, for myself and other readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  SOME OF THESE REMEDIES,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gone to L&#x27;Occitane and other places that sell lavender room sprays to see if they smell better</li>
            <li>Much more concentrate than other brands.</li>
            <li>so I was so excited when I finally ordered the bottle</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t realize it had so many other uses.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for high quality, 100% pure, undiluted lavender oil, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>Very concentrated so only need a few drops to create lovely strong smell.  </li>
            <li>I use lavender oil in many ways - several drops on my CPAP filter at bedtime, to calm my dog during thunderstorms using several drops rubbed on my hands to pet him, several drops mixed with distilled water for refreshing wrinkled clothes (using a travel size spray bottle), as examples.  </li>
            <li>Mixed with Jojoba Oil for my body, with water as a air-freshener, in laundry and clean tables and counters.</li>
            <li>This amazing Lavender Essential Oil is in my cabinet for all minor skin irritations and my spa needs.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s perfect for my night routine: I put a few drops into a small fabric pillow and place it a bit away from my bed on a night stand.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>can also use it to clean cuts, open wounds and bug bites.&lt;br /&gt;You get an email with all kinds of uses for this product</li>
            <li>Just a little of this oil in the warmer filled my foyer, living room and dining room with a light refreshing fragrance without being over-whelming and lasts for a few days.  </li>
            <li>While the company went out of their way with information and the thick glass bottle, the top to the essential oils itself is a very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>I have recently started buying a lot of different essential oil products and so far have had really great results come from them.</li>
            <li>Find myself opening the top and taking a few whiffs every time I pass by it sitting on my nightstand and an immediate positive feeling.</li>
            <li>- clearly they know much about the benefits of lavender!  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll try the Sweet Orange next.</li>
            <li>I would said that it seems working, he falls asleep faster and has average 1 hour more  sleep per night.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a oil that was 100% natural and not diluted so was relieved to read the label and find it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Relief of minor asthmatic and bronchial spasms - Many people suffer from minor asthmatic and acute bronchial spasms leading to some bronchitis (inflammation of the bronchial tubes) from pollens, bacteria and other allergens or pathogens.</li>

            <li>This is the first oil you can apply directly onto the skin.  </li>
            <li>I am not an essential oil expert, I just know this lavender oil smells great and the scent lasts a long long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very new to the whole essential oil thing - but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how effective they are for so many little daily  irritations that you just never realized were bugging you until they stop.  </li>
            <li>But that is my fault for not reading the fine print of the details where it clearly states that price is for ONE bottle only.</li>
            <li>Repellent-I live in a very humid place, which means lots of mosquitoes and such.&lt;br /&gt;Helps with nerve and anxiety issues.&lt;br /&gt;Acne</li>
            <li>and I would definitely purchase more bottles in the future.</li>
            <li>It is difficult at times when purchasing online to be sure you will be satisfied without having the item in your hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever used any essential oil, so the emails from the company giving advice and suggestions for uses are very much appreciated!</li>
            <li>i use it mainly for aroma therapy</li>
            <li>I work alot in my gardens and it has worked great to keep the insects away (even gnats which are frankly the most annoying of all insects in my book).  </li>
            <li>- Inhale some drops of Lavender before and during a test if permitted to help an older student reset balance to mind and emotions for testing anxieties.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not enough to take any stars away, the only thing I wasn&#x27;t pleased with is the Euro dropper that came with the oil.</li>
            <li>If you have noticed a lot of products are adding lavender scents to their products to help relieve stress, The benefits from this particular one helps promote soothing, calming, relaxing, and balancing.</li>
            <li>On hot summer nights, I usually turn on my aroma diffuser before I go to bed, lavender + peppermint is my favorite combination.</li>
            <li>Now, for my older daughter, she has allergies.  </li>
            <li>While lavender oil does help to repel these, this particular product is also for humans.  </li>
            <li>Very professional and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I use this daily to calm and relax my self.</li>
            <li>This seems to both calm my over active mind so that I can fall asleep easily, and an extra benefit is that even if I do not get my required amount of sleep, I do not wake with a headache.  </li>
            <li>Calming  -  Rub 2-3 drops of lavender oil in your cupped palms, and then inhale to draw the scent all the way into your amygdala gland (the emotional warehouse) in your brain to calm the mind.  </li>

            <li>I have some empty bottles, a dropper from one of them should fit.</li>
            <li>For my Younger daughter, I put a drop of this around her nose at night to calm her</li>
            <li>Essential oil is exactly as described and I will definitely be ordering more of this brand in the future.</li>
            <li>This is by FAR my favorite lavender oil on Amazon, hands down.</li>
            <li>Some natural medicinal doctors (NMDs) have used therapeutic-grade Lavender oils and baths in conjunction with other oils such as tea tree oil to effectively kill these parasites that burrow under the skin, lay eggs, and cause allergic irritations and dermatitis.  </li>

            <li>Sometimes the smells are not quite right with different brands.</li>
            <li>I dab a little on my temples before bed to help relax and I&#x27;ve also used a little in my laundry to leave my clothes sleeping great.</li>
            <li>I agree with some of the other reviewers that it does smell kind of strange.</li>
            <li>Minor rashes, dryness, and other skin irritations are often effectively treated with therapeutic-grade Lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish they would have other oils available.</li>
            <li>This is a new oil we added to our inventory and we are going to use it a lot.  </li>
            <li>(Helps with relaxation as well as congestion, and where I live, congestion is a given.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can also open the lid and take a few deep breaths inhaling the lovely fragrance for a quick pick-me-up.</li>
            <li>My first experience with essential oil, but no complaints here.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I then mixed two drops of peppermint oil in my hot chocolate.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly the same as the lavender that I&#x27;ve bought in the store, but for the price and burning purposes it works.</li>
            <li>Recommend as a natural solution!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>Finally found a brand that I really like !</li>
            <li>Most commonly known for its relaxing effects on the body, therapeutic-grade lavender has been highly regarded for the skin.  </li>
            <li>have a special needs sister that has a lot of emotional issues, and I was told to try to use lavender essential oil on her.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>of the box the small plastic sleeve was wet with lavender--not good.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is just right, not too strong and not too weak.</li>
            <li>My only real concern was it seemed pretty inexpensive for undiluted essential oil.</li>
            <li>This one is fresher and crisper, with an almost sweet fullness that the other one lacks.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s definitely less stressed, and actually gets better sleep at night.</li>
            <li>i love the size it is available in; larger than other other bottles of essential oil.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be using this for any skin problems but seems to work fine for relaxation when I put a few drops in a bucket just to soak my feet.</li>
            <li>I have used two other lavender oils in the past and both were superior.</li>
            <li>100% pure essential lavender oil.</li>
            <li>Skin infections caused by fungus like candidiasis are often treated with topical applications of pure Lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it must be therapeutic grade that it pure enough for ingestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Skin infections caused by fungus like candidiasis are often treated with topical applications of pure Lavender oil.    </li>
            <li>However, it must be therapeutic grade that it pure enough for ingestion.    </li>
            <li>Pure and simple.</li>
            <li>Pure essential oil - I did a blot test.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this English Lavender oil - it smells quite different from other lavender oil I bought locally.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more once it is gone, although it will last a very long time!</li>
            <li>She has a hard time getting to sleep and with this, she is doing so much better.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a few days and already notice a huge difference when I go to sleep.</li>
            <li>I think the scent may actually be more powerful than the expensive brand of lavender oil I have in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel the orifice is far too big, causing too much oil to come out at once.</li>
            <li>The scent alone can remove nervous restlessness and exhaustion, and increase the ability to think clearly.</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised.</li>
            <li>use it to sanitize my hands since it&#x27;s a natural antimicrobial agent.</li>
            <li>I use it directly on my hands and feet as well.  </li>
            <li>Not knowing (or caring) that I shouldn&#x27;t have applied eucalyptus oil directly to my skin, I did.</li>
            <li>ADVETTISING.IT IS 100% NATURAL</li>
            <li>Sometimes, on a busy day, just a sniff of the oil itself helps.</li>
            <li>This Lavender Essential Oil is very camphor and leaves a plastic-like after tone.</li>
            <li>It is all about how much you like it or not and this essential oil gets both thumbs up because I LIKE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
            <li>Using it as a natural spider repellant since I have two young children and a parrot.</li>
            <li>I was looking for the Young Life line, but there weren&#x27;t any that were Prime eligible, so I decided to try this instead.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t get eaten alive and carried away by the Alaskan mosquitos, per some of the suggestions and reviews here.</li>

            <li>I have sleeping problems and tried some on my pillowcase and so far seems to work well.</li>
            <li>As a side note, the wild orange has also helped her in terms of sadness (anxiety and depression are linked).</li>
            <li>I bought the oil for someone else, and as far as I know it is being well used.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit like old rancid oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve applied this oil directly to skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has multiple uses and benefits for the whole family.</li>
            <li>also use it on our wool dryer balls to naturally scent our laundry.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I have recently developed (eczema, dermatitis, psoriasis or just an allergy), but so far the oil seems to be helping as the spots have reduced in size and the itching is not as pronounced.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>if you are going to get any essential oils I really recommend getting Lavender Oil.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft after just 2 uses.</li>
            <li>I was wondering if I was addicted to it, so last night I didn&#x27;t use it, I slept good.</li>
            <li>I also add a drop or two to the amount of  body base cream/lotion that I need to put on my body and it makes me smell sooo smell delicious</li>
            <li>and it had very little fragrance which disappeared very quickly.</li>
            <li>He s autistic and has other issues and this has worked and is amazing.  </li>
            <li>and I always seem to receive less than full bottles</li>
            <li>but the lid was not tight when sent and 1/4 leaked out.</li>
            <li>And immediate relaxation and positive mood enhancement during and  after long 12+ hour days.</li>
            <li>A little of this oil goes a long way and there are too many uses to list here.</li>
            <li>I now even use it in a relaxing bath (for those rare me moments) and add to my shea butter lotion which research has claimed to enhance blood circulation, treat respiratory problems and a host of other health benefits.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product, just received my 4th bottle, I&#x27;m addicted to it and use it for personal care as well as all natural house cleaning products.</li>
            <li>Just put a few drops in a clean spray bottle with water and spray some around your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This time I was looking for a larger quantity at a decent price.</li>
            <li>I liked the amount provided but it seemed less thick like it was diluted too much.</li>
            <li>This IS A High Quality Oil and I will make another purchase when low.</li>
            <li>Still a high quality lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this company and its product, Lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li>would have saved LOTS of money from the high prices I paid at a local &amp;#34;Health&amp;#34; store!</li>
            <li>After buying several different brands of lavender scent, I&#x27;ve developed a preference for certain brands.  </li>
            <li>I usually write detailed descriptions of why I rate a product the way I do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this essential oils for the last few days and it seems like my husband is sleeping better.</li>
            <li>I have discontinued applying the eucalyptus oil to my skin, but even last night  when awakened by an allergy triggered headache, I applied the other 2 oils directly to my upper lip and forehead and was able to get back to sleep in under an hour.</li>
            <li>When using with a diffuser the fragrance is weak even when using far more than the directions state.</li>
            <li>Not only can Lavender be used by the drop in a relaxing bath, but it can also be mixed with pure bath salts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only can Lavender be used by the drop in a relaxing bath, but it can also be mixed with pure bath salts    </li>
            <li>I have tried several types and different companies over the past 16 years of practice and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Opening the bottle and taking a whiff, it does have a slight camphor note, but once it is used properly, you have that familiar smell of lavender.</li>
            <li>However the last batch I bought, along with a new look to the packaging, seems to have also gone downhill in quality...</li>
            <li>Essential oil being the new thing when I offered I had to try it.</li>
            <li>I actually put (1/3) less essential oil than the recipe called for - but it was more than enough.</li>
            <li>- Pure therapeutic grade Lavender oil used as a body deodorant kills bacteria that causes body odors and can be used with other applications as natural body</li>
            <li>- Pure therapeutic grade Lavender oil used as a body deodorant kills bacteria that causes body odors and can be used with other applications as natural body deodorants.    </li>
            <li>I use this lavender oil during am personal care in a total body hot towel scrub and  also place it on cotton balls and place it around in various rooms.</li>
            <li>Compared to other essential oils of this grade, it is easy to tell which essential oils are actually infusing fragrance into their product.</li>
            <li>The price is a little higher than other oils, but the quality of this oil makes well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A drop in the hollow of the throat before bed causes me to drop off quickly and sleep solidly for several hours longer than I&#x27;d done in quite a while.  </li>
            <li>It is lightly scented and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I diffuse in the family room where my pups are to keep them calm during the fireworks at the 4th of July, add a few drops to my coconut oil for a moisturizer and have a room spritzer in the bedroom.</li>
            <li>So far, I only use to help me sleep.</li>
            <li>I have only tried your lavender so far</li>
            <li>Since it is one of the few things that help my migraines, however, I really wanted to try this lavender  oil since it really would save me quite a bit of money in essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I am atempting to use natural products for my personal well-being</li>
            <li>The flow is fast so be careful when pouring.</li>
            <li>It came in a dark glass bottle to keep the quality of the oil and includes a dropper so I can get the exact amount I want each time without making a mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, received what expected.</li>
            <li>I have not had a cold but can already see that this would be good this winter to help my congestion.</li>
            <li>As a massage therapist I have used and tried a long list of various essential oil brands and have bee disappointed on way too many accounts and it honestly lowers your expectations.</li>
            <li>- now I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll need to be buying it again fairly soon.  </li>
            <li>It was so thin that it was more like water than oil</li>
            <li>After opening, if you tip it and feel around the edges, you can feel a little bit of wet if it is not closed as tightly as possible, so make sure the top is on tightly and possibly put it in a ziplock bag to keep the bottle as air tight as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than some of the other brands we&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order from them again in the near future.</li>

            <li>Romance and relaxed social settings</li>
            <li>I have never used essential oils before but have been wanting to try ever since I saw a post about a natural spa bath using essential oils</li>
            <li>I am a very busy person, I am up early, and I really do not stop for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>A pure, 2oz lavender essential oil without any other ingredients.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s about as pure as a watered down bottle of febreeze.</li>
            <li>I made the lavender water and spray a little on my neck when I have a hot flash,  it smells yummy, hot flashes aren&#x27;t so bad anymore.  :-)  </li>
            <li>I have to use much less than with my previous brand-- and comes packaged securely in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>I mixed a handful of sea salt, 10 drops of lavender essential oil and a half cup of baking soda in my hot bath.</li>
            <li>Other than for relaxation, I had read lavender also has medicinal properties, in particular to skin.</li>
            <li>not a very good oil, the fragrance  doesn&#x27;t stay long, very week , very volatile.</li>
            <li>Use a drop of Lavender oil on a shallow cut to stop bleeding, clean wound, and kill bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only real complaint is the top.</li>
            <li>I may see if they have other scent for me to buy since this brand of oil is so pure and scent lasts long.</li>
            <li>Ear aches - Using a warm compress, add a few drops of Lavender oil to the warm, wet compress, and massage the areas around and behind the ears, and the sides of the neck under the jaw-line, following the path starting behind the ear lobes.</li>

            <li>The oil is strong so a little goes a long way, its soothing and really helps calm me down after a long exhausting day.  </li>
            <li>Push the tissue covered ice chip up under the middle of the top lip to the base of the nose and hold as long as comfortable or until the bleeding stops (do not freeze the lip or gum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a little more &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; than some other brands I&#x27;ve used, but not weaker as some less pungent brands are.</li>
            <li>Even though I tried not having any real expectation, I was like a little kid waiting for the mailman to arrive with my box of essential oils</li>
            <li>I started giving this essential oil to her along with another oil and after a few weeks of using this every day, she is down to taking this now every other day and her allergies are tremendously better.  </li>
            <li>Have no opinion on the product of good or bad.</li>

            <li> I use this oil in my diffusers but also I apply a drop or two of it along with a drop or two of Frankincense oil each morning to my freshly washed face, neck, and chest - it is calming, refreshing, and healing for acne and scarring and also works nicely for reducing anxiety and stress.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the box the room  was filled with the most lovely fragrance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there is fine print somewhere, but I didn&#x27;t see it.</li>

            <li> The quality was superb, everything i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I use lavender in my dryer as I love the light fragrance of it.</li>
            <li> I love how they place calls and check up on you to make sure the product is working to its full ability....</li>
            <li> What a difference in the Nature&#x27;s Own Essence product vs. the complimentary bottle.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I had to buy two.</li>
            <li> Some oils are way too strong, this one is light and so much appropriate for my lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is an excellent essential oil and the deep lavender fragrance is superior to many that I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> My boss started looking around for other brands, saw the wonderful reviews on Amazon and gave this one a try.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m excited to learn more.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent of lavender and was excited to try this oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The company provided me with a sample of their lavender oil, and being an true fan of good quality of essential oils, I simply loved this one.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have jumped on the essential oils bandwagon, and I am a happy passenger.  </li>
            <li> It evaporated very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love Lavender essential oil and this bottle comes with a great amount.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and even more fantastic company.</li>
            <li> Yep I&#x27;m a happy customer and will be back for more although it may take a while to use it all.</li>
            <li> I used a quarter ounce in making a a pound of soap and it still smells strong after two months of drying.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is strong.</li>
            <li> But I think the smell is a bit strong, I think it will take time to get used to the sharpness.</li>
            <li> Being someone who has always enjoyed lavender oil, I was pretty excited when I found Nature&#x27;s Own Essence Lavender Oil on Amazon.</li>

            <li> Not only does is have a beautiful lavender aroma but it is comparatively inexpensive.</li>

            <li> one of my favorite uses is to put a few drops onto the dryer balls for my laundry to smell amazing after each drying cycle!</li>
            <li> This is a great brand with a hearty scent that is unique from other brands I have tried-</li>
            <li> Good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It truely works.</li>
            <li> but I  enjoyed this product so much</li>
            <li> I thought that I would have run out, but it is so potent you never need much so that 2oz bottle lasts forever</li>
            <li> The good Lord led me to a person who recommended essential oils, and I purchased lavender for my girl.</li>
            <li> Love the oil, working very well.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance •••so natural ••• my favorite will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> There are many types of lavender and this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Has a TRUE lavender aroma.</li>
            <li> Sweetly Citron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the cost of this item and how much you get with it.</li>
            <li> While I was a bit worried about the fragrance, I have no clue how anyone could say this isn&#x27;t fragrant, it has a very powerful smell that you would expect from fresh oils.</li>
            <li> Premium European Lavender is the best and I am hooked on it moreover, the many uses for Lavender is endless.</li>
            <li> Lavender is my favorite scent of all the essential oils, and I was thrilled to find a bit larger bottle at a reasonable price from Nature&#x27;s Own Essence!  </li>
            <li> Great value for such large size.</li>
            <li> Received the lavender oil quickly.</li>

            <li> Great product, scent is soft and natural.</li>

            <li> I enjoy about Nature&#x27;s Own Essence Lavender Essential Oil</li>
            <li> It has helped my ADHD son replace his medicine, &amp; my mildly OCD son to break those habits.</li>
            <li> A tiny drop on my hands makes them feel amazing - smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> Until I make those soaps, I learned I can add Essential oils to cleaning products to make my home smell nice, and, it will also help me enjoy my cleaning.  </li>
            <li> One of the first signs of cheap, synthetic oils is a plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> very much for this product!</li>
            <li> And most important, it does not provide the calming relief that genuine organic lavender (i.e. French Lavender) does.  </li>
            <li> At many levels, lavender oils and diffusing lavender into the room can help promote calm, restful nights and actually help a person regain some life energy by gaining sleep that is more restful.  </li>
            <li> I feel very satisfied with this company especially knowing they offer a GUARANTEE on their product.</li>
            <li> Good quality essential oil, but I could have done without all the subsequent emails from Nature&#x27;s Own Essence.</li>
            <li> A few drops in my wash makes my sheets smell beautiful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the most clean, straight up, pure lavender scent I have found.</li>

            <li> Smells strong, and this oil really seems to work well on my skin.</li>

            <li> suggest this as your first choice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of lavender, this is my favorite by far!  </li>
            <li> I am not calling it a &amp;#34;miracle worker&amp;#34; but it is a lovely natural product that I would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> and it helps keep them happy little campers.</li>

            <li> My family are enjoying using natural remedies in the house.  </li>
            <li> I have been using another lavender essential oil for some time now and have really liked it.</li>

            <li> I actually have another brand of lavender by a more expensive, superior company where the oil is better than Nature&#x27;s Own Essence.</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Own Essence makes the purest and longest-lasting essential oil products that there are.</li>
            <li> Their Myrrh, Frankincense, Tea Tree, Lavender and Eucalyptus essential oils are all incredible, and the price defies the quality of the product entirely.</li>
            <li> Useful in crowded areas like planes or subways to carve out your own personal oasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lavender is an essential oil that can uplift your life (and mood), heal, and entice in a variety of ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review, and I hope that it has been helpful regarding some of the usages and benefits of Lavender Oil.her skin irritations are often effectively treated with therapeutic-grade Lavender oil.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> was given this product for a deep discount to give my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> My favorite way to use lavender oil is in my dryer on wool balls.makes clothing smell great,and the smell lasts along time with no harsh chemicals</li>

            <li> Well I was impressed and decided to do a little research to see exactly what else I could do with this all natural extract.  </li>
            <li> It does not have a pure clean smell of lavender.  </li>
            <li> The seller has been good about sending notes on other uses I had not considered.</li>
            <li> If your other oils are this good</li>

            <li> so I slipped right on in.</li>
            <li> Oil came right on time after ordering it.  </li>

            <li> Have only used in my diffuser so far, loving it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a true Lavender scent - sometimes I just take the top off the bottle and take in a whiff of it - helps me relax but also perks me up too</li>
            <li> Placing a few drops of Lavender in your fountain can kill bacteria and promote a nice, balanced, calm atmosphere while keeping the water fresh and free of microbes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Improve concentration - Because of its ability to stabilize mood, reduce anxieties, and help calm the nervous system, Lavender has been reported by many to help improve the ability to concentrate by reducing other symptoms that can distract thought and provide the ability to focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I use it pretty much everywhere.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell amazing at first but the nice aroma last a while, when other oils tend to smell soapy and off.</li>

            <li> Very fragrant but not in an over powering way.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied..thank you.</li>
            <li> I also put few drops of Lavender on own home made shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was forwarded several bottles of Natures Own Essence Lavender Essential Oil to review.</li>
            <li> Although doTerra claims you can take their essential oils internally, Natures Own Essence does not recommend this with their products.</li>
            <li> Lavender Oil is by far my favorite of all Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m NOT suggesting you start replacing your medicine, for natural products !!!</li>
            <li> I will be buying my lavender oil direct from this company from now on!!!</li>
            <li> I use lavender as a sleep aid by enjoying the scent for a few moments right before bedtime.</li>
            <li> Winding down before bed as an adult or assisting with sleep disorders - Many adults suffer from sleep disturbances and sleep disorders that range from mild to severe.  </li>
            <li> After surgery pain relief - Although there have been more reported testimonials, one study done on biopsy patients (reported at the University of Maryland Medical Center) for after surgery pain relief showed significant pain decrease in patients who received oxygen with Lavender aromatherapy versus those who just received oxygen without aromatherapy in post-operative scenarios.&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is a great product; very concentrated, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other brands.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite place it, but it&#x27;s not as enjoyable to smell as other lavender oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I have provided a list of some of the many uses for Lavender Oil, for myself and other readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  SOME OF THESE REMEDIES,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gone to L&#x27;Occitane and other places that sell lavender room sprays to see if they smell better</li>
            <li> Much more concentrate than other brands.</li>
            <li> so I was so excited when I finally ordered the bottle</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize it had so many other uses.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for high quality, 100% pure, undiluted lavender oil, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> Very concentrated so only need a few drops to create lovely strong smell.  </li>
            <li> I use lavender oil in many ways - several drops on my CPAP filter at bedtime, to calm my dog during thunderstorms using several drops rubbed on my hands to pet him, several drops mixed with distilled water for refreshing wrinkled clothes (using a travel size spray bottle), as examples.  </li>
            <li> Mixed with Jojoba Oil for my body, with water as a air-freshener, in laundry and clean tables and counters.</li>
            <li> This amazing Lavender Essential Oil is in my cabinet for all minor skin irritations and my spa needs.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s perfect for my night routine: I put a few drops into a small fabric pillow and place it a bit away from my bed on a night stand.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> can also use it to clean cuts, open wounds and bug bites.&lt;br /&gt;You get an email with all kinds of uses for this product</li>
            <li> Just a little of this oil in the warmer filled my foyer, living room and dining room with a light refreshing fragrance without being over-whelming and lasts for a few days.  </li>
            <li> While the company went out of their way with information and the thick glass bottle, the top to the essential oils itself is a very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I have recently started buying a lot of different essential oil products and so far have had really great results come from them.</li>
            <li> Find myself opening the top and taking a few whiffs every time I pass by it sitting on my nightstand and an immediate positive feeling.</li>
            <li> - clearly they know much about the benefits of lavender!  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll try the Sweet Orange next.</li>
            <li> I would said that it seems working, he falls asleep faster and has average 1 hour more  sleep per night.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a oil that was 100% natural and not diluted so was relieved to read the label and find it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Relief of minor asthmatic and bronchial spasms - Many people suffer from minor asthmatic and acute bronchial spasms leading to some bronchitis (inflammation of the bronchial tubes) from pollens, bacteria and other allergens or pathogens.</li>
            <li> Relief of minor asthmatic and bronchial spasms - Many people suffer from minor asthmatic and acute bronchial spasms leading to some bronchitis (inflammation of the bronchial tubes) from pollens, bacteria and other allergens or pathogens.</li>
            <li> This is the first oil you can apply directly onto the skin.  </li>
            <li> I am not an essential oil expert, I just know this lavender oil smells great and the scent lasts a long long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very new to the whole essential oil thing - but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how effective they are for so many little daily  irritations that you just never realized were bugging you until they stop.  </li>
            <li> But that is my fault for not reading the fine print of the details where it clearly states that price is for ONE bottle only.</li>
            <li> Repellent-I live in a very humid place, which means lots of mosquitoes and such.&lt;br /&gt;Helps with nerve and anxiety issues.&lt;br /&gt;Acne</li>
            <li> and I would definitely purchase more bottles in the future.</li>
            <li> It is difficult at times when purchasing online to be sure you will be satisfied without having the item in your hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever used any essential oil, so the emails from the company giving advice and suggestions for uses are very much appreciated!</li>

            <li> I have some empty bottles, a dropper from one of them should fit.</li>
            <li> For my Younger daughter, I put a drop of this around her nose at night to calm her</li>
            <li> Essential oil is exactly as described and I will definitely be ordering more of this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> This is by FAR my favorite lavender oil on Amazon, hands down.</li>
            <li> Some natural medicinal doctors (NMDs) have used therapeutic-grade Lavender oils and baths in conjunction with other oils such as tea tree oil to effectively kill these parasites that burrow under the skin, lay eggs, and cause allergic irritations and dermatitis.  </li>

            <li> Sometimes the smells are not quite right with different brands.</li>
            <li> I dab a little on my temples before bed to help relax and I&#x27;ve also used a little in my laundry to leave my clothes sleeping great.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers that it does smell kind of strange.</li>
            <li> Minor rashes, dryness, and other skin irritations are often effectively treated with therapeutic-grade Lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish they would have other oils available.</li>
            <li> This is a new oil we added to our inventory and we are going to use it a lot.  </li>

            <li> My first experience with essential oil, but no complaints here.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I then mixed two drops of peppermint oil in my hot chocolate.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly the same as the lavender that I&#x27;ve bought in the store, but for the price and burning purposes it works.</li>
            <li> Recommend as a natural solution!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> Finally found a brand that I really like !</li>
            <li> Most commonly known for its relaxing effects on the body, therapeutic-grade lavender has been highly regarded for the skin.  </li>
            <li> have a special needs sister that has a lot of emotional issues, and I was told to try to use lavender essential oil on her.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> of the box the small plastic sleeve was wet with lavender--not good.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is just right, not too strong and not too weak.</li>
            <li> My only real concern was it seemed pretty inexpensive for undiluted essential oil.</li>
            <li> This one is fresher and crisper, with an almost sweet fullness that the other one lacks.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s definitely less stressed, and actually gets better sleep at night.</li>
            <li> i love the size it is available in; larger than other other bottles of essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using this for any skin problems but seems to work fine for relaxation when I put a few drops in a bucket just to soak my feet.</li>
            <li> I have used two other lavender oils in the past and both were superior.</li>
            <li> 100% pure essential lavender oil.</li>
            <li> Skin infections caused by fungus like candidiasis are often treated with topical applications of pure Lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it must be therapeutic grade that it pure enough for ingestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin infections caused by fungus like candidiasis are often treated with topical applications of pure Lavender oil.    </li>
            <li> However, it must be therapeutic grade that it pure enough for ingestion.    </li>
            <li> Pure and simple.</li>
            <li> Pure essential oil - I did a blot test.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this English Lavender oil - it smells quite different from other lavender oil I bought locally.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more once it is gone, although it will last a very long time!</li>
            <li> She has a hard time getting to sleep and with this, she is doing so much better.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few days and already notice a huge difference when I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> I think the scent may actually be more powerful than the expensive brand of lavender oil I have in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel the orifice is far too big, causing too much oil to come out at once.</li>
            <li> The scent alone can remove nervous restlessness and exhaustion, and increase the ability to think clearly.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised.</li>
            <li> use it to sanitize my hands since it&#x27;s a natural antimicrobial agent.</li>
            <li> I use it directly on my hands and feet as well.  </li>
            <li> Not knowing (or caring) that I shouldn&#x27;t have applied eucalyptus oil directly to my skin, I did.</li>
            <li> ADVETTISING.IT IS 100% NATURAL</li>
            <li> Sometimes, on a busy day, just a sniff of the oil itself helps.</li>
            <li> This Lavender Essential Oil is very camphor and leaves a plastic-like after tone.</li>
            <li> It is all about how much you like it or not and this essential oil gets both thumbs up because I LIKE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
            <li> Using it as a natural spider repellant since I have two young children and a parrot.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the Young Life line, but there weren&#x27;t any that were Prime eligible, so I decided to try this instead.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get eaten alive and carried away by the Alaskan mosquitos, per some of the suggestions and reviews here.</li>
            <li> Helping young children prepare for</li>

            <li> I have sleeping problems and tried some on my pillowcase and so far seems to work well.</li>
            <li> As a side note, the wild orange has also helped her in terms of sadness (anxiety and depression are linked).</li>
            <li> I bought the oil for someone else, and as far as I know it is being well used.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit like old rancid oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied this oil directly to skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has multiple uses and benefits for the whole family.</li>
            <li> also use it on our wool dryer balls to naturally scent our laundry.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I have recently developed (eczema, dermatitis, psoriasis or just an allergy), but so far the oil seems to be helping as the spots have reduced in size and the itching is not as pronounced.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> if you are going to get any essential oils I really recommend getting Lavender Oil.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft after just 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I was wondering if I was addicted to it, so last night I didn&#x27;t use it, I slept good.</li>
            <li> I also add a drop or two to the amount of  body base cream/lotion that I need to put on my body and it makes me smell sooo smell delicious</li>
            <li> and it had very little fragrance which disappeared very quickly.</li>
            <li> He s autistic and has other issues and this has worked and is amazing.  </li>
            <li> and I always seem to receive less than full bottles</li>
            <li> but the lid was not tight when sent and 1/4 leaked out.</li>
            <li> And immediate relaxation and positive mood enhancement during and  after long 12+ hour days.</li>
            <li> A little of this oil goes a long way and there are too many uses to list here.</li>
            <li> I now even use it in a relaxing bath (for those rare me moments) and add to my shea butter lotion which research has claimed to enhance blood circulation, treat respiratory problems and a host of other health benefits.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product, just received my 4th bottle, I&#x27;m addicted to it and use it for personal care as well as all natural house cleaning products.</li>
            <li> Just put a few drops in a clean spray bottle with water and spray some around your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This time I was looking for a larger quantity at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I liked the amount provided but it seemed less thick like it was diluted too much.</li>
            <li> This IS A High Quality Oil and I will make another purchase when low.</li>
            <li> Still a high quality lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this company and its product, Lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> would have saved LOTS of money from the high prices I paid at a local &amp;#34;Health&amp;#34; store!</li>
            <li> After buying several different brands of lavender scent, I&#x27;ve developed a preference for certain brands.  </li>
            <li> I usually write detailed descriptions of why I rate a product the way I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this essential oils for the last few days and it seems like my husband is sleeping better.</li>
            <li> I have discontinued applying the eucalyptus oil to my skin, but even last night  when awakened by an allergy triggered headache, I applied the other 2 oils directly to my upper lip and forehead and was able to get back to sleep in under an hour.</li>
            <li> When using with a diffuser the fragrance is weak even when using far more than the directions state.</li>
            <li> Not only can Lavender be used by the drop in a relaxing bath, but it can also be mixed with pure bath salts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only can Lavender be used by the drop in a relaxing bath, but it can also be mixed with pure bath salts    </li>
            <li> I have tried several types and different companies over the past 16 years of practice and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Opening the bottle and taking a whiff, it does have a slight camphor note, but once it is used properly, you have that familiar smell of lavender.</li>
            <li> However the last batch I bought, along with a new look to the packaging, seems to have also gone downhill in quality...</li>
            <li> Essential oil being the new thing when I offered I had to try it.</li>
            <li> I actually put (1/3) less essential oil than the recipe called for - but it was more than enough.</li>
            <li> - Pure therapeutic grade Lavender oil used as a body deodorant kills bacteria that causes body odors and can be used with other applications as natural body</li>
            <li> - Pure therapeutic grade Lavender oil used as a body deodorant kills bacteria that causes body odors and can be used with other applications as natural body deodorants.    </li>
            <li> I use this lavender oil during am personal care in a total body hot towel scrub and  also place it on cotton balls and place it around in various rooms.</li>
            <li> Compared to other essential oils of this grade, it is easy to tell which essential oils are actually infusing fragrance into their product.</li>
            <li> The price is a little higher than other oils, but the quality of this oil makes well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A drop in the hollow of the throat before bed causes me to drop off quickly and sleep solidly for several hours longer than I&#x27;d done in quite a while.  </li>
            <li> It is lightly scented and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I diffuse in the family room where my pups are to keep them calm during the fireworks at the 4th of July, add a few drops to my coconut oil for a moisturizer and have a room spritzer in the bedroom.</li>
            <li> So far, I only use to help me sleep.</li>
            <li> I have only tried your lavender so far</li>
            <li> Since it is one of the few things that help my migraines, however, I really wanted to try this lavender  oil since it really would save me quite a bit of money in essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I am atempting to use natural products for my personal well-being</li>
            <li> The flow is fast so be careful when pouring.</li>
            <li> It came in a dark glass bottle to keep the quality of the oil and includes a dropper so I can get the exact amount I want each time without making a mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, received what expected.</li>
            <li> I have not had a cold but can already see that this would be good this winter to help my congestion.</li>
            <li> As a massage therapist I have used and tried a long list of various essential oil brands and have bee disappointed on way too many accounts and it honestly lowers your expectations.</li>
            <li> - now I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll need to be buying it again fairly soon.  </li>
            <li> It was so thin that it was more like water than oil</li>
            <li> After opening, if you tip it and feel around the edges, you can feel a little bit of wet if it is not closed as tightly as possible, so make sure the top is on tightly and possibly put it in a ziplock bag to keep the bottle as air tight as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better than some of the other brands we&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order from them again in the near future.</li>

            <li> Romance and relaxed social settings</li>
            <li> I have never used essential oils before but have been wanting to try ever since I saw a post about a natural spa bath using essential oils</li>
            <li> I am a very busy person, I am up early, and I really do not stop for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> A pure, 2oz lavender essential oil without any other ingredients.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s about as pure as a watered down bottle of febreeze.</li>
            <li> I made the lavender water and spray a little on my neck when I have a hot flash,  it smells yummy, hot flashes aren&#x27;t so bad anymore.  :-)  </li>
            <li> I have to use much less than with my previous brand-- and comes packaged securely in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I mixed a handful of sea salt, 10 drops of lavender essential oil and a half cup of baking soda in my hot bath.</li>
            <li> Other than for relaxation, I had read lavender also has medicinal properties, in particular to skin.</li>
            <li> not a very good oil, the fragrance  doesn&#x27;t stay long, very week , very volatile.</li>
            <li> Use a drop of Lavender oil on a shallow cut to stop bleeding, clean wound, and kill bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only real complaint is the top.</li>
            <li> I may see if they have other scent for me to buy since this brand of oil is so pure and scent lasts long.</li>
            <li> Ear aches - Using a warm compress, add a few drops of Lavender oil to the warm, wet compress, and massage the areas around and behind the ears, and the sides of the neck under the jaw-line, following the path starting behind the ear lobes.</li>

            <li> The oil is strong so a little goes a long way, its soothing and really helps calm me down after a long exhausting day.  </li>
            <li> Push the tissue covered ice chip up under the middle of the top lip to the base of the nose and hold as long as comfortable or until the bleeding stops (do not freeze the lip or gum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little more &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; than some other brands I&#x27;ve used, but not weaker as some less pungent brands are.</li>
            <li> Even though I tried not having any real expectation, I was like a little kid waiting for the mailman to arrive with my box of essential oils</li>
            <li> I started giving this essential oil to her along with another oil and after a few weeks of using this every day, she is down to taking this now every other day and her allergies are tremendously better.  </li>
            <li> Have no opinion on the product of good or bad.</li>
            <li> Much of it had leaked out due to the loose cap.  </li>
            <li> The product appears overpriced compared to the other offers.  </li>

            <li> Evenings are delegated to organization meetings, and when I come home late, I clean the kitchen, do the laundry and any other housework that is necessary.  </li>
            <li> The company that sold the diffuser sent a small bottler of pure lavender oil along with it.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks small but it contains a large amount of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally up, and down all night long, and end up dragging all day, and have to nap often.</li>

            <li> It works beautifully on sun burns, scapes, scabs, migraines, insect bites and even a repellent.</li>
            <li> I think this bottle will be lasting a LONG time!</li>
            <li> Place a few drops near the affected areas, nasal passages, temples, forehead, back of the neck, between the eyes (but NOT in the eyes).  </li>

            <li> My husband definitely prefers lavender over the other two essential oils!</li>
            <li> Both subjects massaged the scalp daily for 7 months, whereas only half used essential lavender oil during the massage.  </li>
            <li> now apply a little to my neck before retiring, even though the directions on the bottle say not to apply directly to the skin.</li>

            <li> Lavender can be used to help alleviate symptoms of minor motion sickness.  </li>
            <li> I had been suffering insomnia for a long time.</li>
            <li> However if you have pets, especially cats, be careful using it around them as it can be toxic to them.</li>
            <li> use it for any minor skin irritations and discomfort.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have been hearing a lot about the benefits of using essential oils as opposed to other things like medications and chemical filled products for everyday life situations over the past couple of years, but I was a bit skeptical because the first time I heard about them was from a pushy salesperson</li>
            <li> have other essential oils</li>
            <li> Use it mixed into some other oils for moisturizing and relaxation.</li>
            <li> And, I don&#x27;t understand why I can ingest other brands&#x27; lavender essential oil, but not his brand&#x27;s ??</li>
            <li> I can only compare it to other lavender oils that I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> I rubbed a little on the back of my neck actually and within an hour my head ache was gone</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I also got the lemongrass and that stays for several days.</li>
            <li> Also works well for dry and chapped hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dry eyes and tear ducts</li>
            <li> Dry eyes and tear ducts</li>
            <li> I also make some drips some in dry flowers for some aroma in the restrooms.</li>
            <li> also drop some in my dryer balls when I dry clothes.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my temples when I get headaches and it seems to help sooth and quiet down my headaches.</li>
            <li> Lavender is the one essential oil that everyone should have, it alone replaces hundreds of items and this brand will not let you down.</li>
            <li> You can tell from the moment you open the bottle this is a quality product that has not been watered down like others I have found.</li>
            <li> She uses it for cuts, bug bites, and other minor skin abrasions.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how anyone can say this little bottle last forever, I have been using this for about 2 months now</li>
            <li> and we haven&#x27;t slept this well in a long time!!!</li>
            <li> So far, I have not had any negative reactions to this product</li>
            <li> Quality product, carefully packaged.</li>
            <li> As someone who makes soaps and candles, I have tried quite a few essential oils over the years.</li>
            <li> I has been putting 2 or 3 drops or oil on the bed sheet for the last few nights.  </li>
            <li> This oil is everything I expected.  </li>
            <li> - rubbing a few drops on the temples and / or on the back of the neck or trapezius muscles</li>
            <li> LAST TWO THAT I HAVE LISTED CALL FOR A FEW DROPS ON THE TONGUE</li>
            <li> - rubbing a few drops on the temples and / or on the back of the neck or trapezius muscles</li>
            <li> It only take a few drops.</li>
            <li> Mixed a few drops of this with alcohol and water for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to put a few drops of the lavender essential oil on the bottoms of our pillows and see how it helped.</li>
            <li> We mixed a few drops of this in jojoba oil</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> THE LAST TWO THAT I HAVE LISTED CALL FOR A FEW DROPS ON THE TONGUE - BE VERY CAREFUL AND READ THE LABEL ON THE LAVENDER OIL BOTTLE TO MAKE</li>
            <li> Like other oils, I do need to replenish my &#x27;air fresheners&#x27; (cotton balls in a bowl) every other week, but, it is doing what I expected so</li>
            <li> After having purchased several bottles of this previously perfect lavender oil, I am sad to say the newest bottle (with new/different labeling) smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> A few drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Will order other oils.</li>
            <li> Not please with their photo representing multiple bottles when the order is for one small bottle.  </li>
            <li> It has a hint of eucalyptus or other unidentifiable smell that distorts the lavender scent.  </li>
            <li> I tried about 3 other brands, all of which smelled medicinal and synthetic.  </li>
            <li> Extremely fragrant lavender scent in a generous bottle.</li>
            <li> When I get to the point of needing other oils, I will try this brand again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need to keep it in mind for the other things you can use it for.  </li>
            <li> I saw online that lavender wards off silverfish and a myriad of other pests.</li>
            <li> I do NOT believe in sleeping pills or any other sleep aid and</li>
            <li> so if I do not get a necessary amount of sleep, I am unconstructive and I usually wake with a headache.  </li>
            <li> Some studies have shown that aromatherapy and other Lavender oil use can help reduce agitation for aging patients who experience agitation and irritability due to dementia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other skin blemishes:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually some distilled water with rubbing alcohol (or vodka) and drops of essential oils that you shake up in a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have ordered&lt;br /&gt;it several times in the past and will continue to buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> I can not wait to try the Lavender Oil in other ways from headaches to using the product on my four legged babies.</li>
            <li> I will not try again any other brand.</li>
            <li> My daughter has used other oils before, both for her hair and bathing</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>

            <li> This one was disappointing to put it mildly.  </li>
            <li> The scent lasts longer, too, which indicates to me that it is less diluted than other</li>
            <li> It comes in a dark brown protective 2 oz.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find anything negative about this essential oil!</li>
            <li> I often react poorly (side effects), and now I&#x27;m exploring natural options.</li>
            <li> Feels almost  quite watered down.  </li>
            <li> I have been adding this to the rinse cycle of wash, rubbing down sore muscles, applying to neck and wrist at night.  </li>
            <li> I have used almost half bottle.</li>
            <li> I am not a Dr., therefore if you have any questions about this you can ask your Dr before taking any essential oils if you are uncomfortable with it as everyone&#x27;s body reacts differently.  </li>
            <li> It oddly, appeared somewhere on the list of sprays and remedies for fleas and ticks.  </li>
            <li> so perhaps it is not a fair comparison but simply a preference.  </li>
            <li> However, it should be tested on small areas and even diluted for some skin types, as it can be a little irritating for very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Smells like Lavender, I could do with a little less emailing from the company though.</li>
            <li> However, after to speaking with some reliable sources as well as doing a little research, I decided to take the plunge into the world of oils.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance... use minimal 1-2 drops in Diffuser as it is very strong. 3-4 drops is very medicinal.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> My first experience with essential oil, but no complaints here. The oil has a very nice fragrance and seems to last a long time. Smells great in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> So relaxing to smell...use in the tub.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have jumped on the essential oils bandwagon, and I am a happy passenger.  I have been hearing a lot about the benefits of using essential oils as opposed to other things like medications and chemical filled products for everyday life situations over the past couple of years, but I was a bit skeptical because the first time I heard about them was from a pushy salesperson and I just didn&#x27;t trust the hype.  However, after to speaking with some reliable sources as well as doing a little research, I decided to take the plunge into the world of oils.  I started with Nature&#x27;s Own Essence Lavender Oil because I have terrible trouble relaxing and sleeping and I figured what better way to start my journey than with the oil that helps with that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after doing research I found that all you have to do to help promote sleep with lavender oil is put a few drops on some tissue and tuck it under your pillow or use a diffuser.  Well, I don&#x27;t own a diffuser, so tissue it is.  A few drops and I can smell this oil all night.  I love it.  I can definitely see a difference in myself while using this oil.  I actually feel more calm and relaxed when I go to bed which allows for better sleep.  I also wanted to try this oil because it has benefits such as the following:&lt;br /&gt;Bug Repellent-I live in a very humid place, which means lots of mosquitoes and such.&lt;br /&gt;Helps with nerve and anxiety issues.&lt;br /&gt;Acne-Yes, although I&#x27;m grown, I still have a breakout from makeup every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;Pain Relief-I get horrible neck and back muscle pains from time to time and I&#x27;m not one of those people who can tolerate meds very well.&lt;br /&gt;General Skin Care-It&#x27;s said to be antifungal and antiseptic-helps with wrinkles and is also used to speed up the healing of cuts and burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh also, I plan to add it to some wool dryer balls I have which was suggested by a friend to help with the laundry.  Can&#x27;t wait to try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really enjoying the qualityof Nature&#x27;s Own Essence Lavender Essential Oil.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.  However, all opinions are my own and unbiased.</li>
            <li> This Lavender is absolutely amazing...use it everyday in bath, making skin care products, in the diffuser.  Almost out already as I literally use it for almost everything it could ever be used for!</li>
            <li> Smells very good, not sweet like some. Very nice and relaxing in a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase. It is a great value and of high quality. I plan to purchase more essential oils from this company.</li>
            <li> Recieved this yesterday! I used it last night and loved it!! So very excited to use it in my daily life! I cannot thank you enough for the speedy delivery and the wonderful product!! So highly thrilled!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough Essential oil. I use lavender at bedtime in the house. On Sundays for a relaxing effect. In the car to make rides home calm and soothing. I love my lavender existential oil! Smells so so so good.</li>
            <li> Great quality. And affordable :-)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Using it for myself as well as a scent for my homemade eye pillows for my family and clients as x-mas gifts!!</li>
            <li> Lavender essentials are great for helping my husband sleep. I wasn&#x27;t always a believer nor did I like the smell of lavender. My husband has a hard time falling and staying asleep. We have changed mattresses, pillows, changed sleep schedules, etc., and nothing seemed to help. So after doing my research on essential oils I decided to give it a shot. Lavender essential oil in particular is great for stress relief, winding down, and helping you sleep. I&#x27;ve used this essential oils for the last few days and it seems like my husband is sleeping better. I will say I was skeptical in using it since as I mentioned, I typically dislike lavender scented products but this smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t cause me to have a headache. I will continue to use it with my husband and I am believer that it works. I also want to mention that when I received my bottles, they were FULL to the top. The reason I mention this is because I have ordered many essential oils and I always seem to receive less than full bottles so it&#x27;s great these are really filled to the top. You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth! Disclosure: I received this product for free or discounted to facilitate this review. The opinions expressed remain 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This oil is has a very strong lavender smell to it.  Unlike others I have tried they just have a faint smell, this one works and I would definitely purchase more bottles in the future.</li>
            <li> Love the product !!!!  The company is a real pleasure to deal with, the best !!!</li>
            <li> amazing value, great quality lavender essential oil</li>
            <li> Excellent oil with long lasting aroma.</li>
            <li> After having purchased several bottles of this previously perfect lavender oil, I am sad to say the newest bottle (with new/different labeling) smells terrible.  I was a loyal &amp; happy Nature&amp;#34;s Own customer, but now will have to look elsewhere for oils.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrant of lavender in the house, thus keep lavender oil in the house. This bottle is 100% pure that makes it valuable.  It comes in a dark brown protective 2 oz. bottle.  The label is so beautiful that anyone looks at it could feel the calming effect.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Received the order swiftly and the product is lovely.  Also appreciated the summary they e-mailed me telling me about the product. Will definitely be ordering more oils from them.</li>
            <li> Lavender oil is widely known for its many properties so I decided to try it. It does feel good on my skin (just keep away from eyes) and smells nice. I tried it as a bug repellant when I jog---no bugs bothered me. When I did get a bite (I wasn&#x27;t wearing the lavender oil then!), I used it to soothe the sting. I have not had a cold but can already see that this would be good this winter to help my congestion. The seller has been good about sending notes on other uses I had not considered. Good product and considerate seller--would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help my daughter sleep through the night since I bought a diffuser for my tea tree oil and four thieves oil. My husband definitely prefers lavender over the other two essential oils! I put in few drops in and it works like a charm for all of us not just my daughter.</li>
            <li> Excellent with wool dryer balls, resulting in fabulous scented laundry.</li>
            <li> Being new to the use of essential oils, I was pleased with the fresh aroma that did not overwhelm the smell senses.  A seriously good product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love all the uses and the ideas shared about the different oils.</li>
            <li> Wonderful in the bath and on the wrists for relaxation and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I bought it for help sleeping.  I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s a God-send; but it might be helping some.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I use the oil everynight on my pillow as well as my children&#x27;s. I will order again!</li>
            <li> Good price and works just as well as higher priced oils</li>
            <li> Not sure about it yet.I have only used it twice but it seems to have a lot of alcohol smell to it.I ordered it to make my own spray for pillows in the bed at night and have not done this yet.I expected more oil I guess and have not ordered this before so this may be how it is.</li>
            <li> So many uses for this stuff....but my go to use is sleep aid! I put a drop on the bottom of each foot at night before bed and sleep like a BABY! Huge difference in how deeply I slept from night 1 of using this.</li>
            <li> Premium European Lavender is the best and I am hooked on it moreover, the many uses for Lavender is endless.</li>
            <li> Great oil, using it in our diffuser, humidifier, laundry &amp; bath smells great, good price.</li>
            <li> Received the lavender oil quickly. Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> So far, I only use to help me sleep. I am experience very stressful time, and I do not want to use anti-anxiety medicine too much.  It helps, it smell good, and last long time. You can use it as perfuse, can not go wrong.</li>
            <li> The Nature&#x27;s Own Essence Lavender Oil has a pure and pleasing Lavender aroma.  I applied it sparingly to selected spots on the soles of my feet and have enjoyed a relaxing night&#x27;s sleep.  I also put two drops on a cottonball and rubbed two spots on my pillow.  The scent is mild and has lasted for four days.  The &#x27;dropper cap&#x27; eliminates waste and spills.  Great price for a two ounce bottle.  Your delivery was prompt and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;Please inform me how I obtain the &amp;#34;FREE Bonus eBook Lavender Oil: Nature&#x27;s #1 Health Booster&amp;#34; as no information was contained in the packaging.</li>
            <li> Helped calm my nerves while dealing with shingles</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this essential oil product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I made my own linen spray and I also use it in my diffuser. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product and a wonderful company. I ordered this oil along with a diffuser. The company that sold the diffuser sent a small bottler of pure lavender oil along with it. What a difference in the Nature&#x27;s Own Essence product vs. the complimentary bottle. This oil is amazing and worth every penny. It has a pure fragrance with no added perfumes. It is long lasting and will permeate your home with relaxing lavender essence. If you are looking for a company to purchase your essential oils from, look no further and buy with confidence. Excellent product and excellent customer service. It is difficult at times when purchasing online to be sure you will be satisfied without having the item in your hands. Nature&#x27;s Own Essence will not disappoint you and will be very responsive IF you should have any issues. They have made a customer for life!</li>
            <li> I thought that 3 came with the order because of the picture :(</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Love its price even more! Great quality at an affordable price.  Essential oil is exactly as described and I will definitely be ordering more of this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> Great huge value, high quality oil in a brown glass container with a dropper inside. I use this daily to calm and relax my self. I think this bottle will be lasting a LONG time!</li>
            <li> I have been making goat milk soap &amp; hard lotion bars for bettysbestsoaps. I was using Edens &amp; YL essential oils. I have only tried your lavender so far but I am sold. If your other oils are this good you have a customer for life. I do gave one question. If your oils are therapeutic grade why can&#x27;t they be used internally. YL gives recipes for their oils for medicinal uses to be ingested. Their big selling reason is because their oils are therapeutic grade so they can be taken internally. The price for YL is so expensive compared to yours, just wondering if this is the reason why.</li>
            <li> Just not a fan of the smell.  It seems like there is a waft of alcohol but I&#x27;m not entirely sure.  I&#x27;ve had lavendar essential oil from Doterra and Plant Therapy and prefer those over this.  I know that the origin of this lavendar is different than that of Doterra so perhaps it is not a fair comparison but simply a preference.  I use it to scent my dryer balls.</li>
            <li> Quality product, carefully packaged.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping, and great product!</li>
            <li> I love using this for spray for all my pillows and bedding!! Love it.. love it.. love it...</li>
            <li> Great quality lavender oil.</li>
            <li> This lavender smells wonderful, fresher than the lavenders I usually buy. I was happily surprised. The scent lasts longer, too, which indicates to me that it is less diluted than other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> smells so wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Not only are the promoting a legit product. The customer service they provide is outstanding. It just might be the greatest customer service I&#x27;ve ever encountered!! They will do everything to make you happy. I will absolutely be shopping with you guys again!&lt;br /&gt;Oh and btw I got the lavender, looooovvvveeee it. I put a couple drops on the top of my bed, I sleep like a baby. So relaxing .</li>
            <li> We bought this for making playdough for my granddaughter because it is supposed to be calming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not smell like lavender, we have many lavender plants in our yard, I have lavender scented things, we know what lavender smells liek and this has zero lavender scent to it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells of nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried using it again in a skin scrub and there is no scent when you open the bottle, none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have other essential oils and they all smell like they should, this one though has no scent that I, or anyone else, can detect.</li>
            <li> This Lavender oil smells great. I use it on my pillow and also mix it with my skin lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It puts me in a peaceful, calming state.</li>
            <li> This lavender is the real deal.  Its potent with true lavender smell.</li>
            <li> This Lavender Oil is wonderful! Not only does is have a beautiful lavender aroma but it is comparatively inexpensive. I will definitely buy this again. I think I&#x27;ll try the Sweet Orange next. Thank you Nature&#x27;s Own for a great affordable EO.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help bring about great aromatic smells in a house filled with 2 large pedigree dogs (mastiffs) and 2 sport active teenage boys (over 6ft tall).  Just a little of this oil in the warmer filled my foyer, living room and dining room with a light refreshing fragrance without being over-whelming and lasts for a few days.  Those of you who may be sensitive to smells like me that may get an instant headache from strong sweet-smelling odors that can not take pungent perfumes will find this oil an excellent product. Well I was impressed and decided to do a little research to see exactly what else I could do with this all natural extract.  I now even use it in a relaxing bath (for those rare me moments) and add to my shea butter lotion which research has claimed to enhance blood circulation, treat respiratory problems and a host of other health benefits.  This is definitely an essential product that no home should be without so add to your list and be prepared to release, refresh and relax.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil!</li>
            <li> did not work as well as thought</li>
            <li> As someone who makes soaps and candles, I have tried quite a few essential oils over the years. Being someone who has always enjoyed lavender oil, I was pretty excited when I found Nature&#x27;s Own Essence Lavender Oil on Amazon. My only real concern was it seemed pretty inexpensive for undiluted essential oil. Since it is one of the few things that help my migraines, however, I really wanted to try this lavender  oil since it really would save me quite a bit of money in essential oils.  Even though I tried not having any real expectation, I was like a little kid waiting for the mailman to arrive with my box of essential oils (I ordered their peppermint too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box, I had a sigh of relief since I saw it in a glass bottle. One of the first signs of cheap, synthetic oils is a plastic bottle. As well, the bottle was almost filled to the brim with wonderful smelling lavender oil. While I was a bit worried about the fragrance, I have no clue how anyone could say this isn&#x27;t fragrant, it has a very powerful smell that you would expect from fresh oils. I think the scent may actually be more powerful than the expensive brand of lavender oil I have in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is the top. While the company went out of their way with information and the thick glass bottle, the top to the essential oils itself is a very cheap plastic. After opening, if you tip it and feel around the edges, you can feel a little bit of wet if it is not closed as tightly as possible, so make sure the top is on tightly and possibly put it in a ziplock bag to keep the bottle as air tight as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am not thrilled about that one packaging issue, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the oil itself. I already have it in one of the diffusers in my house and preparing for some spring cleaning. If you are looking for high quality, 100% pure, undiluted lavender oil, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.or a discounted price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of lavender oil.. and am using this mixed with water as&lt;br /&gt;a hydrating spray for my face before applying moisterizer.  My daughter-in-law&lt;br /&gt;has started using it for my grandson&#x27;s athelete&#x27;s feet..)-: hope it helps!&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for a diffuser to heat the oil in also...&lt;br /&gt;thankyou very much for this product!</li>
            <li> Feeling relaxed after inhaling and applying on my body.</li>
            <li> Wonderful in the bath.  Burnt my hand the other day,(Steam burn not to bad, but it hurt and stung) put this on the burn and it was gone in a few hours.  Used in rinse of laundry, light smell, perfect.  Put in spray bottle with water, scents house/bedding nice.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used Lavender for a long time but I recently had a chance to get some Nature&#x27;s Own Essence Lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love not only the fragrance but the amazing number of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company also gives an Ebook with every purchase of it&#x27;s Lavender and I learned a heck of a lot how to use the oil in ways I never knew about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, high quality, great fragrance and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be getting more of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BB</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this and plan to order more!</li>
            <li> Love the product, I use it religiously every night before I go to sleep. Highly recommended .&lt;br /&gt;I am a repeat customer</li>
            <li> I love lavender oil. It smells really good!</li>
            <li> Awesome and smells so wonderful for all its abundant uses and the customer service communication from the company is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Ordered a bottle for myself and ended up purchasing 3 more for family and friends. Love it and worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I put a couple drops into my rose water toner to help with acne and scarring. It seems to be doing its job because my skin is calming down.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to sanitize my hands since it&#x27;s a natural antimicrobial agent. I put a couple drops and rub. It leaves a nice fragrance. Can get a bit overwhelming for those with sensitive noses though.</li>
            <li> Great essential oil and distributor. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is great! We use it to help sleep calmly and through the night on those stressful days.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my pillow at night to help me sleep.  Wonderful.</li>
            <li> I mix almond oil (85%) with lavender oil (10%) and rosemary oil (5%) to make a bath and shower oil I use on my skin daily.  This lavender oil has so many uses.  Just look up lavender oil and all the uses it has.  I use it directly on my hands and feet as well.  Smells clean and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this for many things. I&#x27;m satisfied with the quality of this Lavender oil!</li>
            <li> I love lavender, I bought this oil to make my own lotion for massage treatment, works perfect.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find a good price on a larger bottle of lavender oil.  I use lavender oil for most of my cleaning products and tend to add more than a few drops because I love the smell!  This bottle is a great value.  Plus the seller sends an occasional usage tip via email.  I love finding new ways to use natural products.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality oil with just a lovely smell. Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> This IS A High Quality Oil and I will make another purchase when low. I use this oil to help with a good nights sleep.</li>
            <li> Great product, scent is soft and natural. Use it mixed into some other oils for moisturizing and relaxation.</li>
            <li> It works for me!I I used a combination of eucalyptus, lavender &amp; peppermint oil for a chronic headache that had been so bad for so long that I was frankly at my wit&#x27;s end. Not knowing (or caring) that I shouldn&#x27;t have applied eucalyptus oil directly to my skin, I did. After inhaling it alone for some time, I applied it to the tips of my fingers, and then to the skin below my nose in combination with the lavender &amp; peppermint oil. Burn~~YES  indeed it did burn, but my headache that I had not been able to relieve by ANY means for years, was gone within minutes. Now, I cannot advise that you do that, but I can tell you that when you&#x27;ve reached the place of total desperation that I&#x27;d been with these headaches and achieved relief, you&#x27;ll not only continue that use, but be wiling to pass it along. I have discontinued applying the eucalyptus oil to my skin, but even last night  when awakened by an allergy triggered headache, I applied the other 2 oils directly to my upper lip and forehead and was able to get back to sleep in under an hour.This  simply NEVER happened before. I am 100% sold.</li>
            <li> Love this relaxing soothing aroma.</li>
            <li> I had trouble sleeping when I travel for work. Using the lavender oil from Nature&#x27;s Own Essence help me relieved my stress. I now use it in my salt bath to help relaxes my muscle after a hard work out. A few drops goes a long way. The aroma is an invitation to relaxation heaven. It truely works. Great idea for my Xmas gift bags for my staff.</li>
            <li> At first I don&#x27;t know how to use it, after I did my research, I&#x27;m very impressed with Lavender Essential oil.  I bought this kind oil from different supplies, but it was pricey. I checked the Amazon and I said why not give a try, after reading the good review.  I put few drops of Lavender oil and  few drops of peppermint oil in my oil diffuser.  The smell was  very relaxing.  I used Lavender oil together with coconut oil for body massage. I also put few drops of Lavender on own home made shampoo. It was great.  My family are enjoying using natural remedies in the house.  I wish they have organic.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil. Use it in soapmaking, lotions,  and creams.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> LETS SAY 1O STAR.AMAZING.YOU KNOW IT IS NOT ADVETTISING.IT IS 100% NATURAL AND IT IS WORKING.I WIL BUY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.AND OF COURSE I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL.</li>
            <li> wonderful product ! I use it on hand made rugs as a moth repellent</li>
            <li> This does not smell as great as other lavender oils that I have tried, but I will be happy with it until it runs out.</li>
            <li> I have been using it in my bathwater to help me relax.  Sometimes, on a busy day, just a sniff of the oil itself helps.</li>
            <li> I have been using another lavender essential oil for some time now and have really liked it. This time I was looking for a larger quantity at a decent price. This essential oil did NOT disappoint. It is incredibly fragrant-- I have to use much less than with my previous brand-- and comes packaged securely in bubble wrap. It really does make a difference the brand that you purchase and for lavender I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Love the smell!!  Would definitely order again!!</li>
            <li> Great natural way to smell good and put on the skin as well.</li>
            <li> love this product, awesome</li>
            <li> This is a great product!! I bought it for my aunt who&#x27;s constantly suffering from back and muscle pain. She rubbs a Little bit of lavender oils where she feels pain and it helps reduce/calm it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the lavender oil daily, along with vitamin E, on my mastectomy incision site. My surgeon says the wounds are healing up nicely. I agree! The smell is a nice bonus too.</li>
            <li> Love This Lavender oil!  high quality too!</li>
            <li> Quality oil and great price. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent, good price and was delivered on time.  I use in making homemade bath and beauty products.  It is as described.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and how many uses lavender oil has. It seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li> Exxcellent product.  Will order other oils.</li>
            <li> The picture displayed shows 3 bottles. I bought the product based on the &amp;#34;suggestion&amp;#34; that I was buying 3 bottles. Silly me. It was only one bottle. I&#x27;m sure there is fine print somewhere, but I didn&#x27;t see it. It would appear that Amazon is in league with the company to mis-lead me an innocent consumer. I expect better from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Own Essence has provided one of the best European Lavender Essential Oils I have ever experienced!  It has become an integral part of my daily living and serves many therapeutic purposes.  Incorporating lavender oil into your routine adds pleasure and relaxation.  This is a wonderful gift for others as well as for your own personal use.</li>
            <li> Good quality essential oil, but I could have done without all the subsequent emails from Nature&#x27;s Own Essence.</li>
            <li> Love the oil but the lid was not tight when sent and 1/4 leaked out.</li>
            <li> Awesome essential oil - loovvee the smell of this stuff! I dab a little on my temples before bed to help relax and I&#x27;ve also used a little in my laundry to leave my clothes sleeping great. Very potent and high quality!</li>
            <li> Very good.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Everything it claims to be and more. Amazing product. The fragrance is mild and pleasant.I was surprised and pleased that the vendor follwed up on the purchase with&lt;br /&gt;so much extra information about the product.I am atempting to use natural products for my personal well-being and I seemed to have found one very excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,\\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Own\\&quot;,&lt;br /&gt; Good job!!&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl Sims,very satisfied customer</li>
            <li> The lavender oil I like to keep on hand to use as a freshener for my wash room and in my bedroom on my mattress. I also  like to use it in my windows to help keep bugs and spiders out of my house.</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases one could make all year. This seems to be the highest quality essential oil I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a certainty that I will be buying more of these products in the future.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this brand, seeing all the raving reviews. I was greatly disappointed. This Lavender Essential Oil is very camphor and leaves a plastic-like after tone. I put a few drops on my pillow and the next day the spot smells awful. It is low quality. Not even mediocre. I would not recommend it and I am returning this.</li>
            <li> This is great Lavender oil!  I used it in my bath last night and slept so well!  I am excited to try it as a bug repellant this spring when the mosquitos come out!  I would recommend this oil to a friend!</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT!  Love it ! It&#x27;s aromatherapy use in bath is fabulous and helps with my migranes It smells wonderful, still finding many uses. Its relaxing and can be used for cuts it helps heal and fight infections. Makes the room smell lovely</li>
            <li> Not please with their photo representing multiple bottles when the order is for one small bottle.  The product appears overpriced compared to the other offers.  I cannot speak for the quality differences with the competitor&#x27;s products if there is any.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for so many things. Mixed with Jojoba Oil for my body, with water as a air-freshener, in laundry and clean tables and counters. Very good product and fantastic quality at a fantastic price... Thank You SO Much!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I put the bottle against my palm an tipped the bottle over to get just a little bit.  I then rubbed that hand over my face, neck, and arms.  It allowed me to finish watering with the mosquitoes.  They still seemed to be around me but didn&#x27;t seem to land.  Because of the drought, I don&#x27;t water much or often but I plan to put a few drops in a spray bottle with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, the service!  I have received two emails with information on how to use the lavender oil.  If I wanted a product they have, I would definitely buy from this company.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of lavender.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooooo in love with it. I work in a beauty salon and use it every day for scalp massage. It came very fast so i will definitly order it again.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s been really helping keeping my four-legged furry face friend calm during firework time and I&#x27;m loving the fact that I get to enjoy the benefits as well :)</li>
            <li> This oil has performed excellently. I used a quarter ounce in making a a pound of soap and it still smells strong after two months of drying. I am very happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> The smell is very nice, seems to work well also</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the oil.  It is100% pure oil.  I diluted the lavender oil with coconut oil and applied on my skin.  I started getting itchy in 10 minutes later. I am not sure if i am allergic to the coconut oil or lavender oil.  I decided to mix the lavender oil with water and still feel itchy on my skin.  I put lotion on my skin and the itching went away</li>
            <li> I am not one to write reviews but I  enjoyed this product so much I just had to tell about it .i received the lavender and frankincense as a gift from a good friend who knows I love natural products.to praise the lavender, I have lots of trouble relaxing and sleeping , so i started burning the oil and putting it on my pillow.I have been sleeping  an relaxing so much better.This is a very good value for such a high quality product.I AM Sold!!!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance! I use  it on all of my linens and they smell fresh and heavenly. I will purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> it has a great smell I use it to calm me and it really works thank you</li>
            <li> Very nice oil. Good quality, wonderful fragrance. Shipping was prompt and reliable.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this a few months ago and when I opened it the aroma was so pure and most importantly &amp;#34;POTENT&amp;#34;. No doubt that it is 100% pure and of highest quality. As a massage therapist I have used and tried a long list of various essential oil brands and have bee disappointed on way too many accounts and it honestly lowers your expectations. Nothing is worse than buying a product online when the advertisements are always tossing the words &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Pure, Or &amp;#34;100&amp;#34; percent in the advertisement and when you get it it&#x27;s about as pure as a watered down bottle of febreeze. I used this 2oz bottle on Everything , Bed sheets, on my pillows (best sleep ever by the way). in my carpet shampooer, Massage Oils, bath water, shower floor, and in my humidifier. I also lace my face cradle covers with a drop of it during massages. I thought that I would have run out, but it is so potent you never need much so that 2oz bottle lasts forever it seems. &amp;#34;until you brake the bottle like the clumsy moron that I am, which is the reason I am buying another bottle today! I recommend this product t everyone including; Massage therapist, estheticians, my clients, people with insomnia, and anybody who enjoys not only the scent but the Many Many health benefits of Lavender essential oils.</li>
            <li> Smells strong, and this oil really seems to work well on my skin. My face skin looked recovered from the bad condition a little bit</li>
            <li> my son has issue falling asleep, and after reading a lot of reviews about this oil.  I decided to give it a try,  I has been putting 2 or 3 drops or oil on the bed sheet for the last few nights.  I would said that it seems working, he falls asleep faster and has average 1 hour more  sleep per night.  I am happy with this product</li>
            <li> After buying several different brands of lavender scent, I&#x27;ve developed a preference for certain brands.  This one was disappointing to put it mildly.  The scent is not what lavender actually smells like.  It has a hint of eucalyptus or other unidentifiable smell that distorts the lavender scent.  And most important, it does not provide the calming relief that genuine organic lavender (i.e. French Lavender) does.  Hugely disappointing!</li>
            <li> This lavender product is great and at a great price. Number of applications for this product. I use lavender to enhance relaxation, induce a calming feeling and an overall sense of well-being.</li>
            <li> Use this instead of those nasty petroleum-based scents.  This smells great and it&#x27;s good for you.  It makes a great body and hair oil when mixed with olive or jojoba.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Lavender Oil!!! The scent is amazing and is so relaxing! The quality of this product is outstanding and is the best Lavender Oil I have ever used!! I will definitely give this as stocking stuffers to my friends and family. I also enjoyed the e-book which has many great ideas on how to use Lavender Oil. Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> This is by FAR my favorite lavender oil on Amazon, hands down. I wish it came in a 4 oz. bottle.  This was my first one purchased on Amazon. Then, I went looking for larger volume, same description, different brand and was sorely mistaken. Very disappointed in what I got from other top rated competitors(which reviewers were given discounted product for review...hmm)  I tried about 3 other brands, all of which smelled medicinal and synthetic.  They were not relaxing or calming like a good EO should be.  I would like to say i have not received any discount for this review and will continue to purchase this oil. Makes me 😴😴 sleep well..HEAVEN. ***GREAT TIP: I BOUGHT A ROLLER BALL TIP &amp; I MIX FRACTIONATED COCONUT OIL WITH IT.  It makes it last longer.  I rub it on my hands, then on my pillows and sheets.  it DOES NOT LEAVE AN OIL STAIN!! ALSO, I PUT ON MY HANDS AND RUB ON MY DOG..SHE LOVES IT..SHE ACTUALLY KNOWS THE WORD &amp;#34;LAVENDER&amp;#34; NOW😀</li>
            <li> Bought Lavender, Rosemary and Peppermint oil from Nature&#x27;s Own Essence. Have been using in my diffuser for a couple of weeks and love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, packaging and speedy delivery. 5 Stars from me!</li>
            <li> This is a great product; very concentrated, so a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever used any essential oil, so the emails from the company giving advice and suggestions for uses are very much appreciated!</li>
            <li> This oil is everything I expected.  I have used it in an air diffuser, spray mist and in a body butter.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the scent! Just a dab of Lavender Oil mix with lotion helps keep my skin soft and smelling nice!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I just wish it was a bigger bottle. That&#x27;s why I only rate it at 3 stars. I would also like to know more uses for it. It does work well on headaches!</li>
            <li> I was forwarded several bottles of Natures Own Essence Lavender Essential Oil to review. I made some Lavender Garden soap with it and it is lovely. About 8 drops in the Bath tub was heavenly. It smells so good I went ahead and made Lavender Lotion Cream, Lavender Massage Oil and a Lavender Sheet Spray in a mister Bottle only to be thrilled with the results in each application. Selecting premium essential oils is like selecting fine art. It is all about how much you like it or not and this essential oil gets both thumbs up because I LIKE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Mike Hulbert - Author&lt;br /&gt;Country Living&#x27;s Crafting Soap at Home&lt;br /&gt;Healthy Living&#x27;s Pure Beauty</li>
            <li> I find this to be an excellent lavender essential oil.  I have purchased it from amazon.com now several times since I discovered it, just recently purchased a bottle to give to my sister for her birthday, we all love lavender oil.  Try it, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I put a drop on my wrist each might and sleep like a baby!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and his mom can&#x27;t get enough of this! I use it to freshen his clothes and our bedsheets - and he likes to use it in an aromatizer.</li>
            <li> Great quality,  huge bottle, amazing price. I can&#x27;t find anything negative about this essential oil!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase! Super fast shipping and product seems pure. Smells amazing! Using it as a natural spider repellant since I have two young children and a parrot. I don&#x27;t want to use anything that will harm the family and this has worked perfectly! In case you&#x27;re wondering I dilute about 5 drops into a 12oz bottle of witch hazel and spray the areas where I&#x27;ve seen spiders. It smells amazing and it works nicely!</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to try it on my feet or linens. I was disappointed by its performance on my diffuser. It evaporated very quickly. It does have a nice scent.</li>
            <li> This helps leg cramps better than any medication!!  You must try it. Helps aches as well. It&#x27;s a must have</li>
            <li> My favorite essential oil. This one is perfect! Got it quickly, love it, awesome seller! Thank you! Works great, no damage! There were no issues or problems with the item at all.</li>
            <li> very relaxed  recommend use it at night, because it will make you sleepy after massage</li>
            <li> Great product. No complaints. Shipping was fast and quality seems excellent.</li>
            <li> Great fresh scent lavender...works well in my diffuser....and love the free Lavender facts and uses download</li>
            <li> Yeah, the real stuff.  No chemicals, no garbage,  This is the good stuff.  I&#x27;ve got it in my diffuser right now and it smells great.  It helps keep me in a good mood.  Yeah.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lavender.. Sometimes the smells are not quite right with different brands. But this one is exactly what I was looking for. Very pleasant. Great to have in my oil burner.</li>
            <li> The price for the 2 oz bottle was great! (awesome deal for quality) The quality was superb, everything i expected it to be. I used it in my soap and it was amazing. I actually put (1/3) less essential oil than the recipe called for - but it was more than enough. I also use it for mosquitoes and stress and etc...&lt;br /&gt;I think the company is great also - after i bought the oil, they sent me several emails (not spamming/advertising!) on the additional usage for the oil which was great! and they politely and assertively asked me to write a review for them.  I would buy essential oils from them again and again</li>
            <li> My third bottle.  Natures Own is the best out there!</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this essential oil.  It smells great and I am using it in several ways.  I have replaced the sprays I have purchased in stores that have chemicals in them and replaced with essential oils.  We are making our own version of insect repellents and they work great.  This is a new oil we added to our inventory and we are going to use it a lot.  We both love the fragrance and this was a good value for the amount of oil.  We will reorder.</li>
            <li> Cindy is awesome. I am really pleased with the Lavender Oil, and I will continue to purchase! She has great suggestions for use as well!!</li>
            <li> The oil smells wonderful. I had recently been purchasing another lower priced lavender oil that is a huge seller on Amazon. However the last batch I bought, along with a new look to the packaging, seems to have also gone downhill in quality...the lavender oil had a sour rancid smell, it was completely unusable. So I decided to give Nature&#x27;s Own Essence a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did. A very nice product.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent of this essential oil is amazing! I am crazy about lavender anyway and thought I would try this! It is total relaxation in a jar! I have been putting drops of this here and there around the house and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this oil! This company makes good products and I have other oils from them. I didn&#x27;t hesitate when I saw this lavender oil. It smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Honestly this is great smelling I used it for candles and yeah it&#x27;s a great smell it&#x27;s also not falibme so it can be ingested like they suggest granted I would, but ether way it smells great and that&#x27;s what I got it for.</li>
            <li> This is a nice Lavender essentials oil . The price is just right and the quality is good too. This lavender is french lavender</li>
            <li> Nice size bottle for the price. Great product</li>
            <li> What a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li> The Best Of The Best !!!!! I  and trust me I have tried many other brands.</li>
            <li> Very good lavender oil!  I love it.  Helps me get a good night sleep and is great on burns and cuts.</li>
            <li> I use this, mixed w/ coconut oil, as lotion for my baby before putting her to bed.  The lavender is calming and the entire mix is a wonderful moisturizer.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this essential oil: fragrant and it works for my purpose, which is keeping my closets fresh-smelling without using chemicals.  Like other oils, I do need to replenish my &#x27;air fresheners&#x27; (cotton balls in a bowl) every other week, but, it is doing what I expected so I am very pleased.  Will order again when needed!</li>
            <li> If you want pure lavender essential oil, don&#x27;t settle for the cheap brands. Nature&#x27;s Own Essence is the real deal. The fragrance is strong. The company shipped my order fast and included the e-book with the confirmation e-mail, as promised. My bottle of awesomeness arrived intact and well-protected. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  Great price for the size .</li>
            <li> Extremely fragrant lavender scent in a generous bottle. I use lavender as a sleep aid by enjoying the scent for a few moments right before bedtime. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wow! For the price I can&#x27;t complain! I love Lavender essential oil and this bottle comes with a great amount. The quality is amazing and all I need is a few drops into my diffuser. My husband and I use it all the time. This company is a pleasure to do business with. Very professional and fast delivery. Love the way they email me instructions and suggestions on how to use the oil. They even sent me a $5.00 coupon off my next purchase. I will definitely order from them again in the near future.</li>
            <li> This is the first time i ever used lavender oil and to be very honest i love it. i use it mainly for aroma therapy and it&#x27;s working wonders for me. but there are so much more uses for it that i didn&#x27;t even know about.&lt;br /&gt;Great product i would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Some lavender oils have a rancid smell.  This one is beautiful and smells exactly as lavender oil should smell.  Use it nightly on my pillow (one drop) and sleep so well.  Thank you for an excellent product.</li>
            <li> When we see the pics, it makes you think 3 bottles for the price of $22. But when I have to pay $22 bucks for this small bottle, it hurts. Why charge so much for an Oil?</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I had no doubt I made the right decision!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read that it could help with an earache. So, I applied it topically on and around my ear before going to bed at night. The earache did stop in three days and an added bonus was that I slept better. I find the smell of this lavender deeply relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now apply a little to my neck before retiring, even though the directions on the bottle say not to apply directly to the skin. (Some people might have a reaction.) So far, I have not had any negative reactions to this product and I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this oil and I use it almost daily.  Good product.</li>
            <li> True to it&#x27;s description this is a high quality lavender oil. Very soothing and gentle. This lavender snob is well pleased with it!!</li>
            <li> I am using this on my pets as a calming potion.  They like the smell and it helps keep them happy little campers.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the Young Life line, but there weren&#x27;t any that were Prime eligible, so I decided to try this instead.  It is perfect!  I will definitely be adding it to lotions and using it to scent linens.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful selection for Lavender Oil.  It has one of the freshest and most intense aromas I&#x27;ve experienced.  I&#x27;m on my way to ordering more.</li>
            <li> LOVED the smell the minute I opened the package. So soothing and relaxing. Find myself opening the top and taking a few whiffs every time I pass by it sitting on my nightstand and an immediate positive feeling. A wonderful, natural, healthy way to get &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;!! LOL  I work on a ship, out at sea for a couple weeks at a time and taking this with me gives me some much needed reminders of the flower gardens and smells of nature I&#x27;m so used to when &amp;#34;on the beach&amp;#34; in Alaska. And immediate relaxation and positive mood enhancement during and  after long 12+ hour days. Great product. Will have to start mixing it with a carrier oil to use as an insect repellent so I don&#x27;t get eaten alive and carried away by the Alaskan mosquitos, per some of the suggestions and reviews here. MUCH better then the awful, nasty, chemically laced &#x27;regular&#x27; insect repellent that I refuse to use, but pay for in bites sometimes. Thanks for a great quality product. And I agree with others comments about the nice label!</li>
            <li> I have been into using Essential Oils. Lavender oil is the oil I use regularly. Its gentle and soothing. This oil is pure and as the name says Premium. I don&#x27;t smell any other impurities or artificial smell. I have used almost half bottle. Recommend it,</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed with this product. I have used two other lavender oils in the past and both were superior. This aroma has a secondary scent to it, almost soap-like or astringent. I can&#x27;t quite place it, but it&#x27;s not as enjoyable to smell as other lavender oils I&#x27;ve used. And, I don&#x27;t understand why I can ingest other brands&#x27; lavender essential oil, but not his brand&#x27;s ??</li>
            <li> I wanted a oil that was 100% natural and not diluted so was relieved to read the label and find it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This essential Lavender oil smells just like the Lavender I remember from Europe - I love it. I use the oil in a diffuser for aroma therapy and to aid with sleep. I also use it mixed with a base oil for scalp massages or as an additive for a bubble bath.&lt;br /&gt;The seller sends regular email updates for additional suggested use... Tips and information to consider. I appreciate that a great deal. The price is a little higher than other oils, but the quality of this oil makes well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased two more essential oils from this seller and will most definitely return for refills on all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and Great customer service :)</li>
            <li> I use this oil in a small bedside diffuser/humidifier.  It has a gentle lavender smell and is soothing when trying to get to sleep.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this English Lavender oil - it smells quite different from other lavender oil I bought locally.  This one is fresher and crisper, with an almost sweet fullness that the other one lacks.  (This one reminds me of my grandmother, who always smelled of Yardley&#x27;s English Lavender.)  At two ounces, this is an excellent value, and although at first I thought I&#x27;d never need two full ounces of this - now I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll need to be buying it again fairly soon.  A drop in the hollow of the throat before bed causes me to drop off quickly and sleep solidly for several hours longer than I&#x27;d done in quite a while.  (Helps with relaxation as well as congestion, and where I live, congestion is a given.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very new to the whole essential oil thing - but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how effective they are for so many little daily  irritations that you just never realized were bugging you until they stop.  When I get to the point of needing other oils, I will try this brand again.</li>
            <li> Everything everyone said is true:  this product is wonderful.  I work alot in my gardens and it has worked great to keep the insects away (even gnats which are frankly the most annoying of all insects in my book).  Such a wonderful smell too...I&#x27;ll need to keep it in mind for the other things you can use it for.  Great product....</li>
            <li> I used this for my daughter when she was in labor. I put some on a cotton ball to relax her and she loved it. The staff that came in also loved the smell in the deliver room!</li>
            <li> Love the lavender oil! It has a wonderful true lavender scent. I use it in my diffuser and also put a few drops in my washing machine. My clothes smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> This item (with this brand, specifically) was recommended to me by my boss.  We fell in love with lavender oil when our colleague started diffusing it all over the place with the doterra brand.  We liked it too but it was getting pricey!  My boss started looking around for other brands, saw the wonderful reviews on Amazon and gave this one a try.  She let me smell both doterra and this one in comparison and I liked both equally, in different fashions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest this as your first choice!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and how it can repel insects. Learning more about the many uses of lavender oil.</li>
            <li> Greatly appreciated emails recieved  from Nauture&#x27;s Own Essence which included many uesful tips for this product to be used other then why I purchased to be used. Would not want to be without this product ever.</li>
            <li> We love this as a relaxation aid. It works in the bath or applied to your skin to help sleep. The price and quantity is wonderful compared to what we can find in retail stores. A great product and purchase for us.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of lavender oil and none came even close to the quality of this one. Not only does it smell amazing at first but the nice aroma last a while, when other oils tend to smell soapy and off. Very pleased with the product, just received my 4th bottle, I&#x27;m addicted to it and use it for personal care as well as all natural house cleaning products. And the price is a bonus!!</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers that it does smell kind of strange. I&#x27;m no expert on lavender, however, so don&#x27;t take my word for it. I got this bottle because I moved into a lovely old apartment and like all old apartments there are problems with silverfish. I saw online that lavender wards off silverfish and a myriad of other pests. I used the entire bottle in one day. It did keep away the silverfish (and actually killed a few that it came into contact with...not sure if that&#x27;s supposed to happen), BUT the scent wore off in ONE day. so...yeah...it&#x27;s kinda costly for something where the scent wears off in one day. I wish the scent would linger longer. But it&#x27;s not terrible, thus the three stars.</li>
            <li> This has a beautiful fragrance.  Reminds me of my trip to France and the smell of all the lavendar fields in between the almond trees.  Highly recommend this for its quality!</li>
            <li> I love the lavender oil I got!!! I have used it several ways- it works well in a diffuser or oil warmer. Also I have used it on my skin. Wonderful product and I definitely  will buy more!!</li>
            <li> This was a very soothing and relaxing lavender oil. I would definitely recommend this to a friends and/ or family!</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say much since i got this as a gift for someone. Far as I&#x27;m aware they love scent and are happy with it.</li>
            <li> I use lavender oil in many ways - several drops on my CPAP filter at bedtime, to calm my dog during thunderstorms using several drops rubbed on my hands to pet him, several drops mixed with distilled water for refreshing wrinkled clothes (using a travel size spray bottle), as examples.  The Nature&#x27;s Own is pure oil, no added oils or &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; in any way, so the wonderful, restorative powers of lavender is exactly what you get.</li>
            <li> I usually write detailed descriptions of why I rate a product the way I do. It is what it is. A pure, 2oz lavender essential oil without any other ingredients. 100% pure essential lavender oil. I actually have another brand of lavender by a more expensive, superior company where the oil is better than Nature&#x27;s Own Essence. But, I would recommend this to someone. Still a high quality lavender essential oil. Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Great value for such large size. I added to my homemade laundry soap and it smells great. I also rub a few drops on my temples to help me relax at night if I&#x27;m restless. I will buy again</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I bought it because it friend told me it repels mosquitoes and it does but it does so much more.  I have used it on cuts, and insects bites and I have not been disappointed.  I cannot believe I never knew of all the great uses for lavender oil.  I will keep a bottle in my house from now on.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil!!!  I will definitely be buying this again!!!</li>
            <li> very good product. Just had a bath and added  three drops and It was a super relaxing experience..  I wish they would have other oils available. So far I have bought three different one and have enjoyed  them all!</li>
            <li> This is some of the best smelling Lavender Oils I&#x27;ve ever used. Excellent product and the price for the quality is great! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The lavender oil is great and I will definitely order it from them again. I am very impressed at their follow-up emails. They gave me some great suggestions on uses for the oil that I had not thought about and were really timely.</li>
            <li> The lavender essential oil is a wonderful quality that I use in my restorative yoga classes. It is very relaxing and I love it!</li>
            <li> Received on time and love it. This is my 1st time to use Essential Oil, so I bought this one as well as another brand to compare. I prefer this one as it has pure Lavender smell.... perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Reading reviews on this product was especially helpful. Many oils compete in this market, and this is without a doubt the most pure of them all. The lack of residue left in the cold mist diffuser I use, which I also bought from Nature&#x27;s Own Essence, is one indication of the purity of the oil. Compared to other essential oils of this grade, it is easy to tell which essential oils are actually infusing fragrance into their product. This oil is not infused with any such fillers or additives, if even for the sake of bringing out the fragrance of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using their products for years now, and will continue to happily. Nature&#x27;s Own Essence makes the purest and longest-lasting essential oil products that there are. Their Myrrh, Frankincense, Tea Tree, Lavender and Eucalyptus essential oils are all incredible, and the price defies the quality of the product entirely.</li>
            <li> As promised. I USE IT AS AN INGREDIENT IN INSECT REPELLANT AND SKIN SOOTHER</li>
            <li> Lavender Oil is one of the most versatile of all essential oils.  Most commonly known for its relaxing effects on the body, therapeutic-grade lavender has been highly regarded for the skin.  Used to cleanse cuts, bruises, and skin irritations.  The fragrance is calming, relaxing, and balancing - physically and emotionally.  Carrying a bottle of lavender around with you is like having your own personal first aid kit, perfume, and pick-me-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has a story and special preferences for their use of Lavender Oil, and this is mine.  I am a very busy person, I am up early, and I really do not stop for the entire day.  Evenings are delegated to organization meetings, and when I come home late, I clean the kitchen, do the laundry and any other housework that is necessary.  By the time I am ready to retire for the evening, I am still wound up and I have difficulty relaxing for bedtime, as my mind is full of things that must be accomplished.  Often I am unable to sleep, because I cannot turn off my thoughts, plans, and my mental list of things that need to be achieved.  If I cannot get to sleep, then I am unable to be constructive with all that needs to be undertaken for the following day.  I do NOT believe in sleeping pills or any other sleep aid and so if I do not get a necessary amount of sleep, I am unconstructive and I usually wake with a headache.  This is where the Lavender Oil is my salvation.  I pour just a drop into my palms, inhale the lavender, and then wipe my palms off onto my pillow.  This seems to both calm my over active mind so that I can fall asleep easily, and an extra benefit is that even if I do not get my required amount of sleep, I do not wake with a headache.  It may be that the scent of lavender on my pillow relaxes me throughout the night; all I am sure of is that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ends my personal review, however, sometimes we choose a product for one or two specific needs and in doing so, we forget the versatility of all the benefits that a product has to offer.  Therefore, I have provided a list of some of the many uses for Lavender Oil, for myself and other readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  SOME OF THESE REMEDIES, THAT I HAVE LISTED CALL FOR A FEW DROPS ON THE TONGUE - BE VERY CAREFUL AND READ THE LABEL ON THE LAVENDER OIL BOTTLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OIL THAT IS SAFE FOR INTERNAL DIGESTION.  SOME OILS ARE EXCLUSIVELY FOR EXTERNAL REMEDIES; THESE LAVENDER OILS SHOULD NOT BE INGESTED FOR SAFETY REASONS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Benefits of Lavender Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Calming  -  Rub 2-3 drops of lavender oil in your cupped palms, and then inhale to draw the scent all the way into your amygdala gland (the emotional warehouse) in your brain to calm the mind.  Then, rub on the feet, temples, wrists (or anywhere) for an immediate calming effect on the body.  Useful in crowded areas like planes or subways to carve out your own personal oasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Sleep aid - Use the cupping and inhalation method.  Then, rub a drop of Lavender oil on your palms and smooth on your pillow to help you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  a)  Helping young children prepare for sleep - Rub a few drops of oil on the soles of the child&#x27;s feet, or touch the under-side of their noses and the lavender scent should develop a calming effect.

At many levels, lavender oils and diffusing lavender into the room can help promote calm, restful nights and actually help a person regain some life energy by gaining sleep that is more restful.  Some have used this inside of their CPAP mask and have reported increased sleep effectiveness of up to 35% more sleep per night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Improve concentration - Because of its ability to stabilize mood, reduce anxieties, and help calm the nervous system, Lavender has been reported by many to help improve the ability to concentrate by reducing other symptoms that can distract thought and provide the ability to focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  a)  Calmness before an exam - Inhale some drops of Lavender before and during a test if permitted to help an older student reset balance to mind and emotions for testing anxieties.

In one study documented by the University of Maryland Medical Center, 86 alopecia areata patients went through a split test.

Thank you for reading my review, and I hope that it has been helpful regarding some of the usages and benefits of Lavender Oil.</li>
            <li> My first purchase of Nature&#x27;s Own Essence Premium Lavender Oil.  I have used it in a diffuser to aid in stress reduction and have also put a drop in a small amount of coconut oil and rubbed behind my neck and on my wrists.  You can also open the lid and take a few deep breaths inhaling the lovely fragrance for a quick pick-me-up.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons for purchasing the lavender oil was to produce a mosquito repellent that is nontoxic. It produced a very pleasing scent and has saved me from being bit.</li>
            <li> great product! i love the size it is available in; larger than other other bottles of essential oil.  overall i am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product before I purchased it. I went to the doctor and was told I was having hormonal issues so I decided to switch my diet and start using organic products. I did NOT want to go on hormonal replacement therapy.  I also was suffering from headaches almost every day. I wanted to replace my deodorant as well. Believe it or not, on my way home, I was having a severe migrane and was very nauseous. I had already ordered this product before the reviews.  When I got home, I opened the bottles ( I ordered both Lavender and Peppermint Oil) and smelled them. I mixed both the Lavender and Peppermint oils in my bath and soaked. I also followed another reviewers advice and placed the peppermint oil on the back of my neck. I then mixed two drops of peppermint oil in my hot chocolate. Guess what? No headache!!!!! I took no medication!!!! I sleep in my lavender oils and use it in my shower and mix it with my lotions. I was almost out and reordered the lavender oil but it was from a different company (that also starts with N). Please, Natures Own Essence may be expensive but it is well worth it! I don&#x27;t work for them, I am a regular mother who read a lot. I recommend Nature&#x27;s Own Essence Oils to the max!! If I had the money, I would buy them out!!! Absolutely love them and I thank God somebody out there is not compromising on purity.</li>
            <li> This is exceptional lavender. I did have an issue with the package, but that&#x27;s on Amazon. The folks at Nature&#x27;s Own Essence are great.</li>
            <li> Lavender is my favorite scent of all the essential oils, and I was thrilled to find a bit larger bottle at a reasonable price from Nature&#x27;s Own Essence!  My favorite use for lavender is to put one or two  drops on each of the five felted wool dryer balls when I&#x27;m doing laundry.  It lasts through several dryer loads, and leaves just the slightest lingering scent on towels, linens and clothes.  But the best part is that since it&#x27;s lavender, its wonderful calming effect stays with me throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Great product..using it along with soda and epson salt as a detox soak . Leaves me feeling refreshed and I sleep so much better.</li>
            <li> We bought this lavender oil to mix with coconut oil to make a soothing, healing salve.  Mixed together, it forms a very pleasant smelling oil that leaves skin extremely soft and refreshed.  The price was great, and purchasing from Amazon is much easier than driving to the store.</li>
            <li> I had been suffering insomnia for a long time. One day my sister suggested me to try Lavender , because it works very well on her. I saw this company&#x27;s product has a 5 stars review, and I bought it. It delivered in time. The first night I tried it and I got a good sleep. The following days I slept pretty good with it. I was wondering if I was addicted to it, so last night I didn&#x27;t use it, I slept good. I also like the smell. It is a good quality product. I like it. I give it 5 stars  :)</li>
            <li> This lavender oil is the best price and quality I have found. I love it and so does my son. We use it for our roller bottles in blends and in the tub. Its calming to the mind and body. It has helped my daughter&#x27;s diaper rash and my son&#x27;s bug bites.</li>
            <li> Was leaking in the box---not sure why--unpacked you could smell the lavender.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box the small plastic sleeve was wet with lavender--not good.</li>
            <li> This oil has a great aroma and works great in my iron.  I mix this with vanilla and make my own ironing water.  It only take a few drops.</li>
            <li> I was given a small sample by my Chiropractor when I mentioned sleep issues. I&#x27;m normally up, and down all night long, and end up dragging all day, and have to nap often. I massage it into the bottom of my feet, behind my knees, and wipe any excess on my pillow. Within an hour I can barely keep my eyes open, and typically on wake once. So gentle I&#x27;m told it can be used on children. Do to a recent Chronic Illness, I take more pharmaceutical medicine then I care to mention. I often react poorly (side effects), and now I&#x27;m exploring natural options. Please check with your Dr, I&#x27;m NOT suggesting you start replacing your medicine, for natural products !!! I hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> Loving this product, use it in my bath, my fabric softener for my bedding, and at night as they suggested and I have been sleeping so much better. appreciate all the handy use ideas they give you as well.  I have several friends using some I gave them and they are hooked as well. Have no problem recommending this Lavender essential oil...</li>
            <li> This product helped me to sleep. I have sleeping problems and tried some on my pillowcase and so far seems to work well. Iten delivered fast and as described.</li>
            <li> I am using this every where ... It smells so good and I need it for tranquility desperately.  I put two drops on a tissue and stick it in my pillow case for sleep also in my lotion at bed time oh in my baths hmmm sniff it randomly gosh so many times I run for the lavendar.  The shipping was fast and packaged very well.  It is in a glass bottle and I love things in glass. Anxious to learn more about essential oils and will order from nature&#x27;s own essence again ;)</li>
            <li> I ordered some of the Lavender Oil for my girlfriend and she is very pleased with the product. I&#x27;m very pleased with the attention to detail and customer appreciation from Matt and his team over at Nature’s Own.&lt;br /&gt;Great job!</li>
            <li> Very nice smell.  Very soothing.  I turned on my essential oil diffuser with the this oil before I go to bed at night.  I helped me falling asleep perfectly</li>
            <li> I love the lavender essential oil.  Mostly I use to relax &amp; calm.  Bath, inhaling after applying to palms,  Nightime.  Delivery &amp; service excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The guy Matt who called about my opinion was nice, but the email with the link to click scared me.  Also, he asked for my email (which he should have already had --  if he was legit)  Please contact me regarding this matter.  5 stars except the phone call thing.&lt;br /&gt; Jo Birdsong</li>
            <li> My 13-year-old daughter has struggled with anxiety, but we are hesitant to put her on prescription meds. The good Lord led me to a person who recommended essential oils, and I purchased lavender for my girl. It&#x27;s helped a lot! As a side note, the wild orange has also helped her in terms of sadness (anxiety and depression are linked). It&#x27;s also helped a ton!</li>
            <li> Love the oil, working very well.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  May be helping my restless legs.  Rub on hands at night and breath in, then wipe hands on pillow.  Also put in wax burner and on dryer balls.  Just use a drop or two at the time.</li>
            <li> I put it in my families&#x27; shampoos and lotions. It smells great and is healthy. My family loves it and smells great like lavender!!!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance •••so natural ••• my favorite will definitely buy again. Have used it for several months and I love it.</li>
            <li> A fabulous oil, I use it diluted for a pillow spray at night, in my organic cleaning solution to give me the &amp;#34;smell good&amp;#34; I like, and have also splashed it in the bath.  A wonderful lavender scent, authentic and not cloying.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of lavender, this is my favorite by far!  Am a repeat customer, and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff.  Transaction was quick.</li>
            <li> not a very good oil, the fragrance  doesn&#x27;t stay long, very week , very volatile. I am kooking for something much better quality</li>
            <li> Lovely scent and great service.</li>
            <li> Good quality, nice to have the large size ...I use it on a cloth with vinegar as a safe fabric softener.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use this oil in my soap making!  The fragrance is just right, not too strong and not too weak.</li>
            <li> Have only used in my diffuser so far, loving it!</li>
            <li> Totally love this oil! 2 ounces of pure lavender that I use for my soap making! I also like using it in my bath to relax and help me fall asleep when I go to bed. Makes great sachets for my dresser drawers .. clothes smell WONDERFUL! So many uses for these oils! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I use this lavender oil during am personal care in a total body hot towel scrub and  also place it on cotton balls and place it around in various rooms.</li>
            <li> I love the Lavender Oil the smell is just so awesome.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for - I use it in my Sauna aroma therapy dish.&lt;br /&gt;It is so relaxing I love it.</li>
            <li> Essential oil being the new thing when I offered I had to try it. It is lightly scented and a little goes a long way. This is perfect to put and spritz in your home from a spray bottle. It is great to add to bath water or I even add to my unscented hand lotion bottle. The bottle looks small but it contains a large amount of product. The smell is perfect and makes everything smell refreshing and fresh.</li>
            <li> I bought the oil for someone else, and as far as I know it is being well used.</li>
            <li> Very Good. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Using it for my allergies.  Seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> There is a great variety in the scent of lavender.  This was an exceptionally fine lavender, very clear scent.  I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my temples when I get headaches and it seems to help sooth and quiet down my headaches.</li>
            <li> It is just ok. The smell is a bit like old rancid oil.  I doubt that it is really \\&quot;essential\\&quot; oil.  It does not have a pure clean smell of lavender.  Feels almost  quite watered down.  Next time I will buy it at a local health food store. Also do not not fooled if you see three photos of bottles be because  you only get one.</li>
            <li> what a wonderful smell...i will be making my own scented bath salts with this. I was a little disappointed when I only received ONE bottle when it appears you will receive THREE. But that is my fault for not reading the fine print of the details where it clearly states that price is for ONE bottle only. Shame the picture is so misleading though. However it is a great product and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described and quick delivery time</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping Perfect!</li>
            <li> Excellent, will buy again!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and even more fantastic company. Adore the product. Use for many different applications. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the 100% lavender oil. It combate fatigue, eases sore muscles and joints!! Great product. I will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful and I love the big bottle.  I use a lot of Lavender and this size is perfect!</li>
            <li> Just what the wife wanted to make her soap</li>
            <li> Love this oil, I put it in my mascara, and it makes my lashes grow!!</li>
            <li> This is the first oil you can apply directly onto the skin.  I put some in a small spray bottle and spray a little under my arms.  Very pleasant oil.  It stays  and does not fade.</li>
            <li> so soothing using in the return air vent on my heating system, makes the whole house smell great</li>
            <li> This oil is very potent and has an amazing aroma. However if you have pets, especially cats, be careful using it around them as it can be toxic to them.</li>
            <li> I like the smell. Helps in giving me a relaxing experience but doesn&#x27;t improve my baby&#x27;s sleep habits. Will keep trying it on my baby and give update if any changes happen.</li>
            <li> Good smell. But I didn&#x27;t read the description the pic fooled me. It only comes with one bottle but it did last a while</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome! I use this in so many of my homemade recipes. The scent has a beautiful lavender smell to it. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was a large bottle for the price.  It smells good, but it isn&#x27;t colored so it is hard to tell how many drops are coming out of the container.</li>
            <li> I just received this last week. There are many types of lavender and this is the real thing. I have tried several types and different companies over the past 16 years of practice and this is by far my favorite. It actually smells like the flower and not the almost medicinal scent of many  others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use lavender for so many purposes and i really love this. I am buying more now and more  bottles as christmas gifts. It&#x27;s absolutely worth it. Lavender, peppermint, and tea tree are the 3 essential essential oils that everyone should keep at home all the time. I wish this company had peppermint. Peppermint together with this particular lavender makes a wonderful headache relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product and this company provides excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> Amazing Lavender Essential oil . My headache go away just few minutes !!! AWESOME !!!! I am truly appreciated Nature&#x27;s Own Essence . THANK YOU SOOOOOO MUCH .</li>
            <li> love the product, did not like getting a call from a telemarketer asking if I liked it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very happy with my purchase!  I use it everyday for many things...relaxation aid, linen spray, laundry freshener, cuts and scrapes healer, dog flea and tick repellent, etc., etc., etc.,...I can&#x27;t live without my lavender essential oil and this one fits the bill perfectly!  I have over 42 different essential oils that I use for specific purposes but lavender is my go-to oil for all around purposes and this one is definitely a top quality oil!  Excellent price and very fast shipment, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> This seems to be the same lavender essential oil  that doTerra sells for 4 times the price. Although doTerra claims you can take their essential oils internally, Natures Own Essence does not recommend this with their products. This is not a problem for me, I use it on my skin only.</li>
            <li> Outstanding quality lavender oil. Smells great!</li>
            <li> I was actually hesitant to purchase this product because I was looking for a stronger lavender... Or, so I thought. This Lavender oil knocked my socks off! More accurately, it knocked me out. Great for calming an entire house down. I used it in homemade room spray, bar soap, liquid castile soap, bath salts, and baby oil gel. I&#x27;ve applied this oil directly to skin. No rash or negative side affects at all. I&#x27;m blown away by the results!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.  I was concerned I did not receive the ebook.  I mentioned it in my review and got the link the next day.  The oil is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for the quick response.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the scent of lavender and find just a few drops of this oil in a diffuser is the perfect way to end a stressful day. I never realized the MANY MANY uses and benefits of lavender oil. Excellent quality!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for scalp and hair.  I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> wonderful stuff! Great product smells heavenly and have used it for many things in the house from aromatherapy to migraines.</li>
            <li> I use only 100% pure therapeutic grade essential oils &amp; Natures Own Essence Lavender (Lavandula Angustifolia) is perfect for my family. I diffuse in the family room where my pups are to keep them calm during the fireworks at the 4th of July, add a few drops to my coconut oil for a moisturizer and have a room spritzer in the bedroom. The uses are unlimited! I&#x27;ve already ordered my second bottle!!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this lavender oil. I use it as aromatherapy to help me sleep at night. Great value!</li>
            <li> This lavender oil is refreshing. The bottle is 2 ounces and comes with a stopper so that the opening only drops versus spills freely. This can be used in diffusers, humidifiers, on the skin, and in the shower. Awesome oil.</li>
            <li> Of all the essentials oils there are, and there are many. Lavender has to be my very favorite.&lt;br /&gt;It has multiple uses and benefits for the whole family. We uses it in a diffuser to relax. I rub it on my temples and soles of my grand babies feet at night to relax.&lt;br /&gt;We also use it on our wool dryer balls to naturally scent our laundry.&lt;br /&gt;This brand is of a very high quality and has a wonderful dripper top that I just love. It is also a generously sized bottle that last about a month in our home as we use it a LOT!!!</li>
            <li> Lavender Essential oil is a must in my house!&lt;br /&gt;I have a special needs sister that has a lot of emotional issues, and I was told to try to use lavender essential oil on her.&lt;br /&gt;With guidance from everyone, I started putting a few drops into the base of her feet. I also put a few drops on her pillow, and then place a  few drops of the oil onto the filter of my air purifying system I have. I have to say that I definitely noticed a difference in her behavior.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s definitely less stressed, and actually gets better sleep at night. I couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing until I saw the results.&lt;br /&gt;Lavender Essential oil works!&lt;br /&gt;I love that this bottle comes in a bigger size, and the price is pretty reasonable. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over two weeks, and am super satisfied and happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for a deep discount to give my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Super fast ship, thank you I love my lavender oil!</li>
            <li> good service / oil amazing</li>
            <li> This oil smells AMAZING! I love that it is organic,good price,sooooo many uses! My favorite way to use lavender oil is in my dryer on wool balls.makes clothing smell great,and the smell lasts along time with no harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and it is very relaxing. I don&#x27;t like taking medicine for just anything so this is a good way to relieve my stress. I looking forward to purchasing more.</li>
            <li> This Oil smells wonderful, but more than this, the Company contacted me before and after delivery to ensure I was happy with it. They also send email tips for Lavender uses. What company takes the time to do that? Really appreciate it, plus the Oil is a great value with endless uses.</li>
            <li> Great Product - chemist at work.....................................science major enjoy a pass time&lt;br /&gt;Allow a novice to experiment on making some beauty products and body butters for Xmas</li>
            <li> Smells great and works great! Good size bottle.</li>
            <li> This amazing Lavender Essential Oil is in my cabinet for all minor skin irritations and my spa needs.&lt;br /&gt;What I enjoy about Nature&#x27;s Own Essence Lavender Essential Oil is that it is very non-disruptive in its aroma. Some oils are way too strong, this one is light and so much appropriate for my lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for any minor skin irritations and discomfort. Also it&#x27;s perfect for my night routine: I put a few drops into a small fabric pillow and place it a bit away from my bed on a night stand.&lt;br /&gt;And one of my favorite uses is to put a few drops onto the dryer balls for my laundry to smell amazing after each drying cycle! You could do it with any essential oil you enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;A beautiful product for many home essentials.&lt;br /&gt;The company provided me with a sample of their lavender oil, and being an true fan of good quality of essential oils, I simply loved this one.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, received speedy delivery and helpful tips from the company which is a plus since I&#x27;m  still learning about essential oils!</li>
            <li> Good stuff - get it.  You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> One of the better lavender oils out there-smells sharp,clean not too sweet.</li>
            <li> Love lavender.  The picture shows three but the price is for one.  It is a good product and I have ordered more then once</li>
            <li> This was a delightful purchase.  Not only is the product of the highest caliber but the company itself has a wonderful business model which is depicted in their follow- up emails. The entire shopping experience from product to customer service is superb. I highly recommend this company and its product, Lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  I appreciated the practical information that came along with the product.  I will order again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I might like a dropper...for measuring.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very dense lavender smell, it helps me breathe. I also put this on my hair it helps my hair grow faster than usual. I</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Great quality and price. Use for migraines and insect bites.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I&#x27;m halfway through my first bottle and just ordered two more bottles! The scent is wonderful and the customer service from this company is great. I like that they send/email you suggestions on various ways to use this oil. I have not really used essential oils before but being pregnant and all, I wanted to have a nice smelling massage oil for my swollen feet so I bought this to blend with vitamin E oil fr Trader Joes and make my own lavender massage oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the scent of fresh lavender in general and was looking for a way to make my home smell nice so I made my own room spray with this as well. It&#x27;s so easy--there are lots of recipes available if you Google it. It&#x27;s usually some distilled water with rubbing alcohol (or vodka) and drops of essential oils that you shake up in a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most clean, straight up, pure lavender scent I have found. I&#x27;ve even gone to L&#x27;Occitane and other places that sell lavender room sprays to see if they smell better but I love this one the best! I&#x27;m a fan for life. :)</li>
            <li> Love my Lavender oil, have been using Lavender oil for over a year now, this is my first time trying this company&#x27;s brand and I must say it is pretty good. I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> No difference that I can tell between the very expensive oils and this. Wonderful oil!! Excellent price.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell ... feel calmer and peaceful</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS!!!! I bought a bottle to use on my family. I have four little boys under the age of six. We rub it on the bottom of their feet before bed, not diluted, and they sleep so well. My husband and I do as well and we haven&#x27;t slept this well in a long time!!! We also use their frankenscence oil too. LOVE ALL THEIR OILS!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful clean essence. I mix it with almond oil for moisture after showering. Great for winter dryness.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, pure, fresh fragrance. Great value quality to price ratio. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing smelling lavender oil I have ever sniffed!  I highly recommend it.  I put it in with my epsom salt bath and it is so luxurious!</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! I have an aroma globe and use this essential oil and every person that walks into my home immediate compliment how fantastic my house smells!!!</li>
            <li> Very concentrated so only need a few drops to create lovely strong smell.  Very good quality.  Will definitely order again.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great oil. The company also sent interesting information on how to use the oil.</li>
            <li> Much of it had leaked out due to the loose cap.  It was so thin that it was more like water than oil and it had very little fragrance which disappeared very quickly.</li>
            <li> SO PLEASED!  Having never bought this brand before, I decided to roll the dice. Co glad I did. Has a TRUE lavender aroma. Much better than some of the other brands we&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I love this oil and the customer service is great!</li>
            <li> Soothing, calming, wonderful aroma. Makes bath heavenly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly the same as the lavender that I&#x27;ve bought in the store, but for the price and burning purposes it works. For some reason to me it smells more &#x27;perfumy&#x27; than an oil burning oil.</li>
            <li> I love it! It smells wonderful! I will definitely be buying more once it is gone, although it will last a very long time! A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Use it in our baby and in the bath. Much more concentrate than other brands. The flow is fast so be careful when pouring.</li>
            <li> Very high quality oil and a generous sized bottle. I use lavender in my dryer as I love the light fragrance of it. Sometimes I remember to put it in the final rinse but almost always forget. Great price and delivery. Overall, ver, very satisfied! Thank you.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL fragrance....seriously</li>
            <li> This is a fine product that I use for a skin condition.  It is excellent quality and arrived ahead of schedule. I have ordered&lt;br /&gt;it several times in the past and will continue to buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used before so I&#x27;m excited to learn more.  Nice calming smell.  Just use a little so it lasts a long time.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very nice lavender oil.  Smells wonderful and seems to be of good quality although I&#x27;m really not an expert in the field.  I can only compare it to other lavender oils that I&#x27;ve purchased.  I use this for refilling my electric diffusers and I&#x27;ve been using it for my skin as well since lavender oil is supposed to help with skin conditions.  I don&#x27;t know what I have recently developed (eczema, dermatitis, psoriasis or just an allergy), but so far the oil seems to be helping as the spots have reduced in size and the itching is not as pronounced.  Nice oil and nice customer relations.</li>
            <li> I use essential oils for everything and my husband likes Lavender on his pillow.  Since we use more Lavender than anything, I like to try different brands of it and use that as a guide to the quality of the company&#x27;s oils.  I&#x27;ve purchased Nature&#x27;s Own Lavender multiple times and have been very satisfied with it.  It is a little more &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; than some other brands I&#x27;ve used, but not weaker as some less pungent brands are.</li>
            <li> The best lavender in essential oils. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance, excellent quality, excellent service!</li>
            <li> Have no opinion on the product of good or bad. No issues.</li>
            <li> This is so perfect for headaches. I have been getting headaches a lot lately. I rubbed a little on the back of my neck actually and within an hour my head ache was gone and i did not have to take any pills!! YAY&lt;br /&gt;You can also use it to clean cuts, open wounds and bug bites.&lt;br /&gt;You get an email with all kinds of uses for this product so I am sure you can find something that this is great for in your life.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a small bottle but you do not need very much at all!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great smell without being overpowering!!!</li>
            <li> I have been adding this to the rinse cycle of wash, rubbing down sore muscles, applying to neck and wrist at night.  Many uses.  Great product.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars. Can&#x27;t say anything bad about the oil. It&#x27;s an excellent quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not enough to take any stars away, the only thing I wasn&#x27;t pleased with is the Euro dropper that came with the oil. I feel the orifice is far too big, causing too much oil to come out at once. I have some empty bottles, a dropper from one of them should fit.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this product. The oil is quite pure and effective. I use it for everything. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells gorgeous. It makes me sleep like an angel</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I liked the amount provided but it seemed less thick like it was diluted too much. I&#x27;ll stick with a different brand from now on.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it literally for everything. Amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> So happy with my lavender oil. I am using it to help falling asleep. I use a few drops in my bath along with some Epsom salt and a little baking soda. I read this was also a good detox to do. It&#x27;s very relaxing.</li>
            <li> This oil is absolutely awesome.. I love the way this looks and works.  I get the smell of the oils immediately and love the stream and colors.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of lavender, and with this in a diffuser  it makes my whole house smell great. Even helps on my headaches and keeps my kids calm in the house when I have this going.</li>
            <li> This Lavender oil is the best! I have made my own massage oils to massage my husbands back and it is very soothing. I have also created room oil to fill both my room and my children&#x27;s room with the oil. The oil is strong so a little goes a long way, its soothing and really helps calm me down after a long exhausting day.  The oil also helps me with calming my headaches and helps my body relax.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I had to buy two.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive for me, but a little goes a long way so I&#x27;ll reorder again.  It&#x27;s such a true Lavender scent - sometimes I just take the top off the bottle and take in a whiff of it - helps me relax but also perks me up too (magic, I guess).  I will order again.</li>
            <li> High quality lavender at a great price! I use this product for just about all of my family&#x27;s health care needs. My oldest daughter inherited fever blisters -&amp;#62; I mix lanolin and lavender to make lip balm that works better and faster than the expensive ointment the doctor prescribes. We use it on all of our boys at night to promote calming, sleep, and concentration at school the next day. It has helped my ADHD son replace his medicine, &amp; my mildly OCD son to break those habits. I add a few drops of it and Frankincense to my witch hazel (best thing you could ever do for your skin) and use it as an astringent. It works beautifully on sun burns, scapes, scabs, migraines, insect bites and even a repellent. Lavender is the one essential oil that everyone should have, it alone replaces hundreds of items and this brand will not let you down.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lavender essence  I have ever experienced.  If you are looking for an authentic lavender this is it.&lt;br /&gt;RL</li>
            <li> Smells so good, and it helps me sleep, it only takes three drops for it to last about four hrs.</li>
            <li> I did receive the Lavender oil and it smells great. Haven&#x27;t used it yet; I plan to use ti in my soap.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery, quality product for the money. Would buy this product again. I like the large size as I use a lot of lavender.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how anyone can say this little bottle last forever, I have been using this for about 2 months now and I have just about used the first bottle up. this is great stuff, I use it in my bath every night, on my hair, on my feet and I have never felt better. My grandson will tell me when it comes to taking a bath that he wants it in his bath. Don&#x27;t think about it just buy it, it is very good</li>
            <li> So amazing.  This is a great brand with a hearty scent that is unique from other brands I have tried- and I have tried many.  I am frequently disappointed with the NOW brand lavender.  But again- this has a unique tone to it. Great in oil warmer</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I mix it with olive oil and sugar to make my own body scrub. After my shower my whole place smells amazing! Very high quality, great antiseptic properties, and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> i love very much, this lavender excellent for therphy</li>
            <li> Great product. One of the best Lavender&#x27;s I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive the premium European lavender oil, especially after reading all the great the reviews. I have recently started buying a lot of different essential oil products and so far have had really great results come from them. I use them to make my own massage oil, bath salts, lotions, body wash, and hand soap. I really love knowing I am using a natural product on my body. I wanted to try the Lavender essential oil to help with sleep issues I suffer from. If you have noticed a lot of products are adding lavender scents to their products to help relieve stress, The benefits from this particular one helps promote soothing, calming, relaxing, and balancing. I have used this product for a few days and already notice a huge difference when I go to sleep. I have been adding it to my massage oil and using it before bedtime. The scent is wonderful and smelling it alone makes me feel a lot more relaxed. You can tell from the moment you open the bottle this is a quality product that has not been watered down like others I have found. I feel very satisfied with this company especially knowing they offer a GUARANTEE on their product. I can not wait to try the Lavender Oil in other ways from headaches to using the product on my four legged babies. I am very happy to have found such a wonderful product and company.</li>
            <li> You are absolutely the best! I will not try again any other brand. Ir Was a waste if money to do so.</li>
            <li> I bought this as this is an excellent remedy for misquito bites and stopping the itch!  Recommend as a natural solution!</li>
            <li> Smells good (as expected!)</li>
            <li> Great lavender aroma and silky smooth feel. A tiny drop on my hands makes them feel amazing - smooth and supple. I&#x27;ve also used this to scent bath salts and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for anybody needing lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be without Lavendar, but I&#x27;m picky! I found quality. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It was a gift,smells okay...........</li>
            <li> Not only do I love this scent but was delighted to find out all of the new and different ways that it can be used.</li>
            <li> Mixed a few drops of this with alcohol and water for cleaning.  Cleans fantastic and smells great!  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is by far THE best lavender oil I have ever used.  Literally.  Many of the higher quality lavender oils seem to almost smell a bit like mineral oil. Not this lavender oil---it is truly 100% pure lavender oil.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the look and smell of the product, and the service is great too. Thx</li>
            <li> Very good company - sent a free book via email about lavender and it&#x27;s uses - follows up to make sure you are 100% satisfied - clearly they know much about the benefits of lavender!  I use this oil in my diffusers but also I apply a drop or two of it along with a drop or two of Frankincense oil each morning to my freshly washed face, neck, and chest - it is calming, refreshing, and healing for acne and scarring and also works nicely for reducing anxiety and stress.  I am not calling it a &amp;#34;miracle worker&amp;#34; but it is a lovely natural product that I would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I&#x27;ve had trouble waking up in the morning due to poor sleep quality. Since using this product, I&#x27;ve been able to wake up a lot easier and fall asleep a lot faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I  love the smell of Lavender and this oil smelled right. However, it didn&#x27;t last. I put it in a diffuser and the odor was gone the next day. On the other hand, I also got the lemongrass and that stays for several days. I won&#x27;t buy the Lavender again even though I love the odor. It really needs to last more than one day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often use that word when giving a review, but in this case it is well deserved.  I ordered both the Premium European Lavender oil and the Rosemary oil when my daughter asked me to get it for her.  When I opened the box the room  was filled with the most lovely fragrance and I thought &amp;#34;Oh dear, one of them must be leaking.&amp;#34;  But they were well wrapped and no spills.  The scent was just too lovely to stay contained.  My daughter has used other oils before, both for her hair and bathing but none have worked so well as these.  Now, I have started using them in my bath and again it&#x27;s so relaxing and soothing.  I even keep a bottle in my office so I can enjoy it during my work week.</li>
            <li> Great oil and price will order again</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for a month and love it. The price is exceptional for the quantity you receive, the smell is beautiful and effective. I have used it in a spray bottle for laundry &amp; anti-stress perfume along with a detox bath once a week. My daughter had a sinus headache for a month (she has an autoimmune disease and sinus infections are recurring) and I had her take a lavender tubby when the shipment came in, her headaches disappeared with a happy mood with out using drugs. I will be buying my lavender oil direct from this company from now on!!!</li>
            <li> I love this brand a lot and will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the quality of the product!!!!</li>
            <li> Pure and simple. Little on a cotton ball helps me relax at bed time. So many great uses.</li>
            <li> Great price, great quality, great smell! On hot summer nights, I usually turn on my aroma diffuser before I go to bed, lavender + peppermint is my favorite combination. The smell of lavender calms me and gives me good night of sleep.</li>
            <li> I use this for a variety of different (non-internal) things, linen spray, laundry detergent, oil warmers. and I just love the way it smells. It&#x27;s a good price, and good quality.</li>
            <li> Quality lavender oil, put a few drops on your pillow or rub a little on areas that have been injured, seams to work for me.</li>
            <li> The real deal. Comes with many helpful uses I never thought of and have tried to great success.</li>
            <li> I heard about this oil from a ranch wife.  She uses it for cuts, bug bites, and other minor skin abrasions.  I ordered it on her recommendation and use it the same way.  Works every time and is better than the chemical remedies for the same issues.  Easy to use, economical at one drop at a time, and pleasant to smell.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of lavender and was excited to try this oil. Other than for relaxation, I had read lavender also has medicinal properties, in particular to skin. A friend of mine loves to put a few drops of lavender oil in a water mister bottle and spray around her bed before bedtime as she said it helps her relax. So I sprayed some in my room, up in the air and let some land on my face. Unfortunately, my facial skin had a bad reaction to the lavender and exploded in a bad rash the next morning. I won&#x27;t be using this for any skin problems but seems to work fine for relaxation when I put a few drops in a bucket just to soak my feet.</li>
            <li> More hair loss and feels like burning my scalp after putting it on my scalp. I really don&#x27;t want to leave a negative review. Sorry.</li>
            <li> Your company deserves a 5 Star +.  This is the best Lavender Essential Oil I&#x27;ve ever used.  Actually my daughter Crystal ordered it for me as gift and I am so grateful.  It is refreshing, calming, soothing and the smell is unmatched.  I am an Aesthetician that uses this in many ways on my clients, such as in body massage oils or as a blend with Peppermint for headaches and stress.  They love it.  It is a permanent on my shelf.  I can&#x27;t wait to try out each and everyone of your companies oils.  You can count on myself, as well as my daughter being customers for life.  Also I want to thank you for sending me the coupon for 40% off my next order.  That speaks for itself on how you care about customer satisfaction guaranteed.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Packaged safely and arrived exactly as they promised it would . Can&#x27;t wait to use it in my diffuser. I applied some to my wrist and what a wonderful aroma. Not overpowering but certainly powerful results. I will order more products from this company ASAP!! Thankyou</li>
            <li> I love this product I use it for everything and the customer service was awesome I love how they place calls and check up on you to make sure the product is working to its full ability.... Thank you ;)</li>
            <li> Great products. I will order from them again.</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff smells so good! Im a huge fan of lavender oil, and this brand is awesome! I have tried other brands, but this is a great deal, and good quality! I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Excellent in preventing mosquito bites.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Wish I would have known about this product/company years ago---would have saved LOTS of money from the high prices I paid at a local &amp;#34;Health&amp;#34; store!</li>
            <li> Pure and delightful oil. Everything the manufacturer says is right on. I&#x27;m especially happy when I dillute w distiller water and spray on bed linens. Like being in my favorite spa!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure of this lavender oil. Opening the bottle and taking a whiff, it does have a slight camphor note, but once it is used properly, you have that familiar smell of lavender. I poured a little in one hand, rubbed both together to distribute the oil, and then ran my hands through my hair and wow! I had that lovely scent of lavender. It smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> This lavender oil smells amazing! We use it daily to soothe skin irritations and in homemade all-purpose cleaner.</li>
            <li> I love the oil! Use it for my bath.. But I think the smell is a bit strong, I think it will take time to get used to the sharpness.</li>
            <li> Very good quality oil.  I put it on our pillows every night, and also put some in the infuser.  I&#x27;m just learning the may uses for it, so I&#x27;m glad this is a 2 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> Great oils! Really smell amazing. I will now try to see if I can get that relaxing feeling everyone keeps talking about!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and well worth the price.  I use this essential oil all over my home (in potpourri, diffuser, in hand lotion) and have received several compliments on how soothing it smells.  Lightly rub a drop or two into the palms of your hands, then rub your hands over your pillow case for a restful night&#x27;s sleep.  I have also used this in my Stress Management classes for pulse-point therapy . . . the participants love it!</li>
            <li> This seems to be a great pure lavender oil. I am not an essential oil expert, I just know this lavender oil smells great and the scent lasts a long long time. It came in a dark glass bottle to keep the quality of the oil and includes a dropper so I can get the exact amount I want each time without making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it at some different places. At work, I have a wax warmer. I mix some lavender oil drops with fragrance wax, my office smells very welcoming and calm. My coworkers thank me for having this at work. Sometimes, work place can be stressful, this fragrance keeps us calm and think better.&lt;br /&gt;I have oil diffuser at home, and this oil works great in it. I like to use it before we go to bed to help us sleep better. I also make some drips some in dry flowers for some aroma in the restrooms. Flowers are pretty, the scent is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I also drop some in my dryer balls when I dry clothes. Clothes come out refreshing and smell wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;This oil is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I would recommend this essential oil to others. I may see if they have other scent for me to buy since this brand of oil is so pure and scent lasts long.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful Lavender Oil!  I never tire of lavender oil so I am always looking for more.....and I am so glad I got Nature&#x27;s Own Essence Lavender Oil.  It has a pleasant, fresh lavender scent and lasts longer than a lot of others.  I use it almost every day in some way...so many uses.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I use it for just about everything.  I put it in my antiaging cream and my pain  cream, in my diffuser.  I like how the company follows up with you after a purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells soooo good. I made the lavender water and spray a little on my neck when I have a hot flash,  it smells yummy, hot flashes aren&#x27;t so bad anymore.  :-)  I have also been using it with soy wax in my warmer which was the reason I bought it, I just love the natural scent. I enjoyed the download that was included as well, there are so many uses for this essential oil. Yep I&#x27;m a happy customer and will be back for more although it may take a while to use it all.</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff. I use it everyday in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> This Lavender Essential Oil has worked wonders for my family.  For my Younger daughter, I put a drop of this around her nose at night to calm her and so she can get rest at night.  She has a hard time getting to sleep and with this, she is doing so much better.  For my son I use this lavender oil around the back of his neck, his nose and his forehead.  He s autistic and has other issues and this has worked and is amazing.  Now, for my older daughter, she has allergies.  I started giving this essential oil to her along with another oil and after a few weeks of using this every day, she is down to taking this now every other day and her allergies are tremendously better.  My husband and I both use this at night.  I put a couple drops of this oil on my hand and rub it in my whole face.  He uses this on his pillow at night.. We also use this with a few drops in our bath water.  This can also be used in laundry detergent. That is what I put in my homemade soaps.  It is so calming for my whole family.. I am so thankful for this Lavender Essential Oil and having it in my home.  I recommend this to others for the above mentioned and so much more.  I am not a Dr., therefore if you have any questions about this you can ask your Dr before taking any essential oils if you are uncomfortable with it as everyone&#x27;s body reacts differently.  I personally have never had any issues with essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a reduced price product.  Regardless, all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Wow.  I am planning to learn to make hand made soap.  Essential oils are used to scent hand made soaps.  Until I make those soaps, I learned I can add Essential oils to cleaning products to make my home smell nice, and, it will also help me enjoy my cleaning.  I really like the scent of your Lavender, very much.  I was able to take off the cap of the bottle, and smelled delicate, wonderful floral scent (not too harsh, not vinegary, etc.).  I know the lavender I bought will be a success.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the smell of lavender and the Lavender Essential Oil is amazing! I have never used essential oils before but have been wanting to try ever since I saw a post about a natural spa bath using essential oils so I was so excited when I finally ordered the bottle and it arrived 2 days later. I had to try it that night! I mixed a handful of sea salt, 10 drops of lavender essential oil and a half cup of baking soda in my hot bath. Having never used the essential oils before, I was a little hesitant, but the aroma was wonderful so I slipped right on in. I was amazed! This was the most relaxing bath I have ever had in my life, plus my skin not only carried a light scent of lavender afterwards, but it was baby soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been having a little trouble sleeping at night so I decided to put a few drops of the lavender essential oil on the bottoms of our pillows and see how it helped. If you have trouble sleeping or just want a relaxing sleep...DO THIS!!! We both slept better than we have in weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount for an Amazon review however all opinions are 100% my own!</li>
            <li> What can I say, I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS OIL!!!  It&#x27;s a very relaxing fragrance, reminds me of being at the spa.  I will definitely buy more from this company</li>
            <li> I use Lavender in different products we produce including Sweetly Citron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is better quality then you buy from most stores because it is undiluted and 100% pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Lavender Oil is by far my favorite of all Essential Oils. It has SO many wonderful uses. Upon receiving my order I was pleasantly surprised on how wonderful this lavender oil smelled. Not to strong! It&#x27;s an amazing value for your money and if you are going to get any essential oils I really recommend getting Lavender Oil. A few drops on the bottom of your feet at night will help you sleep, a few drops in your diffuser will help you relax, I could go on and on about the benefits. Lavender Oil is an oil everyone should have in their medicine cabinet at home, you won&#x27;t regret it!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.</li>
            <li> Lavender essential oil! This has a very nice strong (but not over powering) smell. I have sprinkled a little on my pillows and in my face mask as I sleep at night and have found myself falling asleep faster and falling into a deeper sleep through the night. Love the cost of this item and how much you get with it. This is a really great deal for an essential oil! Also the controlled dropper helped control my drop count when filling my diffuser</li>
            <li> Lavender Essential Oil is an excellent product. The bottle has a built in dropper so when you pour it, only drops come out and you won&#x27;t waste it or make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have put a few drops on my dried flower arrangement and every time I pass by the dinning room I get that hint of lavender. I love it.  I have also used it to rub my legs and arms to keep the mosquitos/bugs away as I enjoy being outdoors in the summer. It works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender Essential Oil is great. Customer service sent me an email explaining many ways I can use the lavender oil. I can&#x27;t wait to experiment.</li>
            <li> I use Lavendar oil on my pillow and I also mix it with skin lotion.  It is important I have a 100% pure oil.  This Lavendar oil is the best.  It smells great, you can actually feel the soothing effects the second you open the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The Oil came right on time after ordering it.  I will always choose this as my Lavendar oil from now on.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the fragrance and would buy again</li>
            <li> Does what it should. Smells like Lavender, I could do with a little less emailing from the company though.</li>
            <li> Used this essence of lavender oil as part of a home made insect repellent. It adds a good kick to the sprayable solution which works fabulously and smells great.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this oil.  I use it pretty much everywhere. I put a drop or two into coconut oil when I moisturize my body after a shower.  Or sometimes in my hair with a spritz of water to give it a little refresher. Even just a straight drop or two on my wrists and temples. A little goes a long way!  This stuff is good, REAL lavender!  I can see the bottle lasting for some time too!</li>
            <li> I love the Lavender oil. I use it a lot, especially at night. It&#x27;s a great sleep aid, very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize it had so many other uses. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  I mix it with vitamin E oil and coconut oil for a body oil.  A few drops in my wash makes my sheets smell beautiful.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Came packaged nicely! The Lavender oil is great! I use it in my toilet paper ring to make the bathroom smell better. I also love to put some on a cotton ball and put that in my pillow sheet. Makes my room smell great and it relaxes me! Great purchase!!!</li>
            <li> I just can not get enough of how heavenly the smell is. I add a drop to my hair serum and makes my hair smell s amazing. I also add a drop or two to the amount of  body base cream/lotion that I need to put on my body and it makes me smell sooo smell delicious</li>
            <li> I had high expectations due to the price of this oil, but found myself disappointed. When using with a diffuser the fragrance is weak even when using far more than the directions state. In fact my husband and children say they cannot even smell it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, received what expected.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I put it in my gneric body creams.  Makes me smell nice and keep bus away.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product while I was ordering some products for my dog.  It oddly, appeared somewhere on the list of sprays and remedies for fleas and ticks.  While lavender oil does help to repel these, this particular product is also for humans.  It is an excellent essential oil and the deep lavender fragrance is superior to many that I&#x27;ve had.  Much as I lve him, I may not be sharing this one any time soon with my dog.</li>
            <li> The product works terrifically and the company really cares about their customers.</li>
            <li> prefcet smell is intense and just right</li>
            <li> Finally found a brand that I really like ! I use this with peppermint and chamomile for my migraine headache relief . Learning the many other uses of essential oils and as I learn more im going to keep coming back to this really great brand here.  Would most definitely recommend this brand very good quality</li>
            <li> I have always loved lavender for it&#x27;s many uses and smell. So it was a no brainer when I saw this to try it. I used it in my heated oil warmer first and omg...it is amazing! Very fragrant but not in an over powering way. I then decided to try it in my bubble bath. My skin is so soft after just 2 uses. I think that is where I&#x27;ll be using the rest from now one!</li>
            <li> wonderful high-quality product!</li>
            <li> Love lavender oil..I add it to coconut oil to moisterize skin. .love the scent, very relaxing..thank you for a great product..no problems with shipping.  Very satisfied..thank you.</li>
            <li> A very good value and I like the quality of the lavender.</li>
            <li> This is not ingestable which means it&#x27;s not 100% lavender oils and has fillers. Disappointed</li>
            <li> Superb product, amazing what lavender oil can do to benefit us in so many ways...</li>
            <li> Super pleased with this wonderful essential oil. Lavender is one of the most amazing oils as it has so many different uses. Not only for therapeutic use, it is also is anti-fungal and antiseptic. The scent alone can remove nervous restlessness and exhaustion, and increase the ability to think clearly. It can be used to treat migraines, headaches, emotional stress, anxiety, and depression. Just put a few drops in a clean spray bottle with water and spray some around your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use it to treat acne, wrinkles, psoriasis and many skin inflammations. A little of this oil goes a long way and there are too many uses to list here. Give it a try and you will love it. Make sure you buy undiluted, therapeutic grade oil such as this one. With essential oils, especially lavender, you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Nothing could be better than the scent of pure lavender oil.  The beautiful label, the detailed description, and the guarantee made me feel confident about ordering and when the product arrived it exceeded all expectations.  We mixed a few drops of this in jojoba oil and it&#x27;s beyond wonderful. This is a great quality essential oil perfect for diffusing.  Great product.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Pure essential oil - I did a blot test.  Product is as advertised.</li>
