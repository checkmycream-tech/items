            <li>EXCELLENT SELLER!</li>
            <li>OMG this is the BEST REVLON LIPSTICK COLOR!</li>
            <li>ORANGE FLIP is a wonderful, versatile, timeless color.</li>
            <li>love Revlon Moon Drops Lipsticks always !!!!</li>
            <li>I bought a couple at an excellent price and am preparing to reorder.</li>
            <li>Orange Flip the best orange lipstick!</li>
            <li>this shade is beautiful on any skin tone, especially warm tones.</li>
            <li>Wife happy, I&#x27;m HAPPY.</li>
            <li>NARS &amp;#34;Heatwave&amp;#34; is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>beautiful color, a classic that has been many years in the market, i couldnt find it in the stores but got it in amazon , so happy to found it , since it was one of my favorite colors in the 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This does the trick of bringout out the &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; in your lipcolor but its not too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I paired it with a bronze-brown cheek and nude eye, got many compliments.</li>
            <li>Love the color</li>
            <li>Love this color on me...</li>
            <li>So glad they have kept this color.</li>
            <li>Love this color and it is orange :)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lipstick in my favorite color.  </li>
            <li>Although the orange color of the lipstick is so bright and fun, the rouge permeates a strong baby powder smell.</li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;m not a fan of the strong smell.</li>
            <li>Try it, it will make you smile!</li>
            <li>Great lipstick for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The color that arrived was almost a neon orange on my lips; not necessarily ugly, but NOTHING even close to what&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and stays on most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful color, not too red, not too orange but definitely vibrant and bold.</li>
            <li>We are in the era of BOLD lips.</li>
            <li>It speaks to all seasons and is unexpectedly neutral and striking all at once.</li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite lipstick color.</li>
            <li>This is specifically for the amazing color, &amp;#34;orange flip&amp;#34;, although I can vouch for the overall high quality of revlon lipstick.</li>
            <li>, this was so pretty on me.  </li>
            <li>its really pretty.  </li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>She has tried almost every other orange-y/red lipstick from drugstore brands but this is by far the favorite - for the creaminess, long-wearing stay and its exotic color.</li>
            <li>HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT! ^_^</li>
            <li>The color is flattering and great for summer, however the wear is not great.  </li>
            <li>This is also my personal favorite go-to &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; lip color - and I&#x27;m not even much of a red lip girl!</li>
            <li>just as expected fast delivery .would have bought more but was the last one in stock</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone that is willing to be different!</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips soft...</li>
            <li>They are creamy and vivid, and never dry your lips.</li>

            <li> We are in the era of BOLD lips. This does the trick of bringout out the &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; in your lipcolor but its not too overwhelming.  Im a woman of color, with a carmel complexion, this was so pretty on me.  I thought orange was gonna make me look crazy but its really pretty.  I paired it with a bronze-brown cheek and nude eye, got many compliments.</li>
            <li> Wife happy, I&#x27;m HAPPY.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY lipstick my Mom ever wears. She has been wearing it for years. It&#x27;s a beautiful color, not too red, not too orange but definitely vibrant and bold. She receives countless compliments on it, practically anytime we go out together. Even my friends ask her what it is. She has tried almost every other orange-y/red lipstick from drugstore brands but this is by far the favorite - for the creaminess, long-wearing stay and its exotic color. Since she has had difficult finding it in local stores lately, I ordered her 5 tubes from Amazon (at a much better price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended - this shade is beautiful on any skin tone, especially warm tones. This is also my personal favorite go-to &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; lip color - and I&#x27;m not even much of a red lip girl! Definitely give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THESE FOR MY MOM AS A GIFT AND SHE WILL FLIP WHEN SHE GETS THESE! ^_^ EXCELLENT SELLER! FAST SHIPPING! HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT! ^_^</li>
            <li> I have been using this lipstick for years.  Love the color</li>
            <li> OMG this is the BEST REVLON LIPSTICK COLOR! AMAZING! I would recommend it to anyone that is willing to be different!</li>
            <li> This is a product I&#x27;ve used for awhile and I like the texture on my lips and I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excelent that I could found it!  The same color for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a bit expensive the delivery, but thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Although the orange color of the lipstick is so bright and fun, the rouge permeates a strong baby powder smell. It&#x27;s overpowering and gross. I cannot wear it. NARS &amp;#34;Heatwave&amp;#34; is a great alternative. -Katie (Daryle&#x27;s wife)</li>
            <li> This is specifically for the amazing color, &amp;#34;orange flip&amp;#34;, although I can vouch for the overall high quality of revlon lipstick. ORANGE FLIP is a wonderful, versatile, timeless color. It speaks to all seasons and is unexpectedly neutral and striking all at once. It is by far my favorite lipstick color. I&#x27;ve tried a wide variety of shades and formulas, revlon&#x27;s orange flip surpasses them all. It is a transformative shade in that it will add some confidence without seeming showy. Try it, it will make you smile!</li>
            <li> Love this color on me...</li>
            <li> just as expected fast delivery .would have bought more but was the last one in stock</li>
            <li> Great lipstick for a long time.  Keeps my lips soft...if I don&#x27;t use it, they chap.  So glad they have kept this color.</li>
            <li> It smells like a mix of cat litter and baby powder. The color that arrived was almost a neon orange on my lips; not necessarily ugly, but NOTHING even close to what&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li> beautiful color, a classic that has been many years in the market, i couldnt find it in the stores but got it in amazon , so happy to found it , since it was one of my favorite colors in the 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Love this color and it is orange :) You can tone it down, if you like, with a copper lip gloss.  It smells like baby powder!  Very creamy and stays on most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Revlon Moon Drops Lipsticks always !!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lipstick in my favorite color.  I bought a couple at an excellent price and am preparing to reorder.</li>

            <li> I would recommend this shade of orange, the moon drops lipsticks never dissapoint. They are creamy and vivid, and never dry your lips.</li>
            <li> Orange Flip the best orange lipstick!</li>
