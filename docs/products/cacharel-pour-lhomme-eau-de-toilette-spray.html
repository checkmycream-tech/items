            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li>but I found that it is still my favorite.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I have used this cologne for many years.</li>
            <li>Nice sweet and spice fragrance, but</li>
            <li>Price is very good, had no problem with placing order, perfume was delivered earlier than expected, in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>A unique scent, it&#x27;s a favorite of mine from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I strongly detest overpowering cologne.  </li>
            <li>was getting another one for my dad, but I believe I should always smell the fragrance and how strong it is before buying it.</li>
            <li>are very familiar with the original product have been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;Bad</li>
            <li>was my husband&#x27;s &amp;#34;staple&amp;#34; fragrance in Israel, where it is widely available.</li>
            <li>This fragrance has a good balance of sweet, musk and bitter odours popular with women.</li>
            <li>I bought the fragrance and was really excited to smell it again.</li>
            <li>The fragance is unique.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as shown in the pictures, and it&#x27;s the original Cacharel perfume.</li>
            <li>yep, the first thing I bought him was Cacharel!  </li>
            <li>, it smelled different, plus my friend cannot smell it unless I kind of pour it all over my cloth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But Cacharel for men is just right,</li>
            <li>I started using this in my 20&#x27;s!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, also don&#x27;t tell my loving wife, but I was introduced to Cacharel for men by a long ago girl friend who now happens to be a family friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a subtle, pleasant and fresh aroma.  </li>
            <li>it only last about 1 hr after spraying a quite good amount of it.</li>
            <li>Cacharel Pour Homme is a classic, elegant men&#x27;s fragrance: masculine, sexy and beautiful-but not at all heavy or overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I like it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought three for my father in law and he loves this one so much</li>
            <li>That this long available product will not continue to be available in the future.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is the only one I am still willing to use.</li>
            <li>Its fragance is soft and very powerfull at the same time.</li>
            <li>The first time I smelled this fragrance on a male client of mine, I almost attacked him, it had such an effect on me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like no other masculine fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Even my female friends comment when he&#x27;s wearing it at a social event.</li>

            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne and is very difficult to purchase.  </li>
            <li> only wish it were not quite so expensive - although this large bottle size helps.  </li>
            <li> A few years later, I met my soul-mate, and</li>
            <li> In fact, I really do not use colognes anymore.</li>
            <li> After moving to the USA, we assumed it would also be easy to find here-but it seems to be nearly impossible to locate in any of the stores...</li>
            <li> I would not use any other cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful it&#x27;s a knockoff !!!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this perfume for few years and it is not possible to get tired of it.</li>
            <li> I was not able to find it in few brick and mortar stores, ordered online.</li>
            <li> After asking him what it was, I actually bought a bottle and started wearing it myself, then felt so guilty</li>
            <li> 17 years of bliss later, he still wears it, and it still drives me crazy.  </li>
            <li> This is a difficult product to find in the US.  </li>
            <li> bad bad....</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed, but found out after, that they are no longer making this cologne.</li>
            <li> Well, I was really disappointed with the smell</li>
            <li> Was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of lavendar in my house, and since this has a smoky lavendar base, that&#x27;s probably why I was drawn to it.  </li>

            <li> The product arrived totally safe and correctly. It&#x27;s exactly as shown in the pictures, and it&#x27;s the original Cacharel perfume. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has a good balance of sweet, musk and bitter odours popular with women.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is not the same I remember using some twenty some years ago. I need to use a great amount in order to &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; the scent. I was a bit disappointed, but found out after, that they are no longer making this cologne.</li>
            <li> This is a difficult product to find in the US.  I was happy to be able to order it for my boyfriend on Amazon.  Cacharel Pour Homme is the best men&#x27;s fragrance out there. Even my female friends comment when he&#x27;s wearing it at a social event.</li>
            <li> I strongly detest overpowering cologne.  But Cacharel for men is just right, not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a subtle, pleasant and fresh aroma.  I would not use any other cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over 25 years. (Don&#x27;t let my middle age run you off - I started using this in my 20&#x27;s!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, also don&#x27;t tell my loving wife, but I was introduced to Cacharel for men by a long ago girl friend who now happens to be a family friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it were not quite so expensive - although this large bottle size helps.  My biggest concern about it?  That this long available product will not continue to be available in the future. Buy it.  You&#x27;ll love it.  And Cacharel will keep producing it!</li>
            <li> So here is how it all started. I had this fragrance years ago, and I wanted to change it but I found that it is still my favorite. I bought the fragrance and was really excited to smell it again. Well, I was really disappointed with the smell, it smelled different, plus my friend cannot smell it unless I kind of pour it all over my cloth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was getting another one for my dad, but I believe I should always smell the fragrance and how strong it is before buying it. I think you cannot get these kinds of things over the internet. Who knows!</li>
            <li> This order arrived much earlier than estimated.  This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne and is very difficult to purchase.  So, when we can, we buy it.</li>
            <li> The first time I smelled this fragrance on a male client of mine, I almost attacked him, it had such an effect on me.  After asking him what it was, I actually bought a bottle and started wearing it myself, then felt so guilty I went back to my Shalimar.  A few years later, I met my soul-mate, and yep, the first thing I bought him was Cacharel!  17 years of bliss later, he still wears it, and it still drives me crazy.  I use a lot of lavendar in my house, and since this has a smoky lavendar base, that&#x27;s probably why I was drawn to it.  It&#x27;s like no other masculine fragrance.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Great problem.! Will buy again the perfume is authentic packaging was great and came in a timely matter my husband loved it..!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is perfect. I have been using this perfume since I was a boy.&lt;br /&gt;Esta fragrância &amp;eacute; perfeita. Eu tenho usado este perfume desde que enumera um garoto.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for many years. I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it has been discontinued by Cacharel so I am now stocking up for the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been some time since I have bought this fragrance, but it seems they may have changed the scent because the bottle I was sent did not smell the same at all.  Was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The fragance is unique. I use it every day. Its fragance is soft and very powerfull at the same time. You should give a try.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this is the cologne ever. In fact, I really do not use colognes anymore. This is the only one I am still willing to use.</li>
            <li> Entregue no BR dentro do prazo, so tive que pagar imposto por aqui, mas faz parte do processo, de resto, tudo maravilha.</li>
            <li> I have looked for this fragrance for some time. A unique scent, it&#x27;s a favorite of mine from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Me encanta su fragancia</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this perfume for few years and it is not possible to get tired of it. I was not able to find it in few brick and mortar stores, ordered online. Price is very good, had no problem with placing order, perfume was delivered earlier than expected, in excellent condition. Wonderful buying experience!</li>

            <li> Great Parfum. It smells great. I bought three for my father in law and he loves this one so much</li>
            <li> Esta loci&amp;oacute;n ocupa un lugar especial en mis recuerdos de juventud, hace 15 a&amp;ntilde;os que la use y encontrarla fue todo un acontecimiento.</li>
            <li> Nice sweet and spice fragrance, but it only last about 1 hr after spraying a quite good amount of it.</li>
            <li> Be careful it&#x27;s a knockoff !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought one and receive a cheep knock off the smell was horrible!@!&lt;br /&gt;We are very familiar with the original product have been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;Bad bad bad....</li>
