            <li>Love the colors that come in this.</li>
            <li>Color selection is cute.</li>
            <li>save you money, they don&#x27;t  work any better than map colors.</li>
            <li>:) Trust me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;***I received a sample of this product (either free or at a discounted price) in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>These are tiny (about the length of a q-tip, but are great quality!</li>
            <li>I love you them</li>
            <li>I love all of the unique colors!</li>
            <li>Real cute and tiny, colors are bright.</li>
            <li>The pencils were great for the price, smooth application, easy clean sharpening, accurate coloring, thank you for the purchase, will buy again.</li>
            <li>For the cost I&#x27;d say they work pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>no smudges easy to blend, stays in place all day, and thats 12 hours or more, even fell asleep and woke up</li>
            <li>I ordered these eyeliners because they were cheap and cute.</li>
            <li>Good selection of colors, and they stay on very well, and water proof.</li>
            <li>Glide on easily.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>They go on easily.</li>
            <li>They go on smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>one note that may be important to some -- made in China, shipped from China.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come on as smooth as what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>But for a cheap addition to a gift bag for a makeup lover</li>
            <li>The colors and nice and vibrant, they go on fairly easily too.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this product and see all the colors.  </li>
            <li>They are very creamy and easy to use and line or blend!</li>
            <li>They are amazing and for the price, WOW!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These eyeliners may be good for a young girl to learn to apply makeup, but if you are looking for some cheap working eyeliners, then go to the drugstore, they have higher quality makeup than this.</li>
            <li>Otherwise they just kind of naturally wear off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember reading anywhere in the description that they are full size.</li>
            <li>I popped one open and tried one to see if they were any good.</li>
            <li>For the price not bad at all.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>And these work great, as long as you prime first, and set them with a powder or eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>There are some great colors here, and I probably won&#x27;t use half of them-</li>
            <li>Use a primer first and something to set your makeup when you&#x27;ve finished application and you&#x27;ll have no problems at all!  </li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and perfect for anyone who likes to have a variety of colors on hand and likes a small pencil to put in their purse on the way out the door for a touch-up or two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are fun to have a &amp;#34;girls dress up day&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought  but work nicely I would buy again .</li>
            <li>They are far better then the ones you get at the dollar store</li>
            <li>So if your looking for a water proof eye liner and lip liner, here it is definitely worth it 100%</li>
            <li>The price was right, and I thought they were worth the try.  </li>
            <li>would probably be great as play makeup for kids, but these are waxy, don&#x27;t last long, and are cheap in price for a reason.</li>
            <li>therefore some of the colors that I wouldn&#x27;t think about buying I now know that I won&#x27;t be wasting several more dollars just to find out they don&#x27;t look right on me.  </li>
            <li>got these VERY fast in the mail.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Mostly bought the eyeliner pencils for the nude and white pencils.  </li>
            <li>I love all the different colors for eyes and lips!</li>
            <li>I love the different colors.</li>
            <li>There smooth pencils not harsh like others  </li>
            <li>I have used in the past, I especially love all the different colors.</li>
            <li>these are not very big, more travel sized.</li>
            <li>Just arrived and they&#x27;re tiny, but that&#x27;s adorable.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and will be lining it over with the same colored eye shadow.</li>
            <li>They are very small but a great color selection.</li>
            <li>I like that they are small, which makes them good for travel.</li>
            <li>Got my eye liners and opened the package was expecting them to be a bit smaller but was surprised that they were a bit bigger, and already sharpened so i could just take them out of the package and use them instantly, best part is i only had to put them on once</li>
            <li>This is the third product that I have purchased from enice and everything has been super!</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty and vibrant though.</li>
            <li>they really were not anything to brag about but</li>
            <li>and you really have to press and keep going over the line to get it to show</li>
            <li>These colored pencils are very small, besides that the color is running very easily!</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have noted, the pencils are a bit on the smaller side, but other than that, they are wonderful!</li>
            <li>The pencils were kind of on the small side.</li>
            <li>Order it and never got it ,im glad I did not pay a lot, wont buy from there again its not worth the fight to complaine...</li>
            <li>but i guess since it was less than two dollars with no shipping and handling its okay</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more in the future.</li>
            <li>I never could get the other eye liner to go on but these or so easy go on</li>
            <li>These are tiny little pencils and though they work great, I wish they were regular sized.</li>
            <li>It seemed like a great deal for the variety of colors.&lt;br /&gt;However, I was wrong.</li>
            <li>Really cheaply made but expected for the price.</li>
            <li>I usually find that the cheaper eyeliners work better for me because my eyelids are very oily.  </li>
            <li>So not only did it go on chunky, but it smeared almost right away.  </li>
            <li>Live and learn</li>
            <li>Also I love the fact that they are small.</li>
            <li>however after using for 3 days I developed an eye infection.</li>
            <li>I tried 2 of them so far</li>
            <li>Got 2 sets and gave one to my 14 yr old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>Photo made them look full size, but in reality they are only about 1 inch long.</li>
            <li>so if you don&#x27;t have one its really not even worth buying.</li>
            <li>these are the size of mini pencils nice colors just not happy with size wont be buying again.</li>
            <li>hopefully it was worth it like my other makeup</li>
            <li>I received them on a few days ago and I am excited to use them this weekend.</li>
            <li>Yea the are small super small someone reviewed it would be the size of a cigarette um more like a cigarette that has been already lit, but for the price who cares your getting 12 different ones when they are finished just order again!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what i expected,!</li>
            <li>some u can barely see</li>
            <li>I am quite certain it was due to this liner... :</li>
            <li>When I went to use them, I tried the black first</li>
            <li>There are some who have complained about the size, so maybe the size was not in the original description, but for me, the only thing I would change is to add a list of the colors included.</li>
            <li>These eye liner pencils were cheap and are very hard to use.</li>

            <li> would probably be great as play makeup for kids, but these are waxy, don&#x27;t last long, and are cheap in price for a reason.</li>
            <li> therefore some of the colors that I wouldn&#x27;t think about buying I now know that I won&#x27;t be wasting several more dollars just to find out they don&#x27;t look right on me.  </li>
            <li> got these VERY fast in the mail.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Mostly bought the eyeliner pencils for the nude and white pencils.  </li>
            <li> I love all the different colors for eyes and lips!</li>
            <li> I love the different colors.</li>
            <li> There smooth pencils not harsh like others  </li>
            <li> I have used in the past, I especially love all the different colors.</li>
            <li> these are not very big, more travel sized.</li>
            <li> Just arrived and they&#x27;re tiny, but that&#x27;s adorable.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and will be lining it over with the same colored eye shadow.</li>
            <li> They are very small but a great color selection.</li>
            <li> I like that they are small, which makes them good for travel.</li>
            <li> Got my eye liners and opened the package was expecting them to be a bit smaller but was surprised that they were a bit bigger, and already sharpened so i could just take them out of the package and use them instantly, best part is i only had to put them on once</li>
            <li> This is the third product that I have purchased from enice and everything has been super!</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and vibrant though.</li>
            <li> they really were not anything to brag about but</li>
            <li> and you really have to press and keep going over the line to get it to show</li>
            <li> These colored pencils are very small, besides that the color is running very easily!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, the pencils are a bit on the smaller side, but other than that, they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> The pencils were kind of on the small side.</li>
            <li> Order it and never got it ,im glad I did not pay a lot, wont buy from there again its not worth the fight to complaine...</li>
            <li> but i guess since it was less than two dollars with no shipping and handling its okay</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more in the future.</li>
            <li> I never could get the other eye liner to go on but these or so easy go on</li>
            <li> These are tiny little pencils and though they work great, I wish they were regular sized.</li>
            <li> It seemed like a great deal for the variety of colors.&lt;br /&gt;However, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Really cheaply made but expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I usually find that the cheaper eyeliners work better for me because my eyelids are very oily.  </li>
            <li> So not only did it go on chunky, but it smeared almost right away.  </li>
            <li> Live and learn</li>
            <li> Also I love the fact that they are small.</li>
            <li> however after using for 3 days I developed an eye infection.</li>
            <li> I tried 2 of them so far</li>
            <li> Got 2 sets and gave one to my 14 yr old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> Photo made them look full size, but in reality they are only about 1 inch long.</li>
            <li> so if you don&#x27;t have one its really not even worth buying.</li>
            <li> these are the size of mini pencils nice colors just not happy with size wont be buying again.</li>
            <li> hopefully it was worth it like my other makeup</li>
            <li> I received them on a few days ago and I am excited to use them this weekend.</li>
            <li> Yea the are small super small someone reviewed it would be the size of a cigarette um more like a cigarette that has been already lit, but for the price who cares your getting 12 different ones when they are finished just order again!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what i expected,!</li>
            <li> some u can barely see</li>
            <li> I am quite certain it was due to this liner... :</li>
            <li> When I went to use them, I tried the black first</li>
            <li> There are some who have complained about the size, so maybe the size was not in the original description, but for me, the only thing I would change is to add a list of the colors included.</li>
            <li> These eye liner pencils were cheap and are very hard to use.</li>
            <li> They wont last long with every day use.</li>
            <li> I got these fairly quick, they are a little small in size</li>
            <li> otherwise my girl like them very much especially the pink one.</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected with it only costing a dollar and change!</li>
            <li> My daughters live to put in there small purses to gi</li>
            <li> I was kind of disappointed that they were trial size.</li>
            <li> I just wish they were a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> I bought these because i thought they&#x27;d be fun, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> A few people noted that these are tiny.</li>
            <li> They are small the size of crayons and do not last very long you will have to reapply.</li>
            <li> I just received these the other day</li>
            <li> its small it looks bigger on the picture</li>
            <li> Also came three days before expected delivery date!</li>
            <li> these suck they dont stay sharp and break all the time and some wont work at all</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;thumbs down ladies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application is tough as the consistency of the product is hard and very nontransferable.</li>
            <li> I wore the colors all night and stays in place, I just wished the pencils wear a little longer.</li>
            <li> If you wrap a little bit off plastic wrap around the pencil when you put it in your make-up case it will survive a night out on the town and you can come home and return it to the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> these really were a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Very small and shipping took longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I had to press really hard to get a little bit of pale color onto my eyelid.</li>
            <li> They are a little too hard to put on my lids</li>
            <li> The pencils were hard and did not glide on as eyeliner should.  </li>
            <li> you could hardly see any of the makeup once it was on..</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a christmas gift for someone and when they came in I could hardly resist opening them.  </li>
            <li> they are just to hard</li>
            <li> no quality, color is difficult to apply and pencils are very dry.</li>
            <li> Not amazing quality but</li>
            <li> I mean, c&#x27;mon, anyone buying this knows already (or should) that this is a Made in China piece of junk.</li>
            <li> However, mine took over a month and a half to arrive, so that was a little disappointing.  </li>
            <li> and it was difficult to apply because it kept breaking off little pieces onto my eyelid.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone but at the same time, for a dollar and some change I guess I can&#x27;t be all that disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> then it did not last the rest of the day very unhappy with this product</li>
            <li> Poor quality....</li>
            <li> not happy with order</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they did not suit my needs.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Took 23 days so not too bad coming from China...</li>
            <li> After a day of wearing it, I was shocked to see that there was no eyeliner where I placed it, instead it was all over the bottom of my eye.</li>
            <li> The quality is very bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love all of the unique colors!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for the sole purpose of having something compact to keep in on the go make up bag- which they are perfect for.  There are some great colors here, and I probably won&#x27;t use half of them- will pass them on to my teen age niece and her friends.  As others have said, you get what you pay for with these, and I&#x27;m one of those who like to try before I buy- therefore some of the colors that I wouldn&#x27;t think about buying I now know that I won&#x27;t be wasting several more dollars just to find out they don&#x27;t look right on me.  There are some who have complained about the size, so maybe the size was not in the original description, but for me, the only thing I would change is to add a list of the colors included.</li>
            <li> colors were great, went on with ease... however after using for 3 days I developed an eye infection. I am quite certain it was due to this liner... :(&lt;br /&gt;thumbs down ladies.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive set of colorful eyeliner works as good as you would expect. Use a primer first and something to set your makeup when you&#x27;ve finished application and you&#x27;ll have no problems at all!  Completely satisfied :-)</li>
            <li> Used an upclose picture to make the pencils seem larger than they actually are. I was disapointed with the item i recieved but i guess since it was less than two dollars with no shipping and handling its okay just not what i was expecting.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know they were mini pencils but..their quality is amazing.! I recommend everybody get this product! It&#x27;s amazing! Promis</li>
            <li> They work but not all of them paint the sane way some go on creamy some u can barely see but they good..</li>
            <li> Almost 100% sure these contain lead. Will never use them because of the risk of lead poisoning. I will gladly pay more for a product that doesn&#x27;t pose a risk to my health.</li>
            <li> Could have sworn I seen white.... which is what I wanted... maybe I&#x27;m mistaken because my set didn&#x27;t have white</li>
            <li> i really enjoyed these! still using them!</li>
            <li> Very small and shipping took longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I had to go across my eyelid to many times snd then it did not last the rest of the day very unhappy with this product</li>
            <li> These colored pencils are very small, besides that the color is running very easily! Definitely not recommended!! I will never buy them again.</li>
            <li> these eye sticks are very nice and easy to use. I am happy with product and would recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> This is great, the colors do not smear off the bottom of my waterline. I wore the colors all night and stays in place, I just wished the pencils wear a little longer. Worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Mostly bought the eyeliner pencils for the nude and white pencils.  The price was right, and I thought they were worth the try.  Unfortunately, they did not suit my needs.  The pencils were hard and did not glide on as eyeliner should.  Live and learn</li>
            <li> These pencils are great for makeup, Halloween, and we especially love them for giving the kids temporary tattoos.  They are fun to have a &amp;#34;girls dress up day&amp;#34; with also.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> OK BUT THE STICK ARE WAY SHORTER THAN IT LOOK ON THE PICTURE</li>
            <li> These are tiny little pencils and though they work great, I wish they were regular sized. Still, good price for what I got though.</li>
            <li> I just received these the other day I have not used them yet but I do like the colors they look beautiful they look like they are going to last me for a while hopefully it was worth it like my other makeup I&#x27;ve brought</li>
            <li> the pencils were really tiny..&lt;br /&gt;and you could hardly see any of the makeup once it was on..&lt;br /&gt;nice colors</li>
            <li> I liked the variety of the eyeliners. this would be a really great gift for any makeup artist. or as an xmas gift as well. i liked this.</li>
            <li> The pencils were great for the price, smooth application, easy clean sharpening, accurate coloring, thank you for the purchase, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  Thought it would be perfect for this.  My grand daughter will love it.</li>
            <li> They were very short. The picture made them look bigger.. otherwise my girl like them very much especially the pink one.</li>
            <li> since it is mostly of various colors it will be a perfect item to use at Haloween time to decorate the face...thank you</li>
            <li> I like these eyeliners. For the cost I&#x27;d say they work pretty darn good. Glide on easily. Received them before the date they provided me with. Will definitely order more in the future.</li>
            <li> These are so awesome and cute! Plus they came way earlier than I thought they would. Also I love the fact that they are small. I have to lean in close to the mirror to do my eyeliner and regular size pencils end up running into the mirror. So these are perfect!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product and see all the colors.  I had read the reviews and saw that most people loved them so I purchased without hesitation.  However, mine took over a month and a half to arrive, so that was a little disappointing.  When I went to use them, I tried the black first and it was difficult to apply because it kept breaking off little pieces onto my eyelid.  So not only did it go on chunky, but it smeared almost right away.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone but at the same time, for a dollar and some change I guess I can&#x27;t be all that disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> its small it looks bigger on the picture but I love that I have options... good price ... the only thing i do wish it was regular size pencils</li>
            <li> these really were a disappointment. they really were not anything to brag about but even with that said for the price they did make a nice stocking stuffer without having to leave my home to go get it</li>
            <li> these pencils were ok. The pencils were kind of on the small side. but overall they worked as cosmetic make up</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, the pencils are a bit on the smaller side, but other than that, they are wonderful! The color goes on beautifully, and lasts for a while! And for the price, I can say for sure I&#x27;ll be buying more when these finish!!! :D</li>
            <li> They are very creamy and easy to use and line or blend! I love all the different colors for eyes and lips!</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and stays on all day. Nice quality product</li>
            <li> Great product worth the price.  This is the third product that I have purchased from enice and everything has been super!</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a christmas gift for someone and when they came in I could hardly resist opening them.  I tried 2 of them so far and I LOVE them!!!!!!!  They are amazing and for the price, WOW!</li>
            <li> Pencils are okay. Photo made them look full size, but in reality they are only about 1 inch long. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I love the different colors. They are a bit smaller than I thought they would be. They wont last long with every day use. But all in all very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Good selection of colors, and they stay on very well, and water proof. I wish they were larger, but they were how I pictured them to be.</li>
            <li> There smooth pencils not harsh like others  I have used in the past, I especially love all the different colors.</li>
            <li> Excellent price! Nice array of colors. They go on easily. I like that they are small, which makes them good for travel.</li>
            <li> I ordered these eyeliners because they were cheap and cute. It seemed like a great deal for the variety of colors.&lt;br /&gt;However, I was wrong. I did receive the same colors of eyeliner that are pictured. The quality is very bad. I only use the brown eyeliner if I want to play up my lower waterline, but it doesn&#x27;t even serve that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is tough as the consistency of the product is hard and very nontransferable. I had to press really hard to get a little bit of pale color onto my eyelid. After a day of wearing it, I was shocked to see that there was no eyeliner where I placed it, instead it was all over the bottom of my eye. It looked like I couldn&#x27;t apply it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These eyeliners may be good for a young girl to learn to apply makeup, but if you are looking for some cheap working eyeliners, then go to the drugstore, they have higher quality makeup than this.</li>
            <li> They are a little too hard to put on my lids but I guess I could take a lighter to them to get better results!</li>
            <li> I bought these because i thought they&#x27;d be fun, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I usually find that the cheaper eyeliners work better for me because my eyelids are very oily.  And these work great, as long as you prime first, and set them with a powder or eye shadow.  Otherwise they just kind of naturally wear off.</li>
            <li> The pencils work great! They are really tiny but that is to be expected with it only costing a dollar and change! Absolutely love the colors! Would definitely buy again! Also came three days before expected delivery date! Took 23 days so not too bad coming from China...</li>
            <li> These are the size of a cigarette.  They go on smooth and creamy. Lovely colors. Wood is good when sharpening and does not splinter.</li>
            <li> I got these fairly quick, they are a little small in size however I did read that on another review before purchasing. The colors and nice and vibrant, they go on fairly easily too.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought  but work nicely I would buy again . My daughters live to put in there small purses to gi</li>
            <li> got these VERY fast in the mail.  Got 2 sets and gave one to my 14 yr old granddaughter.  We both love them.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> They are very small but a great color selection. My daughter loves them! I just wish they were a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> For the price not bad at all. They are small the size of crayons and do not last very long you will have to reapply.</li>
            <li> I love this product its so awesome it goes on greatly and I would buy this over and over again</li>
            <li> these suck they dont stay sharp and break all the time and some wont work at all so i threw them out!!!!</li>
            <li> These eye liner pencils were cheap and are very hard to use. I would not recommend these to anyone. I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I mean, c&#x27;mon, anyone buying this knows already (or should) that this is a Made in China piece of junk. This is not going to be quality eyeliner. I only needed the white pencil, and the white pencil definitely DOES not even color at all. It produces nothing. I just threw the rest in the trash. Poor quality....but if you&#x27;re looking to buy them, you probably don&#x27;t even care about that.</li>
            <li> Love the colors that come in this. Wortg the money.</li>
            <li> I havent tried them yet, but keep in mind that the pencils are quite smaller - shorter than my pinky finger, which is a reason for the price.</li>
            <li> I thought the pencils would be bigger. I was kind of disappointed that they were trial size. The colors are pretty and vibrant though.</li>
            <li> Really cheaply made but expected for the price. Works as Halloween make up. Does not come with a sharpener so if you don&#x27;t have one its really not even worth buying.</li>
            <li> these are not very big, more travel sized. Color selection is cute. I used these as a stocking stuffer for my daughter&#x27;s birthday party.</li>
            <li> would probably be great as play makeup for kids, but these are waxy, don&#x27;t last long, and are cheap in price for a reason. There are lots of colors, but if you are looking for value and quality, keep looking</li>
            <li> save you money, they don&#x27;t  work any better than map colors. I would recommend buying from a dollar store or walgreens.</li>
            <li> not happy with order these are the size of mini pencils nice colors just not happy with size wont be buying again.</li>
            <li> Just arrived and they&#x27;re tiny, but that&#x27;s adorable. The colors are nice and the wood looks like the type that won&#x27;t splinter. I must note though, it says on here that these are eye and brow liners. Yet, on the actual pencils it says eye and lip pencils.</li>
            <li> Not amazing quality but what was I expecting?! I love the colors and will be lining it over with the same colored eye shadow. It&#x27;ll last longer.:) Trust me.</li>
            <li> I received them on a few days ago and I am excited to use them this weekend. They are beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> Great for the eyes and lips! Bought two sets, one as a gift and they loved them! Enough colors to satisfy everyone.</li>
            <li> A few people noted that these are tiny. I don&#x27;t remember reading anywhere in the description that they are full size. They aren&#x27;t. They are mini eyeliner/brow liner/lip liner pencils. And they&#x27;re nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine arrived in a bubble wrapped mailer -- one note that may be important to some -- made in China, shipped from China. The colors are vibrant and perfect for anyone who likes to have a variety of colors on hand and likes a small pencil to put in their purse on the way out the door for a touch-up or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note however (see my photos) that the pencils come in ONE case and they do not have caps on them, thus making portability an issue. If you wrap a little bit off plastic wrap around the pencil when you put it in your make-up case it will survive a night out on the town and you can come home and return it to the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/18/15 -- upon further inspection each of the pencils in my kit has a cap on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I received a sample of this product (either free or at a discounted price) in exchange for my honest review. All opinions stated are that of my own&lt;br /&gt;and have in no way been swayed.***</li>
            <li> These are tiny (about the length of a q-tip, but are great quality!</li>
            <li> I bought several of these to add to my girlfriends&#x27; Christmas presents. I popped one open and tried one to see if they were any good. They&#x27;re not bad for the price. Doesn&#x27;t come on as smooth as what I&#x27;m used to. (I have Kat Von D eyeliners). But for a cheap addition to a gift bag for a makeup lover it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Yea the are small super small someone reviewed it would be the size of a cigarette um more like a cigarette that has been already lit, but for the price who cares your getting 12 different ones when they are finished just order again!  Its worth the price and the wear is great!</li>
            <li> Could be a bit bigger but ya get what ya pay for. They are far better then the ones you get at the dollar store</li>
            <li> Order it and never got it ,im glad I did not pay a lot, wont buy from there again its not worth the fight to complaine...</li>
            <li> no quality, color is difficult to apply and pencils are very dry. may try heating it up and melting to see if it helps</li>
            <li> A great variety of colors, but I wish they were softer.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i expected,! Real cute and tiny, colors are bright.</li>
            <li> Would be good for Halloween</li>
            <li> these pencils do  not work well at all they are just to hard and you really have to press and keep going over the line to get it to show but I am going to keep them around for Halloween you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> They smear more than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Got my eye liners and opened the package was expecting them to be a bit smaller but was surprised that they were a bit bigger, and already sharpened so i could just take them out of the package and use them instantly, best part is i only had to put them on once and it stayed all day, There is a con to this pro, getting it off was a pain since there water proof! I had to use my makeup remover and that didnt even take it all off! So if your looking for a water proof eye liner and lip liner, here it is definitely worth it 100% no smudges easy to blend, stays in place all day, and thats 12 hours or more, even fell asleep and woke up and it was still in place!</li>
            <li> I never could get the other eye liner to go on but these or so easy go on great I love you them</li>
