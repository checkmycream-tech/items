    <ol>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>Great for kids!</li>
            <li>Color was perfect!</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great for my 3yo child.</li>
            <li>Great bonding moment to sit and do your nails with your grandchild as I do.  </li>
            <li>more manicure times!</li>
            <li>I think this is perfect as a first nailpolish.  </li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t own the Piggy Remover</li>
            <li>so I felt like it was time for her to get her own nail polish.  </li>
            <li>The color of this nail polish was nice.</li>
            <li>I honestly wouldn&#x27;t bother getting this shade if I were to do it all over again.</li>
            <li>We love this SAFE product.</li>
            <li>This was just okay.  </li>
            <li>CUTE PACKAGING....</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>This nail polish is adorable on my daughter and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s one of the safest brands out there.</li>
            <li>The polish also dries quickly and sort of fades off on its own</li>
            <li>Color is great for a young girl</li>
            <li>I love this polish because it is free of harmful chemicals and doesn&#x27;t require polish remover when you want to take the polish off.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is chemical free but comes off easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural so it won&#x27;t harm she when she chews it off :P</li>
            <li>It goes on fine</li>
            <li>She was too excited and super cute.  </li>
            <li>The important thing is not getting yucky chemicals in their mouths.</li>
            <li>It has the lowest toxicity rating on the Environmental Working Group website and it really doesn&#x27;t have any kind of smell.  </li>
            <li>I love that this is a water based polish for my two year old daughter, but it chips way too easily!</li>
            <li>I also bought the top coat for the first time and it also dries quickly and protects the Piggy paint somewhat.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to try on my toes (or, &amp;#34;piggy&#x27;s&amp;#34; :) ) as I don&#x27;t really wear nail polish on my finger nails.  </li>
            <li>I had to really rub and rub the nails with a remover soaked cotton ball and after a while, most of it came off</li>
            <li>I just do one coat and blow on them quickly so that it dries before she&#x27;s off and running.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty light colored.</li>
            <li>Definitely want more colors!</li>
            <li>Fun for Gramma and granddaughter.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is safe for little ones to use.</li>
            <li>but it does not last more than a day or so.</li>
            <li>and I had the hardest time getting it off with traditional nail polish remover (which also defeated the purpose of going more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>It stays on a little better on her toes, but then comes off way too easily in the bath.</li>
            <li>the other piggy paints we own are pretty well pigmented.</li>
            <li>I had read that it might take longer to dry and chips off easily, but that wasn&#x27;t the case for us at all!</li>
            <li>It is so close to my daughter&#x27;s nail color that you only notice she&#x27;s wearing polish if the light hits the sparkles just right.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind that it wears off pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>Aren&#x27;t they cute enough already?&amp;#34; But I love this product and couldn&#x27;t care less about strangers hating on cute pink baby toenails.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>She wants use nail polish but always puts hands in her mouth.</li>
            <li>I tested it on my toenails before using it on my daughter and no matter how much nail polish remover or scrubbing, it wouldn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li>I am much happier with Forever Fancy and use that one quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more natural choice with low to no odor.  </li>
            <li>it comes out looking more like a pearlescent light, light, pale, shimmery pink.</li>
            <li>They can have neon blue nails when they&#x27;re a little older :-P  </li>
            <li>this sweetpea sparkly light pink piggy paint is one of the 4 bottles of piggy paint we own (red \\&quot;sometimes sweet\\&quot;, purple \\&quot;midnight pansy\\&quot;, blue \\&quot;sea quin\\&quot;) and i have to say,</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li>and i feel safe putting it on her little toes.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t enough to bother my chemical sensitivity and it went away pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>Painted my daughters piggies the other night and the color is really light.  </li>
            <li>Since it isn&#x27;t like the heavy duty, toxic stuff we would normally buy as adults, it does chip and peel off relatively easy.</li>
            <li>My one-year-old got her first mani-pedi for her big birthday bast.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sheer.</li>
            <li>Stays on her good enough, as well as commercial polish if not better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nontoxic, so safe for baby&#x27;s delicate skin and toes.</li>
            <li>My 3 yr old loves this.  </li>
            <li>I like natural neutral shades myself</li>
            <li>Dries fast enough, so she doesn&#x27;t smudge it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural, just wish the pink was more PINK.</li>
            <li>I like the color, a light pink that took about two coats to fully show, and it lasted on my toes for about 2 weeks with a little chipping on one toe after the first week.  </li>
            <li>None of the Piggie Paint is very long lasting, but if you do two coats with a topcoat you will feel like it was worth the effort to paint a wiggly baby/toddler&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li>i was looking for something with a little bit more pigment and just ordered the forever fancy pink.</li>
            <li>but it really takes FOREVER to dry -</li>
            <li>Like the product but wish I had gotten a darker color--it barely shows up on my daughter&#x27;s toes!</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it looks clearer than it does pink and it peels right off (for me</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to blow dry my nails for one minute and the paint dried very quickly.  </li>
            <li>which considering you&#x27;re using it on kids makes it tough to give it anything more than 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>Color barely showed up even with two coats.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just because she is a kid, but this stuff seems to wear off quickly.</li>
            <li>The color is a sheer, pale shimmery pink which is nice for any little girl.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> i didn&#x27;t want to rate it lower just because the color was so light - you NEED at LEAST 2 coats of this stuff (and any other piggy paint you purchase) to get any sort of wear longer than a day or two.</li>
            <li> this is a very faint color, great for my little one.</li>
            <li> but i guess that&#x27;s what you expect from non toxic nailpolish on an active 3 yr old.</li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t last as long as regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> In order to get it as dark as the picture, I would have to put 3 coats on, and that&#x27;s not happening with a 2 year old.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li> Little pricey but worth it for my little one.</li>
            <li> Like within a few hours, I see paint near her mouth</li>
            <li> It adds a little shimmer without being really obvious, which is what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> realized pink.</li>
            <li> It dried quicker than a regular nail polish would</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real noticeable.</li>
            <li> I guess because it&#x27;s pink</li>
            <li> The problem was that it only lasted about a day and was hard to remove.</li>
            <li> My little two year loves to get her nails painted and stays still while I do them.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 bottles and a polish remover, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but some is still left behind.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Also it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> Appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have the bad stuff in it</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not worried that she&#x27;s eating nasty chemical-laden polish.</li>

            <li> Color is great for a young girl but it does not last more than a day or so.</li>
            <li> I love that this is a water based polish for my two year old daughter, but it chips way too easily! Like within a few hours, I see paint near her mouth and I don&#x27;t like that. It stays on a little better on her toes, but then comes off way too easily in the bath. I bought 3 bottles and a polish remover, what a waste of money.</li>

            <li> My one-year-old got her first mani-pedi for her big birthday bast.  She was too excited and super cute.  We love this SAFE product.</li>
            <li> Like the product but wish I had gotten a darker color--it barely shows up on my daughter&#x27;s toes!</li>
            <li> I bought this to try on my toes (or, &amp;#34;piggy&#x27;s&amp;#34; :) ) as I don&#x27;t really wear nail polish on my finger nails.  I was looking for a more natural choice with low to no odor.  This was just okay.  I like the color, a light pink that took about two coats to fully show, and it lasted on my toes for about 2 weeks with a little chipping on one toe after the first week.  It was definitely low in odor, but there was a scent. It wasn&#x27;t enough to bother my chemical sensitivity and it went away pretty fast.  I followed the instructions to blow dry my nails for one minute and the paint dried very quickly.  However, I don&#x27;t own the Piggy Remover and I had the hardest time getting it off with traditional nail polish remover (which also defeated the purpose of going more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;).  I had to really rub and rub the nails with a remover soaked cotton ball and after a while, most of it came off but some is still left behind. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it again for that reason.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to have comments like, &amp;#34;why would you paint your baby&#x27;s toes? Aren&#x27;t they cute enough already?&amp;#34; But I love this product and couldn&#x27;t care less about strangers hating on cute pink baby toenails. It&#x27;s nontoxic, so safe for baby&#x27;s delicate skin and toes. Since it isn&#x27;t like the heavy duty, toxic stuff we would normally buy as adults, it does chip and peel off relatively easy. Great buy! Definitely want more colors!</li>
            <li> this sweetpea sparkly light pink piggy paint is one of the 4 bottles of piggy paint we own (red \\&quot;sometimes sweet\\&quot;, purple \\&quot;midnight pansy\\&quot;, blue \\&quot;sea quin\\&quot;) and i have to say, it&#x27;s a LOT lighter than it looks on the screen. it comes out looking more like a pearlescent light, light, pale, shimmery pink. i was looking for something with a little bit more pigment and just ordered the forever fancy pink. the other piggy paints we own are pretty well pigmented. i didn&#x27;t want to rate it lower just because the color was so light - you NEED at LEAST 2 coats of this stuff (and any other piggy paint you purchase) to get any sort of wear longer than a day or two.</li>
            <li> My 3 yr old loves this.  only stays on for a day but i guess that&#x27;s what you expect from non toxic nailpolish on an active 3 yr old.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is safe for little ones to use. I like natural neutral shades myself so I like this pea realized pink. It&#x27;s very sheer and goes with everything. My little two year loves to get her nails painted and stays still while I do them. I just do one coat and blow on them quickly so that it dries before she&#x27;s off and running. It doesn&#x27;t last too long but oh well- more manicure times! Great product.  Little pricey but worth it for my little one.</li>
            <li> PRICEY....CUTE PACKAGING....</li>
            <li> I think this is perfect as a first nailpolish.  It adds a little shimmer without being really obvious, which is what I wanted.  They can have neon blue nails when they&#x27;re a little older :-P  I don&#x27;t mind that it wears off pretty fast.  The important thing is not getting yucky chemicals in their mouths.</li>
            <li> NO ODOR!  My Mom is allergic to chemicals like nail polish, but this, she can use --no problem!  Such a godsend to her!</li>
            <li> My daughter just turned 3 and is always fascinated by my toenails after I come home from getting a pedicure so I felt like it was time for her to get her own nail polish.  This was the only brand I considered since its not only marketed for kids but also non-toxic.  It has the lowest toxicity rating on the Environmental Working Group website and it really doesn&#x27;t have any kind of smell.  The color is a sheer, pale shimmery pink which is nice for any little girl.  The polish also dries quickly and sort of fades off on its own so I haven&#x27;t had to buy the Piggy Pain nail polish remover.  I would definitely purchase more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Came out of the package and had to send back.  Looked like&lt;br /&gt;good paint!</li>
            <li> Ok. Pretty sheer. I only pant my toenails and spend a lot of time barefoot outside....you could always see the dirt haha. If that doesn&#x27;t apply to you then I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love that it is chemical free but comes off easily. So it doesn&#x27;t last as long as regular nail polish. Also it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> I have allergies so these polishes allow me to paint my girl&#x27;s nails without a problem. The only downside is that it looks clearer than it does pink and it peels right off (for me that&#x27;s a plus too because I don&#x27;t need to use polish remover).</li>
            <li> I love this polish because it is free of harmful chemicals and doesn&#x27;t require polish remover when you want to take the polish off.  Great for kids!</li>
            <li> Great for my 3yo child. She wants use nail polish but always puts hands in her mouth. Now I&#x27;m not worried that she&#x27;s eating nasty chemical-laden polish. Stays on her good enough, as well as commercial polish if not better.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but my daughter loves it. Glad it&#x27;s natural so it won&#x27;t harm she when she chews it off :P Dries fast enough, so she doesn&#x27;t smudge it.</li>
            <li> Painted my daughters piggies the other night and the color is really light.  In order to get it as dark as the picture, I would have to put 3 coats on, and that&#x27;s not happening with a 2 year old.  I do like that it&#x27;s all natural, just wish the pink was more PINK.</li>
            <li> Appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have the bad stuff in it but it really takes FOREVER to dry - which considering you&#x27;re using it on kids makes it tough to give it anything more than 3 stars.  Color was perfect!</li>
            <li> Piggy Paint is non-toxic.  Dries quickly.  Great bonding moment to sit and do your nails with your grandchild as I do.  I also bought the top coat for the first time and it also dries quickly and protects the Piggy paint somewhat.  Fun for Gramma and granddaughter.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is adorable on my daughter and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s one of the safest brands out there. I had read that it might take longer to dry and chips off easily, but that wasn&#x27;t the case for us at all! It dried quicker than a regular nail polish would and I couldn&#x27;t get it off if I wanted to! Literally. I tested it on my toenails before using it on my daughter and no matter how much nail polish remover or scrubbing, it wouldn&#x27;t come off. This might seem like a problem for some people, but if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t like repainting your nails (or your daughter&#x27;s) often, I find it to be a plus.</li>
            <li> The color of this nail polish was nice. The problem was that it only lasted about a day and was hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just because she is a kid, but this stuff seems to wear off quickly. It goes on fine and she loves it. It&#x27;s not real noticeable. I guess because it&#x27;s pink and it&#x27;s pretty light colored.</li>
            <li> I honestly wouldn&#x27;t bother getting this shade if I were to do it all over again. It is so close to my daughter&#x27;s nail color that you only notice she&#x27;s wearing polish if the light hits the sparkles just right. I am much happier with Forever Fancy and use that one quite a bit. This one has only been used about once a month since I purchased it. None of the Piggie Paint is very long lasting, but if you do two coats with a topcoat you will feel like it was worth the effort to paint a wiggly baby/toddler&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> this is a very faint color, great for my little one. there is no smell and i feel safe putting it on her little toes.</li>
