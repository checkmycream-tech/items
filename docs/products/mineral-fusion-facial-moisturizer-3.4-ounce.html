            <li>and then the smell is appropriate.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands and none of them worked as well as Mineral Fusion.</li>
            <li>so I have to give this more time.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer caused me to fall in love with the mineral fusion line of skin care.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to have this on hand all the time.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>love this moisturizer, its Paraben free with peptides and you get a lot for the money!</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this facial moisturizer for over 6 months now and my skin has never been so great!  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>My friend introduced me to Mineral Fusion and let me try hers, I loved it the first try and wanted to buy it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you are good for the whole day!  </li>
            <li>A great moisturizer for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer, it&#x27;s very well balanced, not too strong but not too soft, I use it just once a day after the shower, and it leaves my skin hydrated and perfect</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll wear it primarily at night.</li>
            <li>GREAT moisturizer, I use it daily</li>
            <li>And even if the price may be more than you&#x27;d like, it is WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>I can report smooth moisturised skin and reduced pore size.</li>
            <li>and I think having a nice, clean moisturizer like this really helps.  </li>
            <li>do not think it makes a huge difference in the texture of my skin or the fine lines (it has peptides, so it should), but I was only looking for a good moisturizer anyway.</li>
            <li>Overall a good moisturizer that absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>my favorite hidratation leave he skin very refresh</li>
            <li>I like that this absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on how young I look!</li>
            <li>A little dab on each cheek and your forehead and it feels great - not too greasy.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent everyday face lotion that I wear alone or under sunscreen when necessary.</li>
            <li>This fits the bill and is very gentle.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and light, not harsh.</li>
            <li>I looked the product up on SkinDeep before purchasing and it had a very low rating, a 1 or 2, which means the ingredients are not toxic and safe.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the BB cream as well!!</li>
            <li>The texture is perfect - light enough that it absorbs quickly, but thick enough to hold the moisture in all day.</li>
            <li>I got my first tube at Whole Foods for $24</li>
            <li>I left off one star because the scent is a bit strong for me.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Have an oily skin, seems to be cooperating with it very well.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised that my skin complexion looked brighter and felt softer in the first week.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have the chance to give this item a try, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Mineral Fusion has a website and you can order this directly from them!!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>No one believe I am as old as I am, so I think it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like I need to turn back around and put more on, like other products.  </li>
            <li>Some products helped a little but just not enough for me to consider purchasing them again and many of them I just trashed.</li>
            <li>Skin feels moisturized and soft, not lotion-y or greasy.</li>
            <li>and I believe I have finally found a moisturizer that is gentle</li>
            <li>So far I have used it for a month</li>
            <li>It smells like natural aroma from Earth</li>
            <li>I am 43 years old</li>
            <li>I had allergies and my nose was dry and peeling from blowing it, and the first day I used this moisturizer the flakiness went away.</li>
            <li>So it works really well on dry and damaged skin.</li>
            <li>I am Chinese and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I got several other items but sadly all of the Skin Balancing Facial Moisturizer was gone, so I knew my next best place to look would be Amazon!</li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone that has dry sensitive skin, and any normal skin type.</li>
            <li>I use a few other products from this brand and love them all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a fortune looking for a magical product to at least rid myself of part of the damage to my skin from tanning.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the right face moisturizer for Asian skin.</li>
            <li> By sheer luck I was searching the clearance racks at the local Ulta store for bargains and ran across this item, it was marked down to $5.99 from $24.99.</li>
            <li> I realized it isn&#x27;t quite enough moisture when my skin gets really dry, but, lo and behold</li>
            <li> but the breakout is not nearly as severe and doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a little overpowering and unpleasant, but luckily it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> The crows feet were barely there and other wrinkles were gone!</li>
            <li> I used to have really bad skin but in the last year or so, I&#x27;ve been able to get it under control</li>
            <li> the Winter I have dry patches on my face.</li>
            <li> Also, I haven&#x27;t had a single outbreak of pimples, acne, or blackheads since then.</li>
            <li> In three days I eliminated the damage I spent years creating.</li>
            <li> Lotion is thick and pasty, goes on WHITE like thick sunscreen and stays white for a little while until it soaks in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells a little to lavender/herby for my taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a balance, between too thick and greasy, and not enough moisture.  </li>
            <li> I still have combination skin and need a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too heavy.  </li>
            <li> NOT a good face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Anyone who says this doesn&#x27;t work miracles is wrong.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> OMG I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect face lotion. Smells wonderful (I love lavendar!) Great under makeup, before bed, after shower, whenever. Skin feels moisturized and soft, not lotion-y or greasy. Def will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Very light. Love it during summer time. My boyfriend steals it from me all the time. Wish they had larger quantity tubes.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer ever. I used to have really bad skin but in the last year or so, I&#x27;ve been able to get it under control and I think having a nice, clean moisturizer like this really helps.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily at all but still leaves me feeling moisturized for the entire day.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love it but it doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen, so I&#x27;ll wear it primarily at night.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a year now.  I got my first tube at Whole Foods for $24 and I when I needed another one I look to Amazon.  I was happy to see it cheaper on here and delivered to my door, you can&#x27;t bet that!  It smells nice, it doesn&#x27;t break my skin out and goes on nicely. I use it once a day in the morning and the tube lasts me one year.</li>
            <li> GREAT moisturizer, I use it daily</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I believe I have finally found a moisturizer that is gentle, doesn&#x27;t make me breakout, and is safe for my skin! I looked the product up on SkinDeep before purchasing and it had a very low rating, a 1 or 2, which means the ingredients are not toxic and safe.</li>
            <li> The texture is perfect - light enough that it absorbs quickly, but thick enough to hold the moisture in all day. I had allergies and my nose was dry and peeling from blowing it, and the first day I used this moisturizer the flakiness went away. So it works really well on dry and damaged skin. The scent is a little overpowering and unpleasant, but luckily it wears off quickly. I just pretend I&#x27;m at the spa and then the smell is appropriate.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would find a facial moisturizer that would work for me. I have tried many brands and none of them worked as well as Mineral Fusion. I have finally found the one! I am Chinese and have very sensitive skin. It&#x27;s hard to find the right face moisturizer for Asian skin. My friend introduced me to Mineral Fusion and let me try hers, I loved it the first try and wanted to buy it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Winter I have dry patches on my face. So far I have used it for a month and I was surprised that my skin complexion looked brighter and felt softer in the first week. Also, I haven&#x27;t had a single outbreak of pimples, acne, or blackheads since then. It smells like natural aroma from Earth and it&#x27;s soothing in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone that has dry sensitive skin, and any normal skin type. It is very gentle and light, not harsh. It will feel like you&#x27;re applying lotion on your face, except it&#x27;s very light and non oily. It leaves your skin feeling moisturized and rejuvenated! And even if the price may be more than you&#x27;d like, it is WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> You can feel the moisture going into your skin. Supple, wonderful and my skin looks fabulous!  No one believe I am as old as I am, so I think it&#x27;s working! I highly reccomend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now a month since I began using this product. I can say my skin looks wonderful. the wrinkles haven&#x27;t faded yet, but it took me 65 years to get them so I have to give this more time. I can report smooth moisturised skin and reduced pore size. Both huge plusses in my book! I will oder it again.</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer for sensitive skin. This moisturizer caused me to fall in love with the mineral fusion line of skin care. This is an excellent everyday face lotion that I wear alone or under sunscreen when necessary. I realized it isn&#x27;t quite enough moisture when my skin gets really dry, but, lo and behold I discovered the &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; facial moisturizer by the same brand and my problems were solved. Very happy with these products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  Let it absorb and you are good for the whole day!  I am 43 years old and I use this at night as well. I get so many compliments on how young I look! I highly recommend the BB cream as well!!</li>
            <li> I would give this ten stars if I could. At age 68 and being a sun lover I have a lot of wrinkles. I&#x27;ve spent a fortune looking for a magical product to at least rid myself of part of the damage to my skin from tanning. Some products helped a little but just not enough for me to consider purchasing them again and many of them I just trashed. So I figured I would give this a shot. Why not? When it came I decided to not look in the mirror for three days so I wouldn&#x27;t see a gradual change. After three days of using this product I couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing. The crows feet were barely there and other wrinkles were gone! In three days I eliminated the damage I spent years creating. Anyone who says this doesn&#x27;t work miracles is wrong. I will be sure to have this on hand all the time. If you want to look younger in three days buy this.</li>
            <li> By sheer luck I was searching the clearance racks at the local Ulta store for bargains and ran across this item, it was marked down to $5.99 from $24.99. I read the ingredients and decided to try it, for the price, why not? I fell in love with it. The smell is wonderful, it feels nice on my face and I use it morning and night and I can honestly say I notice a difference in the way my skin looks and feels. I never heard of this brand before but I decided after trying it I would go back to Ulta and buy the rest of the Mineral Fusion products they had on clearance. I got several other items but sadly all of the Skin Balancing Facial Moisturizer was gone, so I knew my next best place to look would be Amazon! If you have the chance to give this item a try, I highly recommend it. I also did a search on the internet thinking this might be a discontinued item but it&#x27;s not. Mineral Fusion has a website and you can order this directly from them!!</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer.  I left off one star because the scent is a bit strong for me.  However this is an organic product so I know it is a good product I am using.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer EVER</li>
            <li> love this moisturizer, its Paraben free with peptides and you get a lot for the money! will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  A little dab on each cheek and your forehead and it feels great - not too greasy.  I also love the smell.  Will continue to use it as it is well priced too.  Have given it to others who also love it!</li>
            <li> I still have combination skin and need a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too heavy.  This fits the bill and is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, it&#x27;s very well balanced, not too strong but not too soft, I use it just once a day after the shower, and it leaves my skin hydrated and perfect</li>
            <li> Have an oily skin, seems to be cooperating with it very well. Will buy it again once I run out of it. (which has never happened before!)&lt;br /&gt;I do not think it makes a huge difference in the texture of my skin or the fine lines (it has peptides, so it should), but I was only looking for a good moisturizer anyway.</li>
            <li> Overall a good moisturizer that absorbs well.  It does tend to make my face seem a bit oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this facial moisturizer for over 6 months now and my skin has never been so great!  I love it.  I have acne prone skin and I still break out around my cycle but the breakout is not nearly as severe and doesn&#x27;t last as long.  Feels wonderful on and I don&#x27;t feel like I need to turn back around and put more on, like other products.  I use a few other products from this brand and love them all.</li>
            <li> Lotion is thick and pasty, goes on WHITE like thick sunscreen and stays white for a little while until it soaks in. NOT a good face moisturizer. Maybe good for heels and elbows...</li>
            <li> my favorite hidratation leave he skin very refresh</li>
            <li> Best Moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Works great as a moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t take any time for your skin to adjust to it.  Really good product.</li>
            <li> I like the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR REDUCING WRINKLES AND LINES EVER!!!</li>
            <li> I have been trying a lot of different night lotions for my face.  It&#x27;s hard to find a balance, between too thick and greasy, and not enough moisture.  I like that this absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized.  However I don&#x27;t like the smell.  It&#x27;s smells a little to lavender/herby for my taste.</li>
            <li> It is a nice moisturizer, I would not combine it with make up though because anytime i put make up on over this I broke out. Otherwise it is a good moisturizer.</li>
