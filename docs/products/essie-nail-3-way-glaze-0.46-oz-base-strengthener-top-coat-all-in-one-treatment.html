            <li>Also nice to use without a nail polish.</li>
            <li>, I decided to purchase my favorite Target-brand of nail polish, Essie.</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly and my manicure lasted several days without chipping.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the extra strength this adds to my thin/</li>
            <li>goes on easy and holds my nail polish on longer.</li>
            <li>I already have naturally strong nails</li>
            <li>I also used it by itself  and it leaves a beautiful, mild glossy finish on natural nails while making them strong and secure against breakage.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate the 3 free aspect of Essie and the polish works eventually.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ll probably use this primarily as a basecoat and get a quicker drying topcoat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super shiny and I love how my manicure still looks fresh after a week.</li>
            <li>I searched forever for the original 3-way glaze, but this product has replaced it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the original one.  </li>
            <li>It not only adds a nice glaze to your nails, but I&#x27;ve noticed that my polish stays on longer!</li>
            <li>This is a great topcoat if you have all day to wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li>I read reviews first and look at how many stars and item gets to help me decide if the purchase is worth my time and money.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Helps my nail polish last longer and my nails have never looked better!</li>
            <li>This product seems to dry fairly quickly (I haven&#x27;t timed it) and it has a nice shine to it.  </li>
            <li>I am going to  try the quick dry top coat instead.</li>
            <li>I like the product because it&#x27;s helped my nails stay healthy despite two back to</li>
            <li>(I realize this would be different with fingernails, which are more exposed).  </li>
            <li>will definitely be buying more of this when I run out.  </li>
            <li>The glaze makes it shiny but not over the top, and my nails definitely feel stronger.</li>
            <li>I make sure to put an extra coat on the corners of my nails every couple of days.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m lucky to get 3-4 days normally).</li>
            <li>Perfect to use as a base and top coat.</li>
            <li>This is my first 3-in-1 type deal,  so I really like that.  </li>
            <li>It legitimately took hours if not a day to dry and this is with Quick-E on top.</li>
            <li>Does take a while to dry, but I love the thickness</li>
            <li>sometimes flake prone nails and while it does take a while to dry, using it as a top coat</li>
            <li>Fast shipping by seller.</li>
            <li>If it really works as advertised I can&#x27;t say.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Seller is very prompt as well.</li>
            <li>I guess it strengthens your nails, haven&#x27;t really noticed it too much.</li>
            <li>Very runny.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My nails grow much longer and don&#x27;t break if I do that and have been doing so for years.</li>
            <li>but I much prefer this formula.  </li>
            <li>really liking it.</li>
            <li>Dries fast, but does not seem to stop the colour from permeating my nails.</li>
            <li>Helps lengthen my manicure by a few days and makes my nails look nice.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m in a hurry, I&#x27;ll go back to my quick dry top coat (also by Essie)</li>
            <li>but since i started using this strengthener and top coat in one, they grow long and so far have not broken.</li>
            <li>I polished my nails in the morning, then went out in the late afternoon and managed to get indents/imprints in them doing normal things, and then that night, a good 14 hours after I&#x27;d polished them, I went to bed and woke up with my sheets imprinted into my nails.</li>
            <li>Pretty quick to dry.</li>
            <li>Works great as either a top or base coat, or use as both.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li>it does just what it states a high gloss shine and helps with nail art adhering to your nails.</li>
            <li>Super shiny and glossy nail glaze that really does reek like mad acetone but offer superior shine and protection to your manicure.</li>
            <li>and it always dries fast on my natural nails.</li>
            <li>I like the fluidity of glaze, not too thin or too thick and easy to apply for a beautiful finish.  </li>
            <li>And if it matters, I used Kleancolor brand for the color, which was also a new purchase for me.  </li>
            <li>I have sheet prints in my nails (painted before lunch) which I am pretending is one of the new on-trend-nail-art-y designs.</li>
            <li>Using this as both a base and top coat seals my manicure for a good 7-10 days, which is unheard of with my nails</li>
            <li>This all-in-one top coat works well, but it takes a really long time to dry.  </li>
            <li>Makes my nail polish last SO much longer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big on doing my nails, so I don&#x27;t have much experience with a variety of brands or products of the like to do comparisons.  </li>
            <li>But its not a good top coat, doesn&#x27;t keep nail polish on longer.</li>
            <li>But the day following a new manicure, my nail polish would already be flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I started using this 3-way glaze as a base and top coat, my nails are chip free for FIVE days!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it only once so far, but it seems to hold up well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product only once thus far, but I think it worked well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried with one colour so far, so I&#x27;ll have to see how it works with others.</li>
            <li>Works as it says but it doesnt dry fast enough for me and my nails get destroyed...</li>
            <li>Almost a week later, my nail polish is barely showing bare nails.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the top coat base coat and strengthened all being rolled into one.</li>
            <li>I chose this as a top coat and a base coat because it seemed more convenient to keep track of only a single product.  </li>
            <li>My manicure last much longer than with other brands.</li>

            <li> My manicure last much longer than with other brands.</li>
            <li> I was also interested in the strengthening properties, since I have been stubbing my toes and breaking toenails a lot lately</li>
            <li> It really does keep polish on for quite a long time, but it is &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; for at least 12 hours --</li>
            <li> It works for base coat and top coat, but I rather buy revlon&#x27;s quick dry base and top coat for around $4 each than get this again.</li>
            <li> i love it and it wasn&#x27;t as expensive as it is in target!</li>
            <li> thing to note is that it takes a bit longer for the nail polish and topcoat to dry</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to dry over other coats.</li>
            <li> Only lasted a FEW days.</li>
            <li> I use this as a base and/or top coat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as a base coat, added color then used it again as a top coat.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been probably about 3 weeks since I applied this as a base and top coat, and my nail polish hasn&#x27;t quite chipped off half yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m clueless when it comes to nail polish, but I recently decided to at least try a few things with my toenails.  </li>
            <li> My nail polish would always chip (regardless of which brand I use) in less than 48 hours.</li>
            <li> i think it takes a day to completely dry hard</li>
            <li> I have two little kids 2 and 1 y.o.</li>
            <li> I just getting tired of the same color and change it.</li>
            <li> I have been playing around with glitter polish lately, and I think using this as a base coat before applying the glitter polish actually helps make it easier to remove the glitter polish later on down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any chipping in the polish on my toenails for probably at least two weeks after I apply it</li>
            <li> After having gel nail polish for a year on my nails, they were weak.  </li>
            <li> I find my hands in water, in soapy solutions, paint, foodstuffs, etc., so often, that I had to get something to protect the poor nails on their journey throughout my day.  </li>
            <li> esta base es la mejor, no solo proteje la u&amp;ntilde;a, ademas la deja lista para que el esmalte de color deslize perfecto y al final el brillo que deja ... es de lujo!!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace my Essie All-In-One Base Coat since I need a base coat that strengthens and helps with ridges.  </li>

            <li> Within a week I noticed my nails were not as brittle.  I enjoy the top coat base coat and strengthened all being rolled into one.</li>
            <li> I searched forever for the original 3-way glaze, but this product has replaced it.  I&#x27;ve used it only once so far, but it seems to hold up well.  Fast shipping by seller.</li>
            <li> It dried fast, seems to help strengthen the nails. But its not a good top coat, doesn&#x27;t keep nail polish on longer. Only lasted a FEW days.</li>
            <li> I like the product because it&#x27;s helped my nails stay healthy despite two back to back surgery&#x27;s which are noted for causing damage to hair and nails. Since using the product I do not have to polish my nails so often.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have ingredients in it like Sally Hansen does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on doing my nails, so I don&#x27;t have much experience with a variety of brands or products of the like to do comparisons.  This is my first 3-in-1 type deal,  so I really like that.  If it really works as advertised I can&#x27;t say.  I already have naturally strong nails but they definitely chip from time-to-time from the type of work/labor I do.  I&#x27;ve used this product only once thus far, but I think it worked well.  I like the fluidity of glaze, not too thin or too thick and easy to apply for a beautiful finish.  It&#x27;s been probably about 3 weeks since I applied this as a base and top coat, and my nail polish hasn&#x27;t quite chipped off half yet.  And if it matters, I used Kleancolor brand for the color, which was also a new purchase for me.  As my nails are revealed from the polish being chipped, I don&#x27;t notice anything staining.</li>
            <li> Great quality, good price. My manicure last much longer than with other brands. Absolutely loved it! Highly recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> A bit of an exaggeration but only a bit. It legitimately took hours if not a day to dry and this is with Quick-E on top. I have sheet prints in my nails (painted before lunch) which I am pretending is one of the new on-trend-nail-art-y designs. I appreciate the 3 free aspect of Essie and the polish works eventually. If you have all day, ultraviolet polish lights, or a time machine I recommend this. I am going to  try the quick dry top coat instead.</li>

I do think my toenails have gotten a bit stronger.  This product seems to dry fairly quickly (I haven&#x27;t timed it) and it has a nice shine to it.  I don&#x27;t notice any chipping in the polish on my toenails for probably at least two weeks after I apply it (I realize this would be different with fingernails, which are more exposed).  I have been playing around with glitter polish lately, and I think using this as a base coat before applying the glitter polish actually helps make it easier to remove the glitter polish later on down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying more of this when I run out.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a great topcoat if you have all day to wait for it to dry. It really does keep polish on for quite a long time, but it is &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; for at least 12 hours -- I polished my nails in the morning, then went out in the late afternoon and managed to get indents/imprints in them doing normal things, and then that night, a good 14 hours after I&#x27;d polished them, I went to bed and woke up with my sheets imprinted into my nails. So, I&#x27;ll probably use this primarily as a basecoat and get a quicker drying topcoat.</li>
            <li> love this product! nails haven&#x27;t chipped in days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the original one.  I did not like it!</li>
            <li> I read reviews first and look at how many stars and item gets to help me decide if the purchase is worth my time and money.I will be buying this product again it does just what it states a high gloss shine and helps with nail art adhering to your nails.</li>
            <li> I use this as a base and/or top coat and it always dries fast on my natural nails. It&#x27;s super shiny and I love how my manicure still looks fresh after a week. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorites! Arrived quickly as well. Essie is the best! Seller is very prompt as well. Works great as either a top or base coat, or use as both.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Makes my nail polish last SO much longer! The glaze makes it shiny but not over the top, and my nails definitely feel stronger. Pretty quick to dry.</li>
            <li> NICE COAT MAKE NAILS LOOK GOOD</li>
            <li> I guess it strengthens your nails, haven&#x27;t really noticed it too much. It works for base coat and top coat, but I rather buy revlon&#x27;s quick dry base and top coat for around $4 each than get this again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! My nail polish would always chip (regardless of which brand I use) in less than 48 hours. Since I started using this 3-way glaze as a base and top coat, my nails are chip free for FIVE days!</li>
            <li> Very runny. Takes a long time to dry over other coats.</li>
            <li> Does take a while to dry, but I love the thickness I the polish. Works great and keeps my nails from peeling or chipping!</li>
            <li> I have used this before and love it! It not only adds a nice glaze to your nails, but I&#x27;ve noticed that my polish stays on longer!</li>
            <li> I find my hands in water, in soapy solutions, paint, foodstuffs, etc., so often, that I had to get something to protect the poor nails on their journey throughout my day.  I&#x27;m happy to have found this to add to the routine of protective layers.</li>
            <li> My nails peel quite often. I assumed this wasn’t from my nail polish topcoat. But the day following a new manicure, my nail polish would already be flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to purchase my favorite Target-brand of nail polish, Essie. What a difference. Almost a week later, my nail polish is barely showing bare nails. I’m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that it takes a bit longer for the nail polish and topcoat to dry (maybe this is why it lasts longer?).</li>
            <li> I really liked the product</li>
            <li> This product works well and saves money, considering you don&#x27;t have to buy three separate products. It is all you need!</li>
            <li> This does what it says it does.  I&#x27;ve used it as a base coat, added color then used it again as a top coat.  It worked perfectly and my manicure lasted several days without chipping.  I also used it by itself  and it leaves a beautiful, mild glossy finish on natural nails while making them strong and secure against breakage.  I would recomment this product with 100% confidence.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! Absolutely love it. I have two little kids 2 and 1 y.o. and I have a lot to do, dishes, washing kids all the time, change diapers and so on, and my manicure stays 5 !!! days. I think it could stay longer, I just getting tired of the same color and change it. Color stays perfect not chipping, I really am amazed by this product, recommend to everyone. Hope it will always be in market. Thanks</li>
            <li> Super shiny and glossy nail glaze that really does reek like mad acetone but offer superior shine and protection to your manicure. I make sure to put an extra coat on the corners of my nails every couple of days. My nails grow much longer and don&#x27;t break if I do that and have been doing so for years.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace my Essie All-In-One Base Coat since I need a base coat that strengthens and helps with ridges.  I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the extra strength this adds to my thin/sometimes flake prone nails and while it does take a while to dry, using it as a top coat gives an incredibly shiny finish.  If I&#x27;m in a hurry, I&#x27;ll go back to my quick dry top coat (also by Essie) but I much prefer this formula.  Using this as both a base and top coat seals my manicure for a good 7-10 days, which is unheard of with my nails (I&#x27;m lucky to get 3-4 days normally).</li>
            <li> goes on easy and holds my nail polish on longer. Also nice to use without a nail polish. I always cut my nails short because they split and break but since i started using this strengthener and top coat in one, they grow long and so far have not broken. really liking it.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, but does not seem to stop the colour from permeating my nails. I&#x27;ve only tried with one colour so far, so I&#x27;ll have to see how it works with others.</li>
            <li> Works like it is supposed to!</li>
            <li> Perfect to use as a base and top coat. Helps lengthen my manicure by a few days and makes my nails look nice.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  Helps my nail polish last longer and my nails have never looked better! Will purchase again and recommend to others!</li>
            <li> This all-in-one top coat works well, but it takes a really long time to dry.  I have to give it over an hour and sometimes it still smudges after that.</li>
            <li> esta base es la mejor, no solo proteje la u&amp;ntilde;a, ademas la deja lista para que el esmalte de color deslize perfecto y al final el brillo que deja ... es de lujo!!</li>
            <li> awesome! i love it and it wasn&#x27;t as expensive as it is in target! thank you! i totally recommend this product to people who do there nails often!</li>
            <li> This works great.  After having gel nail polish for a year on my nails, they were weak.  This product has strengthened them.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Works as it says but it doesnt dry fast enough for me and my nails get destroyed...i think it takes a day to completely dry hard</li>
