    <ol>
            <li>I can say I&#x27;m very happy with the move and the lack of any transitional hair loss.    </li>
            <li>will stay w perfect image solutions product.</li>
            <li>With the results I&#x27;m seeing, I should be looking great come spring!</li>
            <li>Ships from and sold by Ideal Image Solutions LLC.          </li>
            <li>I just purchased 15% Minoxidil, 5% Azelaic acid solution from Ideal Image Solutions, LLC on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Ideal Image Solutions, LLC is not responding.</li>
            <li>, it works and I&#x27;m happy with my results.</li>
            <li>[...]bySubmissionDateDescending  I was generally happy with that product, except they stopped selling it.</li>
            <li>This product is just great and as my testimony shows, it does work.  </li>
            <li>Good luck to you.</li>
            <li>OK!</li>
            <li>To mention how great this seller is, I made a purchase a month ago for a Lot of 3, and it was incorrectly filled with just the Minoxidil without Azelaic Acid.  </li>
            <li>In my case it&#x27;s effective, but I&#x27;m assuming that if I stop doing it that the results will reverse again.</li>
            <li>This is the best of his kind so far.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best value for any Minoxidil product and works fantastically.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on this stuff for months and am so glad I switched over from a higer priced supplier.</li>
            <li>Use:  3 months and change    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the change.  </li>
            <li>I would say my results were 3X better than the 5% Rogaine as you might expect from the increase in concentration, but is a noticable difference my girlfriend has even noticed.</li>
            <li>This speedy correction made sure that I did not interrupt my use.    </li>
            <li>Although I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the mistake, I was very happy with how they handled the situation and corrected as soon as they possibly could.  </li>
            <li>It looks like you maybe able to keep what you got</li>
            <li>because it glues to my skull when using this product :)  </li>
            <li>To the best of my experience, the combo of minoxidil and Propecia is about the only thing that works.</li>

            <li>NEW 15% Minoxidil and 5% Azelaic Acid - FREE SHIPPING  by Ideal Image Solutions,</li>
            <li>Minoxidil 15% with 5% Azelaic Acid is a great combination and is proven across multiple studies and reviews.  </li>
            <li>Hope others have the same great experience I have/had.</li>
            <li>THANKS!!!</li>
            <li>I wonder how many of the positive comments are from individuals with a vested interest in the company who manufactures or promotes this product.</li>
            <li>This product is great, and I&#x27;ve been using it since October, so roughly 5-6 months.  </li>
            <li>I am a middle aged man in excellent health and with about 30-40% coverage on my crown.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;NEW (NO PROPYLENE GLYCOL) Minoxidil 15% &amp; Azelaic Acid 5% - FREE US SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>As you can see from our Amazon description, our product does contain Propylene Glycol, which is more than likely the cause of your irritation.     </li>
            <li>Also please do give suggestions if you know more about improving facial hair growth.     </li>
            <li>I still have dense hair around the sides, but my crown, top and front are much thinner (the sun is just now starting to hit scalp).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t read any side effects or health issues with this, in fact people do actually get positive and good results, but with a long time.</li>
            <li>I experienced hair loss/shedding after a few weeks of starting this regime, but stuck with it and noticed small/light hair follicles grow as research has stated within 6-7 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 4 months, and have started to see real results.  </li>
            <li>:  Works reasonably well.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable price  Fast shipping and responsive seller    </li>
            <li>So feel free to follow my reviews, I&#x27;ll try to help as much as possible.    </li>
            <li>Thanks,  </li>
            <li>I used this product faithfully for more than five months and saw no positive result.</li>
            <li>Second go around, so will be back for more.    </li>
            <li>I first noticed that it is significantly stickier than the other brand.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, so far I haven&#x27;t seen any much growth.</li>
            <li>(you know, the normal growth).</li>
            <li>little more money, but nowhere near as sticky</li>
            <li>Now as it has been 3 months since I&#x27;ve noticed those new follicles, they have grown in length and have darkened in color.  </li>
            <li>I have strong black hair all over my scalp</li>
            <li>I tried different brands, and feel that this one works better than the other brand.  </li>
            <li>Age:  Late 20&#x27;s    Hair Loss:  Top of Crown    </li>
            <li>So guys, I would really appreciate if you can comment on this procedure and let me know if you or any others are using this for facial growth.</li>
            <li>So much so that I will try something else next.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I really wonder if there is actually 15% minoxidil since its just some slapped on label.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used something similar with the same stuff in it, but this was really sticky and burned for some reason.</li>
            <li>This product was the first one I tried after the 2 bottles of the other brand.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t much agitation at all using this product, and it seems the other sellers with 15% Minoxidil concentration are having issues with stickiness.  </li>
            <li>I mean, free shipping is just a relative term.  </li>
            <li>Fast drying  Little irritation  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I started use at the start of November, and my wife and I have noticed a real difference this past month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest coming back to the hair later (hour after application and presumably absorption) and run a wet comb and apply some product to the hair to get rid of the stiffness and lack of manageability that otherwise occurs.  </li>
            <li> We apologize for the delayed response, but our customer service department only works limited hours during the M-F work week, and we did not recieve your emails until today.     </li>
            <li> We of course wish our product was working out for you, but will accept a partial refund of your open item.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its a social stigma or has any negative effects, but I&#x27;ve read that people do actually try it out for facial growth.</li>
            <li> Well, the thing is I do have a fine beard and mustache, but its not that thick or \\&quot;big\\&quot; enough, you know what I mean!     </li>
            <li> but you will not grow new hair or at least in my case.</li>
            <li> My hair regrowth was slow within the first few months, but I persisted and am now seeing results my coworkers are evening noticing.    </li>
            <li> Long time user of other 15% products and all are greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> we all know we are not gonna get a lion mane, but at least you are not going look complete bald</li>
            <li> I started on this product near late November</li>
            <li> Dear Tom,    Thank you for your message to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), one of the seven centers within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).    </li>
            <li> I see in other posts that you offer an exchange.</li>
            <li> but I see nothing on the bottle, in your description or in the directions of the ingredients other than this.      </li>
            <li> , other %15 brands did not work either probable because they were too greasy and did not stay on your scalp, I have been using this brand sticky formula and that stickiness seems to make the difference</li>
            <li> It is  way much less greaser than the other.  </li>
            <li> I keep my hair reasonably short, so hopefully they will be long enough soon to require cutting from my barber.      </li>
            <li> &gt; A few years ago %5 seems not to be working anymore</li>
            <li> I use it everyday in the morning, and occassionally in the evening.</li>
            <li> If it is worse, I will report back.  </li>
            <li> I used another amazon product for a couple months and decided to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> This stuff burned my scald and makes your hair so stiff that it cannot be combed.</li>
            <li> We are sorry to hear the product is causing your scalp and cause red spots.  </li>
            <li> , I could tell I am getting a least %30 improvement.</li>
            <li> If not, what does this mean for the integrity and safety of the product?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this exploration of hair loss treatments seriously, and</li>
            <li> You can report the sale of the product by Amazon.com to FDA&#x27;s Office of Criminal Investigations at the following link: [...]    </li>
            <li> My wife notices, and even my guy friends are obviously annoyed with how well it&#x27;s been working for me.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully my report to the FDA&#x27;s criminal investigations department will be fruitful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Again, we sorry our product is not working out for you.     </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find this company or even this concentration of minoxidil in your database.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with this mistake, and notified them of this.  </li>
            <li> Maybe is the combination with Nizoral shampoo, but when I apply this, once it dries it is impossible to comb the hair without pulling it out from the roots.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the third review I have tried to post. This stuff burned my scald and makes your hair so stiff that it cannot be combed. I contacted the company and am going to post some of the e-mail thread.    I&#x27;m sorry but if the product would have been listed properly like this, only that it contains propylene glycol there would be no problem. Thank you for your consideration. After deducting 7.50 and shipping it back I may as well just throw it away and just warn Amazon others of this product.     \\&quot;NEW (NO PROPYLENE GLYCOL) Minoxidil 15% &amp; Azelaic Acid 5% - FREE US SHIPPING.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 4 months, and have started to see real results.  Bottom line, it works and I&#x27;m happy with my results.</li>
            <li> This is the best of his kind so far. I prefer this one over the others it s because it stays on the scalp and it does not go to you forehead on face. It is  way much less greaser than the other.  It is too sticky, but in the end I rather it to be sticky than greasy.  I have been using %5 minoxidil for years (10) this is what kept me from total baldness.&lt;br /&gt; A few years ago %5 seems not to be working anymore, other %15 brands did not work either probable because they were too greasy and did not stay on your scalp, I have been using this brand sticky formula and that stickiness seems to make the difference, I could tell I am getting a least %30 improvement. we all know we are not gonna get a lion mane, but at least you are not going look complete bald</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product after making the move from another (more expensive) supplier.  I can say I&#x27;m very happy with the move and the lack of any transitional hair loss.    Second go around, so will be back for more.    Also, I like the fact this company provides a chance to save additional money when purchasing multiple items.  I mean, free shipping is just a relative term.  Just means it is already in the price.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best value for any Minoxidil product and works fantastically.  I&#x27;ve been on this stuff for months and am so glad I switched over from a higer priced supplier.</li>
            <li> Age:  Late 20&#x27;s    Hair Loss:  Top of Crown    Use:  3 months and change    Pros:  Works reasonably well.  Noticeable difference between 6 months use on Rogaine Foam used prior to this.  Fast drying  Little irritation  Reasonable price  Fast shipping and responsive seller    Cons:  Sticky after drying  Does contain Propylene Glycol    4 stars out of 5 represents this product well.  Wasn&#x27;t much agitation at all using this product, and it seems the other sellers with 15% Minoxidil concentration are having issues with stickiness.  Hopefully someone can address this.    I guess the last 2 \\&quot;Pros\\&quot; weren&#x27;t product performance related but price and customer service plays a role for my judgment on anything I buy.</li>
            <li> I moved to this product using Rogaine 5% around spring time this year.  The reason for the move was that I didn&#x27;t feel I though I was getting the same results as I had when I started Rogaine a year or so ago.  I&#x27;m glad I made the change.  I would say my results were 3X better than the 5% Rogaine as you might expect from the increase in concentration, but is a noticable difference my girlfriend has even noticed.</li>
            <li> stuff works but its way too sticky for me. will stay w perfect image solutions product. little more money, but nowhere near as sticky</li>
            <li> So, I bought this 1 month ago. Started applying according to the instructions - after getting up and before bed. Well, here&#x27;s the CATCH---I&#x27;m not using it for treating my baldness. In fact, I don&#x27;t have any baldness. I have strong black hair all over my scalp (you know, the normal growth). OK! So the CATCH is, I am using Minoxidil for my facial hair growth!! I don&#x27;t know if its a social stigma or has any negative effects, but I&#x27;ve read that people do actually try it out for facial growth. I haven&#x27;t read any side effects or health issues with this, in fact people do actually get positive and good results, but with a long time. Anyway, so far I haven&#x27;t seen any much growth. Well, the thing is I do have a fine beard and mustache, but its not that thick or \\&quot;big\\&quot; enough, you know what I mean!     So guys, I would really appreciate if you can comment on this procedure and let me know if you or any others are using this for facial growth. Also please do give suggestions if you know more about improving facial hair growth.     THANKS!!!</li>
            <li> Long time user of other 15% products and all are greasy or sticky.  I&#x27;ve had no irritation and the product seems to work well.  I&#x27;d suggest coming back to the hair later (hour after application and presumably absorption) and run a wet comb and apply some product to the hair to get rid of the stiffness and lack of manageability that otherwise occurs.  As I only apply this at night, I prefer it to the greasy options that I fear get on my pillow case.</li>
            <li> This product works well.  I had lost hope of regrowing my hair as the hair loss started 10 years ago, and I didn&#x27;t do anything to stop it.  Finally I got motivated and started using 10 to 15% minoxidile solution.  I tried different brands, and feel that this one works better than the other brand.  My scalp hair has grown, but those are not grwoing in lenght.  I am hoping that some day the hairs would start growing longer.  I am not using it twice a day as I have relaxed after 10 months of regular twice a day use. I use it everyday in the morning, and occassionally in the evening.</li>
            <li> I started use at the start of November, and my wife and I have noticed a real difference this past month. With the results I&#x27;m seeing, I should be looking great come spring!</li>
            <li> Minoxidil 15% with 5% Azelaic Acid is a great combination and is proven across multiple studies and reviews.  This product is great, and I&#x27;ve been using it since October, so roughly 5-6 months.  My hair regrowth was slow within the first few months, but I persisted and am now seeing results my coworkers are evening noticing.    To mention how great this seller is, I made a purchase a month ago for a Lot of 3, and it was incorrectly filled with just the Minoxidil without Azelaic Acid.  I was unhappy with this mistake, and notified them of this.  They corrected the error and I had the correct items in my hands within 3 days.  This speedy correction made sure that I did not interrupt my use.    Although I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the mistake, I was very happy with how they handled the situation and corrected as soon as they possibly could.  This is why I feel their product not only deserves 5 stars, but their customer service does as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used something similar with the same stuff in it, but this was really sticky and burned for some reason.</li>
            <li> I have used several different versions of Monoxidil products and this one is not much different. I do like how quit this one dries but it will not improve your hair loss situation. It looks like you maybe able to keep what you got but you will not grow new hair or at least in my case. Good luck to you.</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged man in excellent health and with about 30-40% coverage on my crown. I used this product faithfully for more than five months and saw no positive result. I wonder how many of the positive comments are from individuals with a vested interest in the company who manufactures or promotes this product.</li>
            <li> I think my hair will not fall.... because it glues to my skull when using this product :)  Maybe is the combination with Nizoral shampoo, but when I apply this, once it dries it is impossible to comb the hair without pulling it out from the roots.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 months, and I&#x27;m 45. I also have been taking Propecia for the same amount of time. The difference is noticeable. Here is a trick I use to get rid of the \\&quot;stiffness\\&quot;: after applying the 15% dose, I then apply a generic brand of 5% Propecia. It wipes out the stiffness instantly.     You need to give yourself 6-12 months before you decide if it&#x27;s working or not. In my case it&#x27;s effective, but I&#x27;m assuming that if I stop doing it that the results will reverse again. To the best of my experience, the combo of minoxidil and Propecia is about the only thing that works.</li>
            <li> I started using similar products in Jan 2011.  I have never used any hair loss product prior to then. I am using it for thinning hair. I still have dense hair around the sides, but my crown, top and front are much thinner (the sun is just now starting to hit scalp). I&#x27;ve been using the following regimen: Minoxidil 5% foam in the am after drying my hair, and this 15%/5% Minox/Azelaic mix at night.    I started using a different brand initially, but it is no longer on the market.   [...]bySubmissionDateDescending  I was generally happy with that product, except they stopped selling it. (So obviously, I am not selling for that product)    It&#x27;s been 11 months now: I&#x27;ve used 8 bottles/cans of the minoxidil foam, and 3 bottles of the 15%/5% mix. I definitely notice the difference.  My wife notices, and even my guy friends are obviously annoyed with how well it&#x27;s been working for me.  So feel free to follow my reviews, I&#x27;ll try to help as much as possible.    This product was the first one I tried after the 2 bottles of the other brand.  I first noticed that it is significantly stickier than the other brand.  I&#x27;ve used this bottle for 3 months now, and I haven&#x27;t lost hair, so I think it works, but it is definitely sticky.  So much so that I will try something else next.  If it is worse, I will report back.  I&#x27;ve been taking this exploration of hair loss treatments seriously, and I know that some of you have helped me, so I am trying to do what I can to help others.</li>
            <li> I started on this product near late November and I researched Minoxidil prior to use.  (Everyone should do this)  I experienced hair loss/shedding after a few weeks of starting this regime, but stuck with it and noticed small/light hair follicles grow as research has stated within 6-7 weeks.  (Let&#x27;s just say those weeks were nerve racking)  Now as it has been 3 months since I&#x27;ve noticed those new follicles, they have grown in length and have darkened in color.  I keep my hair reasonably short, so hopefully they will be long enough soon to require cutting from my barber.      This product is just great and as my testimony shows, it does work.  Hope others have the same great experience I have/had.</li>
            <li> I used another amazon product for a couple months and decided to save a few bucks. My hair thinned out after a month of this stuff. Honestly, I really wonder if there is actually 15% minoxidil since its just some slapped on label.</li>
            <li> My email to FDA -----------------------------------    Hi,    I just purchased 15% Minoxidil, 5% Azelaic acid solution from Ideal Image Solutions, LLC on Amazon.com. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find this company or even this concentration of minoxidil in your database. The company does not have a website and is not responding to emails through Amazon. Does the FDA have any record of this company? If not, what does this mean for the integrity and safety of the product? Is this the type of product that is allowed to be sold without going through the FDA?    Thanks,  Tom    FDA&#x27;s response -------------------------------------    Dear Tom,    Thank you for your message to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), one of the seven centers within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).    The product is not FDA approved to be marketed in the United States. Therefore we do not have information on the integrity or safety of the product. The maximum concentration of minoxidil in a topical dosage form FDA approved to be marketed is 5% and it is also not approved in combimation with Azelaic acid. You can report the sale of the product by Amazon.com to FDA&#x27;s Office of Criminal Investigations at the following link: [...]    Sincerely,    Division of Drug Information  D202D    ---------------------------------------------------    I reported this to Amazon but they have not removed the product from their page or offered to refund me. Ideal Image Solutions, LLC is not responding. Hopefully my report to the FDA&#x27;s criminal investigations department will be fruitful.</li>
