    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfect size and appearance for travel.</li>
            <li>But it is the best vibrator!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>One of the best systems on the market for the price</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see the value in the exfoliation part of this machine, the exfoliating cream is great though.  </li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>would not recommend this product to anyone else, I loved the crystals cream.</li>
            <li>What I do know is that for $40 it is one of the best, most effective, and most affordable vibrators out there.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>The cream will work without the pad, but not as effectively.  </li>
            <li>When you purchase the refills for the face, they give you a new velcro attachment, which for me is about the perfect time to change it out.  </li>
            <li>I explected the microdermabrasion head to rotate, but instead it vibrates very strongly in your hand.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, quite and powerful.</li>
            <li>I had great results with this product with the first use.  </li>
            <li>That said, when I can afford it, I&#x27;ll probably buy three more so that when they stop making them, I won&#x27;t be out of my favorite vibrator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course, you&#x27;ll still need a face exfoliator, but you&#x27;ll be so glad you bought it and will feel much better about the money.</li>
            <li>Great for anyone who wants to reduce scars.</li>
            <li>By Cindy Mokund: I think this product is an excellent purchase because the cream helps you remove the death cells of your skin with the help of the sponge making all your body look younger.</li>
            <li>If the manufacturer can come up with a pad that has a more permanent surface, they will have a winner with this product.  </li>
            <li>The vibration is too strong for the eye area.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful, gentle, controllable, clean, accessible, non-threatening VIBRATOR for those aches and pains that make you feel older than any sunspot ever could.</li>
            <li>Which was fine since I never wanted to use it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been less than impressed with the foot attachment.  </li>
            <li>Lose the attachment, enjoy the smooth, vibrating sensation.</li>
            <li>This is a ladies personal vibrator deluxe!</li>
            <li>I am using this product right now and Let me just say in these few days I have seen awesome results.</li>
            <li>It is good for a facial massager.</li>
            <li>: I had to laugh at everyone&#x27;s reviews stating that it doesn&#x27;t work for the skin.</li>
            <li>It is cheap enough, which is why the better review.  </li>
            <li>The facial one is better.</li>
            <li>The first one I used for years till it quit.  </li>
            <li>I first bought the face microdermabrasion, it had the pad and the cream like the body</li>
            <li>The body resurfacing cream which has little scrubbing crystals was ok , but can easily be used without this machine.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, I love the facial product!</li>
            <li>It was pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I promise, it really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it has done much to help them.  </li>
            <li>This inexpensive device really works.  </li>
            <li>I really like the face system and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>It gives &amp;#34;carry-on&amp;#34; a whole new meaning.</li>
            <li>The new version comes with a cheaper/weaker motor.</li>
            <li>that when you purchase the refills for the body one, you get the cream and a new pad.  </li>
            <li>I got better results from simply mixing a little lemon juice with sugar.  </li>
            <li>used the attachment head for feet three times before the abrasive finish completely wore</li>
            <li>I bought this for some old acne scars.  </li>
            <li>The vibrations weren&#x27;t intense enough to make any difference.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this it doesn&#x27;t do as describe it feels as it vibrating not rotating, really do not waste your money</li>
            <li>Others have mentioned how much it vibrates (enough that their hands were buzzing and tingling the next day).</li>
            <li>I was under the impression that the attachment would rotate,but in general it&#x27;s just a vibrating(2 levels) machine with attachments that you move around your body manually.</li>
            <li>^.^ Just remove the entire head, leaving behind a smooth plastic circular surface and VOILA!</li>

            <li> ^.^ Just remove the entire head, leaving behind a smooth plastic circular surface and VOILA!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the body pad long enough to know if it will last long enough to use the entire tube, but the face one had a tendency to degrade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, when I used it the second time, the triangular pad lost all of its abrasive surface, leaving me with a smooth, useless triangle.  </li>
            <li> While I usually like Neutrogena products, this is such an absolute waste of money, I&#x27;m taking the time to warn others.  </li>
            <li> It stopped the problem dead in its tracks- not a single ingrown whisker in over two months,</li>
            <li> I did so and had only a small squirt left in the tube after use.</li>
            <li> I use it to massage facial muscles and this does seem to stimulate them into being less saggy around the mouth.  </li>
            <li> Agreed with some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I just bought this one for the body and am only disappointed that the machine is exactly the same as the face one, you can just pop out the attachments between face and body as they all fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Typically Neutrogena is quality, but not this time.</li>
            <li> Her skin in smoother, less wrinkles noticeable.</li>
            <li> After a few years, the vibrating motor inside the device has started to lose its strength, so I&#x27;m buying another to replace it.</li>
            <li> too much trouble to return.&lt;br /&gt;Kept</li>
            <li> I suggest it for anyone who has had bad luck finding the right vibrator.</li>
            <li> where in the past I might get them a few times a week.</li>
            <li> This is too small to be called a body system.</li>
            <li> And if you came here to see if other people hated it as much as you, give it a try!</li>
            <li> the included batteries were three years past their expiration date!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the system a 3 star rating due to the expensive puff refills.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a serious review.</li>
            <li> And this is seriously why I&#x27;m re-buying it today.</li>
            <li> The vibrating, rather than rotating pads are completely useless is removing dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in Neutrogena for producing such a ripoff product.</li>
            <li> The Worst thing ever after the second day the hard Scrub wash rite off!!</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely useless and inconvenient product.</li>
            <li> Thought i was  for the face...was disappointed because it was a gift for my daughter...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Agreed with some of the other reviews. Might as well just apply the lotion yourself and the vibrator is the same ass the face one so it&#x27;s just not necessary to have 2 when you can just switch the applicators.</li>
            <li> This is a ladies personal vibrator deluxe! Forget skin blemishes. This is a wonderful, gentle, controllable, clean, accessible, non-threatening VIBRATOR for those aches and pains that make you feel older than any sunspot ever could. Perfect size and appearance for travel. It gives &amp;#34;carry-on&amp;#34; a whole new meaning. Buy it, you&#x27;ll thank me.</li>
            <li> I explected the microdermabrasion head to rotate, but instead it vibrates very strongly in your hand.  My hands are still buzzing from the night before when I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone else, I loved the crystals cream.</li>
            <li> Would not use for microdermabrasion. But it is the best vibrator! Lose the attachment, enjoy the smooth, vibrating sensation. Yeah.</li>
            <li> The tube of cream was one application - instructions say to apply it to the sponge head and to your skin. I did so and had only a small squirt left in the tube after use. Which was fine since I never wanted to use it again. It had a pungent floral fragrance I found nauseating. And the odor did not subside after use! It took two showers and rubbing my skin with baking soda to get rid of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the attachment head for feet three times before the abrasive finish completely wore off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the included batteries were three years past their expiration date!</li>
            <li> Update: The new version comes with a cheaper/weaker motor. It was pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: I had to laugh at everyone&#x27;s reviews stating that it doesn&#x27;t work for the skin. I wouldn&#x27;t know. What I do know is that for $40 it is one of the best, most effective, and most affordable vibrators out there. ^.^ Just remove the entire head, leaving behind a smooth plastic circular surface and VOILA! Others have mentioned how much it vibrates (enough that their hands were buzzing and tingling the next day). I promise, it really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only reason I am buying this product. After a few years, the vibrating motor inside the device has started to lose its strength, so I&#x27;m buying another to replace it. That said, when I can afford it, I&#x27;ll probably buy three more so that when they stop making them, I won&#x27;t be out of my favorite vibrator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a serious review. And this is seriously why I&#x27;m re-buying it today. I suggest it for anyone who has had bad luck finding the right vibrator. And if you came here to see if other people hated it as much as you, give it a try! Of course, you&#x27;ll still need a face exfoliator, but you&#x27;ll be so glad you bought it and will feel much better about the money.</li>
            <li> After two months my conclussion was that I could see no change what-so-ever. Typically Neutrogena is quality, but not this time. &lt;br /&gt;Now you can&#x27;t say you weren&#x27;t warned.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mother, she has not stopped using this since the day if gave it to her. Her skin in smoother, less wrinkles noticeable.</li>
            <li> While I usually like Neutrogena products, this is such an absolute waste of money, I&#x27;m taking the time to warn others.  The vibrating, rather than rotating pads are completely useless is removing dead skin cells.  I&#x27;m so disappointed in Neutrogena for producing such a ripoff product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the value in the exfoliation part of this machine, the exfoliating cream is great though.  I can use the cream without the machine and get the same result, but the vibrating part is a different story.  I use it to massage facial muscles and this does seem to stimulate them into being less saggy around the mouth.  The vibration is too strong for the eye area.  The vibration also seems to help my aching hands while using it.  It is cheap enough, which is why the better review.  It is good for a facial massager.</li>
            <li> I am using this product right now and Let me just say in these few days I have seen awesome results. Great for anyone who wants to reduce scars.</li>
            <li> I bought this for some old acne scars.  I can&#x27;t say it has done much to help them.  However, I have problems with ingrown (facial, being male) whiskers, so I thought, give it a try.  It stopped the problem dead in its tracks- not a single ingrown whisker in over two months, where in the past I might get them a few times a week.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive device really works.  It leaves my skin clean,soft, and supple - even at my age, 64! However, I think the microdermabrasion pads (puff refills) are over priced at $.51 a piece. I re-use mine several times before replacing them.  I&#x27;m giving the system a 3 star rating due to the expensive puff refills.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be bigger than the facial Microdermabrasion system, but it was not. The facial one is better. This is too small to be called a body system.</li>
            <li> This is the second unit I have bought.  The first one I used for years till it quit.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I had my doubts but after using it one time my skin felt smoother.  The Foot pumice is a must-have.  I don&#x27;t need to go out of my home for a pedicure anymore!  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Ah.Neutrogena,a brand you can depend on</li>
            <li> Thought i was  for the face...was disappointed because it was a gift for my daughter...too much trouble to return.&lt;br /&gt;Kept it.</li>
            <li> This item was recommended in a magazine article for calluses on your feet, so I bought this specifically for that use. I used the triangular pumice attachment only.I was under the impression that the attachment would rotate,but in general it&#x27;s just a vibrating(2 levels) machine with attachments that you move around your body manually. The vibrations weren&#x27;t intense enough to make any difference. The actual machine has no function. The body resurfacing cream which has little scrubbing crystals was ok , but can easily be used without this machine.</li>
            <li> By Cindy Mokund: I think this product is an excellent purchase because the cream helps you remove the death cells of your skin with the help of the sponge making all your body look younger. I can not give an opinion about the pad because i haven&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> I really like the face system and have used it for years.  I just bought this one for the body and am only disappointed that the machine is exactly the same as the face one, you can just pop out the attachments between face and body as they all fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first bought the face microdermabrasion, it had the pad and the cream like the body one does now.  While I like the reusable pad, I wish that the body one had the disposable pads like the face one now.  When you purchase the refills for the face, they give you a new velcro attachment, which for me is about the perfect time to change it out.  It appears (although I haven&#x27;t done it yet) that when you purchase the refills for the body one, you get the cream and a new pad.  I haven&#x27;t used the body pad long enough to know if it will last long enough to use the entire tube, but the face one had a tendency to degrade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been less than impressed with the foot attachment.  It will not be replacing my monthly pedicures any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I still like this system.  It may be in my head, but I think my skin looks and feels smoother after use.</li>
            <li> I had great results with this product with the first use.  However, when I used it the second time, the triangular pad lost all of its abrasive surface, leaving me with a smooth, useless triangle.  I replaced the triangle, thinking I had a \\&quot;dud\\&quot;, but had the same thing happen with the second pad.  The cream will work without the pad, but not as effectively.  If the manufacturer can come up with a pad that has a more permanent surface, they will have a winner with this product.  On a positive note, I love the facial product!</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely useless and inconvenient product. The pads don&#x27;t rotate, just vibrate and that doesn&#x27;t do anything for exfoliation. I used for a couple of months with no results.</li>
            <li> Wish replacements for the triangle adapter (for feet) were easier to find!  It works great.</li>
            <li> The Worst thing ever after the second day the hard Scrub wash rite off!!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this it doesn&#x27;t do as describe it feels as it vibrating not rotating, really do not waste your money</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting this for my face</li>
            <li> No results what so ever. I used it for about six months and no change. I got better results from simply mixing a little lemon juice with sugar.  Total waist of money.</li>
            <li> Great quality, quite and powerful. One of the best systems on the market for the price</li>
