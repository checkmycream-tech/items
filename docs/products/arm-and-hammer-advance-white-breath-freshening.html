    <ol>
            <li>Excellent price and product is great.</li>
            <li>Always been great, hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has done a good job for us</li>
            <li>and we both recommend it to you as a good product.</li>
            <li>so I decided to give ths a try as the cost is good</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>tooth paste tastes good, cleans your teeth better and whitens your teeth with prolonged use.  </li>
            <li>This is now my favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It has baking soda in it - need I say more??  </li>
            <li>the Sugar Fairy visited it - it tastes like toothpaste, which should taste like refreshing mint, not sugar.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not surprised at how great this stuff works.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean, but not with an overpowering flavor like some toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and haven&#x27;t found anything else that comes close to how clean and fresh this makes your mouth feel.  </li>
            <li>the only toothpaste that makes my mouth feel fresh and the baking soda definitely makes it the best toothpaste ever, i started to use crest and others for a while</li>
            <li>I particularly like the baking soda and the scrubbers (I would guess some type of pumice) that is added to the product, which allows you really scrub and brush your teeth! :)</li>
            <li>Rather astounding that I got to buy these for the price of one similar Colgate or Crest product tube.</li>
            <li>pro-health does this too, but Colgate Total just bubbles up nicely).</li>
            <li>Tastes fresh.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this leaves my mouth and teeth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The gentle scrubbing action of the baking soda polishes our teeth and removes more plaque and whitens our teeth in the process.  </li>
            <li>and we love it for several reasons.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much whiteness coming in from it, but I like this for the cleanliness!</li>
            <li>, my teeth didnt feel white and fresh, loved switching back to this and noticed the difference</li>
            <li>I could also tell within the first week that my teeth looked whiter and healthier.</li>
            <li>like everything...stores are trying to keep up with the latest trend, fad or flybynight as seen on tv junk, so when I saw none in my are carried this version anymore - I knew someone on the net would have it.</li>
            <li>did not finish the first tube and instead got another brand.</li>
            <li>The abrasiveness of the baking soda is mild and safe for not real teeth.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I use this toothpaste is because I can drink coffee, juice or eat right after brushing</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toothpaste recently, the baking soda actually surprised me at how clean my mouth feels compared to the super minty stuff in other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>We want our teeth to feel clean and also be white.  </li>
            <li>This paste leaves you feeling fully assured that your teeth not only look clean, but actually are clean.</li>
            <li>it turned out that this toothpaste (as many other major brands) contained Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which has been shown in studies to cause canker</li>
            <li>I bought this toothpaste to try something new...</li>
            <li>My wife also would have her mouth break out with sores in the corners of her mouth as she apparently had an allergic reaction to the peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can feel this stuff working, not sure how effective it is compared with just the raw baking soda.</li>
            <li>gets teeth clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive lips like other toothpastes have done in the past</li>
            <li>Worth the extra cost to have a product I am used to and not full of peroxide!!</li>

            <li> We used the toothpastes that were out there that use peroxide in them to whiten your teeth but the taste as just not good.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started getting canker sores after a few days (2x brushing per day), it was a very unpleasant experience...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is now my favorite toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve used a number of different brands but have never been &amp;#34;loyal&#x27; to any, until now.  I really like the way this leaves my mouth and teeth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Always been great, hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this toothpaste. gets teeth clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive lips like other toothpastes have done in the past</li>
            <li> It has baking soda in it - need I say more??  Well, I will - frankly I appreciate that this is the only toothpaste in the market that doesn&#x27;t taste like the Sugar Fairy visited it - it tastes like toothpaste, which should taste like refreshing mint, not sugar.</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands of whitening tooth pastes but none get me the result that the Arm&amp;Hammer does in a short period of time. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent price and product is great.</li>
            <li> Always did like the freshness you get when brushing with baking soda. Arm and hammer is the tops. The abrasiveness of the baking soda is mild and safe for not real teeth.  I would not clean pearls with it, but it does seem to make your teeth whiter!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean, but not with an overpowering flavor like some toothpastes.  The main reason I use this toothpaste is because I can drink coffee, juice or eat right after brushing and I dont get that kinda nasty flavor that you get when using most toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste a lot. I removed one star for the aftertaste, but it&#x27;s probably because of the baking soda, which is also what makes this toothpaste work so well. It may just be perception on my part, but my mouth feels cleaner and freer of plaque after I brush for 2 minutes with this stuff in the morning. Recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this toothpaste for years and we love it for several reasons.  We want our teeth to feel clean and also be white.  We used the toothpastes that were out there that use peroxide in them to whiten your teeth but the taste as just not good.  My wife also would have her mouth break out with sores in the corners of her mouth as she apparently had an allergic reaction to the peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tooth paste tastes good, cleans your teeth better and whitens your teeth with prolonged use.  The gentle scrubbing action of the baking soda polishes our teeth and removes more plaque and whitens our teeth in the process.  The baking soda also helps to freshen your breath as well as the added frosty mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has done a good job for us and we both recommend it to you as a good product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste recently, the baking soda actually surprised me at how clean my mouth feels compared to the super minty stuff in other toothpastes. I haven&#x27;t noticed much whiteness coming in from it, but I like this for the cleanliness!</li>
            <li> the only toothpaste that makes my mouth feel fresh and the baking soda definitely makes it the best toothpaste ever, i started to use crest and others for a while but it didnt feel the same, my teeth didnt feel white and fresh, loved switching back to this and noticed the difference</li>
            <li> I read a comparison of whitening toothpastes on Yahoo so I decided to give ths a try as the cost is good and it seems to work well.  I don&#x27;t have those artificial brilliant white teeth that look fake but it gets them whiter.  I am satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used arm and hammer for years so I&#x27;m not surprised at how great this stuff works. This paste leaves you feeling fully assured that your teeth not only look clean, but actually are clean. I could also tell within the first week that my teeth looked whiter and healthier.</li>
            <li> I have used this tooth paste for 20 yrs. now they don&#x27;t sell it here in stores. So you got my Biz now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothpaste by Mistake in place of a Similar Named Toothpaste from Arm &amp; Hammer, which I had used before but just cannot Remember the name.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, The Taste is Definitely Minty, But it Definitely does not Linger for Long. And There is Absolutely No Feeling of Freshness. BEWARE !!</li>
            <li> This stuff is addicting.  I have been using this product for years and haven&#x27;t found anything else that comes close to how clean and fresh this makes your mouth feel.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I like arm and hammer toothpaste. I particularly like the baking soda and the scrubbers (I would guess some type of pumice) that is added to the product, which allows you really scrub and brush your teeth! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste for one reason - to brush my teeth. I didn&#x27;t buy this to brush my kids teeth, or my wife&#x27;s teeth, or our cats teeth! Just for me! Is that greedy? Or selfish? Should I now purchase a self-help book on my Kindle? Should I then, after achieving selflessness go on a national tour and explain to crowds of people whilst I wear a headset microphone that toothpaste saved my live from deadly sin of greed? Tony Robbins soul shall flow through me! ARGHHHH!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think so.</li>
            <li> Found this in the clearance bin at the local Wally world and for $1.50, I couldn&#x27;t help but nab the last two remaining. Rather astounding that I got to buy these for the price of one similar Colgate or Crest product tube. Being a daily coffee drinker, there was visual proof of the whitening claims after just two weeks, which in my un-scientific comparison is way faster than my previous Crest pro-health tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s a con, it would have to be that this toothpaste can get runny - rather annoying that sometimes some of it drips down to my neck if I don&#x27;t watch it(Crest pro-health does this too, but Colgate Total just bubbles up nicely).</li>
            <li> like everything...stores are trying to keep up with the latest trend, fad or flybynight as seen on tv junk, so when I saw none in my are carried this version anymore - I knew someone on the net would have it. Worth the extra cost to have a product I am used to and not full of peroxide!!</li>
            <li> This is the toothpaste without peroxide and it&#x27;s not a gel. Tastes fresh.</li>
            <li> I can feel this stuff working, not sure how effective it is compared with just the raw baking soda. but it does leave a wiered film in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste to try something new... it turned out that this toothpaste (as many other major brands) contained Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which has been shown in studies to cause canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started getting canker sores after a few days (2x brushing per day), it was a very unpleasant experience...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not finish the first tube and instead got another brand. The canker sores promptly went away.</li>
            <li> I found it as advertised, I can recommend this item</li>
    </ol>
