            <li>I was asked to try this cleaner in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>and it did a nice job of cleansing my skin.</li>
            <li>Has a handy holder that keeps it upright and stored.</li>
            <li>The soft hair of brush bring me wonderful washing experience.</li>
            <li>The brush is very smooth and perfect for facial cleaning, I also use it to remove eye make up.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent facial brush.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I used it with my favorite cleanser</li>
            <li>I was asked to try this product for free and give an honest review.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a good experience for finally enjoying washing face in the early morning.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works well, really light and functions well.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality broke in a month</li>
            <li>I bought this product becouse is popular en Korea, and have a decent price.</li>
            <li>It works well gets my face clean.</li>
            <li>It was full of water.</li>
            <li>: this brush is very soft, so if you have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t want too much pulling of the skin, it is great.</li>
            <li>The brush is much more soft the mia sonic.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it is very easy to twist off the brush when it is in use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very careful and choosy about what I will review, so I wish I had been a bit more choosy here, as this product really isn&#x27;t for me or my needs--partly because I have a Clarisonic Mia, which I love and in no way</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basic but okay.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know what exactly it did for me?</li>
            <li>It has a nice soft brush head which you move around to clean your face - it doesn&#x27;t spin but with a battery it does have a little vibration.&lt;br</li>
            <li>: No battery included, but for the price maybe that shouldn&#x27;t be a &amp;#34;con.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s difficult to clean the brush head since the very thing that makes it soft (many many fine fine bristles), makes it so tightly packed that the cleanser absorbs all into the head</li>
            <li>Mine have all the details that you can find in the real thing.</li>
            <li>Very helpful, I will recommend it to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It does not eat a lot of the battery, I use it everyday and the battery dead in about a month, it would be perfect if it does not have to insert battery and can be charged tho.</li>
            <li>But it seems that this particular dealer sellls fakeke poblings.</li>
            <li>and you supposed to have new brush head for every 3 mouths.</li>
            <li>and you have to really wash it thoroughly and deeply</li>
            <li>it s too soft, i prefer to use ny hand to wash my face</li>
            <li>The only concern is that they don&#x27;t seem to sale the brush head separately so there is no way to get new brush head</li>
            <li>There are other brush cleansers on the market, and this one is comparable to those (Olay, etc), and at a reasonable price.</li>

            <li> This is an excellent facial brush. The soft hair of brush bring me wonderful washing experience. I love it.</li>
            <li> After using this for 2days I noticed it was vibrating very low. It was full of water. I haven&#x27;t used this in the shower or dipped it in water. Ive use it at the sink and been careful to dry it off after use. Worked great to begin with. But it looks like ill need to take the brush head off and the battery out after each use to dry. That is it still works when I put it back together. Very disappointed. Should have just spent the money on a Clarsonic.</li>
            <li> good brush and soft&lt;br /&gt;touch is very good&lt;br /&gt;outside is beautiful&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;fashion&lt;br /&gt;cute&lt;br /&gt;why need a lot words&lt;br /&gt;i am so headache</li>
            <li> The brush is very smooth and perfect for facial cleaning, I also use it to remove eye make up. The cleansing result is very good and easy to use. It does not eat a lot of the battery, I use it everyday and the battery dead in about a month, it would be perfect if it does not have to insert battery and can be charged tho.

            <li> I bought this product becouse is popular en Korea, and have a decent price. But it seems that this particular dealer sellls fakeke poblings. Mine have all the details that you can find in the real thing. Here a guide for you... http://kimbyshares.blogspot.com/2014/06/how-to-differentiate-real-and-fake-po.html    just an update. the device just broke,  (5 uses)... the worst part is that the vendor doesn&#x27;t warranty the product. is a scam!!!!</li>
            <li> I was asked to try this cleaner in exchange for an honest review.  It has a nice soft brush head which you move around to clean your face - it doesn&#x27;t spin but with a battery it does have a little vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nothing fancy but I did like the brush. I used it with my favorite cleanser and it did a nice job of cleansing my skin. It&#x27;s basic but okay.</li>
            <li> Works well, really light and functions well.</li>
            <li> so bad！！！i am Not sure this one is Genuine！！！！</li>
            <li> The brush is much more soft the mia sonic. And it&#x27;s a good experience for finally enjoying washing face in the early morning.</li>
            <li> Very helpful, I will recommend it to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;My daughters are using it, they all like it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Cutie.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality broke in a month</li>
            <li> It works well gets my face clean. The only concern is that they don&#x27;t seem to sale the brush head separately so there is no way to get new brush head and you supposed to have new brush head for every 3 mouths.</li>
            <li> I was asked to try this product for free and give an honest review. I&#x27;m very careful and choosy about what I will review, so I wish I had been a bit more choosy here, as this product really isn&#x27;t for me or my needs--partly because I have a Clarisonic Mia, which I love and in no way can the PoBling compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: this brush is very soft, so if you have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t want too much pulling of the skin, it is great. Easy to use. Lathers up nicely if you want a great lather. Fits in the hand quite well. Doesn&#x27;t take up too much space. Has a handy holder that keeps it upright and stored. Reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No battery included, but for the price maybe that shouldn&#x27;t be a &amp;#34;con.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s difficult to clean the brush head since the very thing that makes it soft (many many fine fine bristles), makes it so tightly packed that the cleanser absorbs all into the head and you have to really wash it thoroughly and deeply or else the cleanser remains in the brush head. I had a very difficult time pulling out the battery and bent the battery compartment in the process- oops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be a much less expensive alternative to someone who did not want to purchase a Clarisonic.

            <li> cheap piece but good quality~!! It is very good, all of my friends buy one of this item. recommend to everyone~!</li>
            <li> it s too soft, i prefer to use ny hand to wash my face</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what exactly it did for me? Probably saved me some time. But it broke within a month. Would have been sooner if I used it every day.</li>
