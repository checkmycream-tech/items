            <li>and I liked how it looked on the pictures</li>
            <li>This purse organizer is perfect for medium or small bags, and works perfectly!  </li>
            <li>A very good buy - worth the money and thoughtfully designed.</li>
            <li>I am changing purses so much more often now because it&#x27;s not a hassle anymore to swap things out</li>
            <li>I looked on line for purse organizers, making sure the measurements would meed my needs.</li>
            <li>I ordered this one and love all the compartments.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write too many reviews but having purchased this purse insert</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>and I am really enjoying using that.</li>
            <li>Bought a bigger one that is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I bought a purse because I fell in love with it</li>
            <li>and i would love to get info on how to return it.</li>
            <li>So many pockets and sections to organize stuff.</li>
            <li>In the picture provided their is a lot more stuff able to fit in it then what I am able to fit in mine.  </li>
            <li>It fits my 12 inch wide zippered purse perfectly.  </li>
            <li>They were delighted and I really like mine as well.</li>
            <li>This makes them easy to grab.</li>
            <li>But for keeping all the little cluttery stuff off the bottom of purse, it is perfect.</li>
            <li>keeps everything organized and in place in my huge purse.</li>
            <li>To give you some reference, the smallest bag I can fit it in is my Calvin Klein Claire barrel satchel.</li>
            <li>I filled it up with address book,check book, pens, lotion, etc.</li>
            <li>Great for smaller purses, however.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this prouduct to use it</li>
            <li>The dividers and pockets are all so practical: now my purse not only looks nice but is functional too!</li>
            <li>Specially when something made in china not in USA .</li>
            <li>One of my favorite features of this particular organizer is the pen sized pockets.</li>
            <li>This product is substantial and high quality with lots of great pockets both inside and outside of the organizer.  </li>
            <li>so I really get to enjoy using my handbags.</li>
            <li>Nice but not as big as I thought it was going to be</li>
            <li>And I think Avon just introduced a nice big bag for $20.00 .</li>
            <li>but well worth the time.</li>
            <li>I love this bag organizer, it gives me a quick and easy way to enjoy and change bags without all the mess.</li>
            <li>The price was right, and the organizer holds all of my stuff.  </li>
            <li>the colors were exactly what I was looking for, so I bought it.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty large Alexander Wang tote</li>
            <li>First it says large but it was medium size.second</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty much it.  </li>
            <li>being able to quickly switch purses and still find everything is definitely a worth the small investment.</li>
            <li>The multiple outer pockets make it easy to keep items sorted.</li>
            <li>It has all the pockets I need to organize my large purse.  </li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for an insert to use for your medium to large bags-this is NOT it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s holding up very well.</li>
            <li>very durable and holding up still.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice organizer for those small bags!</li>
            <li>But for women who carry &#x27;handbags&#x27; or satchels or totes and then normally have them more than half full with stuff, this little insert will not help you much.</li>
            <li>Very nice but just a little too small.  </li>
            <li>The only changes I would recommend is to be ALL Tan to see into it better &amp; inside pockets a tight squeeze for checkbook.</li>
            <li>There is a large open area inside with two slip pockets on each side of the interior.  </li>
            <li>I used to have a hard time to find all the zippered compartments I wanted in a purse, now I can find more purses that would meet my needs with this product.</li>
            <li>Could be bigger, but works really well for my makeup</li>
            <li>the picture of the purse organizer look bigger than in person, i was very upset and disappionted</li>
            <li>I also like that this gives my relatively soft cloth purse some structure.</li>
            <li>I needed an organizer and the first one I purchased (the Kangaroo Keeper) was too large, and frankly speaking a little smelly.  </li>
            <li>After looking on line in several places I chose this particular organizer</li>
            <li>This could hold maybe a full size leather wallet, a pair of glasses, a powder compact, a few tubes of mascara/lipstick, some IDs and keys.  </li>
            <li>and since most handbags have pockets I can just slip glasses in there if I decide to keep them on or forget to leave them behind.</li>

            <li> I thought it would be bigger but it still keeps all my little things in one spot</li>
            <li> If you normally carry a small clutch purse or one of those little -tucked-under-the-armpit&#x27; purses, then maybe this will work for you.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;d mention is sunglasses do not fit well into side slot as shown, but I keep mine in the car anyway</li>
            <li> Some of the compartments are not even usable due to their size.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a big bag for a trip I am taking, but usually use a small Miche bag.  </li>
            <li> yes, I was disappointed how small it is, so I honestly planned on filing a return.</li>
            <li> Now we can just put everything in it and switch purses in an instant without worrying we left something behind.  </li>
            <li> when i open the package , it looks like a small dead rat.</li>
            <li> Would buy another one for other purses i have!</li>
            <li> I usually refer to my purse as the black hole, because what goes in may never be seen again.</li>
            <li> Before buying that from Amazon I went through the reviews and even though there were a few people saying it was small</li>
            <li> I can now switch with very little effort, since you can pull this out of your bag with the attached handles and plop it in another bag and be on your way.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an insert for your small evening purse, this is the thing to buy.</li>
            <li> This item is ridiculously small.</li>
            <li> It looked small when I got it</li>
            <li> It is extremely small and was trashed upon arrival to me</li>
            <li> This item is SMALL!</li>
            <li> This was not a purse organizer but a very small contrapment</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> nice size.  lots of pockets of all sizes.  I like the handles that makes it easier to remove from one purse and place in the next purse.  well made</li>
            <li> This product is really nice.  It has all the pockets I need to organize my large purse.  My only problem with it is that it is a lot smaller than I thought it would be.  In the picture provided their is a lot more stuff able to fit in it then what I am able to fit in mine.  But for keeping all the little cluttery stuff off the bottom of purse, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this bag organizer, it gives me a quick and easy way to enjoy and change bags without all the mess.</li>
            <li> This purse organizer is perfect for medium or small bags, and works perfectly!  I needed an organizer and the first one I purchased (the Kangaroo Keeper) was too large, and frankly speaking a little smelly.  So I tried this one, and it fits flawlessly!  The price was right, and the organizer holds all of my stuff.  For the medium/smaller bags, I would definitely recommend this organizer.</li>
            <li> I totally blame myself for this purchase mistake. I did not read the dimensions or pay attention to the on line visual. This item is SMALL! If you&#x27;re looking for an insert for your small evening purse, this is the thing to buy. However, if you&#x27;re looking for an insert to use for your medium to large bags-this is NOT it. This item is ridiculously small. Some of the compartments are not even usable due to their size.</li>
            <li> I usually refer to my purse as the black hole, because what goes in may never be seen again. This is a lifesaver! I loaded it up the day I got it and have been using it ever since. So at this point it&#x27;s lasted well over a year. As a student clinician I switch bags almost daily so it&#x27;s holding up very well. The multiple outer pockets make it easy to keep items sorted. One of my favorite features of this particular organizer is the pen sized pockets. The hold two gel-writer pens each, so I keep multiple pens and my lip glosses in those pockets. After a year of use, I can now reach into my bag without looking and feel my way to whatever item it is I&#x27;m trying to grab. I ordered the large version, so it doesn&#x27;t work for small purses, but it does work in medium size bags. To give you some reference, the smallest bag I can fit it in is my Calvin Klein Claire barrel satchel. being able to quickly switch purses and still find everything is definitely a worth the small investment.</li>
            <li> Well made, fits in my purse well. The only changes I would recommend is to be ALL Tan to see into it better &amp; inside pockets a tight squeeze for checkbook. 1/2\\&quot; longer might work.</li>
            <li> I received this today.  I recently bought a big bag for a trip I am taking, but usually use a small Miche bag.  I was so delighted that this fits in both of them.  I can now switch with very little effort, since you can pull this out of your bag with the attached handles and plop it in another bag and be on your way.  The pockets for lipstick and pen are really helpful, as these usually get lost in the bag even when they have pockets.</li>
            <li> Nice but not as big as I thought it was going to be but it does keep my purse meet and in order.</li>
            <li> Very good quality organizer. The handles are so helpful for lifting out/placing into purse but don&#x27;t get in the way of reaching into the organizer itself. I am changing purses so much more often now because it&#x27;s not a hassle anymore to swap things out so I really get to enjoy using my handbags. Only thing I&#x27;d mention is sunglasses do not fit well into side slot as shown, but I keep mine in the car anyway and since most handbags have pockets I can just slip glasses in there if I decide to keep them on or forget to leave them behind. No worries about pens or keys scratching them because it&#x27;s all organized!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Jolie Tan &amp; brown thru MyEasyBag under purse organizer.  It measures 7.5x6x3.5. I looked on line for purse organizers, making sure the measurements would meed my needs. I ordered this one and love all the compartments. I filled it up with address book,check book, pens, lotion, etc. Once you slip it into your purse it serves as a divider for whatever else you want in there like billfold, purse size calender. I used to have a hard time to find all the zippered compartments I wanted in a purse, now I can find more purses that would meet my needs with this product. It looked small when I got it but my purse is maybe medium size and it is great with it.</li>
            <li> This was not a purse organizer but a very small contrapment I don&#x27;t know what to do with. It is extremely small and was trashed upon arrival to me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great organizer, makes everything easy to find! Love the colour! It&#x27;s a nice organizer for those small bags!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write too many reviews but having purchased this purse insert I just feel I need to share my experience. Before buying that from Amazon I went through the reviews and even though there were a few people saying it was small I decided to give it a try. I have a pretty large Alexander Wang tote and I was looking for an organizer to keep all my stuff in order. I came across this one by Jolie Brown and I liked how it looked on the pictures + the colors were exactly what I was looking for, so I bought it. When the package arrived and I opened it yes, I was disappointed how small it is, so I honestly planned on filing a return. But since I had it already opened I decided to give it a try and see how it will work with my tote and everything I have in there. And it works amazing!!! I absolutely love it. It has room for everything and I still have space left. This is a good quality thing and I am really enjoying using that.</li>
            <li> She loved it!  Now she&#x27;s organized!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this prouduct to use it but when my son got it for me I was not too happy.First it says large but it was medium size.second it smelled bad and it doesn&#x27;t fit that much stuff as it shows. And the last thing I want to say it&#x27;s over priced because when you add shipping it&#x27; almost $18.00 .  And I think Avon just introduced a nice big bag for $20.00 . And it has all the pockets to organize yourbag . So I will say it is overpriced. Specially when something made in china not in USA .</li>
            <li> Very nice but just a little too small.  Bought a bigger one that is perfect.  Great for smaller purses, however.</li>
            <li> I bought a purse because I fell in love with it but I also reazied at the time that it had no pockets inside to organize my \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;. After looking on line in several places I chose this particular organizer and I could not be happier. It works great. The dividers and pockets are all so practical: now my purse not only looks nice but is functional too!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size, and exactly what I was looking for!  It took a bit of searching to find it but well worth the time. I do wish it was easier to find though.</li>
            <li> Could be bigger, but works really well for my makeup</li>
            <li> I just learned that this product existed and thought it was a great idea. I bought one for me and several for friends. They were delighted and I really like mine as well. A good idea well executed!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be bigger but it still keeps all my little things in one spot and I don&#x27;t have to dig for my lipstick.</li>
            <li> Great product! very durable and holding up still. keeps everything organized and in place in my huge purse. Would buy another one for other purses i have!</li>
            <li> If you normally carry a small clutch purse or one of those little -tucked-under-the-armpit&#x27; purses, then maybe this will work for you.  But for women who carry &#x27;handbags&#x27; or satchels or totes and then normally have them more than half full with stuff, this little insert will not help you much. This could hold maybe a full size leather wallet, a pair of glasses, a powder compact, a few tubes of mascara/lipstick, some IDs and keys.  That&#x27;s pretty much it.  Anything beyomd that and this thing would be stuffed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO like that it has a key fob...that&#x27;s very handy!</li>
            <li> I often make my purses, but like lots of nooks and crannies to keep things organized, and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> the picture of the purse organizer look bigger than in person, i was very upset and disappionted when i open the package , it looks like a small dead rat. and i would love to get info on how to return it.</li>
            <li> This product is substantial and high quality with lots of great pockets both inside and outside of the organizer.  There is a large open area inside with two slip pockets on each side of the interior.  I stood my wallet and phone on their ends and inserted them on the inside.  This makes them easy to grab. The exterior has loads of various sized pockets.  No netting that can tear.  I ordered the 7 inch brown and taupe organizer.  It fits my 12 inch wide zippered purse perfectly.  My daughter say it and loved it.  I ordered one for her too.  Now we can just put everything in it and switch purses in an instant without worrying we left something behind.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is great! So many pockets and sections to organize stuff. I&#x27;m no longer digging out my wallet, gloves, and keys in order to find my Chapstick, etc.  I also like that this gives my relatively soft cloth purse some structure. A very good buy - worth the money and thoughtfully designed.</li>
