            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Works great for cleaning my teeth</li>

            <li>I have used my Oral-B vitality for 2 years ever since it was suggested by my Dentist, and it is as great as the day I bought it.</li>

            <li>That is a very nice feature.</li>
            <li>Very nice .</li>
            <li>(duct tape amazingly did not work well!)</li>
            <li>I loved it.    </li>
            <li>Well, I purchased this product after the good reviews I read here.</li>
            <li>It does seem to do a good job of cleaning and polishing the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bacause I had a lot of good recommendations from my friends.</li>
            <li>Good .. but its noisy ...</li>
            <li>but after I did I felt it was doing a good job.</li>
            <li>It may not be fair to compare a power toothbrush to a sonic toothbrush, but I feel I must for those who are weighing the merits of each to make a decision whether the power toothbrush might do the job of a sonic without the investment.  </li>
            <li>its battery is good</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Con\\&quot;, this is a really good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>A good toothbrush for the price.  </li>
            <li>but I do use a good deal of pressure when brushing my teeth and this brush had no problem with it.</li>
            <li>Life is good.</li>
            <li>I bought this for $30, which I thought was good to see what these electric toothbrushes offer.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of cleaning teeth and massaging gums.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: this is an effective product that does what it needs to do, doesn&#x27;t do things I don&#x27;t need it to, doesn&#x27;t cost a lot of money, and has good manufacturer support.</li>
            <li>just what I needed and great service, it came in reasonable time and works good!</li>
            <li>I will buy more for the rest of my family when the need arises!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>Got it at a great price with free shipping.</li>
            <li>toothbrush works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown to trust Oral-B since splurging on my own.     </li>
            <li>Oral-B also encloses a coupon good for $3.00 off more replacement heads, if you&#x27;re so inclined, and I probably will be.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two minute timer is a nice addition, though to be candid, I find 90 seconds is plenty of brushing with this brush.</li>
            <li>The two minute timer is a nice addition, though to be candid, I find 90 seconds is plenty of brushing with this brush.</li>
            <li>so that is nice.</li>
            <li>I liked this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I think it would be wise to spring for the better product.</li>
            <li>and It ijust as good as that one, or better.</li>
            <li>Does a nice cleaning job.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is good, two motion functions leave a very clean feeling teeth.</li>
            <li>in all, this inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush seems to be well made, does a good job at cleaning my teeth, and is easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li>All in all, this inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush seems to be well made, does a good job at cleaning my teeth, and is easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it has a two minute timer that lets you know when you have brushed your teeth for the optimum time.  </li>
            <li>The spinning heads just seem to polish my teeth up more effectively than I can by hand...</li>
            <li>What i really liked about this one is that you feel the head much more on your teeth</li>
            <li>This Oral-B is a cost-effective and suitable replacement for a manual toothbrush, and is a good bet for anyone looking to get a cheap automatic toothbrush.    </li>
            <li>On the good side, this powered brush is very powerful.</li>
            <li>This is a very fine toothbrush.</li>
            <li>At first it worked great</li>
            <li>Moreover, it is very light weight in comparison to the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush for many reasons.  </li>
            <li>I can leave it uplugged for many days</li>
            <li>also love that you get a replacement brush with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The sonicare is thinner, has better features, is better looking, and</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;ve not noticed any of the heads around town, so I will probably have to order those online, which is ok, but I like availability.</li>
            <li>It works well and the charge lasts a week or more.</li>
            <li>If the head were skinnier and angled, then it could enable better access to teeth in the rear of my mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never used an electic toothbrush before and wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d feel about it.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t be sure.)    </li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t used to how the brush affects the gums and it did get better.</li>
            <li>this cost do NOT brush better, they just have features</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now confident that I brush my teeth for plenty of time.</li>
            <li>This allows you to store the charger for most of a week.  </li>
            <li>Excellent dental cleaning  Solid construction  Rubberized,</li>
            <li>Another nice feature is that the cost of the replacement heads is not prohibitive and that there are a variety of options available.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see this as a disadvantage--this is probably more of a safety feature.)  </li>
            <li>and I went through many replaceable heads.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, this one is certainly better than most of the electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Thisis a replacement for one I had vor many years</li>
            <li>The charge lasts many days.  </li>
            <li>Still, it has the timer and cleans better than a manual toothbrush does.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it does an okay job</li>
            <li>The toothbrush does do a better job than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love its performance.</li>
            <li>totally satisfied with this purchase and recommend it.</li>
            <li>you want more time.  </li>
            <li>This works much better than my now-defunct non-rechargeable battery operated toothbrush.     </li>
            <li>and I love the massaging motion for my gums.</li>
            <li>better chances with the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is such a great alternative!</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to find one on amazon and its rechargeable.</li>
            <li>We love them.</li>
            <li>Three days at the most after which the power dwindles rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LOVE IT......</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush that not only is good for my teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very straightforward.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>It never disappoints and gets teeth very clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a pretty good power brush.</li>
            <li>First, the good.    </li>
            <li>I had my first Oral-B for 3 years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>and I was happy with the my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I always believe that a toothbrush has done a good job when it leaves me with a smooth, fresh feeling on both the outsides and the insides of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to keep it taped with strong packaging tape</li>
            <li>I am pleased to be able to find it available online at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I loved this toothbrush, was happy with the results, it kept an adequate charge that would last about 2+ weeks.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very good, entry-level toothbrush from Oral-B.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good looking design with a two tone color on the entire handle.  </li>
            <li>I have been using an ultrasonic toothbrush for some time now with great results so far.</li>
            <li>This is a thoughtful feature, but might be more helpful for children than for adults.  </li>
            <li>Their brush pattern (oscillation) is an excellent one for cleaning with minimal abrasion.    </li>
            <li>You can also store the brush on the charger, but this isn&#x27;t the most ecological way of charging the brush.  </li>
            <li>They need to try and overcome the space needed to make the mechanicals of a swirling AND a scrubbing head able to occupy the space at the end of the brush that is supposed to fit in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>These work very well and are of good quality.</li>
            <li>Cleans perfectly, with little or no effort, and is very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>love how fresh it makes my mouth feel!</li>
            <li>so you end up with a feeling of having really clean mouth which I like much more than the ultrasonic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was easy to figure out and easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy grip handle  Rechargeable batteries  Built in timer  </li>
            <li>It is more economical than buying a cheaper, non-rechargeable model and works better than those bargain-basement throwaway electric toothbrushes that you can buy at a department or drug store.</li>
            <li>The design of the handle was well thought out and easy to charge and use.  </li>
            <li>For me, the best are gentle in movement, with a soft brush.</li>
            <li>1. easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>so I clean my teeth better).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Bought for myself and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I got hooked because Oral-B brushes have precisely the right stiffness in the bristles to clean effectively without hurting the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a huge step up from manual and $10 grocery store electrics.</li>
            <li>It is light in your hand, configured to how you hold a brush,packable, and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>tooth paste up to 4 feet away, makes a huge</li>
            <li>Fortunately, this model has a built-in timer, which notifies you that it&#x27;s time to stop or you&#x27;ll overdo it.</li>
            <li>Not only does it do a great job at cleaning teeth</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t have purchased a second one if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable makes it much more economical.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable once you get used to it.    </li>
            <li>I have used a Soniccare Elite toothbrush for several years after receiving a recommendation from a dental hygienist and have been quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with one refill, and additional refills are available here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>That feature is really important since I def.</li>
            <li>I have a Sonicare, which I like a lot and think is a more powerful cleaner</li>
            <li>Fortunately this time, they sent me a toothbrush that worked and still works up to this day (2 weeks time) and looked into the faulty one.</li>
            <li>I used to use a very exspencive powered toothbrush but when that bit the dust I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend that kind of cash again.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Much more powerful than those $5-7</li>
            <li>, it works great, and the price was a lot cheaper than others with the same as this one.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job and is much easier to use than a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Received it today, so far so good</li>
            <li>Soft and white, clean and bright, you look happy to meet me.</li>
            <li>Unlike an old powered toothbrush I once had, it doesn&#x27;t require a special toothpaste, and can use your favorite kind.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like them, the original brush heads will fit too, and there are some additional varieties.</li>
            <li>Overall, excellent brush- highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt extremely clean and smooth after use.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a worthy product and one that I can easily recommend.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very, very fussy about how clean my teeth feel after I brush, and until now, I hadn&#x27;t found a powered toothbrush that satisfied me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many things from Amazon and this is the first product that I ever had aproblem with.</li>
            <li>It was faulty and more specifically after the first two minutes of operation, it just stopped working.</li>
            <li>This brush has a better switch, more brush and more than enough charge to go the full 2 minutes and beyond.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-b Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush is the economy model of the Oral-b electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>(Somehow not quite sonicare clean though)</li>
            <li>The heads with this brush are the dual clean version.</li>
            <li>B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head (4 ct.)]]), but the brush heads in this package also have a set of bristles beneath that go side-to-side (like [[ASIN:B0002KHU3I Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I just do so, so that must also help get them clean.    </li>
            <li>I decided to give this Oral-b Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush a try.    </li>
            <li>gets my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>You can price the Dual Clean replacement head here</li>
            <li>my teeth seem be clean.</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel dental office clean</li>
            <li>but it gives a gentle massage to my guns and keeps my tongue clean and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>and if it is your first electric toothbrush you could get used to it, but to anyone shopping I would suggest looking closely at the part that goes into your mouth and decide if it looks like a comfortable fit.  </li>
            <li>So, I thought this product would be a good middle ground.</li>
            <li>As of this writing, the prices seemed more than reasonable.    </li>
            <li>You really need to place it on a counter top.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t brush the full couple of minutes without it.  </li>
            <li>On top it when I tried charging it it burned so much you could almost get a hand burn if you touched it.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using Oral-B for almost as long, so their electric brush was a good fit for me.  </li>
            <li>Wow-a decent rechargeable toothbrush for this price is pretty amazing, I think.  </li>
            <li>Clean teeth, fresh breath &#x3D;</li>
            <li>Overall,  very satisfied.</li>
            <li>If the rechargeable battery holds out, this will be a great replacement for my original Oral-B electric, which lasted eight years before biting the dust a few weeks ago..     </li>
            <li>If the rechargeable battery holds out, this will be a great replacement for my original Oral-B electric, which lasted eight years before biting the dust a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li>A full charge will give you a week&#x27;s worth of brushing.</li>
            <li>This new brush head works much better.  </li>
            <li>After using the Oral-B for about two weeks, my teeth feel significantly cleaner, very much like just coming from the semi-annual dental check-up and cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I can&#x27;t tell much difference in effectiveness between these heads and the original ones without the side-to-side action, but the new heads are fine with me.</li>
            <li>The Oral-b Vitality seemed like a fine foray into the fantastic realm of moto-brushes, since it seems to provide all the features I&#x27;d find reasonably necessary in a toothbrush, it comes from a &#x27;recognized name&#x27; in oral hygiene (for whatever that&#x27;s worth), and it&#x27;s more reasonably priced than some moto-brushes, which hover at around the $100 mark (or higher!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this brush is great for everyday use, but I will esp.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I bought the same one!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have no real experience with powered toothbrushes, but this one was a good acquisition for a first-timer.  </li>
            <li>so it is worth the trade off.  </li>
            <li>I love the dual tooth brush action.</li>
            <li>Additionally I find their recharge mechanism ingenious, there are no connectors, near as I can tell, it must use a magetic field.</li>
            <li>It came with an extra brush head too, a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric toothbrushes for over 15 years and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Seriously, my whole head vibrates, and my teeth are super clean.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that you can use 3 or 4 different kind of Oral B brushes on this unit.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really worth for the price</li>
            <li>so I got the same kind.</li>
            <li>ITS EFFICIENT AND FUN TO BRUSH WITH, EVERYDAY.&lt;br /&gt;HOLDS</li>
            <li>I first used this power toothbrush it felt somewhat large, but then quickly it felt comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have tried other electric toothbrushes but always go back to Braun, they are the best, their battery lasts the longest.</li>
            <li>Super fast ship!</li>
            <li>This means that when the toothbrush is seated in the charger, the whole thing is a little top heavy and easily falls over--not the best of designs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a little bit more then a week and a half more than happy with every dollar spend on this.</li>
            <li>The brush has an overall shape that is pretty comfortable for gripping.    </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing and able to invest a little more on a toothbrush that I&#x27;ve been very pleased with, I recommend the Philips SonicCare R732 Health White toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>And since the head spins, I didn&#x27;t think you need to apply much pressure to clean the teeth</li>
            <li>With minimal amounts of pressure, I got a surprisingly good dental cleaning--that smooth and squeaky clean feeling that I only seem to get after my teeth are cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush simply does a much better job than a manual toothbrush and really gives you that fresh-from-the-dentist clean feeling.    </li>
            <li>: Timer works great and is obvious enough even when I&#x27;m not 100% awake.    </li>
            <li>[[[ASIN:B0002KHU3I Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]]] and the &#x60;high line&#x27; Pro-White replacement head here</li>
            <li>I have used a rechargeable Oral B toothbrush for many years but there were so many bad reviews on this one that I bought 2 - One to make sure it was okay before giving it to her.  </li>
            <li>Discharges very fast.</li>
            <li>Namely at the bottom, where it sits on the charger, is a totally inadequate plastic cap that hold the whole thing together with a very strong spring inside waiting to break the plastic...which is what happened.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s really nice is that this toothbrush and my other Oral-B both accept the same replaceable brush heads which is great since they usually come in packs of more than one.    </li>
            <li>This is my first ever electric toothbrush, and I received it through the Amazon Vine program.</li>
            <li>They work so much better than regular tootbrushes.</li>
            <li>First, the exterior design.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is more for people who aren&#x27;t used to electric toothbrushes-</li>
            <li>As yet I cannot comment on the battery or related durability issues, as that may take a year or more of use to assess.  </li>
            <li>Save yourself a bunch of money and don&#x27;t buy the expensive alternatives with impressive sounding names.</li>
            <li>I had to return it because it stopped working the first day I got it.</li>
            <li>This is my first battery operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Even though  I purchased it for the first time</li>
            <li>,I am very happy with this and will probably not look into the expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Only hygienists with scrapey tools do a more thorough job.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally gonna buy two more of these for my mom and dad.</li>
            <li>guess I was spoiled by my first one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After I used it for like 2 months, my brother bought exact one</li>
            <li>(it was his first time using el. toothbrush as well).</li>
            <li>When in stand the toothbrush is top heavy and falls easily to the side  </li>
            <li>Particularly for the the back teeth, the spinning bristles do a far superior job of removing particles.</li>
            <li>It certainly feels better than regular ole toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush that came with the unit are soft which I prefer since I feel that soft bristles are better for your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>It costs a bit more, but the fact is, unlike most appliances, it&#x27;s one you&#x27;ll use at least once a day...in your mouth.</li>
            <li>To use this regularly, I&#x27;d probably recommend augmenting it with a manual toothbrush with a smaller head to get to those spots to ensure good dental and gum hygiene.    </li>
            <li>Thus, what would have been a POSITIVE 5 STARS</li>
            <li>-B electric brushes come in multiple types, or to be more precise, the brush heads come in several types.</li>
            <li>We received our Oral-B power toothbrush a few days after ordering and we have both been very pleased with our results.  </li>
            <li>As a first time user, I think the large brush head is a bit much.</li>
            <li>However, the brush head of this particular model is fairly large, which meant I wasn&#x27;t able to get to the gum line of the teeth in the back of my head</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t had this product very long, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>easy to setup and works like a charm, the charge does last for over a week</li>
            <li>Terrific brush, easy to use..</li>
            <li>rather large brush.</li>
            <li>They clean way better than a normal toothbrush--much less plaque build up.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have also mentioned, it would be helpful if there were an indicator light showing when the battery is full.  </li>
            <li>I liked the price and thought this great value, but unless you literally have a big mouth, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular power toothbrush - and if Oral-b offers a different model with a smaller brush head or has replacement heads that have a smaller brush, that might make all the difference in the world and offer a cost savings without compromising your dental health by not reaching all of your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>It feels like the rotating head is really getting into the gumline.    </li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner after I brush with this than when I brush with a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much that I&#x27;m going to order it again for my kids.</li>
            <li>Really cleans.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, compact, and the battery seems to hold its charge very well</li>
            <li>She says that her teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>This Oral-B is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>Because it really does do the job, there&#x27;s a feeling of renewed vitality and freedom from guilt....</li>
            <li>cleans very well&lt;</li>
            <li>And it is reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>There are two oscillating brushes and there are different brush heads that will fit the handle.</li>
            <li>for the brushing, IT IS INTENSE.  </li>
            <li>it cleans teeth really well.</li>
            <li>Works very well- came as advertized.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the two minute timer.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been working really well for me.</li>
            <li>but was that package really</li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner the whole day.</li>
            <li>But once I read reviews for el. toothbrush, it said that you will know you are applying more pressure than needed when you see the brush head become wide.</li>
            <li>Hahaha.</li>
            <li>Thanks Oral-B &amp; Braun.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I liked this toothbrush except for the fact that the head was too big to reach my back teeth.  </li>
            <li>While the outsides felt fine after brushing with the Oral-b, I was not left with the same clean sensation on the inside surfaces of my teeth as when using my Soniccare.    </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve had such toothbrushes before, battery powered, and they ran through juice pretty quick.</li>
            <li>The brush also polishes to a smooth result on flat teeth</li>
            <li>The original version that takes 2 AAs is slightly smaller, and of course needs no charger, so I use one of those for travel.</li>
            <li>Other Oral B units at many times</li>
            <li>My teeth have nerve felt so clean on a daily basis!</li>
            <li>The fact that this thing has a rechargeable battery is both an economic and ecological advantage in the long run.  </li>
            <li>This is our third Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>is the first electric toothbrush I have used so far (have been using for 4 months now).</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure this will result in less cavities when I get my dental check-ups.</li>
            <li>brushes better with less space in your mouth (if that makes sense.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find an electric toothbrush does a more thorough job at cleaning my teeth, especially the back</li>
            <li>or maybe it was this particular seller that is unprofessional.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s better than a manual toothbrush, the head is too big to reach the back of the teeth, which he doesn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as a replacement for an older one.  </li>
            <li>Dentist recommended this particular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I recently tried the Oral-b Dual Clean and found it to be a very old school design.  </li>
            <li>While this might sound like a good thing for some, the sheer size of the brushes made it difficult for me to reach certain areas of my mouth.      </li>
            <li>you are like me and concerned about your oral hygiene, I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for the price.</li>
            <li>I did not realize how my old Oral B had slowed with age!!</li>
            <li>But after receiving the Oral B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable toothbrush from Vine, I&#x27;m back in the saddle again and quite surprised at the results.</li>
            <li>The battery charging system is very good and nothing dangerous.  </li>
            <li>The dual-action head certainly leaves a very clean-tasting mouth, and may assist in my tendency to apply too much pressure when I brushed manually, thus wearing enamel and causing sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>The original Oral-B electric head has a single spinning set of bristles (like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Something about the action of the brushes really does leave my mouth feeling cleaner and my teeth smoother than before.</li>
            <li>I find I normally get about 3 months use before needing to replace the brushing unit, which is the replacement time frame stated on the package.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is well worth the money and comes with several heads</li>
            <li>She loves it and every few days will comment \\&quot;I love my toothbrush\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>$6 brushes are now made for Walmart by yet a new unknown supplier and the quality has taken a huge downfall.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush, Light Green and White  </li>
            <li>Other points: as others have said, the grip is well designed and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Other points: as others have said, the grip is well designed and comfortable.</li>
            <li>with this new dual-head model.    </li>
            <li>a new one cause</li>
            <li>I just wanted a new one..</li>
            <li>AND WILL BUY A NEW, ONE WHEN THIS ONE DIES</li>
            <li>When I get my dental cleanings I can hardly tell the difference because the Oral B does such a good job brushing.  </li>
            <li>The brushing activity is easy enough - definitely a different feeling than a manual brush, but it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>There is no way to tell how much battery life is left (or how much charging is needed to fill the battery.    </li>
            <li>I noticed with the old brush head that my teeth felt much cleaner than when brushing with a old fashioned toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I think Braun was very professional in handling the problem.   </li>
            <li>My more expensive model seems much more powerful (rightfully so) and also seems to have more \\&quot;rotation\\&quot; BUT DOES this less expensive model CLEAN TEETH and GUMS</li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>my gums were actually a bit sore for about a week after trying this at first.</li>
            <li>First the design; the entire brush is a sealed unit so that nothing, including the recharging area, is exposed to water.  </li>
            <li>My first last 5 years</li>
            <li>Funny enough, that one didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I have had, the first lasted about 5 years.</li>
            <li>It was the exact same model.</li>
            <li>It is nice that they have designed different heads to address different issues related to plaque and gums, but if you can only reach the front region of your teeth with it, your dental health would seem to suffer.  </li>
            <li>as though at last you have brushed the way your mother (to say nothing of your dental hygienist) told you was the right way!</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a very long time - i took this on a 4 day vacation without recharging it and it worked for 2 brushings per day for the entire vacation just fine.</li>
            <li>A full charge takes roughly 16 hours to complete.      </li>
            <li>It seems to do an adequate job, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the timer alert that I expected.  </li>
            <li>(Just to test the resilience of the batteries, I found that I was able to brush with the unit twice daily for over a week without running down the charge.)    </li>
            <li>The movement of this power toothbrush was different from that of the sonic toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used - it was slower and less energetic.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Oral B for many years now and my previous one (about 6 years old) finally conked out.  </li>
            <li>I am sold on Oral-b, and certainly will consider this brand when its time for my next automatic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sold on Oral-b; the only cons I see are the loud noise and the large brush heads.</li>
            <li>The Philips R732 is like a powerful little sports car, while this Oral-b is more like a heavy industrial vehicle.  </li>
            <li>And for people with smaller or sensitive mouths, this model may be a bit much.</li>
            <li>This brush has helped me keep my sensitive teeth much cleaner than I could with a regular brush.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush cleans as well as the old toothbrush but doesn&#x27;t set off the buzzing, tickling sensation.</li>
            <li>I was incredibly surprised athow</li>
            <li>the old one still works.</li>
            <li>Having tried this brush, I&#x27;d recommend stepping up to the [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-b Professional Care Electric Toothbrush]].</li>
            <li>I replaced&lt;br /&gt;my old Vitality toothbrush heads</li>
            <li>I also have an Oral-B battery brush that works well and is loud but not quite as powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And with this thing, maybe they won&#x27;t have much work to do next time I visit them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like to tease him that it sounds like a weed eater because it is so loud.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a dental health professional, so</li>
            <li>Keeping the kids busy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Oral-B toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It works as well as my old model.</li>
            <li>So when my old one broke and I couldn&#x27;t find one at Walmart</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, the product is running great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t heard if they like it or not so far.</li>
            <li>But, it just died completely, after not even 2 years of owning it.</li>
            <li>Had one for years bought a replacement before they completely disappear .</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the extra $5 to $8 over the generic one.</li>
            <li>The dual brushes worked fine on the outsides of my teeth and seemed effective around the outside gum line, my relatively small mouth made it quite difficult for me to adequately brush all surfaces of the insides of my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a completely-sealed induction charging base (nice and safe).</li>
            <li>BUT just after I had it for a year, the major flaw erupted!!</li>
            <li>it turns on, it vibrates, it turns off - but the \\&quot;dual action\\&quot; of the rotating round brush and the vibrating straight brush left my teeth feeling just-back-from-the-dentist clean.  </li>
            <li>However, it is really loud and the brush head is large (it comes with two), making it tough to get on my back teeth where I need it the most.  </li>
            <li>I have a $100+ Oral B at home and, while I appreciate the bells and whistles, this much less expensive Oral-B does the same excellent job.</li>
            <li>My teeth are sensitive to harsh vibration, so it took a little practice to use this product effectively.</li>
            <li>The top component is a large, round bristle that oscillates back and forth and a lower triangular section that vibrates up and down.  </li>
            <li>The electric brush also allows you to focus more on each tooth and brush more carefully, whether from a change of long-established habits, or mere respect for power tools!  </li>
            <li>These new heads are even a step above that.  </li>
            <li>There are 5 different style cleaning heads that can be used with this rechargeable toothbrush and the package had a $3 off coupon for a new brush.</li>
            <li>But the dual head is just too big for my mouth, and the combination of the larger head with the intense power of the toothbrush feels too \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s rechargeable - which offers further savings over frequent replacements and/or battery replacements.  </li>
            <li>There is one major design flaw though.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to replace my 10+ year old Oral B rechargeable electric toothbrush (which still works, by the way!)</li>
            <li>The charge cycle may sound incredibly long, but once you realize that the toothbrush will be stored on the charger in between uses, the charge cycle seems to matter less.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this little toothbrush but was very surprised at its vigorous action.  </li>
            <li>The brushes seem to rotate very slowly (compared to the ultra high speed vibration of the Sonicare) and the entire head is too large to comfortably fit in my mouth, especially the back teeth.  </li>
            <li>It feels very solid in your hands and is clearly well constructed.  </li>
            <li>&quot; the head was too big for even an adult mouth.  </li>
            <li>She could barely get it in her mouth and could not maneuver it to reach her teeth with gagging.  </li>
            <li>This replaces my old one that wore out after several years.  </li>
            <li>but it barely held its charge for the 2 minute timer.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money and buy some nice expensive electric toothbrush which will at least last for a good time.</li>
            <li>The fat, round one on the top oscillates while the slightly squared one on the bottom moves from side to side.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using it, both my wife and I have cleaner feeling teeth, less gum bleeding, and better breath.  </li>
            <li>new one does not hold a charge nearly as long.  </li>
            <li>bought it for husband and it has outlasted ever other electric tooth bus we have purchased at at reasonable price</li>
            <li>replacing the same kind that stopped working, even though they slow down from time to time...</li>
            <li>The power toothbrush felt clumsy in comparison, though I did feel the teeth it reached were clean afterward.    </li>
            <li>About 6 months ago I purchased the Oral-B Professional Care Deluxe Electric Toothbrush for about eighty bucks - far more than I&#x27;ve ever spent on a toothbrush but knew I could return it if it was awful.</li>
            <li>The main plus for this toothbrush is that it easily gets in all the places that are hard to reach with a conventional toothbrush, like in close next to the gum line and in between teeth.</li>
            <li>It replaced an old battery-operated brush that had only single cleaning action and used a lot of batteries.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted quite a few years</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is pretty ideally sized, and the base station has a small footprint.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m happy I tried this!</li>
            <li> This replacement is all you need for an excellent brush!  </li>
            <li> If they could downsize the head a bit, it would be a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> So we decided why not get an electric oral b, we found this model and very very happy with it.</li>
            <li> After brushing I can feel my teeth are cleaner and some of the plaque that had been there is gone,  which is awesome!</li>
            <li> It is probably the best value electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> They are the best for the money.</li>

            <li> Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> This electric brush does a great job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> (I had a great sonic toothbrush from the now defunct Ultreo and those heads were $24 apiece -</li>
            <li> Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Works great for cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> This toothbrush worked great for about 3-4 weeks ( twice a day use)  </li>
            <li> I have used my Oral-B vitality for 2 years ever since it was suggested by my Dentist, and it is as great as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price!  </li>
            <li> This is all you need and its cheap!!!</li>
            <li> That is a very nice feature.</li>
            <li> Very nice .</li>
            <li> (duct tape amazingly did not work well!)</li>
            <li> I loved it.    </li>
            <li> Well, I purchased this product after the good reviews I read here.</li>
            <li> It does seem to do a good job of cleaning and polishing the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bacause I had a lot of good recommendations from my friends.</li>
            <li> Good .. but its noisy ...</li>
            <li> but after I did I felt it was doing a good job.</li>
            <li> It may not be fair to compare a power toothbrush to a sonic toothbrush, but I feel I must for those who are weighing the merits of each to make a decision whether the power toothbrush might do the job of a sonic without the investment.  </li>
            <li> its battery is good</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Con\\&quot;, this is a really good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> A good toothbrush for the price.  </li>
            <li> but I do use a good deal of pressure when brushing my teeth and this brush had no problem with it.</li>
            <li> Life is good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for $30, which I thought was good to see what these electric toothbrushes offer.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of cleaning teeth and massaging gums.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: this is an effective product that does what it needs to do, doesn&#x27;t do things I don&#x27;t need it to, doesn&#x27;t cost a lot of money, and has good manufacturer support.</li>
            <li> just what I needed and great service, it came in reasonable time and works good!</li>
            <li> I will buy more for the rest of my family when the need arises!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Got it at a great price with free shipping.</li>
            <li> toothbrush works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown to trust Oral-B since splurging on my own.     </li>
            <li> Oral-B also encloses a coupon good for $3.00 off more replacement heads, if you&#x27;re so inclined, and I probably will be.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two minute timer is a nice addition, though to be candid, I find 90 seconds is plenty of brushing with this brush.</li>
            <li> The two minute timer is a nice addition, though to be candid, I find 90 seconds is plenty of brushing with this brush.</li>
            <li> so that is nice.</li>
            <li> I liked this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I think it would be wise to spring for the better product.</li>
            <li> and It ijust as good as that one, or better.</li>
            <li> Does a nice cleaning job.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is good, two motion functions leave a very clean feeling teeth.</li>
            <li> in all, this inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush seems to be well made, does a good job at cleaning my teeth, and is easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> All in all, this inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush seems to be well made, does a good job at cleaning my teeth, and is easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it has a two minute timer that lets you know when you have brushed your teeth for the optimum time.  </li>
            <li> The spinning heads just seem to polish my teeth up more effectively than I can by hand...</li>
            <li> What i really liked about this one is that you feel the head much more on your teeth</li>
            <li> This Oral-B is a cost-effective and suitable replacement for a manual toothbrush, and is a good bet for anyone looking to get a cheap automatic toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> On the good side, this powered brush is very powerful.</li>
            <li> This is a very fine toothbrush.</li>
            <li> At first it worked great</li>
            <li> Moreover, it is very light weight in comparison to the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush for many reasons.  </li>
            <li> I can leave it uplugged for many days</li>
            <li> also love that you get a replacement brush with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The sonicare is thinner, has better features, is better looking, and</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve not noticed any of the heads around town, so I will probably have to order those online, which is ok, but I like availability.</li>
            <li> It works well and the charge lasts a week or more.</li>
            <li> If the head were skinnier and angled, then it could enable better access to teeth in the rear of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used an electic toothbrush before and wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d feel about it.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t be sure.)    </li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t used to how the brush affects the gums and it did get better.</li>
            <li> this cost do NOT brush better, they just have features</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now confident that I brush my teeth for plenty of time.</li>
            <li> This allows you to store the charger for most of a week.  </li>
            <li> Excellent dental cleaning  Solid construction  Rubberized,</li>
            <li> Another nice feature is that the cost of the replacement heads is not prohibitive and that there are a variety of options available.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see this as a disadvantage--this is probably more of a safety feature.)  </li>
            <li> and I went through many replaceable heads.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, this one is certainly better than most of the electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Thisis a replacement for one I had vor many years</li>
            <li> The charge lasts many days.  </li>
            <li> Still, it has the timer and cleans better than a manual toothbrush does.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it does an okay job</li>
            <li> The toothbrush does do a better job than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love its performance.</li>
            <li> totally satisfied with this purchase and recommend it.</li>
            <li> you want more time.  </li>
            <li> This works much better than my now-defunct non-rechargeable battery operated toothbrush.     </li>
            <li> and I love the massaging motion for my gums.</li>
            <li> better chances with the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is such a great alternative!</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to find one on amazon and its rechargeable.</li>
            <li> We love them.</li>
            <li> Three days at the most after which the power dwindles rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> LOVE IT......</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush that not only is good for my teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very straightforward.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> It never disappoints and gets teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a pretty good power brush.</li>
            <li> First, the good.    </li>
            <li> I had my first Oral-B for 3 years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> and I was happy with the my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I always believe that a toothbrush has done a good job when it leaves me with a smooth, fresh feeling on both the outsides and the insides of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to keep it taped with strong packaging tape</li>
            <li> I am pleased to be able to find it available online at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I loved this toothbrush, was happy with the results, it kept an adequate charge that would last about 2+ weeks.</li>
            <li> Overall, a very good, entry-level toothbrush from Oral-B.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good looking design with a two tone color on the entire handle.  </li>
            <li> I have been using an ultrasonic toothbrush for some time now with great results so far.</li>
            <li> This is a thoughtful feature, but might be more helpful for children than for adults.  </li>
            <li> Their brush pattern (oscillation) is an excellent one for cleaning with minimal abrasion.    </li>
            <li> You can also store the brush on the charger, but this isn&#x27;t the most ecological way of charging the brush.  </li>
            <li> They need to try and overcome the space needed to make the mechanicals of a swirling AND a scrubbing head able to occupy the space at the end of the brush that is supposed to fit in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> These work very well and are of good quality.</li>
            <li> Cleans perfectly, with little or no effort, and is very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> love how fresh it makes my mouth feel!</li>
            <li> so you end up with a feeling of having really clean mouth which I like much more than the ultrasonic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was easy to figure out and easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy grip handle  Rechargeable batteries  Built in timer  </li>
            <li> It is more economical than buying a cheaper, non-rechargeable model and works better than those bargain-basement throwaway electric toothbrushes that you can buy at a department or drug store.</li>
            <li> The design of the handle was well thought out and easy to charge and use.  </li>
            <li> For me, the best are gentle in movement, with a soft brush.</li>
            <li> 1. easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> so I clean my teeth better).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Bought for myself and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I got hooked because Oral-B brushes have precisely the right stiffness in the bristles to clean effectively without hurting the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a huge step up from manual and $10 grocery store electrics.</li>
            <li> It is light in your hand, configured to how you hold a brush,packable, and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> tooth paste up to 4 feet away, makes a huge</li>
            <li> Fortunately, this model has a built-in timer, which notifies you that it&#x27;s time to stop or you&#x27;ll overdo it.</li>
            <li> Not only does it do a great job at cleaning teeth</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t have purchased a second one if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable makes it much more economical.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable once you get used to it.    </li>
            <li> I have used a Soniccare Elite toothbrush for several years after receiving a recommendation from a dental hygienist and have been quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with one refill, and additional refills are available here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> That feature is really important since I def.</li>
            <li> I have a Sonicare, which I like a lot and think is a more powerful cleaner</li>
            <li> Fortunately this time, they sent me a toothbrush that worked and still works up to this day (2 weeks time) and looked into the faulty one.</li>
            <li> I used to use a very exspencive powered toothbrush but when that bit the dust I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend that kind of cash again.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Much more powerful than those $5-7</li>
            <li> , it works great, and the price was a lot cheaper than others with the same as this one.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job and is much easier to use than a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Received it today, so far so good</li>
            <li> Soft and white, clean and bright, you look happy to meet me.</li>
            <li> Unlike an old powered toothbrush I once had, it doesn&#x27;t require a special toothpaste, and can use your favorite kind.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like them, the original brush heads will fit too, and there are some additional varieties.</li>
            <li> Overall, excellent brush- highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt extremely clean and smooth after use.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a worthy product and one that I can easily recommend.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very, very fussy about how clean my teeth feel after I brush, and until now, I hadn&#x27;t found a powered toothbrush that satisfied me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many things from Amazon and this is the first product that I ever had aproblem with.</li>
            <li> It was faulty and more specifically after the first two minutes of operation, it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> This brush has a better switch, more brush and more than enough charge to go the full 2 minutes and beyond.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-b Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush is the economy model of the Oral-b electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> (Somehow not quite sonicare clean though)</li>
            <li> The heads with this brush are the dual clean version.</li>
            <li> B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head (4 ct.)]]), but the brush heads in this package also have a set of bristles beneath that go side-to-side (like [[ASIN:B0002KHU3I Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I just do so, so that must also help get them clean.    </li>
            <li> I decided to give this Oral-b Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush a try.    </li>
            <li> gets my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> You can price the Dual Clean replacement head here</li>
            <li> my teeth seem be clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel dental office clean</li>
            <li> but it gives a gentle massage to my guns and keeps my tongue clean and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> and if it is your first electric toothbrush you could get used to it, but to anyone shopping I would suggest looking closely at the part that goes into your mouth and decide if it looks like a comfortable fit.  </li>
            <li> So, I thought this product would be a good middle ground.</li>
            <li> As of this writing, the prices seemed more than reasonable.    </li>
            <li> You really need to place it on a counter top.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t brush the full couple of minutes without it.  </li>
            <li> On top it when I tried charging it it burned so much you could almost get a hand burn if you touched it.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using Oral-B for almost as long, so their electric brush was a good fit for me.  </li>
            <li> Wow-a decent rechargeable toothbrush for this price is pretty amazing, I think.  </li>
            <li> Clean teeth, fresh breath &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Overall,  very satisfied.</li>
            <li> If the rechargeable battery holds out, this will be a great replacement for my original Oral-B electric, which lasted eight years before biting the dust a few weeks ago..     </li>
            <li> If the rechargeable battery holds out, this will be a great replacement for my original Oral-B electric, which lasted eight years before biting the dust a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> A full charge will give you a week&#x27;s worth of brushing.</li>
            <li> This new brush head works much better.  </li>
            <li> After using the Oral-B for about two weeks, my teeth feel significantly cleaner, very much like just coming from the semi-annual dental check-up and cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I can&#x27;t tell much difference in effectiveness between these heads and the original ones without the side-to-side action, but the new heads are fine with me.</li>
            <li> The Oral-b Vitality seemed like a fine foray into the fantastic realm of moto-brushes, since it seems to provide all the features I&#x27;d find reasonably necessary in a toothbrush, it comes from a &#x27;recognized name&#x27; in oral hygiene (for whatever that&#x27;s worth), and it&#x27;s more reasonably priced than some moto-brushes, which hover at around the $100 mark (or higher!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this brush is great for everyday use, but I will esp.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I bought the same one!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have no real experience with powered toothbrushes, but this one was a good acquisition for a first-timer.  </li>
            <li> so it is worth the trade off.  </li>
            <li> I love the dual tooth brush action.</li>
            <li> Additionally I find their recharge mechanism ingenious, there are no connectors, near as I can tell, it must use a magetic field.</li>
            <li> It came with an extra brush head too, a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric toothbrushes for over 15 years and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Seriously, my whole head vibrates, and my teeth are super clean.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that you can use 3 or 4 different kind of Oral B brushes on this unit.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really worth for the price</li>
            <li> so I got the same kind.</li>
            <li> ITS EFFICIENT AND FUN TO BRUSH WITH, EVERYDAY.&lt;br /&gt;HOLDS</li>
            <li> I first used this power toothbrush it felt somewhat large, but then quickly it felt comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have tried other electric toothbrushes but always go back to Braun, they are the best, their battery lasts the longest.</li>
            <li> Super fast ship!</li>
            <li> This means that when the toothbrush is seated in the charger, the whole thing is a little top heavy and easily falls over--not the best of designs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a little bit more then a week and a half more than happy with every dollar spend on this.</li>
            <li> The brush has an overall shape that is pretty comfortable for gripping.    </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing and able to invest a little more on a toothbrush that I&#x27;ve been very pleased with, I recommend the Philips SonicCare R732 Health White toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> And since the head spins, I didn&#x27;t think you need to apply much pressure to clean the teeth</li>
            <li> With minimal amounts of pressure, I got a surprisingly good dental cleaning--that smooth and squeaky clean feeling that I only seem to get after my teeth are cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush simply does a much better job than a manual toothbrush and really gives you that fresh-from-the-dentist clean feeling.    </li>
            <li> : Timer works great and is obvious enough even when I&#x27;m not 100% awake.    </li>
            <li> [[[ASIN:B0002KHU3I Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]]] and the &#x60;high line&#x27; Pro-White replacement head here</li>
            <li> I have used a rechargeable Oral B toothbrush for many years but there were so many bad reviews on this one that I bought 2 - One to make sure it was okay before giving it to her.  </li>
            <li> Discharges very fast.</li>
            <li> Namely at the bottom, where it sits on the charger, is a totally inadequate plastic cap that hold the whole thing together with a very strong spring inside waiting to break the plastic...which is what happened.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s really nice is that this toothbrush and my other Oral-B both accept the same replaceable brush heads which is great since they usually come in packs of more than one.    </li>
            <li> This is my first ever electric toothbrush, and I received it through the Amazon Vine program.</li>
            <li> They work so much better than regular tootbrushes.</li>
            <li> First, the exterior design.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is more for people who aren&#x27;t used to electric toothbrushes-</li>
            <li> As yet I cannot comment on the battery or related durability issues, as that may take a year or more of use to assess.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself a bunch of money and don&#x27;t buy the expensive alternatives with impressive sounding names.</li>
            <li> I had to return it because it stopped working the first day I got it.</li>
            <li> This is my first battery operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Even though  I purchased it for the first time</li>
            <li> ,I am very happy with this and will probably not look into the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Only hygienists with scrapey tools do a more thorough job.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally gonna buy two more of these for my mom and dad.</li>
            <li> guess I was spoiled by my first one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After I used it for like 2 months, my brother bought exact one</li>
            <li> (it was his first time using el. toothbrush as well).</li>
            <li> When in stand the toothbrush is top heavy and falls easily to the side  </li>
            <li> Particularly for the the back teeth, the spinning bristles do a far superior job of removing particles.</li>
            <li> It certainly feels better than regular ole toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush that came with the unit are soft which I prefer since I feel that soft bristles are better for your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> It costs a bit more, but the fact is, unlike most appliances, it&#x27;s one you&#x27;ll use at least once a day...in your mouth.</li>
            <li> To use this regularly, I&#x27;d probably recommend augmenting it with a manual toothbrush with a smaller head to get to those spots to ensure good dental and gum hygiene.    </li>
            <li> Thus, what would have been a POSITIVE 5 STARS</li>
            <li> -B electric brushes come in multiple types, or to be more precise, the brush heads come in several types.</li>
            <li> We received our Oral-B power toothbrush a few days after ordering and we have both been very pleased with our results.  </li>
            <li> As a first time user, I think the large brush head is a bit much.</li>
            <li> However, the brush head of this particular model is fairly large, which meant I wasn&#x27;t able to get to the gum line of the teeth in the back of my head</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t had this product very long, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> easy to setup and works like a charm, the charge does last for over a week</li>
            <li> Terrific brush, easy to use..</li>
            <li> rather large brush.</li>
            <li> They clean way better than a normal toothbrush--much less plaque build up.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have also mentioned, it would be helpful if there were an indicator light showing when the battery is full.  </li>
            <li> I liked the price and thought this great value, but unless you literally have a big mouth, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular power toothbrush - and if Oral-b offers a different model with a smaller brush head or has replacement heads that have a smaller brush, that might make all the difference in the world and offer a cost savings without compromising your dental health by not reaching all of your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> It feels like the rotating head is really getting into the gumline.    </li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner after I brush with this than when I brush with a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I like it so much that I&#x27;m going to order it again for my kids.</li>
            <li> Really cleans.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, compact, and the battery seems to hold its charge very well</li>
            <li> She says that her teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> Because it really does do the job, there&#x27;s a feeling of renewed vitality and freedom from guilt....</li>
            <li> cleans very well&lt;</li>
            <li> And it is reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> There are two oscillating brushes and there are different brush heads that will fit the handle.</li>
            <li> for the brushing, IT IS INTENSE.  </li>
            <li> it cleans teeth really well.</li>
            <li> Works very well- came as advertized.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the two minute timer.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been working really well for me.</li>
            <li> but was that package really</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner the whole day.</li>
            <li> But once I read reviews for el. toothbrush, it said that you will know you are applying more pressure than needed when you see the brush head become wide.</li>
            <li> Hahaha.</li>
            <li> Thanks Oral-B &amp; Braun.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I liked this toothbrush except for the fact that the head was too big to reach my back teeth.  </li>
            <li> While the outsides felt fine after brushing with the Oral-b, I was not left with the same clean sensation on the inside surfaces of my teeth as when using my Soniccare.    </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had such toothbrushes before, battery powered, and they ran through juice pretty quick.</li>
            <li> The brush also polishes to a smooth result on flat teeth</li>
            <li> The original version that takes 2 AAs is slightly smaller, and of course needs no charger, so I use one of those for travel.</li>
            <li> Other Oral B units at many times</li>
            <li> My teeth have nerve felt so clean on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> The fact that this thing has a rechargeable battery is both an economic and ecological advantage in the long run.  </li>
            <li> This is our third Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> is the first electric toothbrush I have used so far (have been using for 4 months now).</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure this will result in less cavities when I get my dental check-ups.</li>
            <li> brushes better with less space in your mouth (if that makes sense.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find an electric toothbrush does a more thorough job at cleaning my teeth, especially the back</li>
            <li> or maybe it was this particular seller that is unprofessional.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s better than a manual toothbrush, the head is too big to reach the back of the teeth, which he doesn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for an older one.  </li>
            <li> Dentist recommended this particular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I recently tried the Oral-b Dual Clean and found it to be a very old school design.  </li>
            <li> While this might sound like a good thing for some, the sheer size of the brushes made it difficult for me to reach certain areas of my mouth.      </li>
            <li> you are like me and concerned about your oral hygiene, I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how my old Oral B had slowed with age!!</li>
            <li> But after receiving the Oral B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable toothbrush from Vine, I&#x27;m back in the saddle again and quite surprised at the results.</li>
            <li> The battery charging system is very good and nothing dangerous.  </li>
            <li> The dual-action head certainly leaves a very clean-tasting mouth, and may assist in my tendency to apply too much pressure when I brushed manually, thus wearing enamel and causing sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> The original Oral-B electric head has a single spinning set of bristles (like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Something about the action of the brushes really does leave my mouth feeling cleaner and my teeth smoother than before.</li>
            <li> I find I normally get about 3 months use before needing to replace the brushing unit, which is the replacement time frame stated on the package.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is well worth the money and comes with several heads</li>
            <li> She loves it and every few days will comment \\&quot;I love my toothbrush\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> $6 brushes are now made for Walmart by yet a new unknown supplier and the quality has taken a huge downfall.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush, Light Green and White  </li>
            <li> Other points: as others have said, the grip is well designed and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Other points: as others have said, the grip is well designed and comfortable.</li>
            <li> with this new dual-head model.    </li>
            <li> a new one cause</li>
            <li> I just wanted a new one..</li>
            <li> AND WILL BUY A NEW, ONE WHEN THIS ONE DIES</li>
            <li> When I get my dental cleanings I can hardly tell the difference because the Oral B does such a good job brushing.  </li>
            <li> The brushing activity is easy enough - definitely a different feeling than a manual brush, but it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li> There is no way to tell how much battery life is left (or how much charging is needed to fill the battery.    </li>
            <li> I noticed with the old brush head that my teeth felt much cleaner than when brushing with a old fashioned toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I think Braun was very professional in handling the problem.   </li>
            <li> My more expensive model seems much more powerful (rightfully so) and also seems to have more \\&quot;rotation\\&quot; BUT DOES this less expensive model CLEAN TEETH and GUMS</li>
            <li> wow!  </li>
            <li> my gums were actually a bit sore for about a week after trying this at first.</li>
            <li> First the design; the entire brush is a sealed unit so that nothing, including the recharging area, is exposed to water.  </li>
            <li> My first last 5 years</li>
            <li> Funny enough, that one didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have had, the first lasted about 5 years.</li>
            <li> It was the exact same model.</li>
            <li> It is nice that they have designed different heads to address different issues related to plaque and gums, but if you can only reach the front region of your teeth with it, your dental health would seem to suffer.  </li>
            <li> as though at last you have brushed the way your mother (to say nothing of your dental hygienist) told you was the right way!</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a very long time - i took this on a 4 day vacation without recharging it and it worked for 2 brushings per day for the entire vacation just fine.</li>
            <li> A full charge takes roughly 16 hours to complete.      </li>
            <li> It seems to do an adequate job, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the timer alert that I expected.  </li>
            <li> (Just to test the resilience of the batteries, I found that I was able to brush with the unit twice daily for over a week without running down the charge.)    </li>
            <li> The movement of this power toothbrush was different from that of the sonic toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used - it was slower and less energetic.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B for many years now and my previous one (about 6 years old) finally conked out.  </li>
            <li> I am sold on Oral-b, and certainly will consider this brand when its time for my next automatic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on Oral-b; the only cons I see are the loud noise and the large brush heads.</li>
            <li> The Philips R732 is like a powerful little sports car, while this Oral-b is more like a heavy industrial vehicle.  </li>
            <li> And for people with smaller or sensitive mouths, this model may be a bit much.</li>
            <li> This brush has helped me keep my sensitive teeth much cleaner than I could with a regular brush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush cleans as well as the old toothbrush but doesn&#x27;t set off the buzzing, tickling sensation.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly surprised athow</li>
            <li> the old one still works.</li>
            <li> Having tried this brush, I&#x27;d recommend stepping up to the [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-b Professional Care Electric Toothbrush]].</li>
            <li> I replaced&lt;br /&gt;my old Vitality toothbrush heads</li>
            <li> I also have an Oral-B battery brush that works well and is loud but not quite as powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And with this thing, maybe they won&#x27;t have much work to do next time I visit them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to tease him that it sounds like a weed eater because it is so loud.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a dental health professional, so</li>
            <li> Keeping the kids busy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Oral-B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It works as well as my old model.</li>
            <li> So when my old one broke and I couldn&#x27;t find one at Walmart</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, the product is running great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t heard if they like it or not so far.</li>
            <li> But, it just died completely, after not even 2 years of owning it.</li>
            <li> Had one for years bought a replacement before they completely disappear .</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the extra $5 to $8 over the generic one.</li>
            <li> The dual brushes worked fine on the outsides of my teeth and seemed effective around the outside gum line, my relatively small mouth made it quite difficult for me to adequately brush all surfaces of the insides of my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a completely-sealed induction charging base (nice and safe).</li>
            <li> BUT just after I had it for a year, the major flaw erupted!!</li>
            <li> it turns on, it vibrates, it turns off - but the \\&quot;dual action\\&quot; of the rotating round brush and the vibrating straight brush left my teeth feeling just-back-from-the-dentist clean.  </li>
            <li> However, it is really loud and the brush head is large (it comes with two), making it tough to get on my back teeth where I need it the most.  </li>
            <li> I have a $100+ Oral B at home and, while I appreciate the bells and whistles, this much less expensive Oral-B does the same excellent job.</li>
            <li> My teeth are sensitive to harsh vibration, so it took a little practice to use this product effectively.</li>
            <li> The top component is a large, round bristle that oscillates back and forth and a lower triangular section that vibrates up and down.  </li>
            <li> The electric brush also allows you to focus more on each tooth and brush more carefully, whether from a change of long-established habits, or mere respect for power tools!  </li>
            <li> These new heads are even a step above that.  </li>
            <li> There are 5 different style cleaning heads that can be used with this rechargeable toothbrush and the package had a $3 off coupon for a new brush.</li>
            <li> But the dual head is just too big for my mouth, and the combination of the larger head with the intense power of the toothbrush feels too \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; for me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s rechargeable - which offers further savings over frequent replacements and/or battery replacements.  </li>
            <li> There is one major design flaw though.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to replace my 10+ year old Oral B rechargeable electric toothbrush (which still works, by the way!)</li>
            <li> The charge cycle may sound incredibly long, but once you realize that the toothbrush will be stored on the charger in between uses, the charge cycle seems to matter less.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this little toothbrush but was very surprised at its vigorous action.  </li>
            <li> The brushes seem to rotate very slowly (compared to the ultra high speed vibration of the Sonicare) and the entire head is too large to comfortably fit in my mouth, especially the back teeth.  </li>
            <li> It feels very solid in your hands and is clearly well constructed.  </li>
            <li> &quot; the head was too big for even an adult mouth.  </li>
            <li> She could barely get it in her mouth and could not maneuver it to reach her teeth with gagging.  </li>
            <li> This replaces my old one that wore out after several years.  </li>
            <li> but it barely held its charge for the 2 minute timer.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and buy some nice expensive electric toothbrush which will at least last for a good time.</li>
            <li> The fat, round one on the top oscillates while the slightly squared one on the bottom moves from side to side.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using it, both my wife and I have cleaner feeling teeth, less gum bleeding, and better breath.  </li>
            <li> new one does not hold a charge nearly as long.  </li>
            <li> bought it for husband and it has outlasted ever other electric tooth bus we have purchased at at reasonable price</li>
            <li> replacing the same kind that stopped working, even though they slow down from time to time...</li>
            <li> The power toothbrush felt clumsy in comparison, though I did feel the teeth it reached were clean afterward.    </li>
            <li> About 6 months ago I purchased the Oral-B Professional Care Deluxe Electric Toothbrush for about eighty bucks - far more than I&#x27;ve ever spent on a toothbrush but knew I could return it if it was awful.</li>
            <li> The main plus for this toothbrush is that it easily gets in all the places that are hard to reach with a conventional toothbrush, like in close next to the gum line and in between teeth.</li>
            <li> It replaced an old battery-operated brush that had only single cleaning action and used a lot of batteries.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted quite a few years</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is pretty ideally sized, and the base station has a small footprint.  </li>
            <li> Nearly the same price as I paid for the sonicare heads the other day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Paid less than I would have at any of the local stores where I live.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if one offers any advantage over the other, but I preferred the sensation or feeling of the sonic to the power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t determine how long the battery will last, as I&#x27;ve used it only for a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush because I have sensitive teeth and the vibration is not overwhelming fast like other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> especially if you keep it on your sink, and close to the toilet, sinceI read that every toilet flush makes microbes travel through bathroom...</li>
            <li> Since I have not yet used this model for 3 months, I can not claim that the brushing head that came with this rechargeable unit will last that long</li>
            <li> I am thinking about getting a new one though, since the power cord has turned a little off-white.  </li>
            <li> Granted, the Soniccare is more expensive than this Oral-b, but in my own situation the extra money spent at home will probably mean less work for my dental hygienist and hopefully less money spent on my dentist.</li>
            <li> While I have no complaints about its power, the fact that it utilizes two cleaning brushes gives it a much larger brushing surface than with the single brush found on my Soniccare.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m particularly fond of the round head with some small plastic sweepers mixed in with the brushes, [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]].</li>
            <li> The head consists of one upper and one lower brush which work independently of the other.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that the brushes are a little on the pricey side, but I&#x27;m hoping they last longer than my regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like that the charge lasts a long time, so</li>
            <li> As for the rechargeable handle, it is the basic handle with an on/off switch so not much to say about it.  </li>
            <li> and so I found it a bit harder to get to the back teeth.</li>
            <li> That said, I gag using a manual brush and have not used the product that long</li>
            <li> Long charge cycle for NiCad batteries  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an electric toothbrush, and have never really recognized the necessary utility of one.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time, probably 10 years.</li>
            <li> (But be careful, it only works 100-120 volts, so I bought converter as well</li>
            <li> The recharging base is also similarly sealed, a very safe design.  </li>
            <li> Not to be unfair, this toothbrush costs significantly less than many of the sonic toothbushes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t have firsthand experience with other moto-brushes, I can&#x27;t write a comparative review, but I CAN comment on this product&#x27;s effectiveness in comparison with regular brushes, and that comparison is altogether favorable.</li>
            <li> i have had other electric toothbrushes that were much quiet than this one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time to choose other alternative brands, and stop paying ORAL-B for same quality product at twice price!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve become accustomed to the other brush heads that are TWICE AS BIG as the Oral-B heads.</li>
            <li> Once I got used to it, however, I like it, though I alternate with a conventional Oral-b Cross-action</li>
            <li> This has lasted longer - 2+ years than a previous Philips SonicCare (that lasted a very disappointing 10 months) and the brush heads are fairly inexpensive (3 for $21).  </li>
            <li> The brush is also smaller and requires you to use less toothpaste, which will result in savings over time.</li>
            <li> It also sprays less toothpaste if I open my mouth while brushing or the bristle end comes out while I move the toothbrush around.</li>
            <li> It could be that my brush head is defective, I don&#x27;t know, but it definitely happens, and it never happened with any of my previous electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Bought it because previous purchase of same brand lasted 10 years without a fuss.</li>
            <li> toothbrushes are super expensive.</li>
            <li> Oh, and put it in your mouth first, or risk some dramatic toothpaste flingage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is likely due to the use of inexpensive NiCad batteries to keep down cost.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushing head on this unit seems a little larger than others I have used</li>
            <li> If you just have a regular toothbrush you&#x27;re missing out-</li>
            <li> I wondered if the rotating brush would be too harsh on my teeth, but the dentist recommend that I definitely use an electric brush.</li>
            <li> so I have trouble getting to my back teeth.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that I can replace it with the standard round brush head.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Came on time and was just as I expected</li>
            <li> brushes softer than expected but my gums are digging this machine</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say.</li>
            <li> What I mean is that the recharge station and linking area on the brush are all both entirely covered in plastic, so there are no \\&quot;vulnerable\\&quot; spots for bathroom water to reach to short things out or gum up the works.    </li>
            <li> I like the small footprint of the charger, and the extra head the package provides,</li>
            <li> It comes with two heads, and you can use both, or share the other one with someone else.</li>
            <li> The review merits the deduction of one star, due to head design.  </li>
            <li> The brushing head that came with this unit is a dual head and one brush spins around while the other oscillates.</li>
            <li> The footprint that was necessary on the counter was amazingly small.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it comes with warranty, and it it does I would definitely believe the seller should replace or refund.</li>
            <li> The other one lasted me 10 years.</li>
            <li> Other than the</li>
            <li> I bought this product for gift of my foreign friend and in description was not written that it is for 110V</li>
            <li> There is also no LED on the toothbrush or the charge stand that indicates that the toothbrush is actively charging.  </li>
            <li> sometimes annoying vibration comes from the second brush, which gives a back-and-forth action, in contrast to the rotating main head.</li>
            <li> Con: When fully charged, the circular/back-and-forth motion of the dual head brush can be slightly rough if you press to tightly to your mouth.    </li>
            <li> and i am very very disappointed about this when some magazine is selling some products they have to write full description in reviews!!!</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can think of, is that I wish the brushes were a bit softer though, as I prefer a softer bristle.</li>
            <li> I find I get about six weeks out of one on average, though dentists and the Oral-B people think you should replace a brush head once</li>
            <li> have taken this unit on a trip without the charger and found the the rechargeable batteries hold up well with twice a day use for about 5 days, so it is convenient to pack in a small plastic bag and take on a week long</li>

            <li> (I had thought it might be a toothbrush we could take on vacation, leaving the more expensive models home, but I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t care for it enough to do even that).      </li>
            <li> The brush itself is cordless, although the cord on the base station would be better served if it were retractable, for space management purposes.  </li>
            <li> (You can toss your old toothbrush at me now, I know that I can be irritating when I talk about</li>
            <li> The unit will brush for about two minutes, and then slows down a bit to indicate the brushing time is up, but the unit will keep operating until you turn it off.</li>
            <li> After 10 days of working fine...it just died, DIED, suddently and unexpectantly without any indication that battery is slowing down or the charging is not efficient anymore.</li>
            <li> the only issue I have is I received the item with just the round toothbrush head!!</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush thinking it might be a less expensive alternative to the more expensive sonic toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t used the high end expensive ones</li>
            <li> Overall buying this thing from Amazon was not a good experience.</li>
            <li> How could Oral-B and Braun hire such an incompetent brush engineer?</li>
            <li> just a little less than this rechargeable power toothbrush.)  </li>
            <li> As I live in Mexico it was too expensive to bother returning it.</li>
            <li> The moving bristle head has too much clearance between it and the rest of the brush, because it regularly, at least once a day, pinches the inside of my lips or cheeks, often to the point of breaking the skin, and at least once a week bad enough to make my spit turn completely red.    </li>
            <li> Never having used a power toothbrush before, it took a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> The unit is just a little heavy, but not bulky.  </li>
            <li> The reason I think is that with manual toothbrush I was too hard on pressure on my teeth, and within a week, my manual toothbrushes used to wear off (become &#x27;wide&#x27;), so it used to tore my gums I think a bit, thus a cranker sore.</li>
            <li> Replacement brush heads are not cheap.  </li>
            <li> Now, after 1.5 months, its totally dead.</li>
            <li> What a waste, I am using it as a manual toothbrush now, a bulky manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If they&#x27;re all like this one, I&#x27;ve been missing out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it seemed like the battery was dying after few days ...</li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral-B toothbrush for years now, but I was using the brush head that had the small, round head.  </li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and have trouble with gagging.</li>
            <li> If you have a small mouth or have trouble with gagging this product may not be for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another advantage for this one is that there are different types of heads for different uses, and they are considerably less expensive than the replacement heads for ultrasonic toothbrushes (which are almost as expensive as this brush is).</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first being that this was not that expensive, but it exceeded all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Also, and this is a small issue, if it knows to slow itself down after 2 minutes, why cant it turn itself off???&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not suitable for a window sill or a narrow sink.</li>
            <li> #34;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, but keep it up&amp;#34; as she found very little plaque on my teeth.</li>
            <li> yet the treatment isn&#x27;t harsh or abrasive in the least.    </li>
            <li> It has a small footprint, so doesn&#x27;t clutter up my counter space.  </li>
            <li> product arrived timely and was packed in a small cardboard box.</li>
            <li> The product comes with two brushes that are replaceable, the brusing unit, and a small electric powered charger unit.  </li>
            <li> I also find that I take longer brushing my teeth when I use an electric brush, I&#x27;m not sure why I do so</li>
            <li> The space between my cheek and gums/teeth is small</li>
            <li> The toothbrush does not come pre-charged and the instruction manual recommends a 16-hour charge cycle, which seems excessive.  </li>
            <li> No more changing batteries.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After approximately two and one-half minutes, the brush slows down and gives a couple of sluggish spurts, which signals time to stop brushing.</li>
            <li> Not too hard on the gums</li>
            <li> It gets every speck of plaque off of my teeth, even in the hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one as a spare because they are hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> w/ the hard outer plastic of the brush.</li>
            <li> No worries about being partway through a complex brushing maneuver when your two minutes are over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the Oral-b Vitality, as I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m not inclined to use it often enough to know</li>
            <li> at least this</li>
            <li> The charge lasted almost a week before slowly fading.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Serious, 1/2 the size</li>
            <li> The brush replacement heads are a little pricey, but when checking the price I found the brush replacements for this rechargeable model are not as expensive as the ones I buy for my electric toothbrush, so that is another plus for this model.brush</li>

            <li> I was surprised how compact is the base and power adapter for this brush.</li>
            <li> Wish I could get a new one, but they&#x27;re not currently offered:(  Looking at it, the base might just allow replacement.  </li>
            <li> I became so annoyed with it</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s not perfect...</li>
            <li> (sorry, dentists out there - I don&#x27;t know the names of those teeth).  </li>
            <li> The re-designed charger is awful; it is concave, so when you replace the toothbrush into this holder, it pools water and the toothbrush sits in that pool until you dry it with a tissue or towel.</li>
            <li> Downgraded one star because they, inexplicably (something about environment) tell you to unplug it after charging until it runs out of juice (2-3 days or so).  </li>
            <li> While it is an improvement over a manual toothbrush, I&#x27;m afraid this is a case of getting what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> whoever had them you know it&#x27;s painful and so uncomfortable to eat.</li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s virtually impossible to seat the toothbrush on the charger incorrectly</li>
            <li> My bad, time had elapsed so I did try to refund.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t do a bad job on the teeth it could reach</li>
            <li> I think el. toothbrush helped me not to have those painful sores so often.</li>
            <li> I do not know what the real expensive ones can do that this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those annoying people who brushes, flosses and gets a sticker from the hygienist when I have a cleaning twice a year.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy handle, compact base,</li>
            <li> You, like me will hate this product and return it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My teeth have nerve felt so clean on a daily basis! This toothbrush is reasonably priced.  It holds a charge about 3 days; wish it were longer.  Overall,  very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My wife has one. I should have bought one years ago.!</li>
            <li> I had an electric toothbrush for a couple of years and it broke. I loved it so much that I bought the same one!! If you just have a regular toothbrush you&#x27;re missing out- I would recommend you buying this one!!</li>
            <li> I did not realize how my old Oral B had slowed with age!!</li>
            <li> The Oral-b Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush is the economy model of the Oral-b electric toothbrushes.  The head consists of one upper and one lower brush which work independently of the other.  The fat, round one on the top oscillates while the slightly squared one on the bottom moves from side to side.  It comes with an additional brush head, and there are five different brush heads which can be purchased.  They are described in the instructions, and there is a $3 coupon included inside the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After approximately two and one-half minutes, the brush slows down and gives a couple of sluggish spurts, which signals time to stop brushing. It doesn&#x27;t stop by itself and has to be turned off. It is compact and fits well in smaller hands.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this little toothbrush but was very surprised at its vigorous action.  My teeth felt extremely clean and smooth after use.  I can&#x27;t determine how long the battery will last, as I&#x27;ve used it only for a couple of weeks.  I am sold on Oral-b, and certainly will consider this brand when its time for my next automatic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> About 6 months ago I purchased the Oral-B Professional Care Deluxe Electric Toothbrush for about eighty bucks - far more than I&#x27;ve ever spent on a toothbrush but knew I could return it if it was awful. It wasn&#x27;t. I loved it.    However, it was a bit pricey to warrant buying another for traveling or for my teenager. So, I thought this product would be a good middle ground. I&#x27;ve grown to trust Oral-B since splurging on my own.     There are definite differences. My more expensive model seems much more powerful (rightfully so) and also seems to have more \\&quot;rotation\\&quot; BUT DOES this less expensive model CLEAN TEETH and GUMS WELL? YES.    Bottom line I guess is does it get the job done. It works. It certainly feels better than regular ole toothbrushes. It feels like the rotating head is really getting into the gumline.    What&#x27;s really nice is that this toothbrush and my other Oral-B both accept the same replaceable brush heads which is great since they usually come in packs of more than one.    I recommend this product. If you&#x27;re using a traditional toothbrush now, you&#x27;ll likely notice a difference after using this toothbrush for a day or two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have no real experience with powered toothbrushes, but this one was a good acquisition for a first-timer.  There&#x27;s nothing fancy about it - it turns on, it vibrates, it turns off - but the \\&quot;dual action\\&quot; of the rotating round brush and the vibrating straight brush left my teeth feeling just-back-from-the-dentist clean.  I like the small footprint of the charger, and the extra head the package provides, giving you up to a total of six months of brushing.  Oral-B also encloses a coupon good for $3.00 off more replacement heads, if you&#x27;re so inclined, and I probably will be.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Great deal.....just what I needed and great service, it came in reasonable time and works good! I will buy more for the rest of my family when the need arises!</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised, and i am happy with this toothbrush. Not too hard on the gums (i had been worried about that). The battery lasts a very long time - i took this on a 4 day vacation without recharging it and it worked for 2 brushings per day for the entire vacation just fine.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush type was recommended for my sister. Got it at a great price with free shipping. Product performs as advertised. Paid less than I would have at any of the local stores where I live.</li>
            <li> Never having used a power toothbrush before, it took a little getting used to. Fortunately, this model has a built-in timer, which notifies you that it&#x27;s time to stop or you&#x27;ll overdo it. That is a very nice feature. The main plus for this toothbrush is that it easily gets in all the places that are hard to reach with a conventional toothbrush, like in close next to the gum line and in between teeth. After using the Oral-B for about two weeks, my teeth feel significantly cleaner, very much like just coming from the semi-annual dental check-up and cleaning. The brush is also smaller and requires you to use less toothpaste, which will result in savings over time. The only downside is that the brushes are a little on the pricey side, but I&#x27;m hoping they last longer than my regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me and concerned about your oral hygiene, I highly recommend this toothbrush. Not only does it do a great job at cleaning teeth, I&#x27;m sure this will result in less cavities when I get my dental check-ups.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner after I brush with this than when I brush with a manual toothbrush.  The spinning heads just seem to polish my teeth up more effectively than I can by hand...yet the treatment isn&#x27;t harsh or abrasive in the least.    The brushing activity is easy enough - definitely a different feeling than a manual brush, but it&#x27;s natural.  And it comes with a nifty two minute timer on it to let you know when you have brushed the recommended time.    The downsides?  1. Replacement brush heads are not cheap.  2. If two people want to use the brush and switch brush heads, there is not convenient way to store the brush head that you are not using (e.g. a peg on the charging stand to hold the second brush head.  3. There is no way to tell how much battery life is left (or how much charging is needed to fill the battery.    So, it&#x27;s not perfect...but it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush for many reasons.  It has a small footprint, so doesn&#x27;t clutter up my counter space.  I also like that the charge lasts a long time, so I can leave it uplugged for many days and I never run out of charge.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that you get a replacement brush with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;I love how fresh it makes my mouth feel! My teeth feel so clean and smooth. The only negative thing I can think of, is that I wish the brushes were a bit softer though, as I prefer a softer bristle.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever electric toothbrush, and I received it through the Amazon Vine program. It is rechargable, and the charge last well over a week. It comes with two heads, and you can use both, or share the other one with someone else. I wondered if the rotating brush would be too harsh on my teeth, but the dentist recommend that I definitely use an electric brush. They work so much better than regular tootbrushes.</li>
            <li> My point of comparison is a Sonicare Elite with all the bells and whistles. MSRP when I got it was around $180. The sonicare is thinner, has better features, is better looking, and brushes better with less space in your mouth (if that makes sense.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, this toothbrush does about 90% of what the sonicare does at close to 1/6th the price. Nearly the same price as I paid for the sonicare heads the other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a huge step up from manual and $10 grocery store electrics. It leaves my mouth feeling very clean. (Somehow not quite sonicare clean though) It seems like it will accumulate grunge/yellow in the future. Also I&#x27;ve not noticed any of the heads around town, so I will probably have to order those online, which is ok, but I like availability. Also, and this is a small issue, if it knows to slow itself down after 2 minutes, why cant it turn itself off???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you want an electic toothbrush on a budget, this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B electric brushes for about eight years, and regular Oral-B brushes for about twelve years before that. I got hooked because Oral-B brushes have precisely the right stiffness in the bristles to clean effectively without hurting the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having made the transition, I must say that going electric is a night-and-day difference in how well the teeth are cleaned. Particularly for the the back teeth, the spinning bristles do a far superior job of removing particles. The brush also polishes to a smooth result on flat teeth surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B electric brushes come in multiple types, or to be more precise, the brush heads come in several types. The heads with this brush are the dual clean version. The original Oral-B electric head has a single spinning set of bristles (like [[ASIN:B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head (4 ct.)]]), but the brush heads in this package also have a set of bristles beneath that go side-to-side (like [[ASIN:B0002KHU3I Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I can&#x27;t tell much difference in effectiveness between these heads and the original ones without the side-to-side action, but the new heads are fine with me. If you don&#x27;t like them, the original brush heads will fit too, and there are some additional varieties. I&#x27;m particularly fond of the round head with some small plastic sweepers mixed in with the brushes, [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]. They really do a great polishing job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads all have some type of indicator that shows when they need replacement. I find I get about six weeks out of one on average, though dentists and the Oral-B people think you should replace a brush head once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel on business, and I don&#x27;t take the rechargeable version on the road. The original version that takes 2 AAs is slightly smaller, and of course needs no charger, so I use one of those for travel. They share brush heads, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two minute timer is a nice addition, though to be candid, I find 90 seconds is plenty of brushing with this brush. Other points: as others have said, the grip is well designed and comfortable. If the rechargeable battery holds out, this will be a great replacement for my original Oral-B electric, which lasted eight years before biting the dust a few weeks ago..

            <li> I have been using an Oral-B toothbrush for years now, but I was using the brush head that had the small, round head.  This new brush head works much better.  I noticed with the old brush head that my teeth felt much cleaner than when brushing with a old fashioned toothbrush.  These new heads are even a step above that.  The only draw back is they are much larger and are quite a mouthful.  But they work well so it is worth the trade off.  As for the rechargeable handle, it is the basic handle with an on/off switch so not much to say about it.  It works well and the charge lasts a week or more.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a replacement just in case the one I have breaks.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased a second one if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product. I like it so much that I&#x27;m going to order it again for my kids.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t had this product very long, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it. It does an excellent job and is much easier to use than a standard toothbrush. It replaced an old battery-operated brush that had only single cleaning action and used a lot of batteries. Great product for people with arthritis because the brush does all the work. The fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable makes it much more economical. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how compact is the base and power adapter for this brush. It does not use a lot of space in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used this power toothbrush it felt somewhat large, but then quickly it felt comfortable. I have been using an ultrasonic toothbrush for some time now with great results so far. What i really liked about this one is that you feel the head much more on your teeth and you feel the movement, so you end up with a feeling of having really clean mouth which I like much more than the ultrasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another advantage for this one is that there are different types of heads for different uses, and they are considerably less expensive than the replacement heads for ultrasonic toothbrushes (which are almost as expensive as this brush is). I have been using my power brush for about two months, alternating with the ultrasonic, and it has worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a pretty good power brush. For the price, this is an unbeatable value.</li>
            <li> I am using this brush since 2007 !!! I am impressed !! Its still working , I am just changing a head , that it  ! Best brush ever !!!</li>
            <li> Well, I purchased this product after the good reviews I read here. At first it worked great and I was happy with the my new toothbrush. After about 1 month, it started losing battery charge. If I don&#x27;t charge at night, the brush wont work the next morning. Now, after 1.5 months, its totally dead. It wont hold charge for even brushing once. The max it will run is 1 minute. What a waste, I am using it as a manual toothbrush now, a bulky manual toothbrush. Don&#x27;t waste your money and buy some nice expensive electric toothbrush which will at least last for a good time.</li>
            <li> wow!  I love the dual tooth brush action. Really cleans.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B is a cost-effective and suitable replacement for a manual toothbrush, and is a good bet for anyone looking to get a cheap automatic toothbrush.    First, the exterior design.  The toothbrush is pretty ideally sized, and the base station has a small footprint.  The brush itself is cordless, although the cord on the base station would be better served if it were retractable, for space management purposes.  Oral-B claims that the rechargeable battery cannot be \\&quot;killed\\&quot; by repeated charging, so hopefully that works as advertised.  The package also comes with one replacement head, which is a value-added touch.  As other reviewers have also mentioned, it would be helpful if there were an indicator light showing when the battery is full.  A full charge takes roughly 16 hours to complete.      Second, effectiveness.  It&#x27;s equipped with a 2 minute timer, which indicates the suggested total brushing length.  This is a thoughtful feature, but might be more helpful for children than for adults.  My teeth definitely feel cleaner after usage, although not quite on par with visiting a dentist&#x27;s office.  The brush has an overall shape that is pretty comfortable for gripping.    The review merits the deduction of one star, due to head design.  If the head were skinnier and angled, then it could enable better access to teeth in the rear of my mouth. Overall, a very good, entry-level toothbrush from Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Amazon Vines review of the Oral-B Vitality Rechargeable Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived timely and was packed in a small cardboard box. The product comes with two brushes that are replaceable, the brusing unit, and a small electric powered charger unit.  The brushing unit is waterproof so no worry about getting water or moisture on it. There are 5 different style cleaning heads that can be used with this rechargeable toothbrush and the package had a $3 off coupon for a new brush. The unit uses a rechargeable battery, which the company claims can not be over charged, so you can store the brushing unit on the electric charger unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used both a Phillips and Oral-B electric toothbrush and find that this rechargeable model does a comparable job in the cleaning of my teeth. I find an electric toothbrush does a more thorough job at cleaning my teeth, especially the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushing head on this unit seems a little larger than others I have used and so I found it a bit harder to get to the back teeth. The bristles on the brush that came with the unit are soft which I prefer since I feel that soft bristles are better for your teeth and gums. The unit will brush for about two minutes, and then slows down a bit to indicate the brushing time is up, but the unit will keep operating until you turn it off. The brushing head that came with this unit is a dual head and one brush spins around while the other oscillates. It does seem to do a good job of cleaning and polishing the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushing bristles give an indication by fading in color to show when it should be replaced. I find I normally get about 3 months use before needing to replace the brushing unit, which is the replacement time frame stated on the package. Since I have not yet used this model for 3 months, I can not claim that the brushing head that came with this rechargeable unit will last that long but it looks very similar to the brushing head I have used on my Oral-B electric toothbrush and so I assume it will last for about 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have taken this unit on a trip without the charger and found the the rechargeable batteries hold up well with twice a day use for about 5 days, so it is convenient to pack in a small plastic bag and take on a week long trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush seems to be well made, does a good job at cleaning my teeth, and is easy and convenient to use. The brush replacement heads are a little pricey, but when checking the price I found the brush replacements for this rechargeable model are not as expensive as the ones I buy for my electric toothbrush, so that is another plus for this model.brush and so I assume it will last for about 3 months.    I have taken this unit on a trip without the charger and found the the rechargeable batteries hold up well with twice a day use for about 5 days, so it is convenient to pack in a small plastic bag and take on a week long trip.    All in all, this inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush seems to be well made, does a good job at cleaning my teeth, and is easy and convenient to use. The brush replacement heads are a little pricey, but when checking the price I found the brush replacements for this rechargeable model are not as expensive as the ones I buy for my electric toothbrush, so that is another plus for this model.</li>
            <li> I used to have an Oral-B sonic toothbrush that cleaned well but irritated my teeth. This toothbrush cleans as well as the old toothbrush but doesn&#x27;t set off the buzzing, tickling sensation. It also sprays less toothpaste if I open my mouth while brushing or the bristle end comes out while I move the toothbrush around. Fewer toothpaste specks on my clothes make me a happy camper!</li>
            <li> First, the good.    This does seem to get my teeth cleaner.    I also think the rechargability is a plus, I&#x27;ve had such toothbrushes before, battery powered, and they ran through juice pretty quick. Additionally I find their recharge mechanism ingenious, there are no connectors, near as I can tell, it must use a magetic field. What I mean is that the recharge station and linking area on the brush are all both entirely covered in plastic, so there are no \\&quot;vulnerable\\&quot; spots for bathroom water to reach to short things out or gum up the works.    I also find that I take longer brushing my teeth when I use an electric brush, I&#x27;m not sure why I do so, I just do so, so that must also help get them clean.    There is one major design flaw though. The moving bristle head has too much clearance between it and the rest of the brush, because it regularly, at least once a day, pinches the inside of my lips or cheeks, often to the point of breaking the skin, and at least once a week bad enough to make my spit turn completely red.    It could be that my brush head is defective, I don&#x27;t know, but it definitely happens, and it never happened with any of my previous electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used an electic toothbrush before and wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d feel about it. I&#x27;m happy I tried this! I feel like my teeth are a lot cleaner (although I&#x27;m not a dentist so I can&#x27;t be sure.)    This was easy to figure out and easy to use. It&#x27;s comfortable once you get used to it.    The only downside is more for people who aren&#x27;t used to electric toothbrushes- my gums were actually a bit sore for about a week after trying this at first. I just wasn&#x27;t used to how the brush affects the gums and it did get better.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and have trouble with gagging. The space between my cheek and gums/teeth is small so I have trouble getting to my back teeth. If the brush end was smaller it would be great. If you have a small mouth or have trouble with gagging this product may not be for you. That said, I gag using a manual brush and have not used the product that long so I may need to get a lesson or two from my dentist. I still use the product for my front teeth and it works well for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used a Soniccare Elite toothbrush for several years after receiving a recommendation from a dental hygienist and have been quite happy with it.  I decided to give this Oral-b Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush a try.    While I have no complaints about its power, the fact that it utilizes two cleaning brushes gives it a much larger brushing surface than with the single brush found on my Soniccare.  While this might sound like a good thing for some, the sheer size of the brushes made it difficult for me to reach certain areas of my mouth.      The dual brushes worked fine on the outsides of my teeth and seemed effective around the outside gum line, my relatively small mouth made it quite difficult for me to adequately brush all surfaces of the insides of my teeth and gums.  I always believe that a toothbrush has done a good job when it leaves me with a smooth, fresh feeling on both the outsides and the insides of my teeth.  While the outsides felt fine after brushing with the Oral-b, I was not left with the same clean sensation on the inside surfaces of my teeth as when using my Soniccare.    Granted, the Soniccare is more expensive than this Oral-b, but in my own situation the extra money spent at home will probably mean less work for my dental hygienist and hopefully less money spent on my dentist.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B for many years now and my previous one (about 6 years old) finally conked out.  Their brush pattern (oscillation) is an excellent one for cleaning with minimal abrasion.    This replacement is all you need for an excellent brush!  Other Oral B units at many times this cost do NOT brush better, they just have features and I don&#x27;t believe are necessary.  Downgraded one star because they, inexplicably (something about environment) tell you to unplug it after charging until it runs out of juice (2-3 days or so).  I think this recommendation may be so that the recharging can be fully done from a discharged unit which allows the unit to be FULLY recharged.  I am following their directions.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to replace my 10+ year old Oral B rechargeable electric toothbrush (which still works, by the way!) with this new dual-head model.    It works well... gets my teeth clean. But the dual head is just too big for my mouth, and the combination of the larger head with the intense power of the toothbrush feels too \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; for me. I plan to replace the dual head with a standard smaller head and see how that goes. However, this review is of the product as sold. And for people with smaller or sensitive mouths, this model may be a bit much.</li>
            <li> Having used a manual toothbrush for several decades, I thought it time to try something different.  I&#x27;ve also been using Oral-B for almost as long, so their electric brush was a good fit for me.  First the design; the entire brush is a sealed unit so that nothing, including the recharging area, is exposed to water.  The recharging base is also similarly sealed, a very safe design.  As yet I cannot comment on the battery or related durability issues, as that may take a year or more of use to assess.  The dual-action head certainly leaves a very clean-tasting mouth, and may assist in my tendency to apply too much pressure when I brushed manually, thus wearing enamel and causing sensitivity.  The electric brush also allows you to focus more on each tooth and brush more carefully, whether from a change of long-established habits, or mere respect for power tools!  My gums also feel massaged by the vibratory scrubbing they receive, hence that just-went-to-the-dentist feeling without the paperwork, wait, or cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those annoying people who brushes, flosses and gets a sticker from the hygienist when I have a cleaning twice a year.  I&#x27;m very, very fussy about how clean my teeth feel after I brush, and until now, I hadn&#x27;t found a powered toothbrush that satisfied me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush works amazingly well.  It gets every speck of plaque off of my teeth, even in the hard to reach areas.  Unlike an old powered toothbrush I once had, it doesn&#x27;t require a special toothpaste, and can use your favorite kind.  Best of all, it has a two minute timer that lets you know when you have brushed your teeth for the optimum time.  I&#x27;m now confident that I brush my teeth for plenty of time. (You can toss your old toothbrush at me now, I know that I can be irritating when I talk about oral hygiene.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush comes with a sealed plastic charger, which will charge the brush overnight.  A full charge will give you a week&#x27;s worth of brushing. (14 x 2 minutes) This allows you to store the charger for most of a week.  You can also store the brush on the charger, but this isn&#x27;t the most ecological way of charging the brush.  It also comes with one refill, and additional refills are available here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Pros:   Excellent dental cleaning  Solid construction  Rubberized, easy grip handle  Rechargeable batteries  Built in timer  Choice of replacement brush heads  Relatively inexpensive replacement brush heads    Cons:  Charge stand not wall mountable  When in stand the toothbrush is top heavy and falls easily to the side  Long charge cycle for NiCad batteries  No LED to indicate charge status on toothbrush or stand    For a variety of reasons, I haven&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush in some time.  But after receiving the Oral B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable toothbrush from Vine, I&#x27;m back in the saddle again and quite surprised at the results. This toothbrush simply does a much better job than a manual toothbrush and really gives you that fresh-from-the-dentist clean feeling.    Inside the box you will find the toothbrush itself, a charge stand, 2 brush heads (one attached to the toothbrush and a replacement head), and a set of instructions.      The toothbrush does not come pre-charged and the instruction manual recommends a 16-hour charge cycle, which seems excessive.  This is likely due to the use of inexpensive NiCad batteries to keep down cost.  The charge cycle may sound incredibly long, but once you realize that the toothbrush will be stored on the charger in between uses, the charge cycle seems to matter less.  The fact that this thing has a rechargeable battery is both an economic and ecological advantage in the long run.  (Just to test the resilience of the batteries, I found that I was able to brush with the unit twice daily for over a week without running down the charge.)    The unit itself has a relatively ergonomic, rubberized grip.  The unit is just a little heavy, but not bulky.  It feels very solid in your hands and is clearly well constructed.  The supplied brush head has two components.  The top component is a large, round bristle that oscillates back and forth and a lower triangular section that vibrates up and down.  I was incredibly surprised athow well this set up worked.  With minimal amounts of pressure, I got a surprisingly good dental cleaning--that smooth and squeaky clean feeling that I only seem to get after my teeth are cleaned at the dentist. As a bonus, the toothbrush has a built-in timer--it vibrates on and off--to alert you that you have been brushing for the &#x60;recommended&#x27; two minutes.    Another nice feature is that the cost of the replacement heads is not prohibitive and that there are a variety of options available.  You can price the Dual Clean replacement head here [[[ASIN:B0002KHU3I Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]]] and the &#x60;high line&#x27; Pro-White replacement head here [[[ASIN:B0002KHTG6 Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]]].  As of this writing, the prices seemed more than reasonable.    On the downside, the charger supplied with this unit is not wall mountable.  Moreover, it is very light weight in comparison to the toothbrush.  This means that when the toothbrush is seated in the charger, the whole thing is a little top heavy and easily falls over--not the best of designs. This is not suitable for a window sill or a narrow sink. You really need to place it on a counter top. (There is no plug-in option if you find that the toothbrush is not charged and still want to use it.  I don&#x27;t see this as a disadvantage--this is probably more of a safety feature.)  There is also no LED on the toothbrush or the charge stand that indicates that the toothbrush is actively charging.  Granted, it&#x27;s virtually impossible to seat the toothbrush on the charger incorrectly and this is on the low end of the Oral B rechargeable line.  Even so, it is helpful to have some indication that the contact has been made and that the toothbrush is actually charging.    All in all, this is a worthy product and one that I can easily recommend.  It is more economical than buying a cheaper, non-rechargeable model and works better than those bargain-basement throwaway electric toothbrushes that you can buy at a department or drug store.</li>
            <li> easy to setup and works like a charm, the charge does last for over a week so that is nice.</li>
            <li> Save yourself a bunch of money and don&#x27;t buy the expensive alternatives with impressive sounding names. This is all you need and its cheap!!! My first last 5 years and I just bought a new one cause I just wanted a new one..the old one still works.</li>
            <li> Wow-a decent rechargeable toothbrush for this price is pretty amazing, I think.  When there are brushes out there on the market from $50-$180, this is bang for the buck.  It&#x27;s lightweight, can be stored on the charger (the brush can&#x27;t be overcharged), the charge lasts for awhile (I&#x27;d say about a week) and there is a timer on it too.  That feature is really important since I def. don&#x27;t brush the full couple of minutes without it.  It came with an extra brush head too, a nice bonus.  I have a Sonicare, which I like a lot and think is a more powerful cleaner but it&#x27;s more expensive. I think this brush is great for everyday use, but I will esp. be using it for travel since it&#x27;s lightweight and smaller than my bulky Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I liked this toothbrush except for the fact that the head was too big to reach my back teeth.  The design of the handle was well thought out and easy to charge and use.  The footprint that was necessary on the counter was amazingly small.  BUT, and it is a big \\&quot;but\\&quot; the head was too big for even an adult mouth.  I am a grown person and asked my daughter to try it.  She could barely get it in her mouth and could not maneuver it to reach her teeth with gagging.  They need to try and overcome the space needed to make the mechanicals of a swirling AND a scrubbing head able to occupy the space at the end of the brush that is supposed to fit in your mouth.  It is nice that they have designed different heads to address different issues related to plaque and gums, but if you can only reach the front region of your teeth with it, your dental health would seem to suffer.  If they could downsize the head a bit, it would be a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> After 10 days of working fine...it just died, DIED, suddently and unexpectantly without any indication that battery is slowing down or the charging is not efficient anymore. Not sure if it comes with warranty, and it it does I would definitely believe the seller should replace or refund.</li>
            <li> This is my second one. The first one lasted quite a few years and I went through many replaceable heads. It does a very good job and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> We received our Oral-B power toothbrush a few days after ordering and we have both been very pleased with our results.  After a few weeks of using it, both my wife and I have cleaner feeling teeth, less gum bleeding, and better breath.  This toothbrush is well worth the money and comes with several heads so you can share with a partner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an electric toothbrush, and have never really recognized the necessary utility of one. The Oral-b Vitality seemed like a fine foray into the fantastic realm of moto-brushes, since it seems to provide all the features I&#x27;d find reasonably necessary in a toothbrush, it comes from a &#x27;recognized name&#x27; in oral hygiene (for whatever that&#x27;s worth), and it&#x27;s more reasonably priced than some moto-brushes, which hover at around the $100 mark (or higher!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t have firsthand experience with other moto-brushes, I can&#x27;t write a comparative review, but I CAN comment on this product&#x27;s effectiveness in comparison with regular brushes, and that comparison is altogether favorable. Something about the action of the brushes really does leave my mouth feeling cleaner and my teeth smoother than before. This model features a two-minute timer, which is helpful. It&#x27;s sturdy, compact, and the battery seems to hold its charge very well (I use it twice a day, and only need to charge it about once every eight days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-b manufactures a variety of different heads for the Vitality line, and though I&#x27;ve not tested the different varieties to see if they have markedly different results, I like the fact that the product is so well-supported; it means I probably won&#x27;t soon find myself owning an obsolete brush for which I can&#x27;t get replacement heads. The heads are sturdy, too, lasting me about three weeks or a month each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this is an effective product that does what it needs to do, doesn&#x27;t do things I don&#x27;t need it to, doesn&#x27;t cost a lot of money, and has good manufacturer support. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Stopped working after two uses. I will be sending it back. I&#x27;ve purchased many things from Amazon and this is the first product that I ever had aproblem with.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is good, two motion functions leave a very clean feeling teeth. Used with a good mouthwash is a perfect complemementom. The battery charging system is very good and nothing dangerous.  Regards</li>
            <li> I liked this toothbrush. It is very good.  I had to return it because it stopped working the first day I got it. I ordered a replacement and it worked well for 2-3 weeks and then stopped working, so I had to return it too. I will still buy an electric toothbrush from Braun bacause I had a lot of good recommendations from my friends. But I may try a different model or a different merchant.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried a number of electric toothbrushes, with mixed results. For me, the best are gentle in movement, with a soft brush. My teeth are sensitive to harsh vibration, so it took a little practice to use this product effectively. Once I got used to it, however, I like it, though I alternate with a conventional Oral-b Cross-action brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sometimes annoying vibration comes from the second brush, which gives a back-and-forth action, in contrast to the rotating main head. Having tried this brush, I&#x27;d recommend stepping up to the [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-b Professional Care Electric Toothbrush]]. It costs a bit more, but the fact is, unlike most appliances, it&#x27;s one you&#x27;ll use at least once a day...in your mouth. I think it would be wise to spring for the better product. Nonetheless, this one is certainly better than most of the electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is my first battery operated toothbrush. I was a little skeptical at first being that this was not that expensive, but it exceeded all my expectations. I would recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> my teeth seem be clean.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is excellent for cleaning and the timer is a great feature.  Especially for the price.  The additional head is a great added feature.</li>
            <li> great valve at a good price!</li>
            <li> This is a very fine toothbrush. Cleans perfectly, with little or no effort, and is very comfortable to use.  I have had one for 4 years, and have purchased this for my daughter...the only issue I have is I received the item with just the round toothbrush head!! and I ordered it specifically for the DUAL HEAD!  Thus, what would have been a POSITIVE 5 STARS is only being given a 3 star rating!  HOPEFULLY, I will receive the DUAL-HEAD ORAL-B ELEC.Toothbrush with a Simple Phone Call to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought. The other one lasted me 10 years.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 4 weeks ago from Amazon. It was faulty and more specifically after the first two minutes of operation, it just stopped working. It would not recharge, It would not work again.  So I returned it and Amazon sent me another one. Funny enough, that one didn&#x27;t work as well. On top it when I tried charging it it burned so much you could almost get a hand burn if you touched it.   I immediately called the company (Braun) and talked with the representative one the problem. Fortunately this time, they sent me a toothbrush that worked and still works up to this day (2 weeks time) and looked into the faulty one. I think Braun was very professional in handling the problem.   Overall buying this thing from Amazon was not a good experience. I have no idea why all the crappy toothbrushes ended up getting sold through Amazon or maybe it was this particular seller that is unprofessional. I would recommend buying it online from Braun themselves.</li>
            <li> Terrific brush, easy to use..</li>
            <li> This was a requested gift for my wife. She loves it and every few days will comment \\&quot;I love my toothbrush\\&quot;. She says that her teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Happy to have this product again Makes my teeth feel dental office clean</li>
            <li> This Oral-B is a real bargain. I have a $100+ Oral B at home and, while I appreciate the bells and whistles, this much less expensive Oral-B does the same excellent job.This one is my travel brush. It is light in your hand, configured to how you hold a brush,packable, and easy to keep clean. Because it really does do the job, there&#x27;s a feeling of renewed vitality and freedom from guilt....as though at last you have brushed the way your mother (to say nothing of your dental hygienist) told you was the right way!</li>
            <li> After 6mos. I opened the package and the Electric Toothbrush didn&#x27;t recharge.&lt;br /&gt;I threw it in the trash. My bad, time had elapsed so I did try to refund. I replaced&lt;br /&gt;my old Vitality toothbrush heads and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Power Toothbrush, Light Green and White  I returned this product because my dentist did not want me to use it. She said it was much too harsh for my gums and recommended Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Very nice . Even though  I purchased it for the first time and I haven&#x27;t used the high end expensive ones ,I am very happy with this and will probably not look into the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Good .. but its noisy ... i have had other electric toothbrushes that were much quiet than this one</li>
            <li> Great brush. Would recomend it.</li>
            <li> This has exceeded our expectation.  I would recommend to anyone that does not want to spend a fortune on a electric tooth brush. We have always used oral b toothbrushes and decided to try a oral b battery operated model it worked great.  So we decided why not get an electric oral b, we found this model and very very happy with it. We&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these toothbrushes.  Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> Sturdy handle, compact base, rather large brush. I am hoping that I can replace it with the standard round brush head.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter. I have used a rechargeable Oral B toothbrush for many years but there were so many bad reviews on this one that I bought 2 - One to make sure it was okay before giving it to her.  I like it. I had no problem with it. I also wrote a tongue-in-cheek answer to some of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;An example of one of the &#x27;problems&#x27; a person had: If you take it out of your mouth it slings tooth paste up to 4 feet away, makes a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;My answer - It is electronic!  You have to turn it off before taking it out of your mouth.  If you take it out of your mouth while it is vibrating toothpaste will fly!&lt;br /&gt;I also bought her the smaller brush head. As a first time user, I think the large brush head is a bit much.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> 1. easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;2. cleans very well&lt;br /&gt;3. battery last for about 4 or 3 days, and I use the brush for 2 minutes 3 times a day</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush because I have sensitive teeth and the vibration is not overwhelming fast like other electric toothbrushes. I&#x27;ve been using electric toothbrushes for over 15 years and this one is by far my favorite. And it is reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase! Thisis a replacement for one I had vor many years and It ijust as good as that one, or better.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time, probably 10 years. It never disappoints and gets teeth very clean. It lasts 2-3 years.</li>
            <li> This electric brush does a great job of cleaning.  However, it is really loud and the brush head is large (it comes with two), making it tough to get on my back teeth where I need it the most.  After brushing I can feel my teeth are cleaner and some of the plaque that had been there is gone,  which is awesome! After using it for a couple weeks some of the bristles are pulling out when I brush and getting caught in my teeth.  There are two oscillating brushes and there are different brush heads that will fit the handle. The charge lasts many days.  It&#x27;s a very good looking design with a two tone color on the entire handle.  I also have an Oral-B battery brush that works well and is loud but not quite as powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on Oral-b; the only cons I see are the loud noise and the large brush heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush before. If they&#x27;re all like this one, I&#x27;ve been missing out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very straightforward. There&#x27;s a completely-sealed induction charging base (nice and safe). There are two removable heads. And, a button. Put some toothpaste on and press the button. Oh, and put it in your mouth first, or risk some dramatic toothpaste flingage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush will operate for two minutes, \\&quot;stutter\\&quot; a bit to let you know the time is up, and then keep operating until you turn it off. No worries about being partway through a complex brushing maneuver when your two minutes are over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the brushing, IT IS INTENSE.  Seriously, my whole head vibrates, and my teeth are super clean. Only hygienists with scrapey tools do a more thorough job. And with this thing, maybe they won&#x27;t have much work to do next time I visit them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should use one of these.</li>
            <li> My husband gave this toothbrush a try after years of using a Phillips Sonicare.  While it&#x27;s better than a manual toothbrush, the head is too big to reach the back of the teeth, which he doesn&#x27;t like.  I like to tease him that it sounds like a weed eater because it is so loud.  Still, it has the timer and cleans better than a manual toothbrush does.  For that, it gets four stars.</li>
            <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for several years.  It took some getting used to but after I did I felt it was doing a good job. I recently tried the Oral-b Dual Clean and found it to be a very old school design.  The brushes seem to rotate very slowly (compared to the ultra high speed vibration of the Sonicare) and the entire head is too large to comfortably fit in my mouth, especially the back teeth.  If I only had the choice between this and a manual toothbrush I would choose the manual brush.  I&#x27;m sure it does an okay job and if it is your first electric toothbrush you could get used to it, but to anyone shopping I would suggest looking closely at the part that goes into your mouth and decide if it looks like a comfortable fit.  I also suggest considering sonic brushes that do not have rotating parts, I think after you get used to them they leave your mouth feeling cleaner.</li>
            <li> I had this product 3 days and never used it. It was never used because it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. Try as I may, nothing. I became so annoyed with it I tossed it in the garbage, as you will too If you don&#x27;t read this comment. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> it cleans teeth really well.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush thinking it might be a less expensive alternative to the more expensive sonic toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve been using.  While it is an improvement over a manual toothbrush, I&#x27;m afraid this is a case of getting what you pay for.  The toothbrush does do a better job than a manual toothbrush.  However, the brush head of this particular model is fairly large, which meant I wasn&#x27;t able to get to the gum line of the teeth in the back of my head (sorry, dentists out there - I don&#x27;t know the names of those teeth).  To use this regularly, I&#x27;d probably recommend augmenting it with a manual toothbrush with a smaller head to get to those spots to ensure good dental and gum hygiene.    It may not be fair to compare a power toothbrush to a sonic toothbrush, but I feel I must for those who are weighing the merits of each to make a decision whether the power toothbrush might do the job of a sonic without the investment.  The movement of this power toothbrush was different from that of the sonic toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used - it was slower and less energetic.  I&#x27;m not a dental health professional, so I don&#x27;t know if one offers any advantage over the other, but I preferred the sensation or feeling of the sonic to the power toothbrush.  The power toothbrush felt clumsy in comparison, though I did feel the teeth it reached were clean afterward.    Not to be unfair, this toothbrush costs significantly less than many of the sonic toothbushes and it didn&#x27;t do a bad job on the teeth it could reach and it&#x27;s rechargeable - which offers further savings over frequent replacements and/or battery replacements.  I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the Oral-b Vitality, as I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m not inclined to use it often enough to know (I had thought it might be a toothbrush we could take on vacation, leaving the more expensive models home, but I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t care for it enough to do even that).      If you&#x27;re willing and able to invest a little more on a toothbrush that I&#x27;ve been very pleased with, I recommend the Philips SonicCare R732 Health White toothbrush.  This has lasted longer - 2+ years than a previous Philips SonicCare (that lasted a very disappointing 10 months) and the brush heads are fairly inexpensive (3 for $21).  (I had a great sonic toothbrush from the now defunct Ultreo and those heads were $24 apiece - just a little less than this rechargeable power toothbrush.)  The Philips R732 is like a powerful little sports car, while this Oral-b is more like a heavy industrial vehicle.  I liked the price and thought this great value, but unless you literally have a big mouth, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular power toothbrush - and if Oral-b offers a different model with a smaller brush head or has replacement heads that have a smaller brush, that might make all the difference in the world and offer a cost savings without compromising your dental health by not reaching all of your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for an older one.  The re-designed charger is awful; it is concave, so when you replace the toothbrush into this holder, it pools water and the toothbrush sits in that pool until you dry it with a tissue or towel.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. I bought this one as a spare because they are hard to find in stores. I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd one I have owned. The last one last 5 years.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric toothbrush around 6 months ago. I love its performance. its battery is good I charge it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this purchase and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works very well- came as advertized.  Teeth never felt cleaner! Dentist recommended this particular toothbrush.  It is probably the best value electric tooth brush.  I have had it a month and have not had to change the brush head yet either.  I also really like the two minute timer.  It automatically vibrates 2-3 times to let you know times up but it will then keep going in case you want more time.  Overall, excellent brush- highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This works much better than my now-defunct non-rechargeable battery operated toothbrush.     Pro: Timer works great and is obvious enough even when I&#x27;m not 100% awake.    Con: When fully charged, the circular/back-and-forth motion of the dual head brush can be slightly rough if you press to tightly to your mouth.    Other than the \\&quot;Con\\&quot;, this is a really good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have tried other electric toothbrushes but always go back to Braun, they are the best, their battery lasts the longest. They are the best for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item before couple of times. Last time I purchased it in 2010, ordered 2 each at $15.57, and now it&#x27;s $29.99! It&#x27;s time to choose other alternative brands, and stop paying ORAL-B for same quality product at twice price!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for another oral B vitality Dual  that stopped working after several years. We all have one and use them daily. It cleans my mouth well and I love the massaging motion for my gums. Would highly recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> Discharges very fast. Not recommended</li>
            <li> This only worked for about three weeks before it quit.  As I live in Mexico it was too expensive to bother returning it.</li>
            <li> Very good toothbrush for the price, and has made my mouth a lot cleaner since I began brushing with it.</li>
            <li> Works great. This is the second one I have had, the first lasted about 5 years. I also like the fact that you can use 3 or 4 different kind of Oral B brushes on this unit.</li>
            <li> These electric toothbrushes are great!  Super fast ship!</li>
            <li> Works great for cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> Clean teeth, fresh breath &#x3D; better chances with the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lol all jokes aside, My dentist told me to buy this toothbrush. I bought it like 4 months ago and it&#x27;s been working really well for me.</li>
            <li> A good toothbrush for the price.  This is my first electric toothbrush so I have no experience to compare it against but I do use a good deal of pressure when brushing my teeth and this brush had no problem with it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush worked great for about 3-4 weeks ( twice a day use)  it seemed like the battery was dying after few days ...as the motor speed seemed low.  then it just died one day .battery wouldn&#x27;t charge  I have asked for a refund.. should get one shortl</li>
            <li> I used to use a very exspencive powered toothbrush but when that bit the dust I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend that kind of cash again. This is such a great alternative! Order the proper replacement heads though. Don&#x27;t skimp there!</li>
            <li> Came on time and was just as I expected</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really worth for the price&lt;br /&gt;i used these before&lt;br /&gt;tell them to make the adapter universal&lt;br /&gt;because i&#x27;m using these all over the world&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m traveling a lot</li>
            <li> Soft and white, clean and bright, you look happy to meet me. Keeping the kids busy with this purchase. Life is good.</li>
            <li> Received it today, so far so good but was that package really necessary?&lt;br /&gt;It brushes softer than expected but my gums are digging this machine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a little bit more then a week and a half more than happy with every dollar spend on this. My teeth feel cleaner the whole day. My breathe feels fresher in the morning. I&#x27;m totally gonna buy two more of these for my mom and dad.</li>
            <li> was as advertised no prob.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by our local VA Hospital&#x27;s dental department, as part of my husband&#x27;s dental treatment plan for oral cancer.  Does a nice cleaning job.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Oral-B toothbrush. I am very happy with this purchase. It works as well as my old model.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for gift of my foreign friend and in description was not written that it is for 110V so it means that he can not use it and i am very very disappointed about this when some magazine is selling some products they have to write full description in reviews!!!</li>
            <li> This brush has helped me keep my sensitive teeth much cleaner than I could with a regular brush.</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price!  Bought for myself and still going strong.  Love the product.  Will buy one for my wife and daughter</li>
            <li> Love this product and the charger !!! No more changing batteries.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Teeth never felt cleaner. Bought it because previous purchase of same brand lasted 10 years without a fuss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product. I was getting cavities all the time started using a oral b Braun no cavities and the dental hygienist had lttle to do. So when my old one broke and I couldn&#x27;t find one at Walmart I was pleased to find one on amazon and its rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say. It cleans teeth. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with failing to work or charge.</li>
            <li> This is our third Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable electric toothbrush. We love them. They clean way better than a normal toothbrush--much less plaque build up. Our dentist is a witness to this. We like the &amp;#34;dual head&amp;#34; concept.</li>
            <li> The item was as I had hoped</li>
            <li> I had my first Oral-B for 3 years and loved it.  The charge lasted almost a week before slowly fading.&lt;br /&gt;This new one does not hold a charge nearly as long.  Three days at the most after which the power dwindles rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I was spoiled by my first one.  It was the exact same model.</li>
            <li> It seems to do an adequate job, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the timer alert that I expected.  I have always relied on that to let me know when to move on.</li>
            <li> Manual toothbrush vs. electric toothbrush:&lt;br /&gt;This is the first electric toothbrush I have used so far (have been using for 4 months now). My dentist always recommended me to use electric toothbrush for best results, but I always thought these el. toothbrushes are super expensive. I did an extensive search, and found this one. I bought this for $30, which I thought was good to see what these electric toothbrushes offer. I am very glad I purchased it. Actually, before this product, I used to get cranker sores inside the mouth every 2-3 weeks...whoever had them you know it&#x27;s painful and so uncomfortable to eat. I read up from webmd on cranker sore that one of the causes is tissue injury....so I thought maybe my manual toothbrushes causing them. So, I bought this el. toothbrush, and I have only had cranker sore once (within 4 months). I think el. toothbrush helped me not to have those painful sores so often. The reason I think is that with manual toothbrush I was too hard on pressure on my teeth, and within a week, my manual toothbrushes used to wear off (become &#x27;wide&#x27;), so it used to tore my gums I think a bit, thus a cranker sore. But once I read reviews for el. toothbrush, it said that you will know you are applying more pressure than needed when you see the brush head become wide. And since the head spins, I didn&#x27;t think you need to apply much pressure to clean the teeth (vs. in manual toothbrush, I thought I need to apply pressure so I clean my teeth better). So, overall, if you are thinking about buying an el. toothbrush or not, I think you should go for it.&lt;br /&gt;So far, the product is running great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses:&lt;br /&gt;- Definitely cleaner teeth than manual toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;- Helped me not to have cranker sores&lt;br /&gt;- cheap&lt;br /&gt;- comes with 2 brush heads (at least this model)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:&lt;br /&gt;- I wish it had brush container/protector, when travelling or keeping in your bathroom (especially if you keep it on your sink, and close to the toilet, sinceI read that every toilet flush makes microbes travel through bathroom...I keep mine inside the cabinet, so somewhat better)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I used it for like 2 months, my brother bought exact one (it was his first time using el. toothbrush as well). Then, I purchased another 2 for my sister and my parents as a gift oversees. (But be careful, it only works 100-120 volts, so I bought converter as well so it works for 220 volts as well.) Haven&#x27;t heard if they like it or not so far.</li>
            <li> I loved this toothbrush, was happy with the results, it kept an adequate charge that would last about 2+ weeks. BUT just after I had it for a year, the major flaw erupted!! Namely at the bottom, where it sits on the charger, is a totally inadequate plastic cap that hold the whole thing together with a very strong spring inside waiting to break the plastic...which is what happened. I have been able to keep it taped with strong packaging tape (duct tape amazingly did not work well!) for about 9 months and it would charge. But, it just died completely, after not even 2 years of owning it. I won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> replacing the same kind that stopped working, even though they slow down from time to time... I had already bought replacement brushes which are pricey so I got the same kind.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist said &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, but keep it up&amp;#34; as she found very little plaque on my teeth. nuff said</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL.  ITS EFFICIENT AND FUN TO BRUSH WITH, EVERYDAY.&lt;br /&gt;HOLDS IT CHARGE WELL.  LOVE IT......AND WILL BUY A NEW, ONE WHEN THIS ONE DIES</li>
            <li> Does a good job of cleaning teeth and massaging gums. Recommend !</li>
            <li> This brush stopped working on the second day of me using it.</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet but having used their toothbrush before i expect no problems or dislikes</li>
            <li> Had one for years bought a replacement before they completely disappear .</li>
            <li> BRUSH HEAD IS TINY! Do not buy! If you&#x27;ve become accustomed to the other brush heads that are TWICE AS BIG as the Oral-B heads. You, like me will hate this product and return it! Serious, 1/2 the size and you will be banging your teeth w/ the hard outer plastic of the brush. On the good side, this powered brush is very powerful. Much more powerful than those $5-7 Walmart Equate brushes (btw, those Equate $6 brushes are now made for Walmart by yet a new unknown supplier and the quality has taken a huge downfall. Can&#x27;t recommend those anymore).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed w/ power of this brush but the tiny heads make it horrible and get a 1 star. How could Oral-B and Braun hire such an incompetent brush engineer? Wake up Oral-B! I thought about looking at larger heads, but nope. Returning it.</li>
            <li> bought it for husband and it has outlasted ever other electric tooth bus we have purchased at at reasonable price</li>
            <li> My second Oral-B.  This is a great toothbrush with incredible cleaning power.  The dual heads make brushing a breeze.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  I use it twice a day.  When I get my dental cleanings I can hardly tell the difference because the Oral B does such a good job brushing.  The dentist agrees.</li>
            <li> This replaces my old one that wore out after several years.  These work very well and are of good quality.</li>
            <li> Battery is just starting to show its age.  Wish I could get a new one, but they&#x27;re not currently offered:(  Looking at it, the base might just allow replacement.  Well see!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has plenty of power. I tried a store brand that used the Oral B style oscillating heads but it barely held its charge for the 2 minute timer.  This brush has a better switch, more brush and more than enough charge to go the full 2 minutes and beyond.  It is definitely worth the extra $5 to $8 over the generic one.</li>
            <li> I like this, it works great, and the price was a lot cheaper than others with the same as this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush that not only is good for my teeth but it gives a gentle massage to my guns and keeps my tongue clean and healthy looking. I do not know what the real expensive ones can do that this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I bought one of these when I was 18.  I am now 27 and I still use it every day.  I am thinking about getting a new one though, since the power cord has turned a little off-white.  Hahaha.</li>
            <li> I have used my Oral-B vitality for 2 years ever since it was suggested by my Dentist, and it is as great as the day I bought it. Thanks Oral-B &amp; Braun.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. I&#x27;ve had 3 over the years. I prefer it to some of the newer ones on the market. I am pleased to be able to find it available online at Amazon.</li>
