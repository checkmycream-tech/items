            <li>I have used it for years and have had good dental check-ups with its regular use.</li>
            <li>I read that it prevents your teeth from remineralizing, unsure how true that is</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>This is the only mouthwash I have that I was able to use when I had a temp crown in my mouth.</li>
            <li>first reaction.</li>
            <li>cleans teeth well and leaves your whole mouth healthier.</li>
            <li>This is the only completely safe mouthwash on the market, and that includes all the natural ones.</li>

            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re lucky enough to live near a health store that sells it, they might allow returns if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>

            <li>To early to tell if this makes a difference yet.</li>
            <li>It tastes like the old red Lavoris, which to me is a plus.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re doing it for the health benefits for your gums, just use a mouthwash without alcohol or artificial ingredients, brush your teeth, then rinse out with water, and brush your teeth with liquid ubiquinol, proven to be good for your gums.</li>

            <li> My wife and I have been using it for the last few months.</li>
            <li> it is because you want to have minimal ingredients</li>
            <li> Every other one I tried gave me pain in that area.</li>
            <li> In fact, they work better if you don&#x27;t HATE using them.</li>

            <li> I smelled it and was all prepared for some barely tolerable overwhelming nasty taste and it hardly even tasted like anything!</li>
            <li> Buy the small size first.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I needed a Mouthwash and toothpaste that was basically tasteless.</li>
            <li> Very expensive, rather buy the Neem over this product</li>
            <li> (LiQ-nol.)&lt;br /&gt;Things don&#x27;t have to taste bad in order to work.</li>
            <li> This does not taste awful at all!</li>

            <li> This does not taste awful at all! I smelled it and was all prepared for some barely tolerable overwhelming nasty taste and it hardly even tasted like anything! It was so pleasant and leaves an aftertaste of cloves! So much better than nasty regular mouthwash that leaves my mouth feeling like chemicals. Packaging is cute and very sturdy. LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> One of the best I ever tried and have used it since it came out in 2004. Clean refreshing,soothing and no alcohol burn. All herbal ,natural ingredients</li>
            <li> This is the only mouthwash I have that I was able to use when I had a temp crown in my mouth. Every other one I tried gave me pain in that area. Not only didn&#x27;t VitaMyr burn the area it actually soothed it.  It does have a light taste of cloves but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  This is the only completely safe mouthwash on the market, and that includes all the natural ones.</li>
            <li> This may be healthy and good for you and all that, but the taste makes me not want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;It tastes like clove oil (One of the ingredients.)&lt;br /&gt;If it tasted more like djarums, I might be able to use it more than once.&lt;br /&gt;If you like cloves---go for it. Buy the small size first.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna have this sucker sitting in my medicine cabinet until the print gets hard to read.&lt;br /&gt;You can argue that herbal mouthwash isn&#x27;t going to be yummy, but I disagree, I have a bottle of Tom&#x27;s of Maine, and it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re doing it for the health benefits for your gums, just use a mouthwash without alcohol or artificial ingredients, brush your teeth, then rinse out with water, and brush your teeth with liquid ubiquinol, proven to be good for your gums. It doesn&#x27;t taste bad, at least not the brand I&#x27;m using. (LiQ-nol.)&lt;br /&gt;Things don&#x27;t have to taste bad in order to work. In fact, they work better if you don&#x27;t HATE using them. Because you&#x27;ll use them.&lt;br /&gt;I did come up with a good use for this stuff, though. If your kid swears, make him rinse out his mouth with this instead of soap.</li>
            <li> Not only it does not taste good it does not do the job at all.  I have an almost full bottle sitting in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Have only had a few days, bought for my husband and he hasn&#x27;t tried it yet I have and seems to be a good product at this point</li>
            <li> Great Price &amp; Quick Shipping. Highly Recommend. A+++++++</li>
            <li> I needed a Mouthwash and toothpaste that was basically tasteless. I have an EXTREMELY sensitive mouth (not teeth) and any type of mint Mouthwash or toothpaste burns my mouth horribly and for a few hours. It made brushing my teeth agony. This Mouthwash does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, no burning, at all.&lt;br /&gt;The taste isn&#x27;t great but, it&#x27;s not awful either. I think it&#x27;s tolerable because it has such a mild taste.&lt;br /&gt;If you or a family member has a sensitive mouth or gums, this Mouthwash will do the trick.</li>
            <li> This mouth wash is great.  It treats gum disease and keeps ones teeth cleaner with less tarter because of four ingredients---myrrh, clove oil, folic acid and zinc.  I have used it for years and have had good dental check-ups with its regular use.</li>
            <li> Love this Mouthwash.My wife and I have been using it for the last few months.I was never a guy who liked mouthwash until I tried this stuff.We use this and the toothpaste.Great Stuff and good for your mouth-Gums.</li>
            <li> The taste is wonderful I do not understand the previous review. It is not a strong taste like some other herbal formulas. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> No complaints. A good mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This is not the tastiest stuff I&#x27;ve ever used, but it&#x27;s certainly not the worst. I like the after feeling with the clove oil a lot! I would recommend this product definitely.</li>
            <li> This product, when used regularly, will absolutely help reverse gum disease (anecdotal from my wife and myself). It tastes like the old red Lavoris, which to me is a plus.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it.  It is strong on the cloves sensation.</li>
            <li> Leaves a clean feeling mouth.</li>
            <li> Buy this locally whenever I can!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the staying power.  The taste is somewhat awful. Has a herbal taste that I didn&#x27;t like and not much&lt;br /&gt;of a staying power...</li>
            <li> Is is OK.  Very expensive, rather buy the Neem over this product</li>
            <li> Love the freshness flavor.</li>
            <li> Ewe. Watery. Didn&#x27;t help as I tossed it.</li>
            <li> Reason why they don&#x27;t flavor it is because you want to have minimal ingredients, nothing else added, just the essentials, and that is what you got. If you care about your mouth, buy it, if you only care about taste, then forget it but I&#x27;d at least try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re lucky enough to live near a health store that sells it, they might allow returns if you don&#x27;t like it. I know the health food stores around me will allow you to return it if you don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first reaction. YUCK LOL. But I don&#x27;t wanna discourage you from using it. It kinda reminded me of the dentist actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I like it because they don&#x27;t fill with with all sorts of additives or chemicals, no dyes, no artificial sugar or flavors, and NO GLYCERIN! Why does all these toothpastes and mouth washes have glycerin. I read that it prevents your teeth from remineralizing, unsure how true that is but you can google search it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it. Don&#x27;t be a wimp lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems the same price as the store so I&#x27;m not ordering it from Amazon. It costs around $14-15.</li>
            <li> This has no sugary taste...breath is fresher the morning after.  If you are not into herbals the taste will need some breaking into, but it is worth it for healthy gums and great breath!</li>
            <li> Anyone who has ever wanted their mouth to feel amazing use this! I have been purchasing it for years. Your mouth will be so healthy and your breath great. I will always use this product.</li>
            <li> great mouth wash! cleans teeth well and leaves your whole mouth healthier.</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference</li>
            <li> To early to tell if this makes a difference yet. I will find out at my next dental cleaning appointment. If the reviews are correct, I should get a good review. I will update at a later date.</li>
