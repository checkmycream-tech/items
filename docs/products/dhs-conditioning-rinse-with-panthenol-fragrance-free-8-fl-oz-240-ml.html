            <li>Liked it</li>
            <li>(The original fragrance free shampoo was wonderful!)</li>
            <li>Naturally, I thought since the shampoo was so awesome, that the conditioner would be as well.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp and cause me break outs.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>my hair was so shiny and felt so healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size for traveling, though, and good enough for people with allergies who don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on their conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have rated this purchase many times and it is a good shampoo at a reasonable price, no need to keep reviewing</li>
            <li>You cannot find many fragrance free hair conditioners.</li>
            <li>When I proved allergic to the prescibed hair product my dermatologist told me to buy this, it works great leaves my hair feeling soft and easy to get a comb through.</li>
            <li>Does the job, but isn&#x27;t like the other excellent DHS products</li>
            <li>I have fine hair which tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>Product is fine.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>The Conditioning rinse is light and makes my hair easy to comb.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this conditioning rinse is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Now that DHS has changed the formula on their fragrance free shampoo (no longer truly fragrance free)</li>
            <li>An excellent product for those with sensitive skin or allergies, and also for those who don&#x27;t wish to add more fragrance to their personal care regimen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few fragrance free conditioner and DHS Conditioning Rinse is the best.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair tangle free and shiny like a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>No itchy scalp and the panthenol is exactly what I love about this product</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair clean with no odor.</li>
            <li>love this brand of shampoo but the rinse does nothing for untangling hair, or feeling silky like other rinses and you have to use a lot of it to do any good.</li>
            <li>I have rarely had any scalp irritations since I have been using the DHS products.</li>
            <li>It works great - conditions thick, wavy hair with no skin or respiratory irritation and rinses cleanly and quickly.</li>
            <li>My mom uses this rinse and likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping......</li>
            <li>I have had issues with scalp irritations my whole life.  </li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It puts back some of the moisture I lose with fragrance free shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Realize that I don&#x27;t really need this along with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s didn&#x27;t leave my hair very &amp;#34;full&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it too many times as I am trying to use up some other.  </li>
            <li>I have no reactions to it like I do to some many other things.  </li>
            <li>Good product, have used it in the past, but the bottle was busted open when I received it and amazon would not allow me to request a replacement without first returning the busted bottle.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and coarse and DHS leaves it nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decently creamy, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as silky as I&#x27;d like it to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dermatologist is highly allergic to scents and uses this and recommended that I use it.</li>
            <li>I also notice that my scalp feels a little more itchy when using this product.  </li>
            <li>As I suffer from migraines, any additional fragrances in products tend to make migraines linger, or new ones occurr.  </li>
            <li>Actually, this is a big step up for me as I had been using baking soda to wash my hair and am happy to have found a shampoo I can use at least part of the time.</li>
            <li>I do need a little styling cream if going for a polished look, but it is fine if going au naturel.</li>
            <li>The rinse does help a little with detangling my hair, but not a lot, despite having fine thining hair.  </li>
            <li>Also recommended by my dermatologist to be used with DHS Clear Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I would use it even if I didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and de-tangled with residual odor/fragrance.</li>
            <li>The conditioning rinse makes hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I feel I need to use more than necessary to get the same results from other cream rinses.  </li>
            <li>Since  can use this product every other day as long as I use a different one on alternating days, it does fine for me.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thick, and oily hair</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave oily, heavy residue like free and clear and other natural conditioners.</li>
            <li>I alternate the clear and zinc shampoos daily and also use the conditioner/rinse.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> oh a blessing that - in about half the previous time and with less hair lost.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have sebborhea - head itches constantly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It came in a little bottle that doesn&#x27;t look anything like the one shown in the picture, and I think $11 might be a little expensive for its quality and size.  </li>

            <li> i love this conditioner! I have fine, thick, and oily hair and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp and cause me break outs. Until I met DHS conditioning rinse. It doesn&#x27;t leave oily, heavy residue like free and clear and other natural conditioners. It leaves my hair tangle free and shiny like a clean feeling. I would use it even if I didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> No itchy scalp and the panthenol is exactly what I love about this product</li>
            <li> love this brand of shampoo but the rinse does nothing for untangling hair, or feeling silky like other rinses and you have to use a lot of it to do any good. will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Product is fine.  Fast shipping......</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this conditioning rinse is fragrance free.  You cannot find many fragrance free hair conditioners. This was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>

            <li> I have a bad case of the itchies and this helped it immensely. It is great and easy to use. Yeah.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with scalp irritations my whole life.  I have tried product after product with no success with the exception of the DHS products.  The DHS products are the only ones that have worked for me.  I alternate the clear and zinc shampoos daily and also use the conditioner/rinse. I have rarely had any scalp irritations since I have been using the DHS products.</li>
            <li> This product was recommend by my dermatologist.  It is wonderful.  It leaves my hair clean and shiny.  My hair does not feel dried out as with some other products.  :)</li>
            <li> Does the job, but isn&#x27;t like the other excellent DHS products</li>
            <li> I have Contact Dermatitis, and this was one of the products recommended to me by my dermatologist.  It&#x27;s decently creamy, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as silky as I&#x27;d like it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in a little bottle that doesn&#x27;t look anything like the one shown in the picture, and I think $11 might be a little expensive for its quality and size.  It&#x27;s a good size for traveling, though, and good enough for people with allergies who don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on their conditioner.</li>
            <li> When I proved allergic to the prescibed hair product my dermatologist told me to buy this, it works great leaves my hair feeling soft and easy to get a comb through.</li>
            <li> My allergies have made it impossible to use any product with fragrance. So, for the last 2 years, I&#x27;ve been using DHS products.  Not only does this work well, it gives incredible shine to my hair.  I buy ahead so I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about running out!  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It lives up to what my MD told me.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it too many times as I am trying to use up some other.  Seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist and I decided that I am allergic to the shampoo and conditioners that I had been using. My dermatologist is highly allergic to scents and uses this and recommended that I use it. I ordered both the shampoo and conditioner. I gotta tell you that I was unimpressed. I use a rinse to make my hair shiny and detangle.  Even though my hair is short, it just doesn&#x27;t do the job detangling. I went back to my other conditioner figuring that it is only applied to the hair and not the scalp so I hope that works out.</li>
            <li> Good product, have used it in the past, but the bottle was busted open when I received it and amazon would not allow me to request a replacement without first returning the busted bottle. Frustrating.</li>
            <li> Now that DHS has changed the formula on their fragrance free shampoo (no longer truly fragrance free) I don&#x27;t know that I will be buying the conditioner.  (The original fragrance free shampoo was wonderful!)</li>
            <li> My mom uses this rinse and likes it very much. Great to order and have it come to my door. Fast service. Thanks</li>
            <li> This product seems to help alleviate the flaking.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells a little odd in the bottle, but that is expected with no masking perfumes. It works great - conditions thick, wavy hair with no skin or respiratory irritation and rinses cleanly and quickly. It leaves my hair soft and de-tangled with residual odor/fragrance. I do need a little styling cream if going for a polished look, but it is fine if going au naturel. An excellent product for those with sensitive skin or allergies, and also for those who don&#x27;t wish to add more fragrance to their personal care regimen. The DHS shampoo also works great, but I would never use it without a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few fragrance free conditioner and DHS Conditioning Rinse is the best.  It puts back some of the moisture I lose with fragrance free shampoos.  My hair is thick and coarse and DHS leaves it nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner that I am not allergic to!!!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent ... my hair was so shiny and felt so healthy. I would definitely recommend this to my family and friends!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have sebborhea - head itches constantly.  Have taken to washing hair with pine-tar soap (not shampoo) and rinsing with DHS rinse.  It restores combability and shine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair which tangles easily.  I was experiencing problems with my scalp and my dermatologist gave me a sample of  DHS shampoo and conditioning rinse.  I subsequently purchased both products and my scalp began improving immediately.  The Conditioning rinse is light and makes my hair easy to comb.</li>
            <li> I am hyperallergic to many products including fragrances and have used DHS products for years and they are excellent and recommend them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DHS shampoos for about 6 years now, and am very happy that they are fragrance free.  As I suffer from migraines, any additional fragrances in products tend to make migraines linger, or new ones occurr.  DHS shampoo is also PH neutral, and reduces any itchy skin due to psoriasis or eczema.  Naturally, I thought since the shampoo was so awesome, that the conditioner would be as well.

The rinse does help a little with detangling my hair, but not a lot, despite having fine thining hair.  I also notice that my scalp feels a little more itchy when using this product.  Sad disappointment.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it.  It felt bad on my hair.  Someone else might have good results.  Was not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It does not de-tangle at all:-(  My hair is thick and curly and this does not work for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair clean with no odor.</li>
            <li> I have rated this purchase many times and it is a good shampoo at a reasonable price, no need to keep reviewing</li>
            <li> So nice and NO Fragrance!  I have multi allergies and have a hard time finding hair products that I can use.  This stuff is great.  I have no reactions to it like I do to some many other things.  And it helps me de-tangle my long hair - oh a blessing that - in about half the previous time and with less hair lost.  Keep it comin&#x27;!</li>
            <li> This conditioner was recommended by my husband&#x27;s Dermatologist. He has problems with scalp psoriasis and has been the best product on the market.</li>
            <li> Realize that I don&#x27;t really need this along with the shampoo. It&#x27;s didn&#x27;t leave my hair very &amp;#34;full&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Made me break out :( Also kind of sticky.</li>
            <li> The rinse isn&#x27;t enough to keep all the tangles away.  I feel I need to use more than necessary to get the same results from other cream rinses.  Still like the product.</li>
            <li> Liked it but it bothered my eyes</li>
            <li> It did nothing for me. I switched back to what I was using previously.</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner for years. It works great, is a very good price and leaves my hair very silky. I get a lot of compliments on how shiny my hair looks . Also it has no perfumes to irritate your scalp or skin.</li>
            <li> Also recommended by my dermatologist to be used with DHS Clear Shampoo.  The conditioning rinse makes hair soft and silky.</li>
