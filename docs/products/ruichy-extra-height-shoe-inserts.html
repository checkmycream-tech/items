            <li>For this item is  very good quality &amp; works well.</li>
            <li>I´m really happy for your service</li>
            <li>The adjustments of the heels great.</li>
            <li>but they are not assembled good anyway..</li>
            <li>It showed up on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>these would be useful for, but they worked great in my boots.</li>
            <li>so i needed to buy another insole to use in the top of that ....</li>
            <li>:) WOO</li>
            <li>I like this insert better than most.  </li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stack as easily as the photo shows and one was ripped.</li>
            <li>I wore them in a pair of cowboy boots that weren&#x27;t fitting just right and was able to dance the night away.  </li>
            <li>CHEAP JUNK</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
            <li>Material was cheaply made but you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t as comfortable as the first pair I received but they still got the job done if they were just a little but softer than the would be perfect</li>
            <li>THEY ALL CAME SUPER STUCK TOGEHTER TO THE POINT</li>
            <li>Wears out quickly.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>It felt so good on my arch, whereas before without it I felt discomfort after walking for 5 blocks , going up and down the stairs, pounding the pavements.</li>
            <li>I tried many different type of shoe inserts before.</li>
            <li>ITS THE LAYERS ARE TOO SHORT TO THE ARC AND EASY TO BREACK</li>
            <li>Very flimsy - no substance.</li>
            <li>They arrived one sticked to other, most was already broken.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The gel material was not of good quality, it was thin and tore when I tried to line them up.</li>
            <li>It was cheap though, so at least I wasn&#x27;t out much money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for my wife to use and so far she seems to think it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>It took forever to get them since they were shipped directly from China.  </li>

            <li> It hurts after a while and not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> 5 Layers Taller Insole Silicone Gel Inserts... Very flimsy - no substance.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t as comfortable as the first pair I received but they still got the job done if they were just a little but softer than the would be perfect</li>
            <li> CHEAP JUNK THEY ALL CAME SUPER STUCK TOGEHTER TO THE POINT I JUST THREW THEM OUT</li>
            <li> The lifts were not what I expected. The gel material was not of good quality, it was thin and tore when I tried to line them up. I was supremely&lt;br /&gt;disappointed.</li>
            <li> Extremely uncomfortable and of poor quality. Ended up just throwing away as I could not find any use for them.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT ITS AWESOME&lt;br /&gt;THE PROBLEM ITS THE LAYERS ARE TOO SHORT TO THE ARC AND EASY TO BREACK</li>
            <li> I will not recommend buying this insoles... not very easy to use and it sells.... i should try something else. No good!</li>
            <li> bad, i hate that ...they were all sticky and you have to figure out how put together but they are not assembled good anyway..and they are uncomfortable when you wear  with the socks so i needed to buy another insole to use in the top of that ....</li>
            <li> Came from Hong Kong. They don&#x27;t stack as easily as the photo shows and one was ripped. Don&#x27;t order these!</li>
            <li> Yo se que por el precio no debería exigir mucho, pero no me gustaron estas calzas porque son incomodas ya que no abarca bien el pie, están incompletas, si necesita usar todos los 2 centímetros. No era lo que esperaba&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that the price should not require much, but I did not like these tights because they are uncomfortable and it does not cover the foot well, are incomplete, if you need to use every 2 centimeters. Not what I expected</li>
            <li> They arrived one sticked to other, most was already broken.&lt;br /&gt;I waste my money in this buy.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Excelent product and ontime. I´m really happy for your service</li>
            <li> I used these to sneak my son onto rides he was not tall enough for. They work great!  :) WOO</li>
            <li> If you like puzzles then your in luck. For this item is  very good quality &amp; works well. The only thing I can see it that they need a foundation to put the pieces into for stability !</li>
            <li> I wore them in a pair of cowboy boots that weren&#x27;t fitting just right and was able to dance the night away.  (while appearing a bit taller.!)  I&#x27;m not sure what types of shoes these would be useful for, but they worked great in my boots.</li>
            <li> I like this insert better than most.  I use three layers in my left shoe and it evens me out.</li>
            <li> It showed up on time and in good condition. It&#x27;s for my wife to use and so far she seems to think it&#x27;s working ok.But she&#x27;s only had it in her shoe for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;I will update info and how she is doing with it in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> They definately dont look like anything in the picture. Horrible quality</li>
            <li> he did not like the lifts</li>
            <li> I tried many different type of shoe inserts before. This might be worst one of them all. This is a petroleum based product and smells terrible. The chemical smells will last and I am not sure if that is harmful to human or not, but i don&#x27;t trust it at all.  Your shoes and socks will smell entire day. It is also very uncomfortable compare to full size insoles. Is too soft to provide a stable platform to stand on compare to other height increase insoles.  I threw them away within few days.</li>
            <li> Wears out quickly. I have to wear it every day and they wear out within a few weeks. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> They came melted together and one was ripped :( I like that it&#x27;s versatile but that&#x27;s about it. Unable to use</li>
            <li> No problems with delivery. The price was right and so is the product. The adjustments of the heels great. It&#x27;s comfortable. I do notice the added lift. Had no problems with walking and I was walking all over the place. It felt so good on my arch, whereas before without it I felt discomfort after walking for 5 blocks , going up and down the stairs, pounding the pavements. A lift doesn&#x27;t only give you height but it does help the arch and heel too.</li>
            <li> Waited for weeks. -  no wonder - the parcel came from China!  This was one gooey mess could not make heads or tail out of it.  What a waste of time and money.  Very disappointed!!!  Marilyn</li>
            <li> This product arrived in pieces, would not stay together and I cannot use it. It was cheap though, so at least I wasn&#x27;t out much money. Would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at all. Material was cheaply made but you get what you paid for. Also was poorly put together. Couldn&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable at all</li>
            <li> Not comfortable and won&#x27;t stay in place in the shoe.  It took forever to get them since they were shipped directly from China.  The description of the product on the listing I ordered from didn&#x27;t indicate this.  Totally disappointing and worthless.</li>
            <li> This picture is not actual size.  This is too small for adult men,</li>
