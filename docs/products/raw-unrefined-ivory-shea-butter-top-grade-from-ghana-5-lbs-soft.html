            <li>Very happy got exactly what was said.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I found that the best way to filter the butter is to heat in A microwave safe bowl just until it melts, then strain using A clean flour sack that&#x27;s folded over once.</li>
            <li>This is a very good quality shea butter and ships quickly.</li>
            <li>great stuff, has a strong smell</li>

            <li>The level of customer service was amazing.</li>
            <li>I would rather cheap packaging and a GREAT price than pay an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS AMAZING PRODUCT FROM GOD.</li>
            <li>even use it on my face and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>but you can add your own preferred scents.</li>
            <li>but the smell isn&#x27;t nice.</li>
            <li>I just kind of wanted to make my skin softer.</li>
            <li>I make my own body lotion with it and my friends keep begging me to make them some and send it to them.</li>
            <li>This shea butter was a really good buy, i got the most out of my money AND the shea they sell is amazing quality.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely thrilled with this product and this company.  </li>

            <li>then I know what to do with and still an awesome price for so much.</li>
            <li>I make my own soaps, and thought if I ordered a 5 lb.</li>

            <li>I like this shea Butter, it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>If you wipe it on at the end of a shower, then rinse with warm water, you can avoid using a towel and reduce eczema to the weakest of cortisones for spot use.</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>

            <li>I liked it although I do enjoy Shea butter in containers</li>
            <li>and I move about a lot better.  </li>
            <li>This item came in packaged better than the picture here shows.</li>

            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>going to order more.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;ve never had unrefined shea better, but I have had the yellowy processed stuff.</li>
            <li>However, I did filter it just to make sure.</li>
            <li>just feel it will be better after it&#x27;s filtered.  </li>
            <li>** again, something i am ok with because I make whipped body butters and do that process anyways...</li>
            <li>Overall i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Received package on time and was satisfied with the product.</li>

            <li>I will be purchasing more very soon!!!</li>
            <li>This product is excellent to mix with mild essential oils like amyris and frankincense.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind though because the price was the best in comparison to the other choices.</li>
            <li>I used a cheesecloth to filter the particulate but other than that, it has been great!</li>
            <li>It was easy to separate</li>
            <li>I use this in my Shea body and hair products, always fast deliver, always an excellent product, always professional attitude when dealing with the owners</li>

            <li>I took a chance and purchased the shea butter from Smell Good due, in part, on the strength of the good reviews listed here.</li>

            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to process this yet, but it&#x27;s the real deal at a great price for so much!</li>

            <li>I am super pleased</li>
            <li>Very soft and good for making my magnesium shea butter lotion.</li>

            <li>Quick shipping so far its great</li>

            <li>Such great Shea Butter.</li>

            <li>The best thing that I LOVE about this product is that it is very oily and so soft, it melts fast, and I got A LOT.</li>
            <li>I discarded all the cheap lotions and potions I&#x27;ve bought and am sticking with this shea butter.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing price,and it may be exactly what you are looking for, I&#x27;m just not sure if it is for me or not :D</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I purchased 5 lbs.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>

            <li>Good quality, natural product.</li>
            <li>Just good old stinky shea butter.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will be ordering more very soon</li>
            <li>This Raw Unrefined Ivory Shea Butter from smellgood is my new go to for body butters, it may not smell good, but it sure feels good!</li>
            <li>But for me I think the product filled about 4 or 5 mason jars (with gaps), maybe more as I didn&#x27;t put it in the mason jar right away.</li>
            <li>and I was able to get it cleaned up pretty easily</li>
            <li>My batch had more than I need for right now.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Great seller, shipping was fast and item was exactly what I expected, also great pricing.</li>
            <li>product is smooth and clean when heated or just warmed.</li>
            <li>Super pleased came in half the time I thought it would I received exactly what I ordered very good quality for the money!</li>
            <li>I have a small at home soap and body product business, so getting the best bang for my buck is important.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you are making your own creams.</li>
            <li>This was nice and soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>It is and was worth the wait......!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received my Ivory Shea Butter....</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this on my face and hands.</li>
            <li>they weren&#x27;t exactly friendly, but, hey, i&#x27;m not looking for friends - just 5lbs of shea butter,</li>
            <li>It is unrefined; therefore, I have to strain it with cheesecloth, but it is well worth the time and effort!</li>
            <li>I think this is of higher quality than most.</li>
            <li>The packaging was fine and luckily the temperature didn&#x27;t affect the shipping box being soiled.</li>
            <li>this product was rich and sot</li>
            <li>The original shea scent is not covered.</li>
            <li>I got the shea butter about a week and a half after I ordered it, which I thought was very good.  </li>
            <li>Its a great price  for those that don&#x27;t mind the extra step, thanks smellgood for sticking to your word!!</li>
            <li>But other than that I enjoy this product it at a reasonable price and a great product !</li>
            <li>This new batch was everything though I whipped it as soon as I opened the packaging (each pound was in its own bag packaging</li>
            <li>Love that I can make my own body cream with different fragrance.</li>
            <li>Clean and unrefined.</li>
            <li>Also great in hair as a conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and authentic this product is.</li>
            <li>Melt&#x27;s well and feels great on my skin that use to be dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin</li>
            <li>This Shea Butter is creamy, fresh, and rubs on easily.</li>
            <li>I love the scent (can sometimes overpower, adjust essential oils accordingly) and the absorption is making my skin feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>I poured the CLEAN shea into jars I had purchased for this purpose.  </li>
            <li>great item and economical too would definitely buy again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to listen to the positive reviews...</li>
            <li>Thanks to you, I won&#x27;t only SMELLGOOD, but look good too!</li>
            <li>Nice texture nicely blends with other butters if desired.</li>
            <li>When I opened up my package the aroma was so pure, I immediately whip up me some BUTTER :)</li>
            <li>I did have to melt and filter the product, but it is awesome quality raw unrefined shea!</li>
            <li>Great product and shipping was as expected</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; also wasn&#x27;t ivory as described but a bright school bus yellow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and thick and smell delicious!  </li>
            <li>This shea butter was full of debris and when I melted it and filtered it there was slimy substance in the bowl.</li>
            <li>it came in a zip lock bag full of debris.</li>
            <li>so i use a sweet smelling cream on my skin to kill the scent.</li>
            <li>I read reviews stating they did not the full 5lbs of butter</li>
            <li>A whole 5lb bag (I had to weigh it to make sure I did receive all 5 lbs of shea butter</li>
            <li>I sent my son back to college with a 1 liter tupperware container of whipped shea butter and he loves it surprisingly.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product I could just take a piece of and mix with oils or whatever, not one I would have to filter then let cool and try to mix.</li>
            <li>The order was packaged OK and shipment was sent in a reasonable time period.  </li>
            <li>it will be much softer and smell better.  </li>
            <li>Wow I&#x27;m feeling enthusiastic about this stuff.  </li>
            <li>You will receive a bag full of chunks and crumbles, which is not a problem, just letting you know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how fast the Shea arrives at my house and the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>I love purchasing from this seller and they are super fast with shipping.</li>
            <li>It smelled great, no shell bits, no mold or any other problems.</li>
            <li>The shea butter came quickly and it was neatly packaged.</li>
            <li>but I have since become pregnant and can no longer tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li>The shea butter melted quickly.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>It has a mild nutty smell</li>
            <li>My entire family love the body butter I make with this product and can not go more than a day without it.</li>
            <li>My Shea butter arrived rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>but that was over quick.</li>
            <li>However I do like it for body lotions and hand creams because it doesnt leave a super greasy residue on your hands.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU VERY MUCH!</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd time purchasing this Shea butter from this vender and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered from this vendor and  I have been very pleased with the quality of their shea butter both times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty fabulous.</li>
            <li>and I know I have a good amount for a long time.</li>
            <li>The Shea Butter I received was in perfect raw form!!</li>
            <li>My experience with this shea butter was not as great as my previous experiences.</li>
            <li>It should last 2 years, so as long as it does, I am VERY happy.  </li>
            <li>It blended beautifully and the smell is not strong at all.</li>
            <li>There is a pungent, strong odor to it, very earthy.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It cooks beautifully and so far I haven&#x27;t used essential oils.</li>
            <li>The shea butter arrived quickly and smells and feels fresh.</li>
            <li>I did receive exactly 5lbs!  </li>
            <li>Nothing like getting exactly what you wanted/paid for!</li>
            <li>This butter is smooth and soft and can easily melt between hands.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to get back into that, but this was so satisfying and easy to do.  </li>
            <li>Clean and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>but honestly i think that&#x27;s because it pure and natural</li>
            <li>This shea has minimal residue and is high quality, giving all my products a beautiful finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Breaks down very easy Love the quality of it</li>
            <li>Also adding essential oils to this makes it smell amazing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience that straight out of the bag it was smooth and melted on my fingers.</li>
            <li>It was time consuming but worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>Love it, natural is the way to go guys.</li>
            <li>Was not going smelled fresh.</li>
            <li>The product was unrefined and looked good as I expected.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I use this personally for sensitive skin family.</li>
            <li>Better quality than my old eBay supplier.</li>
            <li>i have been making my own shea butter lotions and bodyscrubs and lip products, for the last year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and for the amount for the price...</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is sooo worth it..  </li>
            <li>I have used the yellow kind before</li>
            <li>pieces was well worth it.  </li>
            <li>IT WAS NOT DIRTY AS SOMEONE POSTED.</li>
            <li>well worth it if you ask me.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the bag, it smelled fresh, nutty and buttery.</li>
            <li>It was packaged well and the shea was not dirty at all.  </li>
            <li>but its worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has a nice creamy color, soft scent, and works very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But also be prepared to keep young and healthy skin, eczema or not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I warm it enough to melt the shea butter, and then mix the oils.</li>
            <li>It smells the same but is more buttery and smooth.</li>
            <li>It shipped pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I received my order quick and it was exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>I pure clean product with an earthy aroma of Shea</li>
            <li>I use it to make my hair creme and it feels really good, it mixes in well with the other ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it right now because it does wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>I used it right away without processing it.  </li>
            <li>so I used it right out of the box.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>This does not!I received my order right away.</li>
            <li>The price is right</li>
            <li>they were so right.</li>
            <li>and they responded right away,  </li>
            <li>just right for my hair grease.</li>
            <li>is right.</li>
            <li>, we don&#x27;t use it in the shower anymore, but instead use it right after the shower.</li>
            <li>great raw unrefined Shea.  </li>
            <li>Butter Lotion Bar Stick Ingredients (great for feet):&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons raw organic shea butter</li>
            <li>so thats an extra step i have to take, the butter is very smooth and mild scent.</li>
            <li>Clean high quality shea butter!</li>
            <li>Much easier to keep the tub clean that way.</li>
            <li>Its not the most sophisticated packing, but it works and keeps the pricing down.</li>
            <li>The result was a fine oil with a nice nutty scent that becomes solid once it cooled completely.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, exactly 5 lbs.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described, unrefined, pure top grade and SOFT!</li>
            <li>It comes in a plastic sealed package, but will need to be transported to a large ziplock bag, unless you&#x27;re going to use all 5 pounds at once!  </li>
            <li>Soft, fresh, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this amount of shea butter for such a low price.  </li>
            <li>I mixed it with coconut oil, sesame oil, vitamin E and added essential oils to mask its scent and it works great.</li>
            <li>I will take cheap packaging to keep the price low, although I am upset I cannot find it with free shipping any longer.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and you can easily apply it.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I purchased 10 lbs to make body butters, deodorant and many other things!</li>
            <li>While I had originally planned on making only whipped shea butter, the smoothness of the butter after filtering is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Some people who gave it good reviews talked about a little bit of a smell.</li>
            <li>but it was more than enough for me.    </li>
            <li>+... will most definitely purchase from Smellgood again!</li>
            <li>I used my glass Pyrex bowl and placed it over a pot of boiling hot water, melted it, filtered it through a strainer with a pieced of cheesecloth in the strainer.</li>
            <li>This has a funny smell to it.</li>
            <li>It has a funny chemical smell and it burns my skin when I apply it.</li>
            <li>Very please!</li>
            <li>This was the first time that I ordered the ivory colored</li>
            <li>It is exactly as the manufacturer describes.  </li>
            <li>My dad was pretty concerned, thinking it was drugs or something.</li>
            <li>As the title says, this product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Per the video, melt shea butter on VERY LOW heat, stirring until it is all melted; you should be able to see your spoon through the shea butter when it is all melted.</li>
            <li>In fact, I just ordered ten pounds this time, instead of five, so I can make a lot more of my products.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>this was my first time ordering from this seller</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely looooooooooove this product!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more next week👍!</li>
            <li>I weighed the package and it was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>this seems to be the only thing that helps,  I love it.</li>
            <li>I the product even after processing so be aware when you purchase.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>it absorbed into the skin really well.</li>
            <li>This is exactly as the seller states it is.</li>
            <li>White from what I can tell is what rises to the top when boiled.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>The product received was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the service!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy  more of this stuff.</li>
            <li>As shea butter can be quite expensive, the price is a wonderful value.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time to purchase shea butter, so I&#x27;m a novice here.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I ordered this Shea Butter from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and I have more than enough butter now.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I would order more when I get low on it</li>
            <li>It was exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>In two weeks exact.</li>
            <li>I have whipped this with essential oil and was pleased with results.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have bought from them and I love their shea butter.  </li>
            <li>then all of the bags were put into a bigger bag together, it was ok for me</li>
            <li>I did not have debris in mine and it weighed 5 lbs exactly.  </li>
            <li>I plan on making a whipped shea butter concoction for my hair, so I have more than enough.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try unrefined shea butter for the first time.</li>
            <li>My Shea butter was exactly what was discribed, the delivery was prompt, its not filtered</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>After adding essential oils it smells better.</li>
            <li>just received my order 5lbs exactly ..</li>
            <li>I received a large &amp;#34;brick&amp;#34; of (soft- easily cuts with knife)</li>
            <li>When it cools to room temp I have a very luxurious solid but soft cream-like material that spreads so smooth and easy!</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was of extremely high quality.</li>
            <li>this is the real deal right here.</li>
            <li>It has an earthy aroma that is not particularly welcoming, but not offensive either, and it&#x27;s very easy to disguise.</li>
            <li>I have used pure Shea butter for ten years, and I bought this 5 lb package as the price is better</li>
            <li>It does make nice body butter and other homemade products.</li>
            <li>Clean up with rubber spatula and paper towels making sure to not get any of the shea butter cream down your sink.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the Shea was great, the only downfall was that it required more filtering; there were still shell pieces in it and some other various debris.</li>
            <li>Soft with no need to clean...</li>
            <li>It was soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Be prepared to clean the tub often and wash clothes and sheets frequently.</li>
            <li>I was actually not expecting so much and had to buy some more mason jars.</li>
            <li>Overall, for the price even if its not the nicest of Shea butters, the amount you get is such a good deal you cant pass it up.</li>
            <li>The shea butter is soft and turns to a nice cream when warmed and mixed.</li>
            <li>It was a lot of hard work for something that wasn&#x27;t as good as what costs much less, but it was a fun experience and made a ton (literally, I had so many jars full of this stuff) of christmas presents.</li>
            <li>I made my first batch I used half Shea and  three guarters coconut oil, and a nice splash of E.V.O.O.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive</li>
            <li>Exactly as described fast shipping</li>
            <li>fast on time delivery and exact</li>
            <li>your looking for true Shea butter with all the healing &amp; natural benefits it has, than purchase this.</li>
            <li>I want to take full advantage of Shea butter&#x27;s natural vitamin A and E, so I took my chance with this unrefined Shea</li>
            <li>Melted down nicely with no residue in it.</li>
            <li>The color is outstanding and the smell is &#x27;correctly shea&#x27; a little sweet and nutty; not offensive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a little more nutty smelling than I anticipated, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I have bought shea butter a few times from other sellers and I must say that this is the absolute best I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>Super soft and hydrating.  </li>
            <li>I like the soft texture and mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>this mixed easily and maintained the effects i was looking for</li>
            <li>Make sure everything u use is dry.</li>
            <li>had such a strong smell</li>
            <li>When mixed, it almost smells as strong as plado..</li>
            <li>You need something solid with a large opening that is easy to scoop out.</li>
            <li>pure and smoky</li>
            <li>Also received large amout of the shea butter.</li>
            <li>pure, filtered, unbleached cosmetic grade beeswax pastilles</li>
            <li>I could not imagine what kind of mess I would receive if it came on a day where it was over 100 out.</li>
            <li>but none the less overall great product.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the effort you put into your packaging to make sure my butter doesnt dry out while in transit to me.</li>
            <li>I am an avid vegetable/herbal gardener and blend the shea with  other oils and my homegrown herbs to produce lovely aromatic hair/body delights.</li>
            <li>I know it seems extreme to stir for 1.5 hours until the pot is cool, but the solidified shea butter I got after this was SMOOTH and CREAMY.</li>
            <li>Always use the lowest heat setting with a double broiler and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>Very high quality and</li>
            <li>it was a great deal, the quality was terrific however the packaging was a little messed up.</li>
            <li>Use a towel to pick up hot jar and gently pour  into clean 2nd jar, add about 1-2 ounces of liquid oil, I use jojoba or hemp, and pin prick 4(or 1 for every 8 ozs)-1000</li>
            <li>This does have a strong shea smell to it (as does ALL raw, genuine shea butter)</li>
            <li>Real Shea butter.</li>
            <li>real Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not going to smell like what you buy in walmart , that has fragrances added &amp; it&#x27;s junk.</li>
            <li>I use it to make shea butter cream which is very softening to the skin.  </li>
            <li>It is ready to use anytime I make a cream or lotion.  </li>
            <li>I purchased 5lbs for $12, which yielded six-16 oz containers after being refined, and Whole Foods is selling 7oz of 100% Shea for $10.99 and the 2oz container for $8.99.  </li>
            <li>There was not that much debris in it.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>It is very inexpensive compared to re-processed products.  </li>
            <li>You are getting the real thing.  </li>
            <li>It arrived very promptly.  </li>
            <li>It worked really well in the body butters that I make.</li>
            <li>I received it fast.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated the link provided by the company.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>processing, I mixed in some olive oil, coconut oil, and a bunch of unscented cheap lotion from cvs.</li>
            <li>I ended up with a very grainy shea butter afterwards once it solidified.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li>I knew I should get it as fast as I could - before it was all gone.  </li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to purchase this product</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>The jars are much easier to organize and manage than a lumpy and bulky 5 lb.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to melt more product than your jars can hold.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting such a moisturizing butter since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>and I really like that one</li>
            <li>I put the whole shea butter in a metal bowl and then placed the bowl over the pot.</li>
            <li>Worked really well.</li>
            <li>It was a lot more product than I expected.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING, AND IT DID NOT COME IN JUNKS AS</li>
            <li>GO FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY</li>
            <li>I used it for bath &amp; body products I make, as well as straight out the box.  </li>
            <li>It was very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>This company shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Very affordable for the amount.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ivory color butter, has a light natural scent, melts well and doesn&#x27;t have many impurities, just a few</li>
            <li>it only took 5 mins until it was perfectly smooth .</li>
            <li>really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this shea butter.</li>
            <li>It makes my shea mixtures creamy, smooth and white depending what oils I mix in it when I run out I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I chose not to refine much of it.</li>
            <li>It came in a plastic bag, which didn&#x27;t really bother me.  </li>
            <li>I would really like to thank the vendor who provides this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I had went away and my skin as a whole looks healthier.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived earlier than scheduled, packaged well and secure.</li>
            <li>My skin has really suffered from the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;The package</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li>Much easilier</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling real moist.</li>
            <li>Now I wonder if the product I ordered before from another company was really Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The smell is very nutty, but it does smell like shea butter.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve gotten used to having it on the sheets, and it really doesn&#x27;t make any difference.</li>
            <li>And shipping was fast</li>
            <li>light oil (like almond, jajoba or olive)&lt;br /&gt;Optional: 10-30 drops of essential oils of choice&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>Better quality than I had expected, works well for hand creams.</li>
            <li>but I really do like it</li>
            <li>I make my own lotion and for several years went to the local beauty supply store to purchase my Shea Butter ...</li>
            <li>I love it, been use it a very long time, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Easy to cut with butter knife into long rectangular shapes to add to lotion bottles or anything.</li>
            <li>After about 6 weeks, I noticed I can now easily stand and walk after sitting for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited that it felt like opening a Christmas present; however, upon opening the package, I realized I did not receive the item for which I paid -</li>
            <li>The scent is nutty like some other people said but not awful.</li>
            <li>Your Shea Butter is cleaner, softer and overall higher in quality ... not to mention the better overall price.</li>
            <li>This is better than other Shea butters I have bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like having to melt it to clean it so extensively-</li>
            <li>Weight is usually always right on the money or slightly more.  </li>
            <li>And it smells like these really sweet gross earthy nuts</li>
            <li>Once the POT was cool to the touch, I poured the shea butter into my containers, stirring each individual container until there were no bubbles.</li>
            <li>I leave a jar in my locker at the Y and never have any problems with it, gets soft in room with hot tub, but not liquid.</li>
            <li>Just place a teaspoon full in your hands, rub your hands together for a second or two and spread to all areas needing help.  </li>
            <li>to fridge and let cool another 1 hour or until starting to harden but still somewhat soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>cool for several hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>cool for several hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>it self works good, smell was not good at all.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more Raw Unrefined Shea Butter from smellgood very soon, and I recommend that you do too!</li>
            <li>I immediately inspected it when I got it to make sure that the color, texture and smell were consistent with raw, unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li>Way better than any garbage, watered down version that one would buy from bath and body works or the cvs or walgreens.</li>
            <li>If you plan on melting it down I would recommend weighing the amount you are going to melt to make sure you have the correct amount to fill your jars.</li>
            <li>Let the tubes sit undisturbed for 20 minutes to cool and set (leave any spill-over temporarily undisturbed – it is not worth trying to wipe it off right now).&lt;br /&gt;After your balm has cooled and set, it is ready to go</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize I have to process these, but I just added chucks of them to my other hand lotions (you have to - they smell &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; otherwise) and they work just fine; and they&#x27;re soooo inexpensive compare to the ones they sell on tv, which btw aren&#x27;t pure shea butter anyway</li>
            <li>Both products are the real deal and it is a relief to find a new supplier.</li>
            <li>For a smoother lotion bar stick, use less beeswax and more coconut oil or olive</li>
            <li>For a smoother lotion bar stick, use less beeswax and more coconut oil or olive oil.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly and in a mostly solid block with crumbles, I didn&#x27;t get a chance to weigh it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make a lot of super products from this and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly as a hair product</li>
            <li>I still have a good amount left and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>and will definitely order more in the future.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely buy from this seller again, and I would totally recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>The main thing is that the mix should be about 2/3-3/4 shea butter.</li>
            <li>This product is so soft in texture and smell that it does not take much to cover your whole body in it.  </li>
            <li>Very soft!  </li>
            <li>when  fluffy, do this quickly as the mixture will begin to solidify when cool.  </li>
            <li>I had no intentions of creating products for other people, I did it for the sole purpose of custom making something that suits my own particular needs and preferences.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>It is a high quality butter I and use it in my homemade body butters</li>
            <li>High quality.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend it..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and this seller!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li>The product was of high quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The Shea Butter is fine but could have come in a much smaller plastic bag then it was packaged in to avoid getting the butter on my arms by reaching into such a large buttered plastic bag.</li>
            <li>This is natural, it shouldn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;, but some expect a certain scent that lotions w/ Shea have &amp; that&#x27;s not this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ended up with 5 lbs of butter for a little more than I paid for 1 lb.  </li>
            <li>it melts down faster than chocolate, almost as fast as butter, so don&#x27;t leave it alone long at all on the stove top!</li>
            <li>Thanks soo very much, I would only receive an 8 oz.jar in my town, for the price of your product.</li>
            <li>Works awesome with Raw African Black Soap for acne scars.</li>
            <li>You really need to do your research about natural Shea, the color, smell, where it&#x27;s from, grades etc.</li>
            <li>It arrived well packaged, soft and ready to use.  </li>
            <li>This shea butter is soft and I really didn&#x27;t need to add anything</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using Shea butter on a regular basis, it is definitely worth purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t smelled fresh shea in awhile since I had been taking months to use up my whipped and mixed supply on hand.</li>
            <li>but that might be normal.</li>
            <li>I have a rare form of psoriasis and both products are essential for  my functioning!</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be ordering from here again as long as the shipping will be better the next time .</li>
            <li>Because I wanted to preserve as many nutrients as possible, I used the double boiler method instead of placing the product directly in a metal pot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is NOT hard butter, I never knew there was a soft/hard shea butter, so if you are using it to make body butters, be aware that it will absolutely change the texture of the final product</li>
            <li>We live  in&lt;br /&gt;the high desert region just south east of Reno, Nevada.</li>
            <li>As soon as it turns opaque, not hard, shake vigorously.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, other than the earthly smell that was a bit stronger than I anticipated, this is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>When I saw 5 pounds, i got really excited, but I read some reviews about how it was not really a lot.</li>
            <li>Otherwise you most likely will get a different nut butter that cost way less &amp; has none of the Shea properties , or a refined low grade , cosmetic grade Shea that is the &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; left over after making true Shea or just cheap crap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have been living in the same place for over 3 years now, and have ordered many things off Amazon and other sites most items were sent my UPS or Fed X. Of the few things that were sent by the USPS</li>
            <li>Love this raw unrefined ivory Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I love that it is raw and unrefined.  </li>
            <li>The product was just as they described, I use it on my super dry skin</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t open it and expect it to look nice and fluffy like the body scrubs and stuff those have been refined and whipped.</li>
            <li>I purchased this butter for the main reason that it was soft.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to any smells.</li>
            <li>Just melt it in a pan, do not get it hot, just barely melted, add about 1/6 or so liquid oil such as olive oil or almond oil, whip it up with an eggbeater when it begins to cool, and add essential oil drops to your preference when whipping.  </li>
            <li>On processing, ( heating gently with constant stirring to 170-180F for 15min and filtering there was minimal fine dust/ sandy grit and rapid cooling).</li>
            <li>the seller is VERY willing to answer ANY and all questions--I emailed questions left, right and center on what to do with it, how to store it, how to filter it, will bugs bother with it, etc.  </li>
            <li>That was pretty gross.</li>
            <li>The invoice was inside of the first bag, the shea butter inside of the second bag.</li>
            <li>I purchase Shea butter in bulk on a regular due to using it in most of my soap products and whipped butters</li>
            <li>and it made my hands sooooo soft!</li>
            <li>Today I made my first batch of body butter with essential oils.</li>
            <li>I have ordered bulk shea butter from different locations online, and this is the first time I have ordered from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got within a few days, which was great (earlier than I had expected)!  </li>
            <li>containers.&lt;br /&gt;i filled 3 and half of them up.</li>
            <li>Either way this &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; is not raw.</li>
            <li>have given this concoction to friends and co-workers and I am hoping they will experience the same positive results.  </li>
            <li>It melts quickly in my hands, very soft scent &amp; blend well with other oils</li>
            <li>I did check the weigh after reading other reviews and seeing some people shorted, but I received the full 5 lbs.  </li>
            <li>I got the full 5 lbs with mine, no shorting like a couple other reviews said.</li>
            <li>The product lasted a long time and I still have some, although that might be due to the fact I haven&#x27;t been able to continue making lotions, and hair creams for a while.</li>
            <li>My shipment did not arrive in tiny crumbles as some have stated - instead, 3 or 4 large chunks.  </li>
            <li>It was in a large plastic bag with a descriptive label on the outside.</li>
            <li>Butter is in large clumps, not one solid mass.</li>
            <li>It is soft, light in color and very mild in scent so adding essential oils for scent uses less than other shea butters I have tried.  </li>
            <li>But the price is low &amp; your getting a lot of the real thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one big block, and you just pull off a chunk of how much you want.  </li>
            <li>use this in a lot of natural products like lotion.</li>
            <li>Was shipped in a white &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; plastic grocery bag, but for the price i can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I received my shoe box sized shea butter.</li>
            <li>Very greasy and last for about three hours.</li>
            <li>However, it wasn&#x27;t as soft or glowy looking as</li>
            <li>Just pay the extra money for the real thing.</li>
            <li>This is really soft Shea Butter as in the description.  </li>
            <li>We use it in soap, directly apply it to skin where it melts from body heat.  </li>
            <li>Natural Health and Beauty</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>Natural.</li>
            <li>The unrefined butter is interesting to say the least</li>
            <li>The only real problem I have with it is the hair moisturizer I make with</li>
            <li>100% all natural shea butter.</li>
            <li>This butter is so creamy and soft.</li>
            <li>This Shea butter is so soft that you can use it by itself.</li>
            <li>So far, this has been the richest and creamiest shea butter I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft, doesn&#x27;t stink .</li>
            <li>my hands were SO SOFT</li>
            <li>I am a frequent buyer of this shea butter...</li>
            <li>I use it on my natural hair and my skin.</li>
            <li>Made my hair and skin really soft.</li>
            <li>The difference between what I purchased in the beauty supply store and through you is so far apart.</li>
            <li>I was completely surprised with the amount received.</li>
            <li>bag of unrefined shea butter, in chunks and with some natural discoloration.</li>
            <li>Now that I know what to expect, the next time I order I will leave it as is in chunks and store it in glass jars until ready to use.</li>
            <li>I added a lot of essential and fragrance oils and the smoke smell still is a bit much for me.  </li>
            <li>Soft smell but</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>And it makes my skin feel so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I love the product I received, it was exactly what I expected it have some grains on a small portion</li>
            <li>This does take a considerable amount of time..</li>
            <li>I have probably used up nearly 2 pounds already, in just a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We use it daily to really fight off winter dryness.</li>
            <li>old norwegian/swedish skin needs.  </li>
            <li>Smooth as firm butter!!!!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>I use this in a 4 ingredient all natural lotion I make.  </li>
            <li>I have not used unrefined shea butter before but had no trouble.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it in lotions and soap so far.</li>
            <li>I had to turn it only a few times to make sure all of it melted.</li>
            <li>It does have an earthly smell, but I just add a few drops of essential oil and it make it better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so appreciative to access this product without all of the additives and unnecessary manufactured reconstruction.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for providing with such a fantastic raw material to make my scented moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>BUT that is kind of to be expected since this is a extremely raw product.</li>
            <li>I use Shea Butter on it which not only moisturizes my skin, but when used in regular intervals (in addition to my medicated skin cream), it cuts the normal intensity of the condition and restores the color of my skin much faster.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In a double boiler or glass bowl, combine all ingredients except essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;Bring to medium heat and stir constantly until all ingredients are melted.&lt;br /&gt;Remove from heat and let cool slightly.&lt;br /&gt;Move</li>
            <li>They called back promptly multiple times as I missed their calls at first.</li>
            <li>I think I have finally found Shea that will be the same consistently with each order.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(doesn&#x27;t come as a solid block, but as many small pieces).</li>
            <li>Means is a little cool</li>
            <li>It smells slightly smoky,has a smooth non-oily feel and the color is not WHITE but beige.</li>
            <li>They even included a really substantial coupon to use on my next purchase which I will be doing in the near future.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This shea butter stinks, and not in the warm nutty way that raw shea butter naturally smells like (which I love) but in a rancid play-doh type of way.</li>
            <li>I live in ohio and my husband took it outside and stirred for about 20 minutes in 34 degree temps and it started to solidify.</li>
            <li>Since the only way I could figure out if I did in fact get 5lbs, was to weigh myself on my regular bathroom scale (127.2) and then weigh myself while holding the whole bag of shea butter (132.2)...</li>
            <li>No foreign materials nor smell.</li>
            <li>Has small debris thats easily removed once melted on low heat.</li>
            <li>So far I have made body butter and deodorant with my raw shea butter and it was a total success!</li>
            <li>actually I just ordered some black for the first time and now eagerly awaiting its arrival, they now have a customer for life if they continue to provide high quality products at unbeatable prices..</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and lasts you a very long time!</li>
            <li>I also use it as an all-around moisturizer (including face...great for dry skin!)</li>
            <li>It did come in a more yellow tint and their was a slight odor, but that seemed to be expected from some of the reviews.</li>
            <li>I had to literally blow dry the Shea butter to get it melted which resulted in a huge oily mess and</li>
            <li>and I have a daughter of 14 months that use to get bad diaper rashes this also great for diaper rashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to any buyer, but if you really care about it being white maybe confirm with the different sellers before you buy and figure out which one can guarantee it.</li>
            <li>Granted no shea butter smells like daisies and this wasn&#x27;t FAR off from regular shea smell</li>
            <li>Because of my diminishing math skills I had not mentally estimated what five pounds would look like.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin supple and soft especially my feet.  </li>
            <li>and I am extra soft</li>
            <li>It has so far, I only use a couple ounces per 2 lb.</li>
            <li>my batch wasn&#x27;t soft enough to just whip by itself.</li>
            <li>wow I will be back and tell others about you</li>
            <li>I found an old double boiler at a thrift store that I use for skin products</li>
            <li>I found an old double boiler at a thrift store that I use for skin products</li>
            <li>when compared to other Ivory Shea butters that I have purchased for other suppliers; however,  I would definitely recommend the product and will be more than likely placing another order.</li>
            <li>arrived earlier than expected and was exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I used this product after the return window (my own fault).</li>
            <li>Using a 2nd jar, rubber band a double layer of cheese cloth around the top with a slight depression in center(I use the empty coconut oil jar sometimes).</li>
            <li>No matter; a little goes a long way &amp; it was well worth the price!  </li>
            <li>I have only used it straight so far but want to blend it with other butters.</li>
            <li>Look and smell just like the butter I get from organic creations for a higher price and less product.</li>
            <li>It did need a little more refining like they said but just a little bits of nut shells in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to this shea butter stuff, so maybe the black stuff is normal..</li>
            <li>Used it to make whipped butters and blends really well with other oils.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it matter that much which of the other oils I use.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel soft all over and soothes dry winter skin like no other!</li>
            <li>No dry skin even though I live in a dry winter climate.</li>
            <li>It was one large block, very soft and creamy with very little debris.  </li>
            <li>I also used no heat to mix some of this product using an old regular mixer, with some mango butter and essential oils</li>
            <li>When mixed with othr oils to make hand cream, the result is a soft, creamy yellow hand cream that works wonders!</li>
            <li>The outer ship box though was a little too lightweight and was pretty beat up by the time i got it.  </li>
            <li>It feels a little grainy at first but melt as you rub it in.</li>
            <li>but nothing major I simply shaved it...</li>
            <li>Everyone in the house uses shea butter and it was hard to find a large enough amount that was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Since starting my business I generally buy in bulk.  </li>
            <li>When it finally melted (it took a while to melt 5 pounds in low, low heat), the shea butter was so clear</li>
            <li>You will probably have to pick out some small particles, but it&#x27;s worth it for the price and grade.  </li>
            <li>All over the box, a BIG HUGE MESS!!!</li>
            <li>My hair stays soft and my skin does not get dry like it used to.</li>
            <li>The double bags have helped me to ensure that the product does not dry out while using.</li>
            <li>You could easily use it raw rather than melting it down to filter it out.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I bought raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>is if it melts a little and re-hardens You may find it is a different texture sometimes with chunks after so keep it secret and keep it safe!</li>
            <li>The product comes in a large bag, which is a little big and bulky to find a place to store it.</li>
            <li>(I am lucky enough to have an extra frig) and it lasts for up to at least 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which is exactly what I expected, and other peices were a dingy brownish almost greenish color.</li>
            <li>This is an unbelievable price for raw unrefined top grade shea butter.</li>
            <li>I received a hard yellow chunk that was underweight and returned, and another old hard chunk that was underweight most recently.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I found that the best way to filter the butter is to heat in A microwave safe bowl just until it melts, then strain using A clean flour sack that&#x27;s folded over once.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality shea butter and ships quickly.</li>

            <li> The level of customer service was amazing.</li>
            <li> I would rather cheap packaging and a GREAT price than pay an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS AMAZING PRODUCT FROM GOD.</li>
            <li> even use it on my face and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> but you can add your own preferred scents.</li>
            <li> but the smell isn&#x27;t nice.</li>
            <li> I just kind of wanted to make my skin softer.</li>
            <li> I make my own body lotion with it and my friends keep begging me to make them some and send it to them.</li>

            <li> I like this shea Butter, it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> If you wipe it on at the end of a shower, then rinse with warm water, you can avoid using a towel and reduce eczema to the weakest of cortisones for spot use.</li>

            <li> Will order more as needed</li>
            <li> I started using Shea butter recently and noticed a wonderful change in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> If it smelled better I would purchase again but it doesn&#x27;t so I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li> I liked it although I do enjoy Shea butter in containers</li>
            <li> and I move about a lot better.  </li>
            <li> This item came in packaged better than the picture here shows.</li>
            <li> The kpangnan smelled more nutty and this smells more smoky.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> going to order more.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve never had unrefined shea better, but I have had the yellowy processed stuff.</li>
            <li> However, I did filter it just to make sure.</li>
            <li> just feel it will be better after it&#x27;s filtered.  </li>
            <li> ** again, something i am ok with because I make whipped body butters and do that process anyways...</li>
            <li> Overall i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Received package on time and was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I love the Shea butter</li>

            <li> Wonderful light smell to use alone or easily scented with essential oils.</li>
            <li> They are also so happy with the great benefits of raw shea.  </li>

            <li> Its great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully with coconut oil and everyone who tries it loves it.</li>
            <li> I received more help from Rebecca on her post on here on how she got smooth creamy shea butter.</li>
            <li> I use it to make massage candles and soap so far it has been great.</li>
            <li> I can negotiate the stairs a lot more comfortably</li>
            <li> The pain is still there, but the swelling has subsided and I am a lot more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, soft...and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and good too.</li>
            <li> Overall it was a great buy, was very useful for what I needed and the price was amazing for the amount.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more very soon!!!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent to mix with mild essential oils like amyris and frankincense.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind though because the price was the best in comparison to the other choices.</li>
            <li> I used a cheesecloth to filter the particulate but other than that, it has been great!</li>
            <li> It was easy to separate</li>
            <li> I use this in my Shea body and hair products, always fast deliver, always an excellent product, always professional attitude when dealing with the owners</li>
            <li> I hope that it is easy to process.</li>
            <li> Holy cow, this is the best price I have found for this product online.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is so easy to work with will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I add essential oils to make it smell great and also benefit my skin even more.</li>
            <li> Yes the smell is strong but once applied to skin, the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and purchased the shea butter from Smell Good due, in part, on the strength of the good reviews listed here.</li>
            <li> This particular shea is by far the best quality yet!  </li>
            <li> It seems to whip up fine and goes on the skin just fine.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to process this yet, but it&#x27;s the real deal at a great price for so much!</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine however , it came with No instructions, and NO PACKING SLIP.</li>
            <li> I am super pleased</li>
            <li> Very soft and good for making my magnesium shea butter lotion.</li>
            <li> It softens really nicely and whips down great.</li>
            <li> Thanks love it!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping so far its great</li>
            <li> Oh this is a wonderful lip balm butter, just be very careful when heating Shea since it tends to get grainy if heated up too quickly.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Such great Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> The shea butter was not as smooth as I was hoping.</li>

            <li> Keeps my skin smooth for hours.</li>
            <li> and we could share in nice price, thanks.</li>

            <li> This is my second order of shea butter, it&#x27;s great for making my whipped body butter.  </li>
            <li> Overall I will happily purchase again</li>
            <li> The best thing that I LOVE about this product is that it is very oily and so soft, it melts fast, and I got A LOT.</li>
            <li> I discarded all the cheap lotions and potions I&#x27;ve bought and am sticking with this shea butter.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing price,and it may be exactly what you are looking for, I&#x27;m just not sure if it is for me or not :D</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I purchased 5 lbs.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter feels so good, my hands are so soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really good product and makes your skin really really soft.</li>
            <li> Good quality, natural product.</li>
            <li> Just good old stinky shea butter.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will be ordering more very soon</li>
            <li> This Raw Unrefined Ivory Shea Butter from smellgood is my new go to for body butters, it may not smell good, but it sure feels good!</li>
            <li> But for me I think the product filled about 4 or 5 mason jars (with gaps), maybe more as I didn&#x27;t put it in the mason jar right away.</li>
            <li> and I was able to get it cleaned up pretty easily</li>
            <li> My batch had more than I need for right now.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Great seller, shipping was fast and item was exactly what I expected, also great pricing.</li>
            <li> product is smooth and clean when heated or just warmed.</li>
            <li> Super pleased came in half the time I thought it would I received exactly what I ordered very good quality for the money!</li>
            <li> I have a small at home soap and body product business, so getting the best bang for my buck is important.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you are making your own creams.</li>
            <li> This was nice and soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> It is and was worth the wait......!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received my Ivory Shea Butter....</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this on my face and hands.</li>
            <li> they weren&#x27;t exactly friendly, but, hey, i&#x27;m not looking for friends - just 5lbs of shea butter,</li>
            <li> It is unrefined; therefore, I have to strain it with cheesecloth, but it is well worth the time and effort!</li>
            <li> I think this is of higher quality than most.</li>
            <li> The packaging was fine and luckily the temperature didn&#x27;t affect the shipping box being soiled.</li>
            <li> this product was rich and sot</li>
            <li> The original shea scent is not covered.</li>
            <li> I got the shea butter about a week and a half after I ordered it, which I thought was very good.  </li>
            <li> Its a great price  for those that don&#x27;t mind the extra step, thanks smellgood for sticking to your word!!</li>
            <li> But other than that I enjoy this product it at a reasonable price and a great product !</li>
            <li> This new batch was everything though I whipped it as soon as I opened the packaging (each pound was in its own bag packaging</li>
            <li> Love that I can make my own body cream with different fragrance.</li>
            <li> Clean and unrefined.</li>
            <li> Also great in hair as a conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and authentic this product is.</li>
            <li> Melt&#x27;s well and feels great on my skin that use to be dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is creamy, fresh, and rubs on easily.</li>
            <li> I love the scent (can sometimes overpower, adjust essential oils accordingly) and the absorption is making my skin feel amazing.  </li>
            <li> I poured the CLEAN shea into jars I had purchased for this purpose.  </li>
            <li> great item and economical too would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to listen to the positive reviews...</li>
            <li> Thanks to you, I won&#x27;t only SMELLGOOD, but look good too!</li>
            <li> Nice texture nicely blends with other butters if desired.</li>
            <li> When I opened up my package the aroma was so pure, I immediately whip up me some BUTTER :)</li>
            <li> I did have to melt and filter the product, but it is awesome quality raw unrefined shea!</li>
            <li> Great product and shipping was as expected</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; also wasn&#x27;t ivory as described but a bright school bus yellow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and thick and smell delicious!  </li>
            <li> This shea butter was full of debris and when I melted it and filtered it there was slimy substance in the bowl.</li>
            <li> it came in a zip lock bag full of debris.</li>
            <li> so i use a sweet smelling cream on my skin to kill the scent.</li>
            <li> I read reviews stating they did not the full 5lbs of butter</li>
            <li> A whole 5lb bag (I had to weigh it to make sure I did receive all 5 lbs of shea butter</li>
            <li> I sent my son back to college with a 1 liter tupperware container of whipped shea butter and he loves it surprisingly.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product I could just take a piece of and mix with oils or whatever, not one I would have to filter then let cool and try to mix.</li>
            <li> The order was packaged OK and shipment was sent in a reasonable time period.  </li>
            <li> it will be much softer and smell better.  </li>
            <li> Wow I&#x27;m feeling enthusiastic about this stuff.  </li>
            <li> You will receive a bag full of chunks and crumbles, which is not a problem, just letting you know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how fast the Shea arrives at my house and the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> I love purchasing from this seller and they are super fast with shipping.</li>
            <li> It smelled great, no shell bits, no mold or any other problems.</li>
            <li> The shea butter came quickly and it was neatly packaged.</li>
            <li> but I have since become pregnant and can no longer tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li> The shea butter melted quickly.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> It has a mild nutty smell</li>
            <li> My entire family love the body butter I make with this product and can not go more than a day without it.</li>
            <li> My Shea butter arrived rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> but that was over quick.</li>
            <li> However I do like it for body lotions and hand creams because it doesnt leave a super greasy residue on your hands.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU VERY MUCH!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd time purchasing this Shea butter from this vender and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered from this vendor and  I have been very pleased with the quality of their shea butter both times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty fabulous.</li>
            <li> and I know I have a good amount for a long time.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter I received was in perfect raw form!!</li>
            <li> My experience with this shea butter was not as great as my previous experiences.</li>
            <li> It should last 2 years, so as long as it does, I am VERY happy.  </li>
            <li> It blended beautifully and the smell is not strong at all.</li>
            <li> There is a pungent, strong odor to it, very earthy.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It cooks beautifully and so far I haven&#x27;t used essential oils.</li>
            <li> The shea butter arrived quickly and smells and feels fresh.</li>
            <li> I did receive exactly 5lbs!  </li>
            <li> Nothing like getting exactly what you wanted/paid for!</li>
            <li> This butter is smooth and soft and can easily melt between hands.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to get back into that, but this was so satisfying and easy to do.  </li>
            <li> Clean and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> but honestly i think that&#x27;s because it pure and natural</li>
            <li> This shea has minimal residue and is high quality, giving all my products a beautiful finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Breaks down very easy Love the quality of it</li>
            <li> Also adding essential oils to this makes it smell amazing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience that straight out of the bag it was smooth and melted on my fingers.</li>
            <li> It was time consuming but worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> Love it, natural is the way to go guys.</li>
            <li> Was not going smelled fresh.</li>
            <li> The product was unrefined and looked good as I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I use this personally for sensitive skin family.</li>
            <li> Better quality than my old eBay supplier.</li>
            <li> i have been making my own shea butter lotions and bodyscrubs and lip products, for the last year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh and for the amount for the price...</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is sooo worth it..  </li>
            <li> I have used the yellow kind before</li>
            <li> pieces was well worth it.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS NOT DIRTY AS SOMEONE POSTED.</li>
            <li> well worth it if you ask me.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the bag, it smelled fresh, nutty and buttery.</li>
            <li> It was packaged well and the shea was not dirty at all.  </li>
            <li> but its worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has a nice creamy color, soft scent, and works very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But also be prepared to keep young and healthy skin, eczema or not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I warm it enough to melt the shea butter, and then mix the oils.</li>
            <li> It smells the same but is more buttery and smooth.</li>
            <li> It shipped pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I received my order quick and it was exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I pure clean product with an earthy aroma of Shea</li>
            <li> I use it to make my hair creme and it feels really good, it mixes in well with the other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it right now because it does wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> I used it right away without processing it.  </li>
            <li> so I used it right out of the box.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> This does not!I received my order right away.</li>
            <li> The price is right</li>
            <li> they were so right.</li>
            <li> and they responded right away,  </li>
            <li> just right for my hair grease.</li>
            <li> is right.</li>
            <li> , we don&#x27;t use it in the shower anymore, but instead use it right after the shower.</li>
            <li> great raw unrefined Shea.  </li>
            <li> Butter Lotion Bar Stick Ingredients (great for feet):&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons raw organic shea butter</li>
            <li> so thats an extra step i have to take, the butter is very smooth and mild scent.</li>
            <li> Clean high quality shea butter!</li>
            <li> Much easier to keep the tub clean that way.</li>
            <li> Its not the most sophisticated packing, but it works and keeps the pricing down.</li>
            <li> The result was a fine oil with a nice nutty scent that becomes solid once it cooled completely.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, exactly 5 lbs.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described, unrefined, pure top grade and SOFT!</li>
            <li> It comes in a plastic sealed package, but will need to be transported to a large ziplock bag, unless you&#x27;re going to use all 5 pounds at once!  </li>
            <li> Soft, fresh, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this amount of shea butter for such a low price.  </li>
            <li> I mixed it with coconut oil, sesame oil, vitamin E and added essential oils to mask its scent and it works great.</li>
            <li> I will take cheap packaging to keep the price low, although I am upset I cannot find it with free shipping any longer.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and you can easily apply it.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I purchased 10 lbs to make body butters, deodorant and many other things!</li>
            <li> While I had originally planned on making only whipped shea butter, the smoothness of the butter after filtering is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Some people who gave it good reviews talked about a little bit of a smell.</li>
            <li> but it was more than enough for me.    </li>
            <li> +... will most definitely purchase from Smellgood again!</li>
            <li> I used my glass Pyrex bowl and placed it over a pot of boiling hot water, melted it, filtered it through a strainer with a pieced of cheesecloth in the strainer.</li>
            <li> This has a funny smell to it.</li>
            <li> It has a funny chemical smell and it burns my skin when I apply it.</li>
            <li> Very please!</li>
            <li> This was the first time that I ordered the ivory colored</li>
            <li> It is exactly as the manufacturer describes.  </li>
            <li> My dad was pretty concerned, thinking it was drugs or something.</li>
            <li> As the title says, this product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Per the video, melt shea butter on VERY LOW heat, stirring until it is all melted; you should be able to see your spoon through the shea butter when it is all melted.</li>
            <li> In fact, I just ordered ten pounds this time, instead of five, so I can make a lot more of my products.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> this was my first time ordering from this seller</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely looooooooooove this product!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more next week👍!</li>
            <li> I weighed the package and it was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> this seems to be the only thing that helps,  I love it.</li>
            <li> I the product even after processing so be aware when you purchase.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> it absorbed into the skin really well.</li>
            <li> This is exactly as the seller states it is.</li>
            <li> White from what I can tell is what rises to the top when boiled.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> The product received was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the service!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy  more of this stuff.</li>
            <li> As shea butter can be quite expensive, the price is a wonderful value.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time to purchase shea butter, so I&#x27;m a novice here.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ordered this Shea Butter from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and I have more than enough butter now.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I would order more when I get low on it</li>
            <li> It was exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> In two weeks exact.</li>
            <li> I have whipped this with essential oil and was pleased with results.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought from them and I love their shea butter.  </li>
            <li> then all of the bags were put into a bigger bag together, it was ok for me</li>
            <li> I did not have debris in mine and it weighed 5 lbs exactly.  </li>
            <li> I plan on making a whipped shea butter concoction for my hair, so I have more than enough.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try unrefined shea butter for the first time.</li>
            <li> My Shea butter was exactly what was discribed, the delivery was prompt, its not filtered</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> After adding essential oils it smells better.</li>
            <li> just received my order 5lbs exactly ..</li>
            <li> I received a large &amp;#34;brick&amp;#34; of (soft- easily cuts with knife)</li>
            <li> When it cools to room temp I have a very luxurious solid but soft cream-like material that spreads so smooth and easy!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was of extremely high quality.</li>
            <li> this is the real deal right here.</li>
            <li> It has an earthy aroma that is not particularly welcoming, but not offensive either, and it&#x27;s very easy to disguise.</li>
            <li> I have used pure Shea butter for ten years, and I bought this 5 lb package as the price is better</li>
            <li> It does make nice body butter and other homemade products.</li>
            <li> Clean up with rubber spatula and paper towels making sure to not get any of the shea butter cream down your sink.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the Shea was great, the only downfall was that it required more filtering; there were still shell pieces in it and some other various debris.</li>
            <li> Soft with no need to clean...</li>
            <li> It was soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Be prepared to clean the tub often and wash clothes and sheets frequently.</li>
            <li> I was actually not expecting so much and had to buy some more mason jars.</li>
            <li> Overall, for the price even if its not the nicest of Shea butters, the amount you get is such a good deal you cant pass it up.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is soft and turns to a nice cream when warmed and mixed.</li>
            <li> It was a lot of hard work for something that wasn&#x27;t as good as what costs much less, but it was a fun experience and made a ton (literally, I had so many jars full of this stuff) of christmas presents.</li>
            <li> I made my first batch I used half Shea and  three guarters coconut oil, and a nice splash of E.V.O.O.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive</li>
            <li> Exactly as described fast shipping</li>
            <li> fast on time delivery and exact</li>
            <li> your looking for true Shea butter with all the healing &amp; natural benefits it has, than purchase this.</li>
            <li> I want to take full advantage of Shea butter&#x27;s natural vitamin A and E, so I took my chance with this unrefined Shea</li>
            <li> Melted down nicely with no residue in it.</li>
            <li> The color is outstanding and the smell is &#x27;correctly shea&#x27; a little sweet and nutty; not offensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little more nutty smelling than I anticipated, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I have bought shea butter a few times from other sellers and I must say that this is the absolute best I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Super soft and hydrating.  </li>
            <li> I like the soft texture and mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> this mixed easily and maintained the effects i was looking for</li>
            <li> Make sure everything u use is dry.</li>
            <li> had such a strong smell</li>
            <li> When mixed, it almost smells as strong as plado..</li>
            <li> You need something solid with a large opening that is easy to scoop out.</li>
            <li> pure and smoky</li>
            <li> Also received large amout of the shea butter.</li>
            <li> pure, filtered, unbleached cosmetic grade beeswax pastilles</li>
            <li> I could not imagine what kind of mess I would receive if it came on a day where it was over 100 out.</li>
            <li> but none the less overall great product.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the effort you put into your packaging to make sure my butter doesnt dry out while in transit to me.</li>
            <li> I am an avid vegetable/herbal gardener and blend the shea with  other oils and my homegrown herbs to produce lovely aromatic hair/body delights.</li>
            <li> I know it seems extreme to stir for 1.5 hours until the pot is cool, but the solidified shea butter I got after this was SMOOTH and CREAMY.</li>
            <li> Always use the lowest heat setting with a double broiler and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and</li>
            <li> it was a great deal, the quality was terrific however the packaging was a little messed up.</li>
            <li> Use a towel to pick up hot jar and gently pour  into clean 2nd jar, add about 1-2 ounces of liquid oil, I use jojoba or hemp, and pin prick 4(or 1 for every 8 ozs)-1000</li>
            <li> This does have a strong shea smell to it (as does ALL raw, genuine shea butter)</li>
            <li> Real Shea butter.</li>
            <li> real Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not going to smell like what you buy in walmart , that has fragrances added &amp; it&#x27;s junk.</li>
            <li> I use it to make shea butter cream which is very softening to the skin.  </li>
            <li> It is ready to use anytime I make a cream or lotion.  </li>
            <li> I purchased 5lbs for $12, which yielded six-16 oz containers after being refined, and Whole Foods is selling 7oz of 100% Shea for $10.99 and the 2oz container for $8.99.  </li>
            <li> There was not that much debris in it.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> It is very inexpensive compared to re-processed products.  </li>
            <li> You are getting the real thing.  </li>
            <li> It arrived very promptly.  </li>
            <li> It worked really well in the body butters that I make.</li>
            <li> I received it fast.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated the link provided by the company.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> processing, I mixed in some olive oil, coconut oil, and a bunch of unscented cheap lotion from cvs.</li>
            <li> I ended up with a very grainy shea butter afterwards once it solidified.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li> I knew I should get it as fast as I could - before it was all gone.  </li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to purchase this product</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> The jars are much easier to organize and manage than a lumpy and bulky 5 lb.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to melt more product than your jars can hold.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting such a moisturizing butter since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> and I really like that one</li>
            <li> I put the whole shea butter in a metal bowl and then placed the bowl over the pot.</li>
            <li> Worked really well.</li>
            <li> It was a lot more product than I expected.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING, AND IT DID NOT COME IN JUNKS AS</li>
            <li> GO FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY</li>
            <li> I used it for bath &amp; body products I make, as well as straight out the box.  </li>
            <li> It was very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> This company shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Very affordable for the amount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ivory color butter, has a light natural scent, melts well and doesn&#x27;t have many impurities, just a few</li>
            <li> it only took 5 mins until it was perfectly smooth .</li>
            <li> really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this shea butter.</li>
            <li> It makes my shea mixtures creamy, smooth and white depending what oils I mix in it when I run out I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I chose not to refine much of it.</li>
            <li> It came in a plastic bag, which didn&#x27;t really bother me.  </li>
            <li> I would really like to thank the vendor who provides this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I had went away and my skin as a whole looks healthier.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived earlier than scheduled, packaged well and secure.</li>
            <li> My skin has really suffered from the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;The package</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Much easilier</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling real moist.</li>
            <li> Now I wonder if the product I ordered before from another company was really Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The smell is very nutty, but it does smell like shea butter.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve gotten used to having it on the sheets, and it really doesn&#x27;t make any difference.</li>
            <li> And shipping was fast</li>
            <li> light oil (like almond, jajoba or olive)&lt;br /&gt;Optional: 10-30 drops of essential oils of choice&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> Better quality than I had expected, works well for hand creams.</li>
            <li> but I really do like it</li>
            <li> I make my own lotion and for several years went to the local beauty supply store to purchase my Shea Butter ...</li>
            <li> I love it, been use it a very long time, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy to cut with butter knife into long rectangular shapes to add to lotion bottles or anything.</li>
            <li> After about 6 weeks, I noticed I can now easily stand and walk after sitting for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited that it felt like opening a Christmas present; however, upon opening the package, I realized I did not receive the item for which I paid -</li>
            <li> The scent is nutty like some other people said but not awful.</li>
            <li> Your Shea Butter is cleaner, softer and overall higher in quality ... not to mention the better overall price.</li>
            <li> This is better than other Shea butters I have bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like having to melt it to clean it so extensively-</li>
            <li> Weight is usually always right on the money or slightly more.  </li>
            <li> And it smells like these really sweet gross earthy nuts</li>
            <li> Once the POT was cool to the touch, I poured the shea butter into my containers, stirring each individual container until there were no bubbles.</li>
            <li> I leave a jar in my locker at the Y and never have any problems with it, gets soft in room with hot tub, but not liquid.</li>
            <li> Just place a teaspoon full in your hands, rub your hands together for a second or two and spread to all areas needing help.  </li>
            <li> to fridge and let cool another 1 hour or until starting to harden but still somewhat soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> cool for several hours or overnight.</li>
            <li> cool for several hours or overnight.</li>
            <li> it self works good, smell was not good at all.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more Raw Unrefined Shea Butter from smellgood very soon, and I recommend that you do too!</li>
            <li> I immediately inspected it when I got it to make sure that the color, texture and smell were consistent with raw, unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li> Way better than any garbage, watered down version that one would buy from bath and body works or the cvs or walgreens.</li>
            <li> If you plan on melting it down I would recommend weighing the amount you are going to melt to make sure you have the correct amount to fill your jars.</li>
            <li> Let the tubes sit undisturbed for 20 minutes to cool and set (leave any spill-over temporarily undisturbed – it is not worth trying to wipe it off right now).&lt;br /&gt;After your balm has cooled and set, it is ready to go</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I have to process these, but I just added chucks of them to my other hand lotions (you have to - they smell &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; otherwise) and they work just fine; and they&#x27;re soooo inexpensive compare to the ones they sell on tv, which btw aren&#x27;t pure shea butter anyway</li>
            <li> Both products are the real deal and it is a relief to find a new supplier.</li>
            <li> For a smoother lotion bar stick, use less beeswax and more coconut oil or olive</li>
            <li> For a smoother lotion bar stick, use less beeswax and more coconut oil or olive oil.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly and in a mostly solid block with crumbles, I didn&#x27;t get a chance to weigh it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make a lot of super products from this and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly as a hair product</li>
            <li> I still have a good amount left and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> and will definitely order more in the future.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely buy from this seller again, and I would totally recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> The main thing is that the mix should be about 2/3-3/4 shea butter.</li>
            <li> This product is so soft in texture and smell that it does not take much to cover your whole body in it.  </li>
            <li> Very soft!  </li>
            <li> when  fluffy, do this quickly as the mixture will begin to solidify when cool.  </li>
            <li> I had no intentions of creating products for other people, I did it for the sole purpose of custom making something that suits my own particular needs and preferences.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> It is a high quality butter I and use it in my homemade body butters</li>
            <li> High quality.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and this seller!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> The product was of high quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is fine but could have come in a much smaller plastic bag then it was packaged in to avoid getting the butter on my arms by reaching into such a large buttered plastic bag.</li>
            <li> This is natural, it shouldn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;, but some expect a certain scent that lotions w/ Shea have &amp; that&#x27;s not this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up with 5 lbs of butter for a little more than I paid for 1 lb.  </li>
            <li> it melts down faster than chocolate, almost as fast as butter, so don&#x27;t leave it alone long at all on the stove top!</li>
            <li> Thanks soo very much, I would only receive an 8 oz.jar in my town, for the price of your product.</li>
            <li> Works awesome with Raw African Black Soap for acne scars.</li>
            <li> You really need to do your research about natural Shea, the color, smell, where it&#x27;s from, grades etc.</li>
            <li> It arrived well packaged, soft and ready to use.  </li>
            <li> This shea butter is soft and I really didn&#x27;t need to add anything</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using Shea butter on a regular basis, it is definitely worth purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t smelled fresh shea in awhile since I had been taking months to use up my whipped and mixed supply on hand.</li>
            <li> but that might be normal.</li>
            <li> I have a rare form of psoriasis and both products are essential for  my functioning!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be ordering from here again as long as the shipping will be better the next time .</li>
            <li> Because I wanted to preserve as many nutrients as possible, I used the double boiler method instead of placing the product directly in a metal pot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is NOT hard butter, I never knew there was a soft/hard shea butter, so if you are using it to make body butters, be aware that it will absolutely change the texture of the final product</li>
            <li> We live  in&lt;br /&gt;the high desert region just south east of Reno, Nevada.</li>
            <li> As soon as it turns opaque, not hard, shake vigorously.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, other than the earthly smell that was a bit stronger than I anticipated, this is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> When I saw 5 pounds, i got really excited, but I read some reviews about how it was not really a lot.</li>
            <li> Otherwise you most likely will get a different nut butter that cost way less &amp; has none of the Shea properties , or a refined low grade , cosmetic grade Shea that is the &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; left over after making true Shea or just cheap crap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have been living in the same place for over 3 years now, and have ordered many things off Amazon and other sites most items were sent my UPS or Fed X. Of the few things that were sent by the USPS</li>
            <li> Love this raw unrefined ivory Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I love that it is raw and unrefined.  </li>
            <li> The product was just as they described, I use it on my super dry skin</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t open it and expect it to look nice and fluffy like the body scrubs and stuff those have been refined and whipped.</li>
            <li> I purchased this butter for the main reason that it was soft.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to any smells.</li>
            <li> Just melt it in a pan, do not get it hot, just barely melted, add about 1/6 or so liquid oil such as olive oil or almond oil, whip it up with an eggbeater when it begins to cool, and add essential oil drops to your preference when whipping.  </li>
            <li> On processing, ( heating gently with constant stirring to 170-180F for 15min and filtering there was minimal fine dust/ sandy grit and rapid cooling).</li>
            <li> the seller is VERY willing to answer ANY and all questions--I emailed questions left, right and center on what to do with it, how to store it, how to filter it, will bugs bother with it, etc.  </li>
            <li> That was pretty gross.</li>
            <li> The invoice was inside of the first bag, the shea butter inside of the second bag.</li>
            <li> I purchase Shea butter in bulk on a regular due to using it in most of my soap products and whipped butters</li>
            <li> and it made my hands sooooo soft!</li>
            <li> Today I made my first batch of body butter with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I have ordered bulk shea butter from different locations online, and this is the first time I have ordered from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got within a few days, which was great (earlier than I had expected)!  </li>
            <li> containers.&lt;br /&gt;i filled 3 and half of them up.</li>
            <li> Either way this &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; is not raw.</li>
            <li> have given this concoction to friends and co-workers and I am hoping they will experience the same positive results.  </li>
            <li> It melts quickly in my hands, very soft scent &amp; blend well with other oils</li>
            <li> I did check the weigh after reading other reviews and seeing some people shorted, but I received the full 5 lbs.  </li>
            <li> I got the full 5 lbs with mine, no shorting like a couple other reviews said.</li>
            <li> The product lasted a long time and I still have some, although that might be due to the fact I haven&#x27;t been able to continue making lotions, and hair creams for a while.</li>
            <li> My shipment did not arrive in tiny crumbles as some have stated - instead, 3 or 4 large chunks.  </li>
            <li> It was in a large plastic bag with a descriptive label on the outside.</li>
            <li> Butter is in large clumps, not one solid mass.</li>
            <li> It is soft, light in color and very mild in scent so adding essential oils for scent uses less than other shea butters I have tried.  </li>
            <li> But the price is low &amp; your getting a lot of the real thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one big block, and you just pull off a chunk of how much you want.  </li>
            <li> use this in a lot of natural products like lotion.</li>
            <li> Was shipped in a white &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; plastic grocery bag, but for the price i can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received my shoe box sized shea butter.</li>
            <li> Very greasy and last for about three hours.</li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t as soft or glowy looking as</li>
            <li> Just pay the extra money for the real thing.</li>
            <li> This is really soft Shea Butter as in the description.  </li>
            <li> We use it in soap, directly apply it to skin where it melts from body heat.  </li>
            <li> Natural Health and Beauty</li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> Natural.</li>
            <li> The unrefined butter is interesting to say the least</li>
            <li> The only real problem I have with it is the hair moisturizer I make with</li>
            <li> 100% all natural shea butter.</li>
            <li> This butter is so creamy and soft.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is so soft that you can use it by itself.</li>
            <li> So far, this has been the richest and creamiest shea butter I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft, doesn&#x27;t stink .</li>
            <li> my hands were SO SOFT</li>
            <li> I am a frequent buyer of this shea butter...</li>
            <li> I use it on my natural hair and my skin.</li>
            <li> Made my hair and skin really soft.</li>
            <li> The difference between what I purchased in the beauty supply store and through you is so far apart.</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised with the amount received.</li>
            <li> bag of unrefined shea butter, in chunks and with some natural discoloration.</li>
            <li> Now that I know what to expect, the next time I order I will leave it as is in chunks and store it in glass jars until ready to use.</li>
            <li> I added a lot of essential and fragrance oils and the smoke smell still is a bit much for me.  </li>
            <li> Soft smell but</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> And it makes my skin feel so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I love the product I received, it was exactly what I expected it have some grains on a small portion</li>
            <li> This does take a considerable amount of time..</li>
            <li> I have probably used up nearly 2 pounds already, in just a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We use it daily to really fight off winter dryness.</li>
            <li> old norwegian/swedish skin needs.  </li>
            <li> Smooth as firm butter!!!!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Soft.</li>
            <li> I use this in a 4 ingredient all natural lotion I make.  </li>
            <li> I have not used unrefined shea butter before but had no trouble.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in lotions and soap so far.</li>
            <li> I had to turn it only a few times to make sure all of it melted.</li>
            <li> It does have an earthly smell, but I just add a few drops of essential oil and it make it better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so appreciative to access this product without all of the additives and unnecessary manufactured reconstruction.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for providing with such a fantastic raw material to make my scented moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> BUT that is kind of to be expected since this is a extremely raw product.</li>
            <li> I use Shea Butter on it which not only moisturizes my skin, but when used in regular intervals (in addition to my medicated skin cream), it cuts the normal intensity of the condition and restores the color of my skin much faster.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In a double boiler or glass bowl, combine all ingredients except essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;Bring to medium heat and stir constantly until all ingredients are melted.&lt;br /&gt;Remove from heat and let cool slightly.&lt;br /&gt;Move</li>
            <li> They called back promptly multiple times as I missed their calls at first.</li>
            <li> I think I have finally found Shea that will be the same consistently with each order.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(doesn&#x27;t come as a solid block, but as many small pieces).</li>
            <li> Means is a little cool</li>
            <li> It smells slightly smoky,has a smooth non-oily feel and the color is not WHITE but beige.</li>
            <li> They even included a really substantial coupon to use on my next purchase which I will be doing in the near future.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> This shea butter stinks, and not in the warm nutty way that raw shea butter naturally smells like (which I love) but in a rancid play-doh type of way.</li>
            <li> I live in ohio and my husband took it outside and stirred for about 20 minutes in 34 degree temps and it started to solidify.</li>
            <li> Since the only way I could figure out if I did in fact get 5lbs, was to weigh myself on my regular bathroom scale (127.2) and then weigh myself while holding the whole bag of shea butter (132.2)...</li>
            <li> No foreign materials nor smell.</li>
            <li> Has small debris thats easily removed once melted on low heat.</li>
            <li> So far I have made body butter and deodorant with my raw shea butter and it was a total success!</li>
            <li> actually I just ordered some black for the first time and now eagerly awaiting its arrival, they now have a customer for life if they continue to provide high quality products at unbeatable prices..</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and lasts you a very long time!</li>
            <li> I also use it as an all-around moisturizer (including face...great for dry skin!)</li>
            <li> It did come in a more yellow tint and their was a slight odor, but that seemed to be expected from some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> I had to literally blow dry the Shea butter to get it melted which resulted in a huge oily mess and</li>
            <li> and I have a daughter of 14 months that use to get bad diaper rashes this also great for diaper rashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to any buyer, but if you really care about it being white maybe confirm with the different sellers before you buy and figure out which one can guarantee it.</li>
            <li> Granted no shea butter smells like daisies and this wasn&#x27;t FAR off from regular shea smell</li>
            <li> Because of my diminishing math skills I had not mentally estimated what five pounds would look like.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin supple and soft especially my feet.  </li>
            <li> and I am extra soft</li>
            <li> It has so far, I only use a couple ounces per 2 lb.</li>
            <li> my batch wasn&#x27;t soft enough to just whip by itself.</li>
            <li> wow I will be back and tell others about you</li>
            <li> I found an old double boiler at a thrift store that I use for skin products</li>
            <li> I found an old double boiler at a thrift store that I use for skin products</li>
            <li> when compared to other Ivory Shea butters that I have purchased for other suppliers; however,  I would definitely recommend the product and will be more than likely placing another order.</li>
            <li> arrived earlier than expected and was exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I used this product after the return window (my own fault).</li>
            <li> Using a 2nd jar, rubber band a double layer of cheese cloth around the top with a slight depression in center(I use the empty coconut oil jar sometimes).</li>
            <li> No matter; a little goes a long way &amp; it was well worth the price!  </li>
            <li> I have only used it straight so far but want to blend it with other butters.</li>
            <li> Look and smell just like the butter I get from organic creations for a higher price and less product.</li>
            <li> It did need a little more refining like they said but just a little bits of nut shells in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to this shea butter stuff, so maybe the black stuff is normal..</li>
            <li> Used it to make whipped butters and blends really well with other oils.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it matter that much which of the other oils I use.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel soft all over and soothes dry winter skin like no other!</li>
            <li> No dry skin even though I live in a dry winter climate.</li>
            <li> It was one large block, very soft and creamy with very little debris.  </li>
            <li> I also used no heat to mix some of this product using an old regular mixer, with some mango butter and essential oils</li>
            <li> When mixed with othr oils to make hand cream, the result is a soft, creamy yellow hand cream that works wonders!</li>
            <li> The outer ship box though was a little too lightweight and was pretty beat up by the time i got it.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little grainy at first but melt as you rub it in.</li>
            <li> but nothing major I simply shaved it...</li>
            <li> Everyone in the house uses shea butter and it was hard to find a large enough amount that was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Since starting my business I generally buy in bulk.  </li>
            <li> When it finally melted (it took a while to melt 5 pounds in low, low heat), the shea butter was so clear</li>
            <li> You will probably have to pick out some small particles, but it&#x27;s worth it for the price and grade.  </li>
            <li> All over the box, a BIG HUGE MESS!!!</li>
            <li> My hair stays soft and my skin does not get dry like it used to.</li>
            <li> The double bags have helped me to ensure that the product does not dry out while using.</li>
            <li> You could easily use it raw rather than melting it down to filter it out.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time I bought raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> is if it melts a little and re-hardens You may find it is a different texture sometimes with chunks after so keep it secret and keep it safe!</li>
            <li> The product comes in a large bag, which is a little big and bulky to find a place to store it.</li>
            <li> (I am lucky enough to have an extra frig) and it lasts for up to at least 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which is exactly what I expected, and other peices were a dingy brownish almost greenish color.</li>
            <li> This is an unbelievable price for raw unrefined top grade shea butter.</li>
            <li> I received a hard yellow chunk that was underweight and returned, and another old hard chunk that was underweight most recently.  </li>
            <li> Raw, Dirty-you have to heat/strain/clean if using for commercial or otherwise, color is true, natural odor-not offensive, a little will go a long way-very oily.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first on rather or not I should buy this product, It arrived at my house in a timely manner, however when I received it was totally melted and a huge mess (EVERYWHERE).</li>
            <li> ...use a wide mouth canning jar, fill 1/2 coconut oil and 1/2 shea butter...put in a crock pot, cover with a loose lid, jar not pot to keep out any dust or moisture, leave on high till is all melted.</li>
            <li> I also found the smell to be mild compared to some other shea butters I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Like a couple other reviews said it came in a loose plastic bag (not grocery normal packing but not sealed) then wrapped in cling wrap inside of that.</li>
            <li> large pieces and small.</li>
            <li> in small and large chucks.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, because the stuff I got smelled so strong like melted/burning plastic and smoke, that I couldn&#x27;t keep the bag open for long or the whole house would smell.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how much I use to spend on a small tub of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> it would last me a long time.</li>
            <li> This will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase as long as the quality stays the same.</li>
            <li> : I found out from a friend that you can put these in freezer proof 1 gallon bags and stuff them in the freezer so they&#x27;ll last a really long time.</li>
            <li> good but a little dirty</li>
            <li> This will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> This will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> negatives I see so far is the fact that I did pay for shipping which was half my order.</li>
            <li> My naturally dry skin only aggravates the condition.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if it would be the same as I normally order, but it was.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a hot mess, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I mix on low heat(always double boiler) with coconut oil and other oils/essentials.  </li>
            <li> Since I plan to use this on my very very dry skin, I will update later!</li>
            <li> Well worth the trouble to buy this raw butter at unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> It was a little over 5 lbs, soft and does not need filtering at all.</li>
            <li> like the grade of the product normally i buy it solid and hard to mix.</li>
            <li> This is GENUINE shea butter - not that fake stuff that some people try to peddle.</li>
            <li> I mixed the whipped shea butter with organic dark patchouli oil from www.edenbotanicals.com and lavender and peppermint essential oils from Wegmans.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s usually used with essential oils or herbs to cut that scent it has naturally.  </li>
            <li> Well with it &amp; it lasts a long time!!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> It came earlier than it was expected because they shipped it the day after I placed my order.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The shea butter arrived 10 days after placing the order, rather long time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s what I expected but don&#x27;t be fooled by the creamy white pic</li>
            <li> and I mean right out the bag nothing else poured into the bowl I even considered not adding any other oils</li>
            <li> I thought maybe melting it down would help, plus an entire bottle of lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> This was short by wright and not pure.</li>
            <li> I received this in a sketchy looking white box and when I opened it, it was this white mess in greasy chunks.</li>
            <li> It was exactly 5lbs and in a solid block only a few broken big chunks.  </li>
            <li> I tried other shea butters from different sellers, but I prefer this one.</li>
            <li> This stuff does have scent but is not the repulsive sent of the other one, nor does it stain clothes with that yellow color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now mix this shea butter with other oils, such as coconut, rice bran, and walnut oils.</li>
            <li> The plastic bag had a note attached stating that this was a raw product and may have natural impurities and that they suggest refining before use.</li>
            <li> Just received my raw unrefined Ivory Shea Butter, it was ivory and soft as stated.  </li>
            <li> I mix this with raw cocoa butter, extra virgin coconut oil, vitamin E, a few bulk supplements and essential oil(s) of choice and the outcome is a creamy, soft, nourishing lotion that my skin just drinks in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it in my hair when it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this for children with dry skin.</li>
            <li> My  mom has really dry skin</li>
            <li> I used this for my extremely dry skin problem, also since I wanted to stay away from all petroleum products because seriously who wants to apply gasoline to their skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonder on my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> My heels and elbows used to get so dry they would crack.</li>
            <li> I blended it cold with equal amounts of almond oil, then lightly scented it with 5 drops of [[ASIN:B0019LVG52 NOW Foods Lavender &amp; Tea Tree Oil, 1 ounce]] per every 4 oz of cream.</li>
            <li> This used to a good product, but as of late I have been unhappy with what I have received.  </li>
            <li> this low price the extra step to strain out a few bits  and</li>
            <li> However when I opened up the package the shea butter was all broken up, I guess I thought it would be in a solid chuck not broken chunks.</li>
            <li> The butter was not a solid brick like I expected but broken down into many small pieces.</li>
            <li> and I am never going back to conventional lotion, beauty products, what have you.</li>
            <li> I store mine in a rubbermaid container and try to only take out what I am going to use storing the rest in a dark place.</li>
            <li> IIt&#x27;s hard to review a product when I&#x27;m new to making the batches of butters and lotions.</li>
            <li> once I melted it down using the mason jar in boiling water method and added the essential odors it wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> and it has never let Me down the only problem</li>
            <li> Any one with dry, rough, red skin, any dark spots, wrinkles, eczema or psoriasis problems needs this product.  </li>
            <li> It was soft but very firm.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders on dry hands and cracked feet!  </li>
            <li> The mailman left it in my mailbox so it was slightly melted.</li>
            <li> less than the yellow sheabutter.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not sure what the ivory color of shea is supposed to be, but this stuff was a color that I could only describe as yellow, and made me kinda itchy.</li>
            <li> My sister has very dry skin</li>
            <li> Just what I needed as I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry by nature.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I rated the item a 4 star is because it is not a true ivory Shea butter (in color)</li>
            <li> I like keeping my products/supplies organized, and I would recommend others melt down the product to store it in a different empty container, mason jars or empty washed out mayonnaise jars would work well for storage also.</li>
            <li> Its so pungent don&#x27;t even waste your time and money on whipping essential oils in it, it will still have the funky smell with a slight background hint of your essential oil.</li>
            <li> I have not found anything negative about this product so far.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> Mixed it with coconut oil, microwaved it for a few seconds and used it on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stronger than i expected</li>
            <li> I strained it twice, minimal bits of shell or dirt, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Arrived before the expected date and it was in a baggie as I expected.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> I received just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This is unrefined shea butter; it requires some careful melting and filtering before use in anything you might wish to sell or give away.  </li>
            <li> My order was short 3oz; after emailing the seller, I was sent 3oz within a few days.  </li>
            <li> Will last me a few months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unrefined and unprocessed,  and you can tell from looking at it.</li>
            <li> There is some debris in it, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I use to use Vaseline when I was a youngin, then castor oil a few year back.  </li>
            <li> The debris from it being unrefined was minimal.</li>
            <li> I expected it.</li>
            <li> I just mix with the essential oil of my choice and some almond oil and whip with a mixer until it&#x27;s fluffy.  </li>
            <li> I have not used the product yet, but it was delivered as expected.  </li>
            <li> so I expected discoloration</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the texture of the Shea butter, mixed well as a base for my body butters.</li>
            <li> I used chamomile, geranium and orange&lt;br /&gt;Slowly melt all ingredients, except essential oils, down in a double boiler or sturdy glass bowl over a small pan of boiling water.</li>
            <li> I used chamomile, geranium and orange&lt;br /&gt;Slowly melt all ingredients, except essential oils, down in a double boiler or sturdy glass bowl over a small pan of boiling water.</li>
            <li> I ended up melting down it down on low heat in a pan on the stove, I repurposed some of my empty coconut oil jars and poured the liquid Shea butter into them.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so this will last a long time and be a lot cheaper than lotions I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Raw shea butter breaks off in chunks and is firm (although you can find some that is soft).</li>
            <li> Was what I expected based on reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product several times in it&#x27;s raw form.  </li>
            <li> Stores well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it as both a hair and skin moisturizer mixed with a few other ingredients!</li>
            <li> A label was also on it that said it was real, raw shea butter that has not been filtered and that the smell is the natural smell.</li>
            <li> It is definitely unrefined, but there was very little in the way of shells or other foreign material in it.  </li>
            <li> I put it in other containers, no biggie.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappoint that last two orders of Shea Butter purchased were not top grade.</li>
            <li> , I mix this with other skin softening products.  </li>
            <li> Next day u can put in ur small jars or</li>
            <li> then it is extremely close</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten the other order the seller send out to replace my lost or stolen order</li>
            <li> If you mix with coconut oil and other oils/essential oils and heat/whip/cool</li>
            <li> I saw other comments on how it was grainy</li>
            <li> As a couple other reviews said, this is not refined.</li>
            <li> To refine it, simply heat it in a pot, strain it to remove any dirt or small sticks (not that i&#x27;ve seen any sticks in mine, but they could be there).</li>
            <li> Until I make some homemade exfoliating moisture bars, bath bombs, etc, I cannot say anything in reguards to the product in other ways.</li>
            <li> and then strain out all of the dirt, sticks, string, or any other debris.</li>
            <li> One thing that is important, do not add any water base product, such as aloe vera gel, to the mixture</li>
            <li> Even making enough for 7 people I still have approximately 1.5 lbs left.</li>
            <li> This was advertised as &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; but there are several hard spots in what I received.  </li>
            <li> I store it in a tupperware container in a dark drawer to keep it from going rancid prematurely.</li>
            <li> this is the only one I never got, I sent the seller smellgood an email on Saturday night about not getting my item, I did not hear from them until I posted negative feedback today about not getting a response from them about the undelivered package.</li>
            <li> Melted down it came to three quarts, so it will be a shame to throw it out.</li>
            <li> hopefully when I add some oils it will tone it down...</li>
            <li> I wiped down (inside)the plastic bag it came in and put it all over my body.</li>
            <li> I had difficulties with going up and down the stairs and standing up after sitting for a period of time.  </li>
            <li> Plus I can&#x27;t return it because I already melted it down.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any debris in mine as a few other people claimed.</li>
            <li> But anyways, I made it and used it over night even though it smelled terrible, and when I washed it off the next day my skin was pretty soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to ordering from my distribution companies but cheaper and less hassle.</li>
            <li> Has slight smell</li>
            <li> , I seriously started to think it may have been mixed into it.</li>
            <li> They lost two stars because my shea butter had black spots through out the shea butter..</li>
            <li> I noticed that the product was slightly off by 3 oz.  </li>
            <li> Mine had no sticks and less that a teaspoon of debris when I strained it.  </li>
            <li> Lost about a half pound into the bottom of the box.</li>
            <li> I like the Dudu Osun black soap too.</li>
            <li> I had previously ordered the 1lb bag, this time I went fot the 5lbs.</li>
            <li> BTW,  I did some weighing and with what I melted and the remaining amount in the bag, it came out slightly over 5 lbs.  </li>
            <li> No matter what temperature you put this on to melt it, it turns black.</li>
            <li> Mine did not turn black</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t melt or leave a mess in the box...</li>
            <li> I used a hand mixer to mix it, but there were these harder small chunks that wouldn&#x27;t go away every if I tried to press them or crush them.</li>
            <li> Normally shea buter is had and difficult to rub in.  </li>
            <li> While it is soft, it leaves a gritty texture behind (like having sand on the skin), this product RUINED my batch!!</li>
            <li> I keep my shea in a tightly sealed ziplock bag in my frig</li>
            <li> It came in a box and inside was the Shea butter in two plastic bags sealed tight.</li>
            <li> annoying bubbles ayer being whipped because it wasn&#x27;t hot enough</li>
            <li> this was a little funky.</li>
            <li> I was a little stunned.</li>
            <li> When I get a skin cut, I dab on a little.</li>
            <li> Caution to anyone who isn&#x27;t wanting to do a little work to process the shea butter before use in soaps, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> Weight was a little off</li>
            <li> The packaging is a little ghetto but who cares?</li>
            <li> like I lost just a little of it.  </li>
            <li> I strain a little then use the whip/cool process.  </li>
            <li> I had little to no debris in my Shea butter .</li>
            <li> Packaging leaves a little to be desired.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was within the timeframe specified, it wasn&#x27;t crazy fast or anything, typical wait time...</li>
            <li> Next order will be at the very least, 10 pounds.</li>
            <li> It is raw shea, so does have a slight odor.</li>
            <li> I ordered this unrefined shea butter along with their raw black soap.</li>
            <li> but I have been whipping mixtures for a few years and</li>
            <li> I let mine sit for a few months before getting around to it</li>
            <li> I use this butter for few months, my friend and colleague like it as well, smellgood made this item well</li>
            <li> few pieces of dirt,</li>
            <li> I find it stays nice and creamy unless temps get over 90 degrees, but still does not separate or get nasty.</li>
            <li> I put it in two zip-lock (heavy duty)freezer gallon size bags.</li>
            <li> The package arrived smelling heavily of cigarette smoke.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came in a plastic bag tied with a wire bread tie....very messy.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It looked pale green and I was upset</li>
            <li> I am always worried when an item is being sent by the USPS because they always sit the package on the doorstep in plain sight and do not knock or ring the doorbell.</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter for 13 years, and buying it from Whole Foods is very expensive.</li>
            <li> The item was dirty has all sorts of unknown debris certainly not what was expected.</li>
            <li> Attached to the bag containing the shea butter was a note that directed me to their website ([...] if I wanted to learn how to process the raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s raw</li>
            <li> It was raw, ivory, and smelled nutty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to buying the filtered shea butter in the plastic container, but I wanted a raw product to use in my homemade hair and skin butters.</li>
            <li> I got what was advertised: a raw, 5 lb.</li>
            <li> shea butter comes in chunks in plastic bags (not as a block as pictured) and it is raw and unrefined.  </li>
            <li> Raw Unrefined means that the butter has not been filtered and you should melt the butter and strain before using.</li>
            <li> get any dirt or sticks out since it is raw)</li>
            <li> teaspoon organic raw shea butter&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little slow on shipping before Christmas but arrived in time to make gifts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It says you could filter the butter with cheese cloth again if there are debris, but mine had hardly any debris in it that it&#x27;d be a waste of effort to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t smell that bad.</li>
            <li> I have brought from this seller for the past three years and I cannot complain.</li>
            <li> Not d sure if it was 5lbs</li>
            <li> I usually order five pounds of this stuff and use it to make homemade hair and body creams.</li>
            <li> So you can either keep it in the resealable plastic bag or re-package it in small containers if you want.</li>
            <li> I realize I purchased un-refined shea, so that accounts for the small particles of whatever floating around in it.  </li>
            <li> It has some small material in it but nothing of note.  </li>
            <li> Has the appearance of&lt;br /&gt;cookie dough with small bits in it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, smells smoky...contained something that was irritating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am not sure whether or not I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> all of the ingredients in a small sauce pot and put it on the oven on low-medium heat.</li>
            <li> The butter was very firm yet creamy when I touched it.</li>
            <li> The shea butter that I buy in the beauty supply store is expensive and it only comes in very small quantities.  </li>
            <li> (i have been using fake stuff for so long i guess).</li>
            <li> This can be used just raw by itself as well!</li>
            <li> Living out here in the desert climate can really make my already dry skin even worst.</li>
            <li> The only downfall to this was my order was 3 days late!!!</li>
            <li> If I had any complaint, it was that the plastic wrapping stuck to the shea butter</li>
            <li> From the research I have done the butter I used to buy was kpangnan butter which is commonly sold as shea butter</li>
            <li> Shea butter seems like its thick, but it can be used on the face because it doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> it was a tad thick for that</li>
            <li> and it is so much less expensive than my previous 1 lb purchase ($15.99!!).  </li>
            <li> When the process was done as instructed to clean the pro cut became grainy and still had an awful smell.  </li>
            <li> , it was real raw unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li> Real raw unrefined.</li>
            <li> And as long as it isn&#x27;t heated, it shouldn&#x27;t go bad for at least a</li>
            <li> but it was ez to work with and really not all that dirty.</li>
            <li> I only needed like a pound of it, but for the price it was stupid to not buy the 5 lb container.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base for my hair and body mixes and am constantly getting comments about my hair and questions about the products I use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how chunky and broken up</li>
            <li> Decently quality Shea, but shipping is horrible.  </li>
            <li> A bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> I then did some research to figure out where I went wrong.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a lot, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting that, but don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit tedious, but I&#x27;d rather do this myself and get the shea butter at a lower cost.</li>
            <li> What I did smell was so faint.</li>
            <li> weird chemical smell.</li>

            <li> Very bad bad Shea butter, doesn&#x27;t smell like raw Shea butter.</li>

            <li> BAD BATCH-</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed the way that my product was delivered, it was over 100 degrees in Las Vegas when it was delivered and the Shea Butter was leaking out of the package and the plastic:(</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>

            <li> Just initially annoying.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter was filthy</li>
            <li> That was annoying, but whatever.</li>
            <li> This is the base for everything in our house.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> Horrible way to do business</li>
            <li> I was completely disgusted.</li>

            <li> great Shea Butter.  Great deal.  Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic shea butter.  Super soft and hydrating.  It does have an earthy smell, though the men in my family thinks it smells like bacon LOL!  I mix with coconut oil and add some essential oils to cover the bacon smell.</li>
            <li> Real Shea butter. There are many fakes. You really need to do your research about natural Shea, the color, smell, where it&#x27;s from, grades etc. Otherwise you most likely will get a different nut butter that cost way less &amp; has none of the Shea properties , or a refined low grade , cosmetic grade Shea that is the &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; left over after making true Shea or just cheap crap.&lt;br /&gt;This is real Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not going to smell like what you buy in walmart , that has fragrances added &amp; it&#x27;s junk. This is natural, it shouldn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;, but some expect a certain scent that lotions w/ Shea have &amp; that&#x27;s not this.&lt;br /&gt;The benefits are many. The price is great. No fancy container or wrappers. But the price is low &amp; your getting a lot of the real thing. I put it in other containers, no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for true Shea butter with all the healing &amp; natural benefits it has, than purchase this. Well with it &amp; it lasts a long time!!&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality for the price!  I use it to make shea butter cream which is very softening to the skin.  It is very easy to do.  Just melt it in a pan, do not get it hot, just barely melted, add about 1/6 or so liquid oil such as olive oil or almond oil, whip it up with an eggbeater when it begins to cool, and add essential oil drops to your preference when whipping.  Spoon into containers when  fluffy, do this quickly as the mixture will begin to solidify when cool.  Clean up with rubber spatula and paper towels making sure to not get any of the shea butter cream down your sink.  This is a versatile recipe.  You can include some vitamin E oil for extra nutrition to your skin.  One thing that is important, do not add any water base product, such as aloe vera gel, to the mixture or it could cause the shea butter to mold.  You will love this cream!</li>
            <li> softest shea butter EVER!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shea butter!  I use it when making my shea butter body cream.  It works wonders on dry hands and cracked feet!  I&#x27;ve even used it in my hair when it&#x27;s dry.  It doesn&#x27;t make it oily or leave a residue in your hair.  It&#x27;s wonderful to use from head to toe!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Shea Butter and it is so much less expensive than my previous 1 lb purchase ($15.99!!).  Information came with this butter directing me to a Youtube video with instructions as to how to process the butter.  I followed those instructions the day I received the package and now store the butter in the refrigerator. It is ready to use anytime I make a cream or lotion.  It should last 2 years, so as long as it does, I am VERY happy.  I ended up with 5 lbs of butter for a little more than I paid for 1 lb.  If you&#x27;re using Shea butter on a regular basis, it is definitely worth purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this item earlier in 2014. It did come in a more yellow tint and their was a slight odor, but that seemed to be expected from some of the reviews. I didn&#x27;t mind though because the price was the best in comparison to the other choices. The product lasted a long time and I still have some, although that might be due to the fact I haven&#x27;t been able to continue making lotions, and hair creams for a while. But for me I think the product filled about 4 or 5 mason jars (with gaps), maybe more as I didn&#x27;t put it in the mason jar right away. I was actually not expecting so much and had to buy some more mason jars. The product came quickly and in a mostly solid block with crumbles, I didn&#x27;t get a chance to weigh it but it was more than enough for me.    In regards to the odor once I melted it down using the mason jar in boiling water method and added the essential odors it wasn&#x27;t a problem. The odor didn&#x27;t add or take away from the smells. I also used no heat to mix some of this product using an old regular mixer, with some mango butter and essential oils and it came out to be a nice creamy texture that was great for using as a hair mask.    Overall it was a great buy, was very useful for what I needed and the price was amazing for the amount. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to any buyer, but if you really care about it being white maybe confirm with the different sellers before you buy and figure out which one can guarantee it.</li>
            <li> Very soft!  I was able to cut a chuck off with a butter knife.... Works great for a whipped Shea Butter I make for my hair!</li>
            <li> Such great Shea Butter. I have bought shea butter a few times from other sellers and I must say that this is the absolute best I have ever bought. Its smooth and smells wonderful (if you don&#x27;t mind that smokey shea scent)</li>
            <li> Came on time and in great shape. Melted down nicely with no residue in it.</li>
            <li> Great product and shipping was as expected</li>
            <li> I placed my order on June 26, 2013, and received it today - when it was promised.  I was so excited that it felt like opening a Christmas present; however, upon opening the package, I realized I did not receive the item for which I paid - I ordered the IVORY Shea Butter and was shipped the YELLOW Shea Butter.  I emailed the seller - who apologetically responded the same day! - and was told they would send me out another order after the 4th of July Holiday. Yay, great customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, despite the minor mixup, I must say the value for the money is amazing.  I purchased 5lbs for $12, which yielded six-16 oz containers after being refined, and Whole Foods is selling 7oz of 100% Shea for $10.99 and the 2oz container for $8.99.  That&#x27;s a savings of $170+... will most definitely purchase from Smellgood again!</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.  I will order from them again. I used my glass Pyrex bowl and placed it over a pot of boiling hot water, melted it, filtered it through a strainer with a pieced of cheesecloth in the strainer. There was not that much debris in it. I poured it into a glass pan and cut into squares, when it solidified, placed in a container. It was time consuming but worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> great stuff, has a strong smell but honestly i think that&#x27;s because it pure and natural (i have been using fake stuff for so long i guess). Absolutely love it, plan to use it on everything. I have use it as a conditioner on my hair and it&#x27;s great. Mixed it with coconut oil, microwaved it for a few seconds and used it on my skin. Yes the smell is strong but once applied to skin, the smell is gone. Love it, natural is the way to go guys.</li>
            <li> A bit skeptical. This has a funny smell to it. Granted no shea butter smells like daisies and this wasn&#x27;t FAR off from regular shea smell but I have been whipping mixtures for a few years and this was a little funky. I have never smelled rancid shea butter to my knowledge to know by comparison if this was the case. I let mine sit for a few months before getting around to it but I have done that plenty of times before, especially since shea butter has a shelf life of 2 years. It seems to whip up fine and goes on the skin just fine. It didn&#x27;t stink anymore after I melted it and whipped it oddly enough. *shrugs* Still going to use it. I&#x27;ve been telling myself it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t smelled fresh shea in awhile since I had been taking months to use up my whipped and mixed supply on hand.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.  It does not get any better.  It is very inexpensive compared to re-processed products.  My sister has very dry skin and this is a life saver.  You are not paying for fancy packaging and scent.  You are getting the real thing.  I would think it would also make a great base for a product that would be further processed.</li>
            <li> It came in a large block, was exceptionally clean and was a great price!</li>
            <li> UPDATE I just ordered this again twice over the last month or two and quality has eroded.  I received a hard yellow chunk that was underweight and returned, and another old hard chunk that was underweight most recently.  This used to a good product, but as of late I have been unhappy with what I have received.  I am hesitant to try it again. This was advertised as &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; but there are several hard spots in what I received.  I did check the weigh after reading other reviews and seeing some people shorted, but I received the full 5 lbs.  Not too bad for price.</li>
            <li> Clean high quality shea butter!</li>
            <li> Love the shea butter.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products that is made for eczema. I love the texture and what it is doing to help decrease the itching that eczema causes.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter I received was in perfect raw form!! It was delivered in a timely manner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you... will purchase again soon.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me , mix with cocoa butter</li>
            <li> This is perfect I will definitely purchase more. Was not going smelled fresh.</li>
            <li> Yessssss for the money this is great perfect shipped very well to my hot climate.  Didn&#x27;t melt or leave a mess in the box... awesome</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  It comes in a plastic sealed package, but will need to be transported to a large ziplock bag, unless you&#x27;re going to use all 5 pounds at once!  It&#x27;s one big block, and you just pull off a chunk of how much you want.  It&#x27;s creamy and thick and smell delicious!  Works beautifully in my homemade soaps and lotions.  I&#x27;m going to put it on my feet tonight before bed to soften my heels and calluses.  Highly recommend.  Great price.</li>
            <li> This shea butter was full of debris and when I melted it and filtered it there was slimy substance in the bowl. It has a funny chemical smell and it burns my skin when I apply it. Very disappointed in the quality. I did not mind the filtering process however, I just don&#x27;t like the smell and the way it makes my skin feel(tingly). Maybe it wasn&#x27;t tested for dangerous substances before sale. I WILL NOT ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> Product was as promised but took awhile yo be delivered.</li>
            <li> the grade and quality of this shea butter is as advertised.  Very satisfied</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE shea butter. This was a good product. It was white just like pictured. Don&#x27;t listen to the posts that say that shea butter can be yellow. Thats not Shea but a different nut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in a lot of natural products like lotion. I plan on making face cream next. Shea butter seems like its thick, but it can be used on the face because it doesn&#x27;t clog pores. This can be used just raw by itself as well! Its great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks soo very much, I would only receive an 8 oz.jar in my town, for the price of your product. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Perfect! It&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to ordering from my distribution companies but cheaper and less hassle.</li>
            <li> Great results for my skin type. Store bought lotions and creams just don&#x27;t cut it for a brother like me. You can mix it and come up with a mixture that will work for you. Use your imagination. Works great on feet, elbows and hands!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is wonderful.  It arrived very promptly.  I use it for making body butter, hair butter and soap.  I&#x27;ve ordered from this seller before and continue to be very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great, bargain, great product doubled bagged and sealed</li>
            <li> I love it, been use it a very long time, I highly recommend it. work perfect for your skin.</li>
            <li> A little slow on shipping before Christmas but arrived in time to make gifts. Good quality Shea.</li>
            <li> mix it with coconut oil and cocoa butter for daily moisturizer and oil treatment</li>
            <li> Great product, It came looking just like the picture. I will buy again. It works great in my lotion bars. Also adding essential oils to this makes it smell amazing. It works great on the skin.</li>
            <li> Nice product, smelled great. I&#x27;ve used it in homemade body butters and soaps. no problems. A great deal on the product cost and amount that I have found.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first on rather or not I should buy this product, It arrived at my house in a timely manner, however when I received it was totally melted and a huge mess (EVERYWHERE). The plastic bag that was holding the butter just couldn&#x27;t keep it together. The Shea Butter was everywhere. All over the box, a BIG HUGE MESS!!! I am also very sure that I didn&#x27;t get the 5lbs that I paid for. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! I knew when I purchased this product it would be coming in a plastic bag but I never would I have bought it knowing it wasn&#x27;t sealed properly, making leaking possible wasting the product.</li>
            <li> This company was awesome and when my original package did not show (I think it may have even been stolen from my front porch but can&#x27;t be sure) they promptly resent the shipment which arrived practically overnight!  They even included a really substantial coupon to use on my next purchase which I will be doing in the near future. This product is just as I was expecting and will be perfect for my homemade lotions but better yet they made sure I was a happy customer!</li>
            <li> Worth the price, exactly 5 lbs. Ivory creamy lite smell.  Received in a box the shea butter in plastic bag enclosed in another plastic bag. Very please!</li>
            <li> Came in one bag weighed in at just over 5lbs. Haven&#x27;t seen any debris in mine as a few other people claimed. Also mine was one giant block of shea not pieces. either way its good by me. would buy again.</li>
            <li> Was shipped in a white &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; plastic grocery bag, but for the price i can&#x27;t complain too much.  The outer ship box though was a little too lightweight and was pretty beat up by the time i got it.  Product inside was in mostly good shape and was usable for what i needed.  It is raw shea, so does have a slight odor. I will buy the refined next time.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality. Best I&#x27;ve had in a while.</li>
            <li> Love it. When mixed with othr oils to make hand cream, the result is a soft, creamy yellow hand cream that works wonders! Will definitely order this again!</li>
            <li> The product was unrefined and looked good as I expected. It is ok and safe to shop here! Have a successful day.</li>
            <li> It came in a block and it broke up easily its GREAT!!</li>
            <li> perfect coloring texture and absorbs wonderfully !!! thank you</li>
            <li> Because of my diminishing math skills I had not mentally estimated what five pounds would look like. I was pleasantly surprised when I received my shoe box sized shea butter. I have been using shea for years but this is by far the best quality I have ever purchased. I use it as a base for my hair and body mixes and am constantly getting comments about my hair and questions about the products I use. I had no intentions of creating products for other people, I did it for the sole purpose of custom making something that suits my own particular needs and preferences. Now, I am getting orders none stop, what in the world ???? Ahh well, glad people like it and I&#x27;m happy to do it. I am an avid vegetable/herbal gardener and blend the shea with  other oils and my homegrown herbs to produce lovely aromatic hair/body delights. Very pleased: about to purchase another batch.</li>
            <li> The texture is rather gritty. Don&#x27;t care for that. Once rubbed it well, it melts away. Just initially annoying.</li>
            <li> The shea butter was not as smooth as I was hoping. It was a grainy and also had a smokey smell. The shea butter also irritated my skin. My experience with this shea butter was not as great as my previous experiences.</li>
            <li> This will last me a very long time. Very clean and nice consistency. Love that I can make my own body cream with different fragrance. Never have to buy on streets again</li>
            <li> And I a still using it 8 months later.  I divided the bag into tubs which I keep throughout the house.  Now with the winter season coming on I will be using my Shea butter to protect my skin.  In the summer I used it on my hair and as a tan cream..it interact nicely with the sun causing your skin a lovely brown glow.  It keeps my skin supple and soft especially my feet.  I just love Shea butter!  Way better than any garbage, watered down version that one would buy from bath and body works or the cvs or walgreens.</li>
            <li> Smells like cocoa butter. Very greasy and last for about three hours. Does work well on children though. I recommend this for children with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It was soft but very firm.  This was the first time that I ordered the ivory colored and I am very satisfied.  It did need a little more refining like they said but just a little bits of nut shells in it. It worked really well in the body butters that I make. I only gave 4 stars because i did not receive 5 lb. but only 4.1 lb.  The price was still good.</li>
            <li> It came just as it is pictured.  Virtually not smell and no trash.  I will be purchasing more very soon!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I use this personally for sensitive skin family. I received it fast. I really appreciated the link provided by the company. I will definately order again.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping so far its great, I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Love it. Soft, fresh, and smooth. No foreign materials nor smell. I store it in a tupperware container in a dark drawer to keep it from going rancid prematurely. Would definitely buy again to share with family.</li>
            <li> Kind of smelly, but great price!!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter was filthy it came in a zip lock bag full of debris. I filtered this product and it still made me itch.  I would not recommend buying unfiltered Shea butter</li>
            <li> Excellent will buy again</li>
            <li> Already used up in my soap and body products which my customers LOVE</li>
            <li> Quite pleased with this shea butter.  It is definitely unrefined, but there was very little in the way of shells or other foreign material in it.  The smell is standard shea, but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> No complaints. Clean and unrefined. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have brought from this seller for the past three years and I cannot complain. The shea butter is excellent</li>
            <li> Great quality shea butter!  Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Shea butter comes wraped in cellophane and then that is placed in a glad type bag. This is whipped butter but in solid brick form. Easy to cut with butter knife into long rectangular shapes to add to lotion bottles or anything. This container filled 2.5 quart sized containers.</li>
            <li> arrived earlier than expected and was exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product, I put it in the microwave to melt, easier to use with liquified and I use it from my head to my toes.  Has slight smell but you can add your own preferred scents. Keeps my skin smooth for hours. Best of all, it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It is exactly as the manufacturer describes.  I use it in all of my hair and skin products.</li>
            <li> I love this but the smell isn&#x27;t nice. It&#x27;s stronger than i expected so i use a sweet smelling cream on my skin to kill the scent. Outside of that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> So I bought this not having any idea what the heck I was doing. I just kind of wanted to make my skin softer. I received this in a sketchy looking white box and when I opened it, it was this white mess in greasy chunks. My dad was pretty concerned, thinking it was drugs or something. That was pretty gross. And it smells like these really sweet gross earthy nuts but that might be normal. I dont know.&lt;br /&gt;For processing, I mixed in some olive oil, coconut oil, and a bunch of unscented cheap lotion from cvs. I used a hand mixer to mix it, but there were these harder small chunks that wouldn&#x27;t go away every if I tried to press them or crush them. That was annoying, but whatever. It&#x27;s incredibly greasy, like I dont even know how shea butter lotion works because it doesnt feel or smell anything like what I made. But anyways, I made it and used it over night even though it smelled terrible, and when I washed it off the next day my skin was pretty soft. However, it wasn&#x27;t as soft or glowy looking as when I just put on johnson &amp; johnsons baby oil over night. It was a lot of hard work for something that wasn&#x27;t as good as what costs much less, but it was a fun experience and made a ton (literally, I had so many jars full of this stuff) of christmas presents.</li>
            <li> Love the shea butter it is good moisturizer for body and hair</li>
            <li> Great quality. Clean and exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This shea butter works magic on my skin and hair. My hair stays soft and my skin does not get dry like it used to.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the texture of the Shea butter, mixed well as a base for my body butters. Stores well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This shea butter stinks, and not in the warm nutty way that raw shea butter naturally smells like (which I love) but in a rancid play-doh type of way. It also has the consistency of play-doh, I seriously started to think it may have been mixed into it. Either way this &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; is not raw. Raw shea butter breaks off in chunks and is firm (although you can find some that is soft). This is a processed refined shea butter concoction, do not be mistaken. Its so pungent don&#x27;t even waste your time and money on whipping essential oils in it, it will still have the funky smell with a slight background hint of your essential oil. This &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; also wasn&#x27;t ivory as described but a bright school bus yellow. Even the label said ivory but it was clearly yellow. It&#x27;s just a hot mess, don&#x27;t waste your money. Just pay the extra money for the real thing. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> As the title says, this product was exactly what I ordered. It came earlier than it was expected because they shipped it the day after I placed my order. I was alerted by SmellGood when they shipped my order, and they sent it Priority Mail at no additional cost to me. The packaging consisted of a box and two plastic bags. The invoice was inside of the first bag, the shea butter inside of the second bag. Attached to the bag containing the shea butter was a note that directed me to their website ([...] if I wanted to learn how to process the raw shea butter. I watched the video and was able to process my own shea butter. I ended up with a very grainy shea butter afterwards once it solidified. I then did some research to figure out where I went wrong. As a result, one piece of advice I would give on that: STIR, STIR, STIR. Per the video, melt shea butter on VERY LOW heat, stirring until it is all melted; you should be able to see your spoon through the shea butter when it is all melted. I suggest that you then REMOVE from heat at that point. I put the pot of melted shea butter on a pot holder on the table, pulled up a chair, and using a big wooden spoon, I stirred and stirred for about 1.5 hours until I could no longer see the spoon through the shea butter because the density increased as the product cooled. Once the POT was cool to the touch, I poured the shea butter into my containers, stirring each individual container until there were no bubbles. I know it seems extreme to stir for 1.5 hours until the pot is cool, but the solidified shea butter I got after this was SMOOTH and CREAMY. Well worth the effort for a great product. One final note: if you don&#x27;t like the consistency of your shea butter after you have processed it, re-melt it and try again. That&#x27;s what I did after I did my research and the second try was perfect.</li>
            <li> Excellent product it has a light nutty aroma. Am very happy with my product and the weight was a bit over 5lbs.</li>
            <li> This is really soft Shea Butter as in the description.  It is unfiltered but the quality of the butter is wonderful!  We use it in soap, directly apply it to skin where it melts from body heat.  Also great in hair as a conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Wonderful addition to my solid lotion bars.  Smells great and has a nice texture.  I love this stuff and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Disappoint that last two orders of Shea Butter purchased were not top grade. The smell is bad.</li>
            <li> pure and smoky it&#x27;s really good stuff.</li>
            <li> Loved this shea butter.  I used it to make moisturizer, and I have received nothing but outstanding compliments on the quality of my product.  Thanks for providing with such a fantastic raw material to make my scented moisturizers.  In fact, I just ordered ten pounds this time, instead of five, so I can make a lot more of my products.  I am also adding two more product lines that I am creating with the shea butter.  Next I want to try coca butter, and then maybe mango butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angelia Duenas&lt;br /&gt;Redeemer Natural Health and Beauty</li>
            <li> I like the soft texture and mild fragrance. It was easy to separate so I could share it with friends and family.</li>
            <li> I am still using my shea butter I purchased in 2013...great deal and I am extra soft</li>
            <li> I use this in my Shea body and hair products, always fast deliver, always an excellent product, always professional attitude when dealing with the owners</li>
            <li> I love this butter it was a great deal, the quality was terrific however the packaging was a little messed up.There was a trail of butter from the mailbox to the house. Wasted a bit that I really wanted to use.</li>
            <li> Great stuff at great price!</li>
            <li> Excellent Quality....Great Deal!</li>
            <li> I ordered this unrefined shea butter along with their raw black soap. Both products are the real deal and it is a relief to find a new supplier. I have a rare form of psoriasis and both products are essential for  my functioning! The service was great, delivery was fast, and prices were fair. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I just finished processing this Shea butter. I strained it twice, minimal bits of shell or dirt, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. What does is the smell. A burnt, smoky smell,  and greenish color. I don&#x27;t think it is rancid, I think it has to do with the processing. I had it on my hands while straining, and the smell reminds me of being in a smokers house. Since I use this in body butters, I don&#x27;t know if it will work for me or not.  I plan to let it air out for a while, then try it. Melted down it came to three quarts, so it will be a shame to throw it out. Only time will tell I guess.</li>
            <li> I ordered from seller &amp;#34;smellgood&amp;#34; and the product I received is great and looks just like the photo.  When I need more shea butter, I look forward to ordering from this seller again.  Thank you for the good quality!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Better quality than my old eBay supplier.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter.  It is a high quality butter I and use it in my homemade body butters</li>
            <li> This butter is smooth and soft and can easily melt between hands.</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter for 13 years, and buying it from Whole Foods is very expensive. This is the best! Will buy more soon.</li>
            <li> I use this butter for few months, my friend and colleague like it as well, smellgood made this item well and we could share in nice price, thanks.</li>
            <li> My  mom has really dry skin, I mix this with other skin softening products.  Well packaged, lasts a long time and the instructions on cleaning it are great!  Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li> Good Grade&lt;br /&gt;Very Raw, Dirty-you have to heat/strain/clean if using for commercial or otherwise, color is true, natural odor-not offensive, a little will go a long way-very oily. Will purchace again.</li>
            <li> this was my first time ordering from this seller and i was very pleased&lt;br /&gt;the shea butter was a beige/off white coloring and a bit grainy but&lt;br /&gt;once you rubbed it into your skin it felt great!!!&lt;br /&gt;the packaging lol it was in a plastic bag but i&lt;br /&gt;just transfered everything to those 32oz plastic containers.&lt;br /&gt;i filled 3 and half of them up. all in all the product was good&lt;br /&gt;shipped on time and i will be reordering next i will go for the 10 lbs!!!&lt;br /&gt;whole family uses shea butter in conjuction with the afrcan soap.&lt;br /&gt;very pleased</li>
            <li> Oh My Wow... When I saw the box it came in I was a little stunned. I said ok 5lbs that&#x27;s a lot, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting that, but don&#x27;t get me wrong this is the real deal right here. This stuff is BOMB! I use it for hair &amp; skin. By from them, they won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> white,with out impurities in shea butter, does not need to be processed to make usible. pleasant shea smell, not smokey like some.</li>
            <li> This product came in a timely manner.  It doesn&#x27;t have a lot od debris to be filtered.  However, I did not get 5lbs of butter.  I read reviews stating they did not the full 5lbs of butter so I weighed it as soon as I received it.  I only received 4lbs 14 Oz of butter.</li>
            <li> So far I have made body butter and deodorant with my raw shea butter and it was a total success! I work in the medical field so I wash my hands often hence I use my body butter several times a day and can&#x27;t get enough of it! And since it&#x27;s made with all organic products it can be applied anywhere on your body, from your eyelids all the way to your toes! No worries about any kind of chemicals, Love it! My co-workers love it too so now I have to keep it in my purse or it will be gone by the end of the day! Lol</li>
            <li> The smell blew my mind...I didn&#x27;t like it but It&#x27;s suppose to be unrefined, and I can deal with the smell...hopefully when I add some oils it will tone it down... I gave them three because of the companies communication and shipment was great...They lost two stars because my shea butter had black spots through out the shea butter..I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s dirt or mold or what so that&#x27;s the only reason. I&#x27;m new to this shea butter stuff, so maybe the black stuff is normal.. But good company over all...</li>
            <li> I use Shea butter for my skin and hair. It is a great moisturizer. Not d sure if it was 5lbs I didn&#x27;t weigh it but it is a great value for the price. Didn&#x27;t have to filter it.</li>
            <li> Wow, excellent. I received a huge amount...much more than expected, for a great price. And product was just as described. This will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> This was short by wright and not pure. I returned it. Did not like it.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I NEEDED FOR COOKING</li>
            <li> Great quality arrived on time I&#x27;m very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Love this product! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described fast shipping</li>
            <li> Loved the butter.  Natural. No preservatives.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I make my own body lotion with it and my friends keep begging me to make them some and send it to them.</li>
            <li> like the grade of the product normally i buy it solid and hard to mix. this mixed easily and maintained the effects i was looking for</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed the way that my product was delivered, it was over 100 degrees in Las Vegas when it was delivered and the Shea Butter was leaking out of the package and the plastic:(</li>
            <li> Good product. I still have a lot left over.. fresh :) good condition. Will buy more of this product. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product! It arrived quickly and was of extremely high quality. I make lotions, balms and soaps and wouldn&#x27;t be without having Shea butter. I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> The unrefined butter is interesting to say the least but it was ez to work with and really not all that dirty. The only real problem I have with it is the hair moisturizer I make with it hardens on me when it sits after mixing:/ something I&#x27;m looking into over coming:)</li>
            <li> I absolutely looooooooooove this product! i have been making my own shea butter lotions and bodyscrubs and lip products, for the last year. And it all started with the big box of shea butter i bought from this seller. I want to give them a huge thank you, now i have many friends and family asking me to make them some of my products. This shea butter was a really good buy, i got the most out of my money AND the shea they sell is amazing quality. 100% all natural shea butter. Yes there some remnants of the shells buried within the brick BUT that is kind of to be expected since this is a extremely raw product. I will keep buying from them aslong as they keep shipping my shea brick with the most care.</li>
            <li> Great product. This is my second order. I use it to make skin and hair cream for myself and my family. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering shea butter from different sources to compare quality.  This particular shea is by far the best quality yet!  The color is outstanding and the smell is &#x27;correctly shea&#x27; a little sweet and nutty; not offensive.  It has been melted and cooled correctly and I have had no problems with it feeling grainy.  I am absolutely thrilled with this product and this company.  Arrived before the expected date and it was in a baggie as I expected.  I have ordered from this company before so when I saw this on Amazon... I knew I should get it as fast as I could - before it was all gone.  I keep my shea in a tightly sealed ziplock bag in my frig crisper (I am lucky enough to have an extra frig) and it lasts for up to at least 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product from this company</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to purchase this product but I am so happy I did! I purchase Shea butter in bulk on a regular due to using it in most of my soap products and whipped butters so I decided to try it (great price). I am so happy and pleased with no complaints what so ever. Look and smell just like the butter I get from organic creations for a higher price and less product. It was a little over 5 lbs, soft and does not need filtering at all. I will be ordering more next week👍!</li>
            <li> I have used pure Shea butter for ten years, and I bought this 5 lb package as the price is better and I know I have a good amount for a long time. I use this product on my hands, feet, knees, and elbows. When I get a skin cut, I dab on a little. Helps to speed up the healing.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected. I make my own body butters and use this product in my mixtures. It works wonderfully with coconut oil and everyone who tries it loves it.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent quality shea butter. I will be buying from them again. A whole 5lb bag (I had to weigh it to make sure I did receive all 5 lbs of shea butter and I did!) is almost gone but I have been using it to make several body butters and lip balms. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I love how soft and authentic this product is. It&#x27;s fresh and for the amount for the price...Outstanding!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few pieces of dirt, but it&#x27;s raw so it&#x27;s expected. I am gonna order more for my hair and skin!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, product is great! Pure, unrefined, I use in my homemade soap making and my soap has been turning out wonderful! Will come back when out, this is the best deal out there!</li>
            <li> The shea butter came quickly and it was neatly packaged. The product is smells good and is good quality. I weighed the package and it was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This product came in a box and inside that box was two plastic grocery bags containing the Shea butter. I did weigh the butter and only actually received 3.8 pounds not the 5 advertised. However this was still way more Shea butter then I know what to do with and still an awesome price for so much. The plastic bag had a note attached stating that this was a raw product and may have natural impurities and that they suggest refining before use. I called the company with questions about how to accomplish that. The level of customer service was amazing. They called back promptly multiple times as I missed their calls at first. The butter was not a solid brick like I expected but broken down into many small pieces. I never bothered to refine it and just use it as it is. It feels a little grainy at first but melt as you rub it in. It has a strong smell that was pleasant at first but I have since become pregnant and can no longer tolerate the smell. I&#x27;m sad I can&#x27;t use it right now because it does wonders for my skin. I plan to buy a lavender or peppermint oil to melt and mix so I can continue to use it. I look forward to buying from this company again.</li>
            <li> I did have to melt and filter the product, but it is awesome quality raw unrefined shea! Will order again.</li>
            <li> Awesome, I use shea butter in my all natural Cellulite cream. I tried using refined but it didn&#x27;t give me the consistency I wanted.  So I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is fantastic!! Mine came as pictured and weighs 5.09 pounds-thanks Smellgood!! I&#x27;ll filter it tomorrow, does not look like there is a lot to filter out. I love the smokey smell of it, and it feels great when I rub it into my skin. I&#x27;m positive I&#x27;ll make a lot of super products from this and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> The product was just as they described, I use it on my super dry skin this seems to be the only thing that helps,  I love it.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars however when  I weighed it I noticed that the product was slightly off by 3 oz.  I haven&#x27;t refined it yet, but like the fact that the seller has an instructional video listed.  Hoping that all goes well in the refining process.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product !!! will buy from  them again .Thankyou so much</li>
            <li> This butter is so creamy and soft. I love how beautifully it just melts right on contact with my skin. I made a whipped body butter with this and I am never going back to conventional lotion, beauty products, what have you. I think I am forever a DIYer! Oh this is a wonderful lip balm butter, just be very careful when heating Shea since it tends to get grainy if heated up too quickly. Always use the lowest heat setting with a double broiler and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> Just received my raw unrefined Ivory Shea Butter, it was ivory and soft as stated.  It was exactly 5lbs and in a solid block only a few broken big chunks.  I used it right away without processing it.  So far so good.  It was delivered today I hope that it is easy to process. It was delivered promptly.  If it works out I plan to order again</li>
            <li> Holy cow, this is the best price I have found for this product online. I make my own soaps, and thought if I ordered a 5 lb. bag it would last me a long time. It has so far, I only use a couple ounces per 2 lb. batch of soap. I should be set on Shea butter for quite some time. The product comes in a large bag, which is a little big and bulky to find a place to store it. I ended up melting down it down on low heat in a pan on the stove, I repurposed some of my empty coconut oil jars and poured the liquid Shea butter into them. The jars are much easier to organize and manage than a lumpy and bulky 5 lb. bag. I like keeping my products/supplies organized, and I would recommend others melt down the product to store it in a different empty container, mason jars or empty washed out mayonnaise jars would work well for storage also. You need something solid with a large opening that is easy to scoop out. If you plan on melting it down I would recommend weighing the amount you are going to melt to make sure you have the correct amount to fill your jars. You should be able to figure out how many cups or ounces your jars hold. Be careful not to melt more product than your jars can hold. Great seller, shipping was fast and item was exactly what I expected, also great pricing. Will use this seller again in the future.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and lasts you a very long time!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. High quality.  Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Very soft and good for making my magnesium shea butter lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it to make my hair creme and it feels really good, it mixes in well with the other ingredients.  When used by its self it goes on smooth</li>
            <li> This product smells like cigarette smoke. When the process was done as instructed to clean the pro cut became grainy and still had an awful smell.  There is a lot of dirt I the product even after processing so be aware when you purchase.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this Mango Butter. It melts quickly in my hands, very soft scent &amp; blend well with other oils</li>
            <li> I love this product! Works awesome with Raw African Black Soap for acne scars. Leaves my skin with a beautiful youthful glow. My complexion is the clearest it has been in over 3 years. I don&#x27;t even wear lotion anymore. Just shea butter. You get a lot for your money. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and received it very quickly. Even though it was unrefined it included directions for refining it and it was very simple to refine and had almost no debris in it. I will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying Shea Butter.  It arrived well packaged, soft and ready to use.  We have used it for homemade personal care products with satisfactory results. I will reorder when I need more.</li>
            <li> This was really great for my lotion making it did not have an over greasy feeling and it absorbed into the skin really well. I also found the smell to be mild compared to some other shea butters I have purchased in the past. The only thing is I don&#x27;t know if I would use this for face lotion it was a tad thick for that</li>
            <li> I use this for my diy body butter. The easiest way I have found is like this...use a wide mouth canning jar, fill 1/2 coconut oil and 1/2 shea butter...put in a crock pot, cover with a loose lid, jar not pot to keep out any dust or moisture, leave on high till is all melted. Using a 2nd jar, rubber band a double layer of cheese cloth around the top with a slight depression in center(I use the empty coconut oil jar sometimes). Use a towel to pick up hot jar and gently pour  into clean 2nd jar, add about 1-2 ounces of liquid oil, I use jojoba or hemp, and pin prick 4(or 1 for every 8 ozs)-1000mg vitamin E caps and squeeze into jar, cap jar(use plastic lids, not metal) and set in refrigerator.  As soon as it turns opaque, not hard, shake vigorously. Means is a little cool so jar won&#x27;t break. Shake a lot. Put back in fridge, every time u walk by, shake it again. Leave in fridge over night. Next day u can put in ur small jars or where ever u want. I find it stays nice and creamy unless temps get over 90 degrees, but still does not separate or get nasty. I leave a jar in my locker at the Y and never have any problems with it, gets soft in room with hot tub, but not liquid. Do NOT get water in it. Make sure everything u use is dry.</li>
            <li> Perfect for making home made lotions and soap. The Shea butter I received did not have any dirt or sticks in it so I used it right out of the box. It was a nice but chilly day out when i received this and it had melted some so i will be stocking up on this before summer. I could not imagine what kind of mess I would receive if it came on a day where it was over 100 out. I was not expecting such a moisturizing butter since it was so cheap. A little bit goes a long way so this will last a long time and be a lot cheaper than lotions I have bought in the past. I didn&#x27;t like the smell but with some essential oils it turned out great!</li>
            <li> This is exactly as the seller states it is. Great texture and works well for all my uses. I would definitely recommend this shea butter.</li>
            <li> I Love it!! It is and was worth the wait......!  I was so excited when I received my Ivory Shea Butter.... ..... When I opened up my package the aroma was so pure, I immediately whip up me some BUTTER :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is sooo worth it..  Thank you Smell Goods!</li>
            <li> Good deal. Gonna use this to make handmade soaps</li>
            <li> Nice product I gave samples out to my friends and family and they wanted to buy some.  It was not gritty and smoothed it on my hair and face and legs.  It worked best to hold in moisture after a shower.  It  soothes my sons eczema.  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This product is as described. Just what I needed as I have very dry skin and this seems to be the only thing that works.</li>
            <li> The mailman left it in my mailbox so it was slightly melted. It looked pale green and I was upset untill I did some research. Conclusion, it was real raw unrefined shea butter. It still had bits of the unrefined shea tree nut in it and an earthy nutty smell. I love it! Its great, it melts well, blends well. I use it in ny body and hair. It a great buy and the price is perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this raw unrefined ivory Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I received just what I expected.  Ivory shea butter. large pieces and small. Mine had no sticks and less that a teaspoon of debris when I strained it.  I did go to the website and watch the video.  I received more help from Rebecca on her post on here on how she got smooth creamy shea butter. I live in ohio and my husband took it outside and stirred for about 20 minutes in 34 degree temps and it started to solidify. This is an unbelievable price for raw unrefined top grade shea butter. I will buy from here again. Yesterday alone I made organic deodorant, lotion bars, whipped body butter.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly happy with this product. Delivery was very quick, and it arrived in perfect condition. It has a great consistency, and fits its description to a T. I will definitely be back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I found this seller.  The Shea Butters that I was finding in the stores are just not as good a quality.  This butter comes, just as it is shown.  But mine was in an express envelope, instead of a box.  It is basically, a semi-soft brick of butter that I cut up and placed in 16 oz. containers to see if it was in fact 5 lbs and it was.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is so soft that you can use it by itself. I have used the yellow kind before and I really like that one but this one is softer and feels smother when applied to the skin. I make body creams and also used it for making homemade sunscreen and its works great! I would recommend this butter to anyone who likes using moisturizer on face and body.</li>
            <li> They have filtered this but fro what i can tel nothing else.  Also you may want to know that there is a big difference between &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; Shea butter.  White from what I can tell is what rises to the top when boiled.  I don&#x27;t want mine boiled- killing all the essential nutrients.  Ivory is BEFORE they make the yellow and white kinds.  Pre-processed.  Fells awesome- smells pleasantly nutty not over powering at all to me at least.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter. This is the best I have received from any site on AMAZON. I was very happy with delivery time, quanitity and quality of this shea butter. I was so excited to use this on my face and hands. I think I have finally found Shea that will be the same consistently with each order.</li>
            <li> This is unrefined shea butter; it requires some careful melting and filtering before use in anything you might wish to sell or give away.  My shipment did not arrive in tiny crumbles as some have stated - instead, 3 or 4 large chunks.  My order was short 3oz; after emailing the seller, I was sent 3oz within a few days.  they weren&#x27;t exactly friendly, but, hey, i&#x27;m not looking for friends - just 5lbs of shea butter, so it&#x27;s all good. I&#x27;m pleased with my order and would buy again.  Caution to anyone who isn&#x27;t wanting to do a little work to process the shea butter before use in soaps, lotions, etc. - it&#x27;s a bit tedious, but I&#x27;d rather do this myself and get the shea butter at a lower cost.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I bought raw shea butter. I wanted it to use in soaps and lotions. It came in chunks and pieces that were ivory to cream. I just heated a pot of water. I put the whole shea butter in a metal bowl and then placed the bowl over the pot. The shea butter melted quickly. I had to turn it only a few times to make sure all of it melted. I then poured it through a colander with cheesecloth. The result was a fine oil with a nice nutty scent that becomes solid once it cooled completely. I used some in some goat&#x27;s milk soap. Worked really well. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast! It&#x27;s unfiltered so you may have to filter it to get rid of some of the shells from the shea nut. It was a lot more product than I expected. Enough to last a while! I&#x27;m using it as both a hair and skin moisturizer mixed with a few other ingredients! Great buy and quality!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this amount of shea butter for such a low price.  It&#x27;s quality seems very good. I am using it in soaps and lotions. My order came packed in plastic bags.  This saved money on shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this low price the extra step to strain out a few bits  and pieces was well worth it.  The items description was just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service was excellent.  When I contacted this seller with a question I recieved a reply right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering again soon</li>
            <li> I have wanted to buy Shea butter for the longest time. This one had the best reviews and liked that it said unrefined, pure,and soft. I put it in two zip-lock (heavy duty)freezer gallon size bags. I wiped down (inside)the plastic bag it came in and put it all over my body. I am very sensitive to any smells. What I did smell was so faint.Believe me any scent bothers me. This does not!I received my order right away. It came in a white package wrapped in plastic.There was no debris in it at all. I&#x27;m glad it came in chunks. Much easier to use.I will use it just like it is.I will buy this again !!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the shea butter and the service!</li>
            <li> I used this for my extremely dry skin problem, also since I wanted to stay away from all petroleum products because seriously who wants to apply gasoline to their skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind this is unrefined so there will be some particles in it.</li>
            <li> The quality of the Shea was great, the only downfall was that it required more filtering; there were still shell pieces in it and some other various debris. But once filtered its a wonderful quality Shea.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff real good quality shea butter</li>
            <li> works great in my lotion bars, high quality</li>
            <li> My delivery was no problem and I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> Decently quality Shea, but shipping is horrible.  They out in the system that it ha shipped, but don&#x27;t actually ship it until a week later.  Horrible way to do business</li>
            <li> The price is right *****!&lt;br /&gt;This works great in everything I use it for which is EVERYTHING salves, ointment, lip butters, lotions etc and it has never let Me down the only problem is if it melts a little and re-hardens You may find it is a different texture sometimes with chunks after so keep it secret and keep it safe! I store mine in a rubbermaid container and try to only take out what I am going to use storing the rest in a dark place.</li>
            <li> The product received was exactly as described. Great price value for the amount received. Will last me a few months.</li>
            <li> Love it! Good quality stuff. Weight was a little off but none the less overall great product. I will buy this product over and over again.</li>
            <li> Feels nice. The smell reminds me of a cross between cocoa and play-doh</li>
            <li> Best Shea Butter if this is not Grade A quality then it is extremely close I use this in my products, soap and my hair.  Perfect every ounce of it.</li>
            <li> Blended beautifully into a whipped body butter. Would have gave 5 stars if there hadn&#x27;t been a hole in the bag they shipped it in. Lost about a half pound into the bottom of the box. I wasn&#x27;t going to scrape the residue that was left off the box...</li>
            <li> Very bad bad Shea butter, doesn&#x27;t smell like raw Shea butter. I will not recommend this Shea butte. I have to discard mine cuz the smell was jst so bad</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING, AND IT DID NOT COME IN JUNKS AS SOMEONE POSTED. IT WAS NOT DIRTY AS SOMEONE POSTED. NICE PIECE  AND I WOULD ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> I have ordered shea butter from different companies but i like Atl smell good the best they deliver fresh quality grade A shea butter like they say i love this shea butter its the best and i will be ordering from them again time to go put on my smooth &amp; creamy ivory shea butter bye bye</li>
            <li> The shea butter arrived 10 days after placing the order, rather long time. The butter is cream or ivory colored with mild pleasant nutty smell. There were no visible grit/dirt. On processing, ( heating gently with constant stirring to 170-180F for 15min and filtering there was minimal fine dust/ sandy grit and rapid cooling). Well worth the trouble to buy this raw butter at unbeatable price. If you were using for massaging or soap, I do not think it warrants the processing, but if you are making for commercial venture o gifting may want to consider the extra step.</li>
            <li> fast on time delivery and exact weight,...Thanks love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed the quality of this Shea Butter.  Melt&#x27;s well and feels great on my skin that use to be dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Thank you</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Shea Butter! It smelled great, no shell bits, no mold or any other problems. It softens really nicely and whips down great. I mixed the whipped shea butter with organic dark patchouli oil from www.edenbotanicals.com and lavender and peppermint essential oils from Wegmans. My entire family uses them. I have them all over the house. I sent my son back to college with a 1 liter tupperware container of whipped shea butter and he loves it surprisingly. I will never buy lotion again.</li>
            <li> So far, this has been the richest and creamiest shea butter I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I got within a few days, which was great (earlier than I had expected)!  Great for dry skin and I have a daughter of 14 months that use to get bad diaper rashes this also great for diaper rashes.  A little bit goes a long way.  I was very satisfied with this and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on ordering so much at such a great price! The packaging is a little ghetto but who cares? I certaintly do not. I would rather cheap packaging and a GREAT price than pay an arm and a leg. This shea butter is soft and I really didn&#x27;t need to add anything but I love my whipped shea butter so of course it did great with that. This will help with making my gifts for friends also. I will continue to order from this company!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Shea butter and when I made my body butter it was the best. Will use this seller again!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I used this product after the return window (my own fault). While it is soft, it leaves a gritty texture behind (like having sand on the skin), this product RUINED my batch!! Will not buy again from divineproducts.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product several times in it&#x27;s raw form.  I&#x27;m so appreciative to access this product without all of the additives and unnecessary manufactured reconstruction.  I can melt it and add the fragrances that I want or leave it as it is.  I love the packaging and the rapid shipping.  Thanks for the service!</li>
            <li> good product... i highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> Have been using this product to make homemade body butter. Love it, the results are amazing. I have been putting it on my neck and notice my neck is looking younger. LOL</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is great. I grew up in Ghana and this is all I used growing up. I wasn&#x27;t sure abt the brand when I ordered it but it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s really soft, doesn&#x27;t stink . I use it every day. And I got a lot of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this happen before and I have been living in the same place for over 3 years now, and have ordered many things off Amazon and other sites most items were sent my UPS or Fed X. Of the few things that were sent by the USPS this is the only one I never got, I sent the seller smellgood an email on Saturday night about not getting my item, I did not hear from them until I posted negative feedback today about not getting a response from them about the undelivered package. I am always worried when an item is being sent by the USPS because they always sit the package on the doorstep in plain sight and do not knock or ring the doorbell. I get a text or have to sign if it is sent by Fed X or UPS. It was in the News around Christmas time that people were stealing people packages, and that if it happens and you don&#x27;t have insurance the company does not have to do anything. So just beware if your product says delivered and you don&#x27;t have it the company is under no obligation to refund you or send you another item it&#x27;s just Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********************************************************************UPDATE*********************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten the other order the seller send out to replace my lost or stolen order but before that order came I had already requested a refund through amazon of this item and have been since then refunded. I will say the Shea butter was not what I was expecting, I was thinking it would be like the picture and in a block. Instead it is in bits and pieces inside a sealed plastic bag and on the bag it states that it needs to be filtered of any dirt and debris . I wanted a product I could just take a piece of and mix with oils or whatever, not one I would have to filter then let cool and try to mix. Its a great price  for those that don&#x27;t mind the extra step, thanks smellgood for sticking to your word!! I&#x27;m updating my stars just because of that.</li>
            <li> The scent is nutty like some other people said but not awful. I mixed it with coconut oil, sesame oil, vitamin E and added essential oils to mask its scent and it works great.</li>
            <li> This product was contaminated. The package arrived smelling heavily of cigarette smoke. Immediately my nose began the allergic itch. Then came the nausea. I gave it a try and it created a stinging/burning sensation on the skin surrounding my eyes. The bag was greasy on the outside and open when it arrived. Also, it looked a greenish-yellow color, as opposed to ivory. Subtracting the anticipated shipping cost and counting on the 80% refund, I essentially paid about $13.40 plus my time and energy to get burned.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT TO HAVE IN YOUR HOME. GO FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS AMAZING PRODUCT FROM GOD.</li>
            <li> This Raw Unrefined Ivory Shea Butter from smellgood is my new go to for body butters, it may not smell good, but it sure feels good! It is exactly as described, unrefined, pure top grade and SOFT! I received a large &amp;#34;brick&amp;#34; of (soft- easily cuts with knife) ivory colored shea butter wrapped in a plastic bag, and inside a box. No frills in packaging, and that doesn&#x27;t matter. What DOES matter is the quality of the item, and this is a superb product! It has an earthy aroma that is not particularly welcoming, but not offensive either, and it&#x27;s very easy to disguise. I ordered a 5 pound bag, and it is almost gone already! Next order will be at the very least, 10 pounds. I love this stuff, and anyone I have given body butter to, loves it also. I mix this with raw cocoa butter, extra virgin coconut oil, vitamin E, a few bulk supplements and essential oil(s) of choice and the outcome is a creamy, soft, nourishing lotion that my skin just drinks in. It makes you feel soft all over and soothes dry winter skin like no other! It can be scented with any oil you choose, and that covers the smell, OR the shea smell adds to it. Either way it&#x27;s a winner! I will be purchasing more Raw Unrefined Shea Butter from smellgood very soon, and I recommend that you do too!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, it was offered by Prime with no shipping.  It arrived quickly.  I used it for bath &amp; body products I make, as well as straight out the box.  It was great! Low odor and did wonders for my eczema.  The packaging could throw you off...it came just as pictured; in a brown cardboard box, wrapped in plastic.  If I had any complaint, it was that the plastic wrapping stuck to the shea butter &amp; I felt like I lost just a little of it.  No matter; a little goes a long way &amp; it was well worth the price!  I will take cheap packaging to keep the price low, although I am upset I cannot find it with free shipping any longer.  I have since ordered from another company and the shea butter had such a strong smell, I was not as pleased as I was with this order.  I will be ordering from this company from now on.</li>
            <li> I have been sharing this wonderful product with family and friends.  They are also so happy with the great benefits of raw shea.  Man of man.  Wish I had known about this stuff years back.  Great stuff for an amazing price.  Thank you thank you thank you!</li>
            <li> I pure clean product with an earthy aroma of Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a bag the bag was torn open but it did not affect the product any since it is in a solid state there was no leakage.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again.</li>
            <li> weird chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Though I never purchased bulk before, I&#x27;ve been using Shea butter for years, mostly for my hands and feet. I didn&#x27;t realize I have to process these, but I just added chucks of them to my other hand lotions (you have to - they smell &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; otherwise) and they work just fine; and they&#x27;re soooo inexpensive compare to the ones they sell on tv, which btw aren&#x27;t pure shea butter anyway</li>
            <li> This is GENUINE shea butter - not that fake stuff that some people try to peddle. This does have a strong shea smell to it (as does ALL raw, genuine shea butter) but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant. This does need to be refined but refining it isn&#x27;t difficult. I made hand cream with some of this and it made my hands sooooo soft! I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the skin. The price you can&#x27;t beat. I have been using for close to 20yrs. I like the Dudu Osun black soap too.</li>
            <li> Everyone in the house uses shea butter and it was hard to find a large enough amount that was reasonably priced.  The shea butter that I buy in the beauty supply store is expensive and it only comes in very small quantities.  I&#x27;ve told all my friends about this deal. You can&#x27;t beat 5 lbs of top grade shea butter for this price!</li>
            <li> Not mush to say that has not already been said.  I would order again.  It was very inexpensive.  The shea biutter seemed to be of good quality and worked well in the moisturizer recipe I used it for.  The order was packaged OK and shipment was sent in a reasonable time period.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> This is the softest Shea Butter I ever bought.  I use it mainly as a hair product but I sometimes use it on my skin. I definitely see a difference in this product compared to others I have purchase.</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ALL MY FRIEND AND THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW AND SHOW THEM HOW TO USED AND WORK.</li>
            <li> The item was dirty has all sorts of unknown debris certainly not what was expected. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter</li>
            <li> this product is great and so is the price. The best that I have found so far. This company shipped fast. I found the way it came in chunks made it very easy to handle and use. I&#x27;m glad I decided to listen to the positive reviews...they were so right.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering from this seller for about a year now, and I love the quality of their shea butter! It&#x27;s unrefined and unprocessed,  and you can tell from looking at it. There is some debris in it, but that&#x27;s to be expected. I usually order five pounds of this stuff and use it to make homemade hair and body creams. I love this seller. :-)</li>
            <li> I love this product on my skin. It seems to work as described it would. I did notice the color was off-white to and an eggshell variance but nothing that would alarm me (like others described). The product has a pleasant light but creamy scent to it. Not offensive or rancid odor whatsoever. Would definitely recommend this to others and returning again to purchase in the future. Very affordable for the amount. And as long as it isn&#x27;t heated, it shouldn&#x27;t go bad for at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negatives I see so far is the fact that I did pay for shipping which was half my order. But it came from Africa and in bulk!</li>
            <li> I always buy from here, good quality.  Can&#x27;t believe how much I use to spend on a small tub of this stuff.  So glad to find a place I can purchase in bulk.  Weight is usually always right on the money or slightly more.  I don&#x27;t care how chunky and broken up it looks I always whip it.  I will heat 5lbs at a time.  I mix on low heat(always double boiler) with coconut oil and other oils/essentials.  I strain a little then use the whip/cool process.  The whipping and cooling process is quite time consuming, but well worth it if you ask me.  If you mix with coconut oil and other oils/essential oils and heat/whip/cool it will be much softer and smell better.  I use to use Vaseline when I was a youngin, then castor oil a few year back.  So glad I found out about Shea, way better than using the chemical infested petroleum.  Castor oil just felt slimy.  Shea butter feels so good, my hands are so soft.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair and skin. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to regular store bought lotion. I had previously ordered the 1lb bag, this time I went fot the 5lbs.</li>
            <li> I use this shea butter to make cream lotions. This stuff works wonder on my extremely dry skin. Living out here in the desert climate can really make my already dry skin even worst. My heels and elbows used to get so dry they would crack. I have tried every lotion out there and most of it just irritated my skin. This shea butter, when mixed with coconut oil, vitamin E oil, and grapeseed oil, has given my skin a softness it has never had before. I use it on my hair as well, to seal in moisture. I will definitely buy  more of this stuff.</li>
            <li> As shea butter can be quite expensive, the price is a wonderful value.  I did see another review that mentioned it being dirty-and the package DOES state that it comes AS IS and to expect some debris, etc.  With that said, I use shea butter for all things head to toe on my children and me so this was a great value and I will be ordering again... I just don&#x27;t like having to melt it to clean it so extensively-BUT oh well.</li>
            <li> I use it to make massage candles and soap so far it has been great.</li>
            <li> Received on time and packaged well.  It was one large block, very soft and creamy with very little debris.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I tried other shea butters from different sellers, but I prefer this one. This is a very good quality shea butter and ships quickly. It&#x27;s an ivory color butter, has a light natural scent, melts well and doesn&#x27;t have many impurities, just a few and I see them only if I drain it through a cheese cloth. I make whipped shea butter, body lotions, lip balms, face and hair creams from this butter and everything turns out great. It was my second order from this seller, and I would order again. I am OK with plastic bag packaging: it&#x27;s easier to get the butter out and I don&#x27;t see any reason for a fancier box or container. Butter comes in bulk, 5 lb, in double plastic bag: ones is sealed, another is resealable. So you can either keep it in the resealable plastic bag or re-package it in small containers if you want. All you need is a great product, which this butter is, not a fancy wrap.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to purchase shea butter, so I&#x27;m a novice here. I realize I purchased un-refined shea, so that accounts for the small particles of whatever floating around in it.  I just don&#x27;t know if the smell is spot on. Maybe I&#x27;m just not a fan of the shea butter smell. It does make nice body butter and other homemade products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to process this yet, but it&#x27;s the real deal at a great price for so much!</li>
            <li> Excellent shea butter. I&#x27;ve had it a while now and used it in lotions and alone as a moisturizer. It is fantastic. The shipping was excellent and I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It came in a box and inside was the Shea butter in two plastic bags sealed tight. It has a mild nutty smell I but I like it. After I refined it by using the double boiler method and added my oils in , then I put it in the freezer for 10 mins , after that I started whipping it together it only took 5 mins until it was perfectly smooth . I saw other comments on how it was grainy I didn&#x27;t experience that straight out of the bag it was smooth and melted on my fingers. Even after I processed it into a whipped Shea butter it was very smooth . I had little to no debris in my Shea butter . The only downfall to this was my order was 3 days late!!! But other than that I enjoy this product it at a reasonable price and a great product ! I think I&#x27;ll be ordering from here again as long as the shipping will be better the next time .</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.. Never want to buy lotion again! Normally shea buter is had and difficult to rub in.  This was nice and soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I received it very quickly and in good condition.  The package is really big - it is an off-white color with tinges of yellow.  It is soft and you can easily apply it.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ordered this Shea Butter from Amazon.  I was not sure if it would be the same as I normally order, but it was.  I received my product really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality product and I have more than enough butter now.  This will last me a long time.  It does have an earthly smell, but I just add a few drops of essential oil and it make it better.  I use this everyday on my face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really good product and makes your skin really really soft.</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail on time. It is just like I pictures it. I love using it. Great benefits with its use.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is fine but could have come in a much smaller plastic bag then it was packaged in to avoid getting the butter on my arms by reaching into such a large buttered plastic bag.</li>
            <li> the seller is VERY willing to answer ANY and all questions--I emailed questions left, right and center on what to do with it, how to store it, how to filter it, will bugs bother with it, etc.  no, bugs won&#x27;t bother with it, but I already filtered mine before the warm weather hit (I got mine as a Christmas present, so COLD weather).  yes, it IS smelly, it&#x27;s usually used with essential oils or herbs to cut that scent it has naturally.  even before it&#x27;s filtered, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer, though!  my hands were SO SOFT the day I did the filtering!  it melts down faster than chocolate, almost as fast as butter, so don&#x27;t leave it alone long at all on the stove top!, also use a double boiler, just to give it a \\&quot;softer\\&quot; heat.  seller didn&#x27;t suggest that, that I remember, but I&#x27;ve melted plenty of marshmallows and chocolate and I don&#x27;t want my shea butter to risk a burnt smell.  can&#x27;t wait to have soap and lotion bars with this stuff in it!  also, the price on unfiltered can&#x27;t be beat and the item was sent in great time and plenty sturdy packaging AND S&amp;H wasn&#x27;t a rip off!  :)</li>
            <li> I really like this shea butter. It makes my shea mixtures creamy, smooth and white depending what oils I mix in it when I run out I will be ordering again. which will be no time soon, because its a lot</li>
            <li> I reeeaallllyyyyy love this Shea butter. The smell is not so bad it goes away in fifteen to twenty mins. I mixed mines with vitamin E oil which is also excellent fr the skin so now its simpler to apply. I love this product and i will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> it has this earthy smell to it, and when you melt you can see some of the shea fruit peel in it so you know it is definitely unrefined.</li>
            <li> we use this to make our homemade skin and hair products. The Shea Butter is so easy to work with will be buying again.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!!  I am a frequent buyer of this shea butter... I use it for soaps &amp; shea body butter!</li>
            <li> Wonderful shea butter. I was a bit scpetical but the delivery time was great and the shea butter was clean and authentic. Thanks</li>
            <li> Breaks down very easy Love the quality of it</li>
            <li> good but a little dirty</li>
            <li> Shea butter is great. Just as described by Smellgood.Only my order did not come in A cardboard box like in the picture but, that&#x27;s A non issue to me. I found that the best way to filter the butter is to heat in A microwave safe bowl just until it melts, then strain using A clean flour sack that&#x27;s folded over once. This is the best method for me.</li>
            <li> Great buy I will Definitely buy again.... High-quality wonderful does everything it claims Smooth texture works great on my skin</li>
            <li> Real raw unrefined. Has a earthy smell. Very satisfied. Has small debris thats easily removed once melted on low heat.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff. I use it to make my own face and body creams. I have very dry skin and this feels great. I add essential oils to make it smell great and also benefit my skin even more. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll level with you; my girlfriend had me order it.  I have no idea what this stuff is, but she seems to be happy.  Happy girlfriend &#x3D; happy me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shea butter about 7 months ago. I still have a good amount left and use it everyday. My entire family love the body butter I make with this product and can not go more than a day without it. I recommend this product for all skin and hair types. You will fall in love as well. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this Shea Butter. The debris from it being unrefined was minimal. I chose not to refine much of it. I use it on my natural hair and my skin. My skin is very dry by nature. I also have a skin condition called Lichen Plantus which is basically a non-contagious chronic skin rash. My naturally dry skin only aggravates the condition. I use Shea Butter on it which not only moisturizes my skin, but when used in regular intervals (in addition to my medicated skin cream), it cuts the normal intensity of the condition and restores the color of my skin much faster. I&#x27;m enjoying it. I plan on experimenting with it and making various recipes so I plan on buying more as soon as this runs out.</li>
            <li> I have been making body butters with it and using it just by itself too. Great amount, great quality, and great price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use in hair. I don&#x27;t like the feel of this product. The 8oz I purchased online before was nice and it maxed my hair look great, not this. I don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  You get a lot of it and works well when making body products.  Made my hair and skin really soft.</li>
            <li> Great product! Soft with no need to clean...no debris, shells or dirt. Packaged great, shipped quickly. Will be ordering more soon...the quality is so good, had I known, I would&#x27;ve ordered 10lbs instead of five. Great customer service. Thanks to you, I won&#x27;t only SMELLGOOD, but look good too!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t buy Shea butter cheaper than this. I only needed like a pound of it, but for the price it was stupid to not buy the 5 lb container. Like a couple other reviews said it came in a loose plastic bag (not grocery normal packing but not sealed) then wrapped in cling wrap inside of that. As a couple other reviews said, this is not refined. Don&#x27;t open it and expect it to look nice and fluffy like the body scrubs and stuff those have been refined and whipped. To refine it, simply heat it in a pot, strain it to remove any dirt or small sticks (not that i&#x27;ve seen any sticks in mine, but they could be there). I got the full 5 lbs with mine, no shorting like a couple other reviews said. Overall, for the price even if its not the nicest of Shea butters, the amount you get is such a good deal you cant pass it up.</li>
            <li> Just as it said it would arrive in the information.  It has some small material in it but nothing of note.  You could easily use it raw rather than melting it down to filter it out.  I have used it both ways and was happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I purchased 10 lbs to make body butters, deodorant and many other things! It is unrefined; therefore, I have to strain it with cheesecloth, but it is well worth the time and effort!</li>
            <li> Love my load of shea butter. Today I made my first batch of body butter with essential oils. I have a recipe at my blog if you&#x27;d like to see it. Five pounds should last me awhile and I have a nice cool place to keep it in my food pantry.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. I&#x27;ve already made several different products with this. Good quality, natural product.</li>
            <li> Packaging leaves a little to be desired. It came in a plastic bag tied with a wire bread tie....very messy. The picture is misleading as it shows it in a box.</li>
            <li> I used this shea butter for making body butter and omg this shea butter is amazing! Very high quality and the price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> It came on time it look good I use it I would order more when I get low on it</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. I immediately inspected it when I got it to make sure that the color, texture and smell were consistent with raw, unrefined shea butter. It passed the test. It smells slightly smoky,has a smooth non-oily feel and the color is not WHITE but beige.</li>
            <li> Great product.  That&#x27;s all I can say.  It came in a plastic bag, which didn&#x27;t really bother me.  You will probably have to pick out some small particles, but it&#x27;s worth it for the price and grade.  Maybe melt, strain, and let set?</li>
            <li> I need to order more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. It shipped pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Nice. Definitely will repurchase</li>
            <li> love this! Its been months and I still have a lot left over. Seems authenthic and smells great. I use this to make whiped shea butter for my hair n even my husband loves it, he uses it for his hair and his skin. Its better than lotion Would def buy again</li>
            <li> I would really like to thank the vendor who provides this product. I really appreciate the effort you put into your packaging to make sure my butter doesnt dry out while in transit to me. Its not the most sophisticated packing, but it works and keeps the pricing down. THANK YOU VERY MUCH! I LOVE MY BUTTER AND  I LOVE YOUR PRICING!!!!</li>
            <li> I make my own lotion and for several years went to the local beauty supply store to purchase my Shea Butter ... okay, I didn&#x27;t know better :-D! The difference between what I purchased in the beauty supply store and through you is so far apart. Your Shea Butter is cleaner, softer and overall higher in quality ... not to mention the better overall price. Highly recommend this product and this seller!&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Stephanie Parson</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is creamy, fresh, and rubs on easily. Used it to make whipped butters and blends really well with other oils. I&#x27;ve been able to use it as is, with no filtering.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what i wanted. It was raw, ivory, and smelled nutty. I separated mine into a couple of zip-lock bags and used some of it to make a lotion. I will order again after i run out.</li>
            <li> My Shea butter arrived rather quickly. In two weeks exact. The best deal I could of ever gotten cant wait to place my next order. I&#x27;m very satisfied got a lot for my money. I been doing all kinds of great stuff with my Shea thanks smell goods two thumbs up to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised with the amount received. The photo does no justice to the quantity in the plastic. It&#x27;s sealed properly and shipped well. The shea butter is soft and turns to a nice cream when warmed and mixed. I have very happy to have found this vendor and will continue to shop, so long as they are selling.</li>
            <li> Super pleased came in half the time I thought it would I received exactly what I ordered very good quality for the money! I am super pleased will be ordering again soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to buying the filtered shea butter in the plastic container, but I wanted a raw product to use in my homemade hair and skin butters. I took a chance and purchased the shea butter from Smell Good due, in part, on the strength of the good reviews listed here. I am glad I read almost all of them because I knew what to expect of this product when I received it. I got what was advertised: a raw, 5 lb. bag of unrefined shea butter, in chunks and with some natural discoloration. When I opened the bag, it smelled fresh, nutty and buttery. Please note that this is what shea butter is supposed to smell like. It can be an acquired scent if you&#x27;re not used to it but there is nothing wrong with your product. I went ahead and filtered the shea butter per video instructions suggested on the package. Because I wanted to preserve as many nutrients as possible, I used the double boiler method instead of placing the product directly in a metal pot. When it finally melted (it took a while to melt 5 pounds in low, low heat), the shea butter was so clear and I decided not to filter it after all. Now that I know what to expect, the next time I order I will leave it as is in chunks and store it in glass jars until ready to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make hair and body butter&#x27;s as well as light hair whips as gifts this Christmas. Even making enough for 7 people I still have approximately 1.5 lbs left. It blended beautifully and the smell is not strong at all. Every loves it and I personally am using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even use it on my face and the results are amazing. No dry skin even though I live in a dry winter climate. I will be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li> Great customer service. I had a question regarding the product.&lt;br /&gt; I called them and they responded right away,  answered my question&lt;br /&gt;in detail and was very friendly.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is awesome if  you have dry skin eczema, psoriasis, strech marks or blemishes it will be gone. so thank you I&#x27;ve been sharing this product with my family and my friend, so sincerely Paul</li>
            <li> I was okay, however I would buy again. However when I opened up the package the shea butter was all broken up, I guess I thought it would be in a solid chuck not broken chunks. It did the job anyway for what I purchased it for: hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I have whipped this with essential oil and was pleased with results. I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t have to add a lot of essential oil to get desired smell.</li>
            <li> Will order more as needed</li>
            <li> Wow I&#x27;m feeling enthusiastic about this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it for four days and my skin has improved noticeably.  Acne I had went away and my skin as a whole looks healthier.  Can&#x27;t say enough about it, I recommend.</li>
            <li> The item arrived earlier than scheduled, packaged well and secure. True to the description and happy with the results. Definitely will order again.</li>
            <li> I started using Shea butter recently and noticed a wonderful change in just a couple of days. We live  in&lt;br /&gt;the high desert region just south east of Reno, Nevada. My skin has really suffered from the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived two days before it was I expected it. The butter was very firm yet creamy when I touched it. There is a pungent, strong odor to it, very earthy.&lt;br /&gt;When I made my first batch I used half Shea and  three guarters coconut oil, and a nice splash of E.V.O.O. I&lt;br /&gt;also used twelve drops of eucalyptu s</li>
            <li> This is better than other Shea butters I have bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with this order. The item arrived just as pictured and it goes great with all my homemade body butters and lotion!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered bulk shea butter from different locations online, and this is the first time I have ordered from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shea butter comes in chunks in plastic bags (not as a block as pictured) and it is raw and unrefined.  Raw Unrefined means that the butter has not been filtered and you should melt the butter and strain before using. Melting and straining will get out elemental debris like twigs, rocks, dirt etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make hair creams and body butters so melting and filtering was not an issue for me.  The quality of the shea butter was very good and the price is amazing.  I will definitely use this seller again.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> IIt&#x27;s hard to review a product when I&#x27;m new to making the batches of butters and lotions. From what I&#x27;ve read, it seems to be of the best quality. It cooks beautifully and so far I haven&#x27;t used essential oils. I intend to but it really doesn&#x27;t smell that bad. When mixed, it almost smells as strong as plado.. I think this is of higher quality than most.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought from them and I love their shea butter.  I have a small at home soap and body product business, so getting the best bang for my buck is important.  This shea has minimal residue and is high quality, giving all my products a beautiful finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this order.  The value could not be beat. The packaging was fine and luckily the temperature didn&#x27;t affect the shipping box being soiled.</li>
            <li> This smells like cigarette  smoke.  I was expecting a nutty smell but not the cigarette smell.  It was packaged well and the shea was not dirty at all.  It&#x27;s was very smooth when melted and whipped. I added a lot of essential and fragrance oils and the smoke smell still is a bit much for me.  If it smelled better I would purchase again but it doesn&#x27;t so I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd time purchasing this Shea butter from this vender and I am very pleased. The quality is A+ and it makes the best whipped body butter when combined with coconut oil. I will continue to purchase as long as the quality stays the same.</li>
            <li> Great product! Excellent price!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered from this vendor and  I have been very pleased with the quality of their shea butter both times. They also have the best price! I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of shea butter, it&#x27;s great for making my whipped body butter.  Great to use all by it&#x27;s self too.  I just mix with the essential oil of my choice and some almond oil and whip with a mixer until it&#x27;s fluffy.  Best lotion out there.</li>
            <li> I have not used the product yet, but it was delivered as expected.  For the looks of it, it is exacly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this shea butter.  It is soft, light in color and very mild in scent so adding essential oils for scent uses less than other shea butters I have tried.  I will absolutely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Semi-creamy whitish/beige color. Has the appearance of&lt;br /&gt;cookie dough with small bits in it. Has some debris&lt;br /&gt;and of course it is oily. Came in a plastic clear&lt;br /&gt;bag in small and large chucks. Soft smell but way&lt;br /&gt;more less than the yellow sheabutter. Much easilier&lt;br /&gt;to work with in chucks; so time is saved trying to&lt;br /&gt;cut into it. The process of filtering it do take some&lt;br /&gt;time but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used the entire 5 lb block and all my customers have raved about it! I will be making future purchases.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Quick shipping.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Product arrived full of MOLD!!!! I was completely disgusted. Needless to say it was immediately returned. I&#x27;d give zero stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Just as described. I use it in body butters and it feels great.</li>
            <li> YEAH - Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit freaked out...there are ants in it.</li>
            <li> I like this shea Butter, it smells really nice. It leaves your skin feeling real moist.</li>
            <li> I purchased this butter for the main reason that it was soft. Living in a dorm on campus I&#x27;m not asked to have a microwave and last time I ordered Shea butter on amazon (totally different seller) my batch wasn&#x27;t soft enough to just whip by itself. I had to literally blow dry the Shea butter to get it melted which resulted in a huge oily mess and annoying bubbles ayer being whipped because it wasn&#x27;t hot enough 😥. This new batch was everything though I whipped it as soon as I opened the packaging (each pound was in its own bag packaging then all of the bags were put into a bigger bag together, it was ok for me I liked it although I do enjoy Shea butter in containers so I can scrape the extra like it&#x27;ll make a difference). It whipped beautiful by itself and I mean right out the bag nothing else poured into the bowl I even considered not adding any other oils but that was over quick. Overall I will happily purchase again</li>
            <li> It has a nice light smell to it, really good quality shea butter. I got 8lb instead of 5lb which is great. Ive already started making my hair and body butters will buy again.</li>
            <li> I suffer from osteoarthritis on both knees.  I have been taking a lot of supplements like Move-free, Glucosamine, condroitin, etc. and I have never felt any relief.  I had difficulties with going up and down the stairs and standing up after sitting for a period of time.  I bought this product, shea butter and castor oil and mixed them together (65% shea butter/25% cocoa butter and 10% castor oil.  It created a pasty cream that I applied liberally on my knees every morning.  After about 6 weeks, I noticed I can now easily stand and walk after sitting for a long time.  I can negotiate the stairs a lot more comfortably and I move about a lot better.  The pain is still there, but the swelling has subsided and I am a lot more comfortable.  The only side effect is that my knees are baby-smooth in texture.  I can deal with that!  LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given this concoction to friends and co-workers and I am hoping they will experience the same positive results.  Oh, one girl at work used it with her psoriasis.  The affected area has now cleared.</li>
            <li> I recieved my shea butter today! It was in a large plastic bag with a descriptive label on the outside. Since the only way I could figure out if I did in fact get 5lbs, was to weigh myself on my regular bathroom scale (127.2) and then weigh myself while holding the whole bag of shea butter (132.2)... I did receive exactly 5lbs!  I will warn you, this stuff is stinky! But I know I have to melt and strain this(to get any dirt or sticks out since it is raw), so I plan to add some essential oils into it to mask the smell. Hopefully that will help. This was a great buy! Very happy with my purchase. I did not see any mold, or ants or anything else for that matter. Just good old stinky shea butter. I attached a photo to show the product I got, hopefully that will help help you with your decision.  Until I make some homemade exfoliating moisture bars, bath bombs, etc, I cannot say anything in reguards to the product in other ways. Since I plan to use this on my very very dry skin, I will update later!</li>
            <li> like it, As mentioned its unrefined (has dust particles)</li>
            <li> Now I wonder if the product I ordered before from another company was really Shea Butter.  This stuff does have scent but is not the repulsive sent of the other one, nor does it stain clothes with that yellow color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a nice creamy color, soft scent, and works very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(doesn&#x27;t come as a solid block, but as many small pieces).</li>
            <li> BAD BATCH-Not what I expected, smells smoky...contained something that was irritating. I do not have sensitive skin...however, this caused a prickly rash on me and baby.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. It was soft and clean.  Made a great moisturizer for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> This item came in packaged better than the picture here shows. Butter is in large clumps, not one solid mass. It was packaged in factory sealed plastic and the box was lined with paper. A label was also on it that said it was real, raw shea butter that has not been filtered and that the smell is the natural smell. From the research I have done the butter I used to buy was kpangnan butter which is commonly sold as shea butter but is a deep yellow color. This butter is off white with a different smell. The kpangnan smelled more nutty and this smells more smoky. This shea has great moisturizing properties and is not greasy AT ALL! I used it directly (especially on my feet) but will be adding carrier and essential oil which will cover up the smell. This shea butter is great for making your own body butters, balms, etc. I am 100% pleased with this product (the price is phenomenal!) and will definitely order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the speedy shipping, I love the shea butter!!! Just what i need to moisturize my skins</li>
            <li> great raw unrefined Shea.  I love purchasing from this seller and they are super fast with shipping.</li>
            <li> I did not have debris in mine and it weighed 5 lbs exactly.  I did not like the smell of unrefined Shea butter.  I use it for my soaps but I do not make body whips because I can&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
            <li> love this product. going to order more. this product was rich and sot just right for my hair grease. thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this unrefined Shea butter because I read refined Shea butter often have chemicals added to them, and because they were heated, some nutrients were destroyed. I want to take full advantage of Shea butter&#x27;s natural vitamin A and E, so I took my chance with this unrefined Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little more nutty smelling than I anticipated, but it&#x27;s not bad. It&#x27;s just earthly and smells like nuts and soil. I blended it cold with equal amounts of almond oil, then lightly scented it with 5 drops of [[ASIN:B0019LVG52 NOW Foods Lavender &amp; Tea Tree Oil, 1 ounce]] per every 4 oz of cream. It&#x27;s pretty fabulous. The original shea scent is not covered. It&#x27;s blended in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package is about the size of a 500 page pack of letter size printer paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says you could filter the butter with cheese cloth again if there are debris, but mine had hardly any debris in it that it&#x27;d be a waste of effort to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, other than the earthly smell that was a bit stronger than I anticipated, this is a fabulous product. It&#x27;s also the cheapest source I found at $17/5lbs including shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I found out from a friend that you can put these in freezer proof 1 gallon bags and stuff them in the freezer so they&#x27;ll last a really long time.</li>
            <li> Smells good, soft...and shipped fast. You can whipped it with coconut oil for a creamy and great smelling body butter.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve never had unrefined shea better, but I have had the yellowy processed stuff. When I got this, after reading all of the reviews, I thought that I would have a block of shea butter with a bunch of debris in it, but it was not the case. However, I did filter it just to make sure. The smell is very nutty, but it does smell like shea butter. For those who have never had the chance to come in contact with unrefined shea butter, it does not smell like the shea butter that you would get off of the shelf of a store. I have not found anything negative about this product so far. The best thing that I LOVE about this product is that it is very oily and so soft, it melts fast, and I got A LOT. When I saw 5 pounds, i got really excited, but I read some reviews about how it was not really a lot. My batch had more than I need for right now. I could fill up 2 tubs of butter. I plan on making a whipped shea butter concoction for my hair, so I have more than enough. I would most definitely buy from this seller again, and I would totally recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> It is what the vendor said it would be. This product is excellent to mix with mild essential oils like amyris and frankincense. And it makes my skin feel so soft and supple. I discarded all the cheap lotions and potions I&#x27;ve bought and am sticking with this shea butter. Reasonably priced and good too.</li>
            <li> This is the base for everything in our house.  I use it everyday.  I apply after a shower to my skin and hair.  IT has helped reduce my stretch marks and scars from surgery.  I mix it with oil essence and that helps the woody smell.</li>
            <li> Was what I expected based on reading other reviews. Comes in chunks but still melts the same. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Well, this Shea Shea butter arrived before time. I was very pleased with this Shea butter, NOTHING like that store bought stuff. Very very smooth. Would highly recommend purchasing. Will be purchasing this Shea butter again.</li>
            <li> I love the product I received, it was exactly what I expected it have some grains on a small portion but nothing major I simply shaved it... The product was of high quality and I could not be happier actually I just ordered some black for the first time and now eagerly awaiting its arrival, they now have a customer for life if they continue to provide high quality products at unbeatable prices..</li>
            <li> I got the shea butter about a week and a half after I ordered it, which I thought was very good.  I used it with some coconut oil and argan oil to make some whipped shea butter.  It is great.  I didn&#x27;t heat this and filter it, but will do so for the next batch.  I didn&#x27;t find anything in the shea butter, just feel it will be better after it&#x27;s filtered.  I recommend this especially to people who are trying to get away from chemical laden body butters, lotions, and lip balms.  So easy and inexpensive to make my own.</li>
            <li> This got so many wonderful ratings and the price is right. So I decided to try unrefined shea butter for the first time. Some people who gave it good reviews talked about a little bit of a smell. Maybe I got a bad batch, because the stuff I got smelled so strong like melted/burning plastic and smoke, that I couldn&#x27;t keep the bag open for long or the whole house would smell. I thought maybe melting it down would help, plus an entire bottle of lavender essential oil. It took days for the chemical smell to be gone out of the house. And now the shea butter just smells like burning plastic and lavender. And I&#x27;m not sure what the ivory color of shea is supposed to be, but this stuff was a color that I could only describe as yellow, and made me kinda itchy. Plus I can&#x27;t return it because I already melted it down. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to explore making homemade lotion bars.  Worked great.  I did however melt it all and strain it with cheesecloth to get some of the particles out.  Not a big problem though.</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes a great addition to my lotion recipes!</li>
            <li> The shea butter arrived quickly and smells and feels fresh. I have only used it straight so far but want to blend it with other butters. 5lbs is a big chunk.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine however , it came with No instructions, and NO PACKING SLIP.</li>
            <li> You will NOT receive what you see in the photo. You will receive a bag full of chunks and crumbles, which is not a problem, just letting you know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the color, I have never gotten shea butter that had such variation of color... some pieces were ivory, or cream colored which is exactly what I expected, and other peices were a dingy brownish almost greenish color. They lost a star here..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will get a sticker on the bag that tells you you have to process the product. basically you have to melt it all and then strain out all of the dirt, sticks, string, or any other debris. This does take a considerable amount of time.. ******This is NOT a take from the package and apply to skin product***** again, something i am ok with because I make whipped body butters and do that process anyways...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT hard butter, I never knew there was a soft/hard shea butter, so if you are using it to make body butters, be aware that it will absolutely change the texture of the final product, Mine felt a bit gritty not at all like the &amp;#34;Frosting consistency&amp;#34; that I am accustomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was within the timeframe specified, it wasn&#x27;t crazy fast or anything, typical wait time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am not sure whether or not I will purchase this again. It is an amazing price,and it may be exactly what you are looking for, I&#x27;m just not sure if it is for me or not :D</li>
            <li> Wonderful for making stuff with . Very good for skin .</li>
            <li> I have probably used up nearly 2 pounds already, in just a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is smooth and clean when heated or just warmed. I have used all kinds of oils, but this one is the king of moisturizing. We use it daily to really fight off winter dryness. If you wipe it on at the end of a shower, then rinse with warm water, you can avoid using a towel and reduce eczema to the weakest of cortisones for spot use. Be prepared to clean the tub often and wash clothes and sheets frequently. But also be prepared to keep young and healthy skin, eczema or not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;My method of using this has improved. I now mix this shea butter with other oils, such as coconut, rice bran, and walnut oils. The main thing is that the mix should be about 2/3-3/4 shea butter. I warm it enough to melt the shea butter, and then mix the oils. When it cools to room temp I have a very luxurious solid but soft cream-like material that spreads so smooth and easy! I don&#x27;t think it matter that much which of the other oils I use. I get them all on Amazon. Today&#x27;s mixture actually has all of the oils together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we don&#x27;t use it in the shower anymore, but instead use it right after the shower. Much easier to keep the tub clean that way. We&#x27;ve gotten used to having it on the sheets, and it really doesn&#x27;t make any difference. For some reason it never penetrates even to the mattress protector, let alone to the mattress.</li>
            <li> My Shea butter was exactly what was discribed, the delivery was prompt, its not filtered so thats an extra step i have to take, the butter is very smooth and mild scent. Overall i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is amazing, soft and smells good its not ivory, its more of a yellowish color, but great value!</li>
            <li> Any one with dry, rough, red skin, any dark spots, wrinkles, eczema or psoriasis problems needs this product.  With in 24 hours all of my problems were well on their way to healing.  This product is so soft in texture and smell that it does not take much to cover your whole body in it.  Just place a teaspoon full in your hands, rub your hands together for a second or two and spread to all areas needing help.  And don&#x27;t forget your face.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and my eczema has not returned since the third day of use.  A must for all households.</li>
            <li> I used this product in homemade lotions. It was perfect! I also use it as an all-around moisturizer (including face...great for dry skin!) for myself and my dogs (nose, and paw pads in the winter)!</li>
            <li> I am having the best time with this stuff and the quality.  I love the scent (can sometimes overpower, adjust essential oils accordingly) and the absorption is making my skin feel amazing.  The SPF factor is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Received package on time and was satisfied with the product. Also received large amout of the shea butter. I highly recommend this if you are making your own creams.</li>
            <li> I love the Shea butter it is great I use it for my hair scalp and skin  great great. And shipping was fast wow I will be back and tell others about you r the people to order from for sure. Need to give five stars for sure.</li>
            <li> The best TOTAL body moisturizer</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described. I used a cheesecloth to filter the particulate but other than that, it has been great!</li>
            <li> Great product, reasonable price</li>
            <li> I have only recently been researching shea butter.  I have a local friend from Ghana and spoke with his wife.  I ordered the 5 lb. \\&quot;loaf\\&quot; from smellgood and it arrived this morning.  I filtered it with two layers of lintfree tea towel (cut) rubber-banded over a mason qt. jar.  I heated the shea (double boiler) and poured it through the filters.&lt;br /&gt;I used to make soap bars by the hundreds about 10 yrs. ago.  I didn&#x27;t want to get back into that, but this was so satisfying and easy to do.  I poured the CLEAN shea into jars I had purchased for this purpose.  Thirty minutes in the freezer and it is perfect, smells mild, and will be just what my 55 yr. old norwegian/swedish skin needs.  While I had originally planned on making only whipped shea butter, the smoothness of the butter after filtering is fantastic.  NOTE:  No graininess!  Smooth as firm butter!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  BTW,  I did some weighing and with what I melted and the remaining amount in the bag, it came out slightly over 5 lbs.  I will be buying from smellgood again!!</li>
            <li> It is unrefined so I expected discoloration and it&#x27;s what I expected but don&#x27;t be fooled by the creamy white pic</li>
            <li> Buttery. Soft. Luscious. Authentic Shea Butter. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will be ordering more very soon</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter lotions from this company is always excellent.  Since starting my business I generally buy in bulk.  I love how fast the Shea arrives at my house and the quality of the product.  I have used the Shea in my lotions and soaps with great results.  I would recommend this product to anyone that uses Shea.</li>
            <li> No matter what temperature you put this on to melt it, it turns black. It doesn&#x27;t seem to affect anything but it looks gross. However I do like it for body lotions and hand creams because it doesnt leave a super greasy residue on your hands.</li>
            <li> Very happy got exactly what was said. I have used it and it works great. Mine did not turn black but I also broil to get to liquid state. Pan with water bowling and use a glass measuring cup. Made some psoriasis cream for my son and it&#x27;s the only relief we can find! Great price too.</li>
            <li> After adding essential oils it smells better. They do state that the shea is not filtered so I  filtered it with cheese clothe, which i didnt mind doing. Nice product</li>
            <li> I use this in a 4 ingredient all natural lotion I make.  It is a great product!  5 pounds was a good amount.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing quality! Wonderful light smell to use alone or easily scented with essential oils. Nice texture nicely blends with other butters if desired. Will definitely be buying again!</li>

(5.5 ml) lip balm tubes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combine all of the ingredients in a small sauce pot and put it on the oven on low-medium heat. Stir the mixture until all of the beeswax and shea butter has melted. Turn the burner off and remove the pot from the heat. Fill the lip balm tubes using a funnel. Let the tubes sit undisturbed for 20 minutes to cool and set (leave any spill-over temporarily undisturbed – it is not worth trying to wipe it off right now).&lt;br /&gt;After your balm has cooled and set, it is ready to go&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy Homemade Whipped Body Butter Recipe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Butter:&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup Cocoa Butter or Mango Butter&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup Coconut Oil&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup light oil (like almond, jajoba or olive)&lt;br /&gt;Optional: 10-30 drops of essential oils of choice&lt;br /&gt;How to Make Body Butter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a double boiler or glass bowl, combine all ingredients except essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;Bring to medium heat and stir constantly until all ingredients are melted.&lt;br /&gt;Remove from heat and let cool slightly.&lt;br /&gt;Move to fridge and let cool another 1 hour or until starting to harden but still somewhat soft.&lt;br /&gt;Use a hand mixer to whip for 10 minutes until fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;Return to fridge for 10-15 minutes to set.&lt;br /&gt;Store in a glass jar with a lid and use as you would regular lotion or body butter. If your home stays above 75 degrees, it may soften and need to be kept at the fridge, but it will stay whipped at a temperature lower than that.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!

            <li> I found the item was packaged excellently. The double bags have helped me to ensure that the product does not dry out while using. The only reason that I rated the item a 4 star is because it is not a true ivory Shea butter (in color) when compared to other Ivory Shea butters that I have purchased for other suppliers; however,  I would definitely recommend the product and will be more than likely placing another order.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quality.  I will definitely be placing another order.</li>
            <li> Nothing like getting exactly what you wanted/paid for!</li>

            <li> I have not used unrefined shea butter before but had no trouble.  The product is great but packaging could be a lot better!</li>
            <li> This version is softer than the stuff I got this summer in West Africa. It smells the same but is more buttery and smooth. I have been using shea butter for almost 2 decades. Shea butter serves as my all purpose beauty care system. It arrived quickly and was packaged well. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love that it is raw and unrefined.  I will be ordering again! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for carrying this excellent product. I&#x27;ve used it in lotions and soap so far. It has a wonderful earthy smell, and is very clean. I love it!</li>
