            <li>My skin is white and this cream is absolutely perfect for my skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything ok as announced.</li>

            <li>The tint is a bit too light for&lt;br</li>
            <li>its lightly tinted.</li>
            <li>Thank you for having it available.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, this product have good coverage and something that would blend in well on my skin.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s good, but there may be better options cheaper.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care about the price, it&#x27;s worth never burning!</li>
            <li>The seller I patronized sent the package quickly and I was happy to see the expiration date is a year away, meaning it&#x27;s not old stock.</li>
            <li>I really like this on top of the rich optimale, but, there&#x27;s always a</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive, but It sure does love Avene.</li>
            <li>This also helps to minimize the oily feel, specially at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>Turns my skin white, and I&#x27;m fair skinned.</li>
            <li>I am light skinned and need a powerful blocker that this product has.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>I have a pretty senstive skin and find this cream non-irritating and effective (broad spectrum protection).</li>
            <li>Its pricier but worth it.</li>
            <li>I have to wonder if it isn&#x27;t some kind of racket between the medical profession or the journalists who write about it and the sunscreen makers.  </li>
            <li>Many years ago my dermologist recomended this sunscreen, and since then is the only one I use for my face,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also, found that if I just put enough to cover all the areas of my face/neck, then it blends better with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>fast delivery!</li>
            <li>used more when i go outside.</li>
            <li>I also would like to point out that it is my opinion that some of the ingredients in many sunscreens might actually cause the cancer you are using it to prevent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>slightly tinted, so you donÂ´t look all white after applying and very good protection from sun.</li>
            <li>This is strong, but made my face very yellow and somewhat chalky.  </li>
            <li>not only does it protect my skin from the sun, it has calmed it down and it looks great</li>
            <li>I have to wonder about some of the reviews on Amazon that claim miraculous results from using certain products.  </li>
            <li>This cream has pretty high zinc and titanium oxide levels</li>
            <li>it protects the skin very well.  </li>
            <li>it just stays like that the whole day.</li>
            <li>This product ,I like it,good!It really helps in severe sun.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that my skin did not itch or burn when I applied the cream</li>
            <li>I have no complaints about this sunscreen except that it costs so much.  </li>
            <li>Really keeps my face protected from the sun.  </li>
            <li>As other readers have noted, because of the zinc oxide, it is very light colored, and can cause the &amp;#34;Casper&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>That does not bother me since I am an older person</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I let it soak in for a little while, then put liquid make-up over the top, which seems to alleviate that problem.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my face, and normal sunscreen on my body in Cancun.  </li>
            <li>Now I only use the cream, wait 2 minutes until it gets absorbed and then put my make up on and seems to work well.  </li>
            <li>It does take some time to work it into my skin until my normal color shows, even with the tint, but it doesn&#x27;t clog my skin.</li>
            <li>I am trying to find a good sunscreen for very sensitive skin as some sun screens are actually irritating the skin.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product in the summer.</li>
            <li>but, I wish the color was more yellow than pink.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If u have fair skin, this covers slight blemishes and dark spots.</li>
            <li>I have used several weeks and believe the protection element seems better than other products I have used.  </li>
            <li>My skin is not only sensitive to light but also fluorescent light, a few minutes outside or in a department store makes my skin itch and burn, it literally is equivalent to a sunburn.</li>
            <li>This is strong, but made my face somewhat chalky and pale...</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s a little too light for my skin</li>
            <li>I really like Avene products because they seem well-researched, contain effective ingredients, and aren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li>Next time I tried to apply a tiny tiny amount which was better, but still it leaves a white purple hue.</li>
            <li>The pharmacist suggested it after I mentioned that I had rosacea and needed something for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have to wear face podwer to get natural color skin...</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive so when I use this product, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>Plus, if you are sensitive to heavier coverage creams this can trigger skin eruptions.  </li>
            <li>Dont Apply too much or your face Will be white.  </li>
            <li>I have tried just about every product available for sunblock but found that all of these products dried out and irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>-- I suppose it would be prohibitive to make it in a large enough container to last you</li>
            <li>The only way I see this being way too white is if you apply too much.</li>
            <li>have sensitive and mix skin, and this product offers me the protection that I need and serves well as a base since its tint help to even the skin tone before the foundation, I love it!</li>

            <li> have sensitive and mix skin, and this product offers me the protection that I need and serves well as a base since its tint help to even the skin tone before the foundation, I love it!</li>
            <li> (My skin is sensitive to all other commercial products).</li>
            <li> I bought this cream 20 days ago, but for Two things I don&#x27;t like: It&#x27;s a little too light for my skin ( my skin is a little dark) and it tends to make my face oilier.</li>
            <li> The only downside is it made my skin look pink.</li>
            <li> I used it all summer long.</li>
            <li> Lasts long on your skin.</li>
            <li> All sunscreen seems to be expensive and the higher the SPF, the more expensive it is.  </li>
            <li> I got a sunburn wearing, but I was out in the sun for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> However, I have come across some similar, maybe even more hypoallergenic products that are quite a bit less expensive, although still in a small container</li>
            <li> Close to what I had expected however it was slightly thinner than the same product I purchased elsewhere some years ago.</li>
            <li> This product does leave a slight white cast on my face, but a little bronzes helps that out.  </li>
            <li> but it still looks alittle chalky due to the zinc oxide-It seems to work.</li>
            <li> Other sunscreens cause a rash, but not this one.</li>
            <li> and it is not effective if you don&#x27;t slather it on pretty heavily, but it is very expensive and usually comes in small containers, so how can most people afford that?  </li>
            <li> being said, I do see what others mean by it turning your skin white.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Turns my face white:(</li>
            <li> Avene was a wonderful produce.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  it protects the skin very well.  The only downside is it made my skin look pink.</li>
            <li> This might be a good sunscreen, it makes the skin soft, however, I will not be able to use it. It creates a white-purple layer on my skin that does not disappear even with massaging it in for several minutes. it just stays like that the whole day. Makes one look sick. Next time I tried to apply a tiny tiny amount which was better, but still it leaves a white purple hue. HMM not sure. I am trying to find a good sunscreen for very sensitive skin as some sun screens are actually irritating the skin. I bought this one because of the minerals.</li>
            <li> The only way I see this being way too white is if you apply too much. Every morning before applying my makeup I use this sunscreen. I love it because it doesn&#x27;t break me out and it leaves my skin really smooth. The reason I picked this sunscreen is because it doesn&#x27;t have a harmful ingredient called oxybenzone. Its pricier but worth it.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this on Amazon, but in the Berlin Airport at a pharmacy.  The pharmacist suggested it after I mentioned that I had rosacea and needed something for sensitive skin.  I asked the pharmacist what made it different from others, and she said it was made with minerals, not chemicals.  I have used several weeks and believe the protection element seems better than other products I have used.  It has not caused any irritation to my rosacea. As other readers have noted, because of the zinc oxide, it is very light colored, and can cause the &amp;#34;Casper&amp;#34; look.  I let it soak in for a little while, then put liquid make-up over the top, which seems to alleviate that problem.  I see that Avene&#x27; makes a tinted sunblock but I don&#x27;t think it is a mineral based sunblock.  I gave it a 4 for the color, not its ability to work as a sunblock.</li>
            <li> I used this on my face, and normal sunscreen on my body in Cancun.  Never re-applied.  My body burned, my face did not.  Now I use this all over when I go to the beach, or exercise outdoors.  I don&#x27;t care about the price, it&#x27;s worth never burning!</li>
            <li> Does go on a bit light, but once you put on your foundation or BB cream, it blends in well. Great sun protection!</li>
            <li> I had an alergy, lot of acne after aply.</li>
            <li> Many years ago my dermologist recomended this sunscreen, and since then is the only one I use for my face,&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive and mix skin, and this product offers me the protection that I need and serves well as a base since its tint help to even the skin tone before the foundation, I love it!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, this product have good coverage and something that would blend in well on my skin. This is strong, but made my face somewhat chalky and pale...I have to wear face podwer to get natural color skin...</li>
            <li> Avene is the best product line that I have found for sensitive and acne prone skin. I noticed a brightness in my skin what seemed immediately. I love this, I just wish it was less so I could cover my entire body, but I guess that were is aveno spf comes in play. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product ,I like it,good!It really helps in severe sun.Weather is getting warmmer and warmmer in OH,so be prepared for it.</li>
            <li> I really like this on top of the rich optimale, but, there&#x27;s always a but, I wish the color was more yellow than pink. This works great for rosacea....when I go kayaking or to work. I didn&#x27;t ding a star for color because the product performance was more impt to me.</li>
            <li> My friends recommended this for me and I absolutely love it! My skin is sensitive so when I use this product, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. This is my go to sun block! I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The sunblock was recommended and it is smooth but it still looks alittle chalky due to the zinc oxide-It seems to work.</li>
            <li> good skin protector for the California sun. I like to use it in  the summer time. it smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for really strong sun protection, good coverage and something that would blend in well on my skin.  This is strong, but made my face very yellow and somewhat chalky.  Plus, if you are sensitive to heavier coverage creams this can trigger skin eruptions.  Unfortunately had to toss it...</li>
            <li> Great product higlhly recommed For all beach sport or outdoor sport. Stays on doesnt make my face Sweat. You wont regret it. Dont Apply too much or your face Will be white.  I use it For sports And beach not For daily use</li>
            <li> Great Product and received it quickly.</li>
            <li> The consistency, feel, and protection is superb.  The tint is a bit too light for&lt;br /&gt;my skin and leaves a ghost look on face for a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,it makes me happy, my hands are not dry like before.it is the best hand cream. I love it.</li>
            <li> its lightly tinted. If u have fair skin, this covers slight blemishes and dark spots. Makes your skin appear lighter, more even and misty. I love it. My skin is super sensitive, but It sure does love Avene. This is the second Avene product I&#x27;ve bought and I am hooked for life.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen for sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> Turns my skin white, and I&#x27;m fair skinned. Needs a lot to get it to blend in, but a good sun protector. A very small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great sunblock. I used it all summer long. My skin color is fair, so it was not noticeable on my face. However, for people of a darker complexion it might be different. I really like the fact that my skin did not itch or burn when I applied the cream (My skin is sensitive to all other commercial products). Nor did it have a typical sunblock smell. I would totally recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only sunscreen that I use since I have intolerant skin. Other sunscreens cause a rash, but not this one. I recently vacationed in Fiji and this sunscreen was always with me. Just slathered it on my face and body and my skin was protected. After any water sports, I would just reapply. Lasts long on your skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a 45+ SPF protection tinted sunscreen for my face. I found this one which seemed like a good option. Two things I don&#x27;t like: It&#x27;s a little too light for my skin (I&#x27;m latina) and  it tends to make my face oilier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying it for a week, I found the best way to use it. I decided to avoid using my pressed powder on top, otherwise I&#x27;d look like Casper!. Now I only use the cream, wait 2 minutes until it gets absorbed and then put my make up on and seems to work well.  Also, found that if I just put enough to cover all the areas of my face/neck, then it blends better with my skin tone. This also helps to minimize the oily feel, specially at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Makes me look like a ghost.  My daughter likes it.  I got a sunburn wearing, but I was out in the sun for a very long time.  Overall I think it&#x27;s good, but there may be better options cheaper.</li>
            <li> great! fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and love it.  Thank you for having it available.  I will order more again soon</li>
            <li> Almost 3 yrs ago I was diagnosed with Dermatomyositis, a condition that affects the muscles and skin.  My skin is not only sensitive to light but also fluorescent light, a few minutes outside or in a department store makes my skin itch and burn, it literally is equivalent to a sunburn. I have tried just about every product available for sunblock but found that all of these products dried out and irritated my skin.  A dermatologist suggested i try Avene SPF50.  I am extremely pleased with the results!  If you find it too greasy to put under makeup, I found that waiting 10-15 minutes does the trick.</li>
            <li> I use this product more than 10 years, nice and really good price here!</li>
            <li> Close to what I had expected however it was slightly thinner than the same product I purchased elsewhere some years ago.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I thought it would be.  I was looking for a product with 50 sunscreen and a little tint to even out the skin.</li>
            <li> i donot use it right now, and it seems good.</li>
            <li> As lots of reviews said it looks like foundation, too white, definitely not good for tanned skin people. I used it as my daily foundation, not greasy, I have no problem with it.</li>
            <li> nice to skin- no break outs. slightly tinted, so you donÂ´t look all white after applying and very good protection from sun. Like it a lot.</li>
            <li> it light my skin, i liked it.  I feel i need used more when i go outside. my skin looks a little bit too oil. but i feel good.</li>
            <li> I really like Avene products because they seem well-researched, contain effective ingredients, and aren&#x27;t expensive. This cream has pretty high zinc and titanium oxide levels so I feel confident when I put it on that I&#x27;m getting good coverage. It does take some time to work it into my skin until my normal color shows, even with the tint, but it doesn&#x27;t clog my skin. There is residual chalkiness but that just tells me there&#x27;s mineral protection. The seller I patronized sent the package quickly and I was happy to see the expiration date is a year away, meaning it&#x27;s not old stock.</li>
            <li> Avene is a great bargain, and recommended by skin care professionals</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t go a day without it !!!</li>
            <li> I just ordered for my friends. They like it. However, they still think about the disconnected product that were made frim this company.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT ,I LOVE IT ,,I LIKE IT ,I LOVE IT ,,I LIKE IT ,I LOVE IT ,,I LIKE IT ,I LOVE IT ,,</li>
            <li> Higo protection without leave spats in your skin.</li>
            <li> This product worked exceedingly well for me. I am light skinned and need a powerful blocker that this product has. I am very pleased with the product and would recommend it to others who fear skin lesions, etc.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I am also very pale. I had almost given up on a face cream with SPF that could work for me, but this is it! love love love it! not only does it protect my skin from the sun, it has calmed it down and it looks great (bonus!) will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I used to buy it when living in Europe and then when moved to US had to stock up everytime I visit there...I am so happy that this brand is now available in US! I have a pretty senstive skin and find this cream non-irritating and effective (broad spectrum protection). I believe that EU has a stricker policies for pharmaceuticals and cosmetics so I think this product is safer than many that were made in US.</li>
            <li> Too bright.....and smell weird..</li>
            <li> The best protection cream I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there will be a light hue, so if your skin is darker, it is probably not the best cream for you. My skin is white and this cream is absolutely perfect for my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;The best out there.</li>
            <li> The coloring is too white.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this sunscreen except that it costs so much.  All sunscreen seems to be expensive and the higher the SPF, the more expensive it is.  I have to wonder if it isn&#x27;t some kind of racket between the medical profession or the journalists who write about it and the sunscreen makers.  You are not supposed to go out without it and it is not effective if you don&#x27;t slather it on pretty heavily, but it is very expensive and usually comes in small containers, so how can most people afford that?  I also would like to point out that it is my opinion that some of the ingredients in many sunscreens might actually cause the cancer you are using it to prevent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I do see what others mean by it turning your skin white.  That does not bother me since I am an older person and I like having my skin tone appear to be a lighter shade.  It does make your face glow or appear luminous, and it does not seem difficult to apply to me.  It also does not irritate my skin or make me break out.  However, I have come across some similar, maybe even more hypoallergenic products that are quite a bit less expensive, although still in a small container -- I suppose it would be prohibitive to make it in a large enough container to last you a while if you slather it as instructed...and I will be purchasing those in the future.  I have to wonder about some of the reviews on Amazon that claim miraculous results from using certain products.  It is my educated opinion, that beyond moisturizing, giving sun protection and not causing your face to break out, nothing else of a miraculous nature will come out of using this.</li>
            <li> Everything ok as announced. The product is excellent. I recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this cream 20 days ago, but for Two things I don&#x27;t like: It&#x27;s a little too light for my skin ( my skin is a little dark) and it tends to make my face oilier.</li>
            <li> Really keeps my face protected from the sun.  I have pale skin, age 38, and battling age spots/hyperpigmentation.  I&#x27;ve tried various drug store brands that tout 110 SPF but they did not work.  This product does leave a slight white cast on my face, but a little bronzes helps that out.  Can&#x27;t live without this product in the summer.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!!!, I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Avene is a wonderful product. My skin feels so much more supple and softer when I use this product. Thank you for sending me the extra goodies- shampoo and conditioner. That is always a plus.</li>
