            <li>They are great.</li>
            <li>Great for putting lotion on when I sleep at night.  </li>
            <li>Apply moisturizer and slip these on; your feet will look and feel amazing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These wear out very easily.</li>
            <li>These are very comfortable, according to my wife.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>About to order more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d feel better if these were maybe $2.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got these gloves from Amazon.</li>
            <li>go to bed bath and beyond for better gloves.  </li>
            <li>i will invest in better quality gloves</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d flip out more if they weren&#x27;t $4.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing any more gloves from your company anytime soon..</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing any more gloves from your company anytime soon.</li>
            <li>and I did like those much better.  </li>
            <li>and I love these gloves for sleeping in.  </li>
            <li>I love the pattern and the shipping was speedy and my package arrived well protected and undamaged.</li>
            <li>I love these moisture gloves.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>They are light and cool, I apply virgin coconut oil and pure shea butter for my eczema, and they are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is a real theft of good money.</li>
            <li>They keep my hands warm but not too warm which is such a blessing because I tend to be more hot blooded and get warm really easily which always results in me tearing off the gloves five minutes after putting them on, and therefore they aren&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li>And the pattern is pretty cute to boot!</li>
            <li>Basically this is a huge scam and Amazon</li>
            <li>i thought it looked cheap and</li>
            <li>They fit on my hands, but I wish they were a bit longer.</li>
            <li>(My kind of eczema results in the skin on my hands not being able to absorb moisture properly.</li>
            <li>good for using moisturizing products at night, and don&#x27;t get too stretched out, and  are easily washed</li>
            <li>Received them quickly - fit nicely - typing still easy and best part - I can still use my touch screen smartphone while wearing them ... now to heal my rough dry hands with the help of these soft comfy gloves!!!</li>
            <li>They are nice and soft, but sometimes fall off during the night.</li>
            <li>Cool.  </li>
            <li>Received quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>fine them comfortable and soft.</li>
            <li>Very effective if used with a heavy moisturizer.</li>
            <li>These are breathable, easy to wear, not overly bulky and so soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure a round through the washer will cure that. :)</li>
            <li>They clean up easily and have gone through several uses.</li>
            <li>I like to wear them to bed, and like many of the moisture gloves on the market they are just too short in the sleeve/wrist area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove(s) fit nicely (I have small hands) and cover my palms well.</li>
            <li>They are soft and smooth and stay clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are soft and fit well.</li>
            <li>These little gloves do not fall off at night and feel more comfortable on my hands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many in the past that have been too easy to attract hair.</li>
            <li>First of all it did ship fast as it came before the estimated time of arrival.  </li>
            <li>I found similar gloves at a local pharmacy for under $2 that do the trick and fit better.</li>
            <li>I first bought them to cover my lotioned-up hands at night, and they worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I love these cotton gloves and use them almost every single night.</li>
            <li>My hands were not horribly dry so they haven&#x27;t made a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>I am pretty small, and the gloves fit fine.  </li>
            <li>But no one knows how to invent a glove that will allow those with Eczema to leave intense moisturizers on their hands overnight to treat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But no one knows how to invent a glove that will allow those with Eczema to leave intense moisturizers on their hands overnight to treat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought these to wear with hand cream overnight - they are very breathable but retain moisture really well.</li>
            <li>Within a week of using nightly they notice that they&#x27;re hands were much softer.</li>
            <li>These do feel nice &amp; soft, but not really the luxury/spa treatment accessory I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Soft, but short, and come off easily during sleep.</li>
            <li>Word to the wise: I got these at my local drug store for about 60% less than what Amazon is selling them for.     </li>
            <li>Material is less cotton and more silk like.  </li>
            <li>Strong little hands</li>
            <li>The fabric is very stretchy, but the seams are NOT, so the entire seam between the index finger &amp; thumb ripped open the first time I put them on.</li>
            <li>I suppose they serve their purpose, but they are extremely thin, absorb most of the lotion you put on your hands, they are overly stretchy, they fit like loose pantyhose.</li>
            <li>These are FAR overpriced in my opinion.</li>
            <li>They are soft and lightweight.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re completely unusable by that point.</li>
            <li>Natural and functional.</li>
            <li>I live with cold-weather eczema on my hands, and since moving to Colorado, it effects me for 3 seasons out of the year, so I have to continually watch out for outbreaks, and prevent them as much as possible, because I make my living using my hands.</li>
            <li>Nice material, but they are a little small.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and have the normal amount of shedding.</li>
            <li>If they are the bamboo rayon variety, they are nice and thin (for hot days) and stretchy enough that they aren&#x27;t too short for average fingers and hands.</li>
            <li>While the gloves are very soft, I wish they were of a bit thicker material and long enough to cover my wrists, because I have to slather my hands with Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream before puting the gloves</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend these enough if you have dry hands.</li>
            <li> I either have super small hands or they changed the sizing because they are actually a little loose on me.</li>
            <li> The fingers are very short &amp; the hand/palm area is too wide for me</li>
            <li> Then my dermatologist said that I should keep my dry hands protected everytime</li>
            <li> Not loose to the point that they fall off but not as tight as I&#x27;d like them to be.</li>
            <li> If I wipe off the grease, my hands are left dry, cracked, and itchy--and eventually the skin will become thick and the cracks will open up like papercuts, bleed, become infected; and cause my hands to turn red, swell, and burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several pairs get holes in them after just a few wks.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call my hands tiny because I work a lot outdoors, heavy work.  </li>
            <li> I got some other brand of cotton gloves and i wanted to bamboo for the quality for my wife.  </li>
            <li> If you have uncommonly small hands and short fingers, these may be the gloves for you.</li>
            <li> Have small hands, agree the product is short on the wrists.  </li>
            <li> The reason that I gave 4 stars rather than 5 was because each glove arrived with a small hole in each seam which has gotten  bigger with use.</li>
            <li> At least one always falls off in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> was a little scared because of all the reviews saying they were child sized or way too tight, etc.</li>
            <li> After opening these TINY THIN gloves.  </li>
            <li> Received ones with a green pattern.  </li>
            <li> They are just a little too small/short on the hands, I&#x27;m a petite 5&#x27;2\\&quot;, size in 7 gloves &amp; sadly these barely cover my palm.  </li>
            <li> I have little hands and the gloves are still too small</li>
            <li> Maybe my hands are small</li>
            <li> Way to small.</li>
            <li> We invented the technology that eventually was used in small electronics like cells phones and computers; all so we could send men to the Moon and beyond.</li>
            <li> We invented the technology that eventually was used in small electronics like cells phones and computers; all so we could send men to the Moon and beyond.</li>
            <li> Some of the competitor&#x27;s products just look a bit ridiculous with the loud patterns and crazy colors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> During Fall, Winter, or Spring, my hands can get this bad in just 2 days, if left untreated.)</li>
            <li> My skin is perpetually dry and between the combination of cold weather, artificial heat and washing my hands fifty times per day, my hands always need a little TLC at night.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I wear a medium size glove, and these gloves are way too small for me.  </li>
            <li> This in no way hinders the use of the gloves, but it was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> also poorly made.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Problem is, your gloves--being made of thin fabric--absorb the moisturizer, and get saturated with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone would invent some sort of moisture-protective gloves that are not made out of a thin fabric; but a thicker, flexible plastic that: 1) Won&#x27;t absorb the moisturizer;</li>
            <li> really like that the gloves don&#x27;t have an insane pattern!  </li>
            <li> Gloves I&#x27;ve used in the past would be horrible about the hairs sticking to them and being so gross.</li>
            <li> Aside from the oddly small size, these gloves aren&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> Do Not buy this product - they are made of bad fabric, but worse they are falling apart at the seams upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Shame on Amazon for carrying bad products like this.</li>
            <li> I hate them.</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fits perfect and they feel nice</li>
            <li> These gloves are simply wonderful.  They hold up and are great for my hands.  Love them.  About to order more</li>
            <li> These are FAR overpriced in my opinion. I suppose they serve their purpose, but they are extremely thin, absorb most of the lotion you put on your hands, they are overly stretchy, they fit like loose pantyhose. The fabric is very stretchy, but the seams are NOT, so the entire seam between the index finger &amp; thumb ripped open the first time I put them on. The fingers are very short &amp; the hand/palm area is too wide for me &amp; I&#x27;m a bigger size person. I would not reccomend these. I&#x27;d feel better if these were maybe $2. I&#x27;m trying to find another pair but definitely will not re-order these.</li>
            <li> Very effective if used with a heavy moisturizer. I like to wear them to bed, and like many of the moisture gloves on the market they are just too short in the sleeve/wrist area. At least one always falls off in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> They are nice and soft, but sometimes fall off during the night. Maybe my hands are small</li>

            <li> I am glad I got these gloves from Amazon. They are soft and lightweight. My hands were not horribly dry so they haven&#x27;t made a significant improvement. I work with paper a lot and thought it would be helpful to moisturize my hands at night. Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> Way to small. I hate them.</li>
            <li> Great gloves.  Received quickly and as advertised.  A+++ transaction!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that big, but these gloves are so tiny.  only the smallest woman could use them.  save your money.  go to bed bath and beyond for better gloves.  also poorly made.</li>
            <li> If they are the bamboo rayon variety, they are nice and thin (for hot days) and stretchy enough that they aren&#x27;t too short for average fingers and hands.</li>
            <li> i thought it looked cheap and the fabric was scratchy, not something i want to use on a regualr basis. i will invest in better quality gloves</li>
            <li> After opening these TINY THIN gloves.  They are not ecotools, they are probably cloth, not bamboo.  Basically this is a huge scam and Amazon needs to boot these guys off of their site.  I&#x27;d flip out more if they weren&#x27;t $4.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These wear out very easily. I&#x27;ve had several pairs get holes in them after just a few wks. Soft, but short, and come off easily during sleep.</li>
            <li> I had bought these gloves for a b-day gift for my wife.  First of all it did ship fast as it came before the estimated time of arrival.  But the reason I am giving this a 1 star is because i did not get what I had purchased.  I got some other brand of cotton gloves and i wanted to bamboo for the quality for my wife.  I tried contacting the seller, Mayabeauty, and all they asked was for me to rate them.  So here I am.  All I want is the product that is in the picture of bamboo and not what i got.</li>
            <li> Nice material, but they are a little small.  They fit on my hands, but I wish they were a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I live with cold-weather eczema on my hands, and since moving to Colorado, it effects me for 3 seasons out of the year, so I have to continually watch out for outbreaks, and prevent them as much as possible, because I make my living using my hands. I&#x27;m a writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these online after searching all over town for gloves I could wear overnight to keep moisurizers on my hands. (My kind of eczema results in the skin on my hands not being able to absorb moisture properly. I cannot just rub lotion all over my hands because it won&#x27;t absorb into the skin; it just leaves a slimy grease all over them, and then I can&#x27;t use them. If I wipe off the grease, my hands are left dry, cracked, and itchy--and eventually the skin will become thick and the cracks will open up like papercuts, bleed, become infected; and cause my hands to turn red, swell, and burn. They&#x27;re completely unusable by that point. During Fall, Winter, or Spring, my hands can get this bad in just 2 days, if left untreated.) While the gloves are very soft, I wish they were of a bit thicker material and long enough to cover my wrists, because I have to slather my hands with Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream before puting the gloves on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, your gloves--being made of thin fabric--absorb the moisturizer, and get saturated with it. Then, I need to put another pair of gloves on (viny) over them to prevent the saturated gloves from leeching moisturizer all over my bed sheets. Of course, the vinyl gloves deteriorate after contact with moisture, so I can only wear them once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone would invent some sort of moisture-protective gloves that are not made out of a thin fabric; but a thicker, flexible plastic that: 1) Won&#x27;t absorb the moisturizer; 2) Won&#x27;t leech the moisturizer all over bed sheets; 3) Won&#x27;t deteriorate after contact with moisture so they can be used over and over; and 4) Will extend beyond the palm to cover the wrists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;America is a country of inventors. We invented the technology that eventually was used in small electronics like cells phones and computers; all so we could send men to the Moon and beyond. But no one knows how to invent a glove that will allow those with Eczema to leave intense moisturizers on their hands overnight to treat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I recently found cotton gloves that are used for the same purpose as your gloves--at my local Dollar Tree Store! I won&#x27;t be purchasing any more gloves from your company anytime soon..

            <li> Word to the wise: I got these at my local drug store for about 60% less than what Amazon is selling them for.     If you have uncommonly small hands and short fingers, these may be the gloves for you. Unfortunately, I wear a medium size glove, and these gloves are way too small for me.  Aside from the oddly small size, these gloves aren&#x27;t too bad.  The bamboo is lightweight and breathes while still retaining heat and moisture.</li>
            <li> Have small hands, agree the product is short on the wrists.  Material is less cotton and more silk like.  I had a different pair of night gloves that were made of 100% cotton and I did like those much better.  Gloves do stay in place all night.</li>
            <li> Not as pictured.  Received ones with a green pattern.  Poor fit. Overpriced.  Would not order again.  I found similar gloves at a local pharmacy for under $2 that do the trick and fit better.</li>
            <li> Received them quickly - fit nicely - typing still easy and best part - I can still use my touch screen smartphone while wearing them ... now to heal my rough dry hands with the help of these soft comfy gloves!!!</li>
            <li> I am pretty small, and the gloves fit fine.  I wouldn&#x27;t call my hands tiny because I work a lot outdoors, heavy work.  Strong little hands I guess, and I love these gloves for sleeping in.  They are light and cool, I apply virgin coconut oil and pure shea butter for my eczema, and they are wonderful.  Like the footies too.  The coolness is the charm, and I can still read my Nook in bed, you can touchscreen with these.</li>
            <li> Great. Apply moisturizer and slip these on; your feet will look and feel amazing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that the gloves don&#x27;t have an insane pattern!  Some of the competitor&#x27;s products just look a bit ridiculous with the loud patterns and crazy colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove(s) fit nicely (I have small hands) and cover my palms well.</li>
            <li> They are great. At night I slather shea butter on my hands and then put the gloves on.  Natural and functional.</li>
            <li> I have bought these gloves from Amazon twice.  I first bought them to cover my lotioned-up hands at night, and they worked very well.  Then my dermatologist said that I should keep my dry hands protected everytime I am outside, so I use the second pair for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I have little hands and the gloves are still too small</li>
            <li> I bought these to wear with hand cream overnight - they are very breathable but retain moisture really well. I love the pattern and the shipping was speedy and my package arrived well protected and undamaged. The reason that I gave 4 stars rather than 5 was because each glove arrived with a small hole in each seam which has gotten  bigger with use. This in no way hinders the use of the gloves, but it was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love these moisture gloves. I&#x27;ve tried many in the past that have been too easy to attract hair. I have long hair and have the normal amount of shedding. Gloves I&#x27;ve used in the past would be horrible about the hairs sticking to them and being so gross. I don&#x27;t have that problem with these. They are soft and smooth and stay clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little scared because of all the reviews saying they were child sized or way too tight, etc. I either have super small hands or they changed the sizing because they are actually a little loose on me. Not loose to the point that they fall off but not as tight as I&#x27;d like them to be. I&#x27;m sure a round through the washer will cure that. :)</li>
            <li> fine them comfortable and soft. good for using moisturizing products at night, and don&#x27;t get too stretched out, and  are easily washed</li>
            <li> Great for putting lotion on when I sleep at night.  They are soft and fit well.</li>
            <li> I love these cotton gloves and use them almost every single night. My skin is perpetually dry and between the combination of cold weather, artificial heat and washing my hands fifty times per day, my hands always need a little TLC at night. These are breathable, easy to wear, not overly bulky and so soft! They keep my hands warm but not too warm which is such a blessing because I tend to be more hot blooded and get warm really easily which always results in me tearing off the gloves five minutes after putting them on, and therefore they aren&#x27;t as effective. I can&#x27;t recommend these enough if you have dry hands. And the pattern is pretty cute to boot!</li>
            <li> Does the job well. I bought these for a friend and they use them while they sleep. Within a week of using nightly they notice that they&#x27;re hands were much softer.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Cool.  iPhone compatible.  Only thing I don&#x27;t care for is they are short on the wrist</li>
            <li> This is a real theft of good money. Do Not buy this product - they are made of bad fabric, but worse they are falling apart at the seams upon arrival. Worthless. Shame on Amazon for carrying bad products like this.</li>
            <li> I had been using the white cotton gloves on my hands at night and they would fall off in bed.  These little gloves do not fall off at night and feel more comfortable on my hands.  would never go back to the white cotton gloves after buying a pair of these.  They hold the moisture in your hands, not in the gloves!</li>
            <li> These are very comfortable, according to my wife. She wears them every night to help with her psoriatic arthritis. They clean up easily and have gone through several uses.</li>
