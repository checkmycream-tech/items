            <li>great smell</li>
            <li>They smell great, too.</li>
            <li>This morning, I ran out of the good conditioner</li>
            <li>I am a conditioner addict, I admit it and it feels good to say it.</li>
            <li>Huge mistake!!</li>
            <li>Daughter&#x27;s favorite!</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>I love a good deal, so took advantage of this one when I saw it.  </li>
            <li>Comes with convenient pump and fits nicely inside the shower.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, looks great, and the pump makes it super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Good product and I bought it monthly when it was available on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, the pump is convienent, and the shampoo/conditioner is good.</li>
            <li>No heavy build up, rinses easy, and the pump works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li>When I bought this product, my hair was shiny and healthy, but lacked volume.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks much better since I started using this with the matching shampoo.</li>
            <li>Save even more with Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Ship.</li>
            <li>I love some Aussie conditioner.</li>
            <li>I put way more than the recommend amount.</li>
            <li>I have fairly fine hair that tends to get oily easily.</li>
            <li>I also use garnier fructis conditioners and enjoy those as well.  </li>
            <li>One bottle lasts several months and is a great deal.</li>
            <li>It is great for it is very good for moisturizing and keeping smooth my easily tangled, long hair without weighing it down or being greasy.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see that Amazon had these huge 2 pack pump bottles for $10</li>
            <li>Great Price and does not weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li>My order was processed and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair fresh, rinses well.</li>
            <li>after using them, so I stopped and bought a different kind.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is pretty mild, but that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Great Aussie product as usual</li>
            <li>I used to use Aussie shampoo and conditioner all the time, but recently, I bought this (huge) bottle of conditioner along with a (huge) bottle of shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is a great deal considering the big pump bottles at my local store cost about $7 a piece.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell, but it did not moisturize my hair enough and my hair was very tangled after using.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know that it is better than others, but the fragrance goes with the same brand shampoo, so I get it to match.</li>
            <li>My fiance even asked what happened to my hair and noted that it was &amp;#34;so shiny and pretty around the holidays&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This is not my first time with this conditioner...</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I know there are better conditioners out there for healthier hair.</li>
            <li>We are enjoying using our favorite shampoo and conditioner, and I would certainly make the same purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>Same as most decent conditioners.</li>
            <li>I wish I had not purchased the large bottle.</li>
            <li>thanks Aussie</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used Aussie before so either this is not the real shampoo, or Aussie</li>
            <li>and it really does help your hair according to her.</li>
            <li>Once I used it for about a month straight</li>
            <li>I do recommend this to anyone who wants some added volume to their hair.</li>
            <li>I have long hair down to my waist and it works great.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but it almost has the consistency of just plain water.</li>
            <li>Every once in a while I drift over to the more expensive brands to see if they do more than the Aussie products do, and they don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Good price, two big bottles that last a long time.</li>
            <li>It does not detangle hair like a normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>I bought a smaller bottle of this to try first and while it isn&#x27;t a miracle worker at adding volume, it does add volume and gives my hair a luxurious feel.</li>
            <li>Aussie is a little more affordable, especially with the subscribe and save discount.</li>
            <li>I leaves my hair so soft and shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and they give you a massive amount of it.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with Aussie in general, because the different types really are different (unlike other brands I&#x27;ve purchased in the past) and seem to work as advertised without a huge expense.</li>
            <li>only recieved 1 of 2 conditioners very upset that i paid for two and only got one and tried to call and but couldnt get thru</li>
            <li>The only thing I can think of is that Aussie added some ingredients to their old formula.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have an itchy or dry scalp, and no other brand causes this problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to take some time to get my hair back to normal, which REALLY sucks since I am getting married in July!</li>
            <li>I do occasionally have to supplement the formula with a deep conditioner, but still highly recommend this product for daily use.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that gets weighed down really easily with typical products.</li>
            <li>but it certainly doesn&#x27;t weight it down either.</li>
            <li>It works really well and conditions without weighing my curls down.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair, but loads of strands.  </li>

            <li> Lots of good ingredients minus some bad</li>
            <li> I only shampoo every couple of weeks, but I work this conditioner into my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> It became dry and fly-away</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out</li>
            <li> I am also still bitter that this product was taken off subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Received what I expected, matches description on product page.</li>
            <li> I use this on my thick naturally curly hair and it helps a lot with tangles.</li>
            <li> This costs less than half what Amazon is charging at the regular store.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product, in this fashion before, not sure if from the same person or not.  </li>
            <li> One other note: don&#x27;t buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my scalp was extremely itchy (like, lice-itchy!)</li>
            <li> I squirt some in my hands and then when I try to rub my hands together and comb the conditioner into my hair, half the stuff falls out of my hands.</li>
            <li> and I thought I&#x27;d just use a little of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a leave in conditioner by towel drying my hair, put a little bit in my palm and rub through my ends.</li>
            <li> and I can usually buy a two pack from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really mad at myself for buying two bottles of this stuff because honestly, it&#x27;s no different than just plain water.</li>
            <li> just sucks.</li>
            <li> After I began using this product, I slowly noticed the texture of my hair changing.  </li>
            <li> However the pump is no good and stops working while there is still a lot of product in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I tend to give them the benefit of the doubt and just say this is a fake.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the remaining product is going where it belongs....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked considering</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> excellent shipment arrived faster than planned thank you</li>
            <li> I use this on my thick naturally curly hair and it helps a lot with tangles. I only shampoo every couple of weeks, but I work this conditioner into my hair every other day. It&#x27;s worked very well, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily, but also minimizes tangles. I also use garnier fructis conditioners and enjoy those as well.  Aussie is a little more affordable, especially with the subscribe and save discount.</li>
            <li> Good price, two big bottles that last a long time. Aussie is my favourite hair product. Smells great, looks great, and the pump makes it super easy to use. I will always buy these!</li>
            <li> only recieved 1 of 2 conditioners very upset that i paid for two and only got one and tried to call and but couldnt get thru</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Aussie before so either this is not the real shampoo, or Aussie just sucks. I tend to give them the benefit of the doubt and just say this is a fake. It smells nice but it almost has the consistency of just plain water. I squirt some in my hands and then when I try to rub my hands together and comb the conditioner into my hair, half the stuff falls out of my hands. Once I put it in my hair, you can&#x27;t even feel that there&#x27;s conditioner and my hair comes out looking like I only shampooed it. I&#x27;m really mad at myself for buying two bottles of this stuff because honestly, it&#x27;s no different than just plain water. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair fresh, rinses well.</li>

            <li> bought for girlfriend she loves it and its cheaper here than in stores def will keep ordering!!! great smell and it really does help your hair according to her.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s cheap, the pump is convienent, and the shampoo/conditioner is good. I have fairly fine hair that tends to get oily easily. The conditioner is pretty mild, but that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I used to use Aussie shampoo and conditioner all the time, but recently, I bought this (huge) bottle of conditioner along with a (huge) bottle of shampoo. I noticed that my scalp was extremely itchy (like, lice-itchy!) after using them, so I stopped and bought a different kind. Problem solved. This morning, I ran out of the good conditioner and I thought I&#x27;d just use a little of this conditioner. Huge mistake!! My scalp is on fire! I can&#x27;t wait until I have a chance to wash my hair and get this garbage out! The only thing I can think of is that Aussie added some ingredients to their old formula. I don&#x27;t normally have an itchy or dry scalp, and no other brand causes this problem.</li>
            <li> Great Aussie product as usual</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair, but loads of strands.  When I bought this product, my hair was shiny and healthy, but lacked volume.  After I began using this product, I slowly noticed the texture of my hair changing.  It became dry and fly-away and I now have a lot of breakage.  My fiance even asked what happened to my hair and noted that it was &amp;#34;so shiny and pretty around the holidays&amp;#34;.  Needless to say, the remaining product is going where it belongs....in the trash.  It&#x27;s going to take some time to get my hair back to normal, which REALLY sucks since I am getting married in July!</li>
            <li> I love a good deal, so took advantage of this one when I saw it.  I have bought this product, in this fashion before, not sure if from the same person or not.  My order was processed and arrived quickly.  We are enjoying using our favorite shampoo and conditioner, and I would certainly make the same purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see that Amazon had these huge 2 pack pump bottles for $10 so of course I ordered them. It is a great deal considering the big pump bottles at my local store cost about $7 a piece. I bought a smaller bottle of this to try first and while it isn&#x27;t a miracle worker at adding volume, it does add volume and gives my hair a luxurious feel. I&#x27;m shocked considering this is just a drug store brand. Once I used it for about a month straight that&#x27;s when I decided to order the two big pump bottles. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out but it certainly doesn&#x27;t weight it down either. I do recommend this to anyone who wants some added volume to their hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that gets weighed down really easily with typical products. Not so with this conditioner. It works really well and conditions without weighing my curls down. My hair looks much better since I started using this with the matching shampoo. I will continue to purchase this type. I am really pleased with Aussie in general, because the different types really are different (unlike other brands I&#x27;ve purchased in the past) and seem to work as advertised without a huge expense. They smell great, too.</li>
            <li> Lots of good ingredients minus some bad and it works great!</li>
            <li> If you like this shampoo, why not save some money.  Comes with convenient pump and fits nicely inside the shower.  If you&#x27;re going to use it anyway, you might as well put a lot of money back in your pocket.  Save even more with Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Ship.</li>
            <li> Great Price and does not weigh my fine hair down. This is not my first time with this conditioner...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner on a daily basis for several years. One bottle lasts several months and is a great deal. I do occasionally have to supplement the formula with a deep conditioner, but still highly recommend this product for daily use.</li>
            <li> I love some Aussie conditioner. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and they give you a massive amount of it. I am a conditioner addict, I admit it and it feels good to say it.

This costs less than half what Amazon is charging at the regular store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aussie products for years and always found them satisfactory.  Every once in a while I drift over to the more expensive brands to see if they do more than the Aussie products do, and they don&#x27;t.  So there&#x27;s no need to spend the extra money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner! I have long hair down to my waist and it works great.I leave it in for about 3 minutes before I rinse it out.I also use it as a leave in conditioner by towel drying my hair, put a little bit in my palm and rub through my ends.</li>
            <li> Received what I expected, matches description on product page. Arrived in the allotted time; I would purchase from here again.</li>
