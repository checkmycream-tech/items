    <ol>
            <li> This palette is a fake!! I ordered it and compared it to a real naked palette. The colors were off and it was lighter! Do not order!</li>
            <li> Love these eye shadows, very pigmented and nice:) and I only paid$23 for this palette. Love it:)</li>
            <li> Is this for real??? 132.00 dl?? Its not even original!</li>
            <li> This was a fake. It was not at all what I expected. I wouldn&#x27;t recomend it. The colors and container do not match the real thing.</li>
            <li> Do not buy! You can get this at sephora  for 52.00!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Is The best!!!</li>
            <li> This palette is definitely a fake and it&#x27;s cheaply made, its to high and or to cheap to b the real naked palette. The real naked palettes are only $54 everywhere!</li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE! not happy especially since I was assured of it&#x27;s autheticity.</li>
            <li> Yall done lost your name if you buy this for one its a fake and its only available from third party sellers HUGE RED FLAG plus this is way more than the real palette is in sephora or ulta. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Spend the money and get the authentic one in stores. Only $50 and well worth the money. The quality of the real palettes is amazing. I own all 3</li>
            <li> Product is great, exactly what I hoped it would be!</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail. The second I opened the lid,  the plastic broke. I compared this to the naked 2 that I have already and this is ridiculously cheaply made next to the original I bought from Ulta. Absolutely cheap. Do not spend $1 on this.  I&#x27;m hoping I can return &amp; a refund but I&#x27;m guessing it will be the biggest head ache.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure  why this priced so high. I paid $23 here ðŸ˜³    01/26/2015- This is such a fake pallet. Ebay sells fake ones for $6, so this price for a fake on is lame. It is sooooo cheaply made. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> This product is a total rip-off.  The Box is authentic but the product inside is fake. The colors are completely off and container is all scratched up.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> It is not authentic, but you get what you pay for. The shadows are easy to use there&#x27;s just a weird texture. The brush is unusable because it&#x27;s too cheap.</li>
            <li> Well, I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it was shipped in a yellow bubble wrap envelope, which wasn&#x27;t stable enough.  The box didn&#x27;t look brand new and was somewhat smashed on the corners.  When I opened the case, the eye shadow pieces had fallen out of their places.  It wasn&#x27;t easy trying to figure out where each one went.  I was not satisfied, and if my daughter didn&#x27;t have her heart set on this item, I would&#x27;ve returned it!</li>
