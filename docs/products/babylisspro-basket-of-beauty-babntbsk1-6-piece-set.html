            <li>The hair dryer is the true winner from all the appliances in the kitty as it works amazingly well to dry down my hair in jiffy.</li>
            <li>I was getting good value of money with so many sick attachment in a basket</li>
            <li>The.big flatiron only is worth the expense.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money, only took 4 days for it to come in as well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist &amp; I purchased this as a gift to myself</li>

            <li> Not a fan.&lt;br /&gt;For further review on this flat iron check my blog:</li>
            <li> After flat ironing my hair ,  i have a fabulos shine on my hair.  </li>
            <li> have issues with the flat iron for which I decided to buy the basket all together.</li>
            <li> It was the same price for all this as I spent on just the flat iron alone!</li>
            <li> The blow dryer makes my hair so shiny, it cut my drying time in half, and it&#x27;s quiet.</li>
            <li> In additions, no snags, the iron heats up in 15 sec.  </li>
            <li> As expected and advertised.</li>
            <li> I wish I would of known about this when I purchased my babyliss flat iron a few months before.</li>
            <li> With all my past flat irons I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> I have very thick course hair, and the flat iron straightened it after 1 pass over it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it has to do something with flat iron being so lightweight that it is unable to straighten my hair.</li>

            <li> This basket full of goodies will please anyone who styles their hair.  The.big flatiron only is worth the expense.  After flat ironing my hair ,  i have a fabulos shine on my hair.  In additions, no snags, the iron heats up in 15 sec.  I would recommend this treasure trove of goodies!!</li>
            <li> This was an amazing buy! I wish I would of known about this when I purchased my babyliss flat iron a few months before. It was the same price for all this as I spent on just the flat iron alone!</li>
            <li> Amazing basket of awesome tools! Well worth the price.</li>

            <li> Amazing basket of pro tools. I am a professional cosmetologist and these tools are great and so is the price! The hair dryer leaves the hair shiny and silky. Love these tools!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this basket! I have very thick course hair, and the flat iron straightened it after 1 pass over it. The blow dryer makes my hair so shiny, it cut my drying time in half, and it&#x27;s quiet. Id recommend this to anyone who may be considering purchasing it!</li>
            <li> Well, I should have known when the price is too good to be true, its too good to be true. All products are manufactured in China. I was getting good value of money with so many sick attachment in a basket and so I bought it. The hair dryer is the true winner from all the appliances in the kitty as it works amazingly well to dry down my hair in jiffy. The curling iron and mini flat iron are like good enough products and they get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;I have issues with the flat iron for which I decided to buy the basket all together. Flat iron instruction guide suggest that for fine hair use temp setting 11-20 and when I did..viola..nothing happened!!!. My hair is fine and brittle but wavy and frizzy at same time. Maybe it has to do something with flat iron being so lightweight that it is unable to straighten my hair. I had to increase temp to 40 to get my hair straight and even then, it was bit curvy in the ends. SO overall except the flat iron, a really good kit. Oh yeah the brushes are major suck fest. Not a fan.&lt;br /&gt;For further review on this flat iron check my blog: http://beautyisinsession.blogspot.in/</li>
