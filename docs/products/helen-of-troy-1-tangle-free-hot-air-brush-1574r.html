            <li>I was happy to see they still make them and I was able to buy this one off Amazon.  </li>
            <li>If you want more curl this is a great curl brush.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad!  </li>
            <li>This hot air brush is the perfect size for my hair length.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It is great easy to use.</li>
            <li>very easy to use does not get too hot, it works best on damp hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tube is made of plastic and the air coming out it lukewarm to warm.</li>
            <li>and she is thrilled.</li>
            <li>Nice handle.</li>
            <li>Nice tool, but not for longer hair.  </li>
            <li>However; it was still quite effective.</li>
            <li>This is the best hot air brush I have ever had, and I&#x27;ve had many.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job and quite quickly to style the hair.  </li>
            <li>By the way,  my old brush still works perfectly!</li>
            <li>First, the idea of this brush is great:  </li>
            <li>Great curling brush, easy to use, quick styling</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to style my hair after a shower!</li>
            <li>I had a Belson hot air brush and used it happily for many years almost every day.</li>
            <li>Also good for quick touch-ups</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love Helen of Troy products</li>
            <li>Of course, they don&#x27;t make it any more.</li>
            <li>Was going to return this and am glad I did not, my Conair blew up after 2 months.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love these and keep buying them ....  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I had 1 from &amp;#34;Helen of Troy&amp;#34; and it lasted more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love everything about this brush.....</li>
            <li>This product has been part of my hair care arsenal for many years now.</li>
            <li>Have purchased six of these over the years because I love the way it works for me.</li>
            <li>I love this styling brush.  </li>
            <li>It does the job just  as well, though, so it is OK.</li>
            <li>Just wish the blow dryer was better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have used this for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a competitor out there like itâ€¦unfortunately.  </li>
            <li>When and if I find a comparable product that works better, I&#x27;ll buy it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li>Perfect hot air brush, never fails, so dependable.</li>
            <li>ANYTHING is better than this for me.  </li>
            <li>I also love the semi-flexible bristles--they don&#x27;t scratch the scalp.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I loved this hot air brush in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>I had one of these Helen Of Troy hot air brushes which I used for years, and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>They are perfect for uncoordinated people like me who can&#x27;t use a brush and a blow dry simultaneously.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use and does not fry my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the rotating brush, the &amp;#34;curl release&amp;#34; control, and the easy to clean construction.  </li>
            <li>also didn&#x27;t like how easily it got stuck when I rolled it up in my hair.</li>
            <li>Nice hot temp</li>
            <li>I also liked how the hot brush immediately cooled when turning it off.  </li>
            <li>wanted to try this (after my Conair BC171NCS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush&#x27;s heating element stopped working after a year) since it was the highest rated product of its kind on Amazon</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled with the 1\\&quot; Helen of Troy Hot Brush.  </li>
            <li>I have fine an thinning hair.</li>
            <li>choice of speed and comfortable handle.</li>
            <li>I am talented enough to still be able to get my curl tangled, but it doesn&#x27;t happen often.</li>
            <li>There is a nice volume of warm air coming out to dry it.  </li>
            <li>I got this for quickly doing my hair and felt like if it were more powerful it would have helped.</li>
            <li>Love this hot air brush.</li>
            <li>I am now ordering the Conair Inifinty Pro curling iron brush (with hot air) and hope that is will work better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using a Helen of Troy hot air brush for many years.  </li>
            <li>It is best to use this on hair that does not have any oils in it when freshly washed and towel dried.</li>
            <li>The two-speed blower is nice and fast unlike the hot brushes I bought at the drugstores.</li>
            <li>If you have soft-silky hair, you will be able to get flowing gentle curls if you turn the rod from end to root.</li>
            <li>I got one longer wig &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; in the bristles and was able to turn it off and then pull off the brush end and gently untangle it with no damage to the wig.  </li>
            <li>The brush will tend to overheat and refuse to start again if you turn it off, but it will work again if you let it cool.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in a hurry, use your blow dryer on the cool setting to cool off the brush faster.</li>
            <li>If you like the sort of old Hollywood kind of curls</li>
            <li>The second one hasn&#x27;t been nearly as good.  </li>
            <li>Cool name.</li>
            <li>It works great on my fine limp hair and no tangling.</li>
            <li>These are the best hair dryers for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>The barrel doesn&#x27;t get very hot</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a smaller size, but I am still very pleased.</li>
            <li>Now it works like new and she is not cranky any more.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li>Great product, really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Made in China, and not so great or long lasting any more, I guess.  </li>
            <li>When I decided to order a new brush, I was thrilled to see that the same style number (#1574R) was still available!  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fairly gentle on fine,</li>
            <li>I think the Helen of Troy 1\\&quot; Tangle Free, works very well</li>
            <li>I particularly like that the bristles are easily removed for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>This product does not get warm enough, and seems to just flatten my hair.</li>
            <li>well worth it since I have arthritis</li>
            <li>The price is much better on this than the store where I purchased the old one.  </li>
            <li>Best way to use it is to blow dry your hair until just a tiny bit damp and then use the hot air brush to curl.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size for my layered hair.  </li>
            <li>It would look great at first, but after a few hours the volume would be gone.</li>
            <li>I gave this an okay rating because it seems to create static and leaves my hair frizzier than the hot air brush I used previously.</li>
            <li>Great product, however, it only lasts about 1 1/2 years with daily use.  </li>
            <li>This kind of brush works very well on my short hair.</li>
            <li>Very light plastic and not enough power to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>Have used the Vidal Sassoon and Helen of Troy hot air brushes for decades.</li>
            <li>I found that it was easily fixed by removing excess hair which was clogging both  ends of the unit preventing free air flow.  </li>
            <li>I keep replacing the item since I haven&#x27;t found it made any better by a different company.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I used one exactly like it that a friend had</li>
            <li>I have been using the Helen of Troy Tangle-Free Hot Air Brushes for years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try it one more time before I send it back.</li>
            <li>I also have the 1 and 1/2 in Helen of Troy Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush and like it as well, but when I shut it off</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the difference this hot air brush makes.</li>
            <li>I just tried to use this product for the first time.  </li>
            <li>On a good day it works well, but sometimes I have trouble releasing the curl.  </li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; of the brush don&#x27;t get caught so easily in the hair (if you are very carefully rolling up the ends), and there is a &amp;#34;release&amp;#34; button you push to make the barrel free wheeling</li>
            <li>This is a very wimpy hot air brush.</li>
            <li>It will not completely fix frizzing from friction but it did make the 4 wigs I used it on look much better.  </li>
            <li>This hot brush works really well.</li>
            <li>You simply need to unscrew the tip, and the bristles slide off the metal rod easily.  </li>
            <li>B0018CBBPW Helen of Troy 1574 Tangle Free Hot Air Brush, White, 1 Inch Barrel]]</li>
            <li>Did not give hair much lift.</li>
            <li>You just don&#x27;t won&#x27;t to put too much hair around it or it will over heat and shorten the life of the brush.</li>
            <li>I have another one that looks just like the one pictured, but which cost twice as much from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>I do not believe this will work well on very course kinky hair.</li>
            <li>Now I have hair pulled out, a whole patch on the side of my head.  </li>
            <li>but I was REALLY DISAPPOINTED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really consider wattage when purchasing this</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>and it really does untangle the hair from the brush.</li>
            <li>I went to a local store and bought a new one that is working just fine.  </li>
            <li>My wife used this product for years and loved it, but recently it overheated and would not work until it cooled down.  </li>
            <li>Maybe this is the first sign that it is getting too old.  </li>
            <li>but still cool enough to be used on synthetic wig hair if you want to change the style.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my five-year-old Conair 1&amp;#34; Hot Air Brush, but this does not come close to doing the curling/shaping/styling actions of my old Conair brush.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that the latest one I purchased constantly overheats and stops working.</li>
            <li>Holds my hair in place to get a good curl and only needs a few seconds on each section of hair.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is moderately short, then you will have no problem; it doesn&#x27;t get very hot though.</li>
            <li>This model seems less powerful and though it still dries and styles like previous models, it seems to get hotter more quickly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS STYLING TOOL</li>
            <li>I say unfortunately because the quality isn&#x27;t so great and seems to have degraded over the years.  </li>
            <li>and so cannot use both hands to use a normal curling iron.</li>
            <li>I use my normal hair dryer at first to damp dry my hair, then switch to the hot air brush.</li>
            <li>My work around is to push the button and manually unroll the brush, and that works, the the basic function should be such that I don&#x27;t have to do this, it should just unroll easily while the button is pressed.  </li>
            <li>This one will turn back on right after I shut it off.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, hair and it takes me a long time to dry it using this.</li>
            <li>In a few minutes, with little effort my hair looks great.</li>
            <li>When they quit I buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this brush.  </li>
            <li>This is low enough heat that it worked great to give some life back to a few wigs that I love but had gotten a little droopy and frizzed on the ends.  </li>
            <li>This is my third hot air brush in about 10 years.  </li>
            <li>After I bought my first one, several people asked me what I was doing differently--great product.</li>
            <li>only hot air brush I have ever used or ever will</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t last a really long time, but for the price, is fine.  </li>
            <li>It is so much easier than juggling a blow dryer and a brush, and having the hair partly dry to start with speeds up the whole process.  </li>
            <li>I know it isn&#x27;t too hot nor has it been on for too long when it does this.  </li>
            <li>I have had several of this exact same hot air brush and they have lasted for several months.  </li>
            <li>The cord became damaged on my old air brush.  </li>
            <li>The bush provides a soft curl and is not damaging to your hair.</li>
            <li>My first one worked well and lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>I use a blow dryer to get my hair 70-80% dry, then use the hot air brush to style and finish drying.  </li>
            <li>Wash my hair, dry it 2/3 of the way and then use my Helen of Troy hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine just past shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>I also like the extra long electric cord since my outlet is pretty far from my mirror.  </li>
            <li>AND IT NEVER FAILS TO PERFORM AS EXPECTED.</li>
            <li>I have very coarse thick hair and the shorter bristles on many brushes does not work for me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I quite have it down yet on how to work it right.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thought of trying other hot air brushes, but if it ain&#x27;t broke, why fix it.</li>
            <li>This is a lightweight, plastic piece of junk that DOES entangle my below-shoulder length, thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li>This particular brush only lasted a week and totally stopped working.  </li>
            <li>and if your not careful, you will have to cut your hair to get it out.  </li>
            <li>It is apparently the proffesional model, because this one is not well made by comparison.</li>
            <li>If you want to dry your hair and curl it at the same time, this really works.  </li>
            <li>but it has a tendency to make my hair very curly on the other hand.</li>
            <li>I either let my hair air dry for a few minutes after washing or dry it with a blow dryer briefly first, then curl and finish the drying process with this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s been on and is hot, it won&#x27;t turn back on until it&#x27;s cooled down.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be due to the fact I live in an old house and the electrical system is not terrific.</li>
            <li>so I am not sure I purchased the right one for me.  </li>
            <li>My short hair has gotten quite fine and thin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> great product -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Great price for this very effective product.  </li>
            <li> I love this !!</li>
            <li> I like this because when I want a looser style but still have lift, this comes in very handy.  </li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful curling iron ever!!</li>
            <li> No tangles and nicely styled hair!</li>
            <li> Easy to use with wonderful results</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and the brush holds each swatch of hair perfectly without tangles or breakage.  </li>
            <li> Its always good to go with your instincts.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that this gives you time to replace it.  </li>
            <li> Good for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Darn good product.</li>
            <li> and I am very glad that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see they still make them and I was able to buy this one off Amazon.  </li>
            <li> If you want more curl this is a great curl brush.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad!  </li>
            <li> This hot air brush is the perfect size for my hair length.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It is great easy to use.</li>
            <li> very easy to use does not get too hot, it works best on damp hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tube is made of plastic and the air coming out it lukewarm to warm.</li>
            <li> and she is thrilled.</li>
            <li> Nice handle.</li>
            <li> Nice tool, but not for longer hair.  </li>
            <li> However; it was still quite effective.</li>
            <li> This is the best hot air brush I have ever had, and I&#x27;ve had many.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job and quite quickly to style the hair.  </li>
            <li> By the way,  my old brush still works perfectly!</li>
            <li> First, the idea of this brush is great:  </li>
            <li> Great curling brush, easy to use, quick styling</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to style my hair after a shower!</li>
            <li> I had a Belson hot air brush and used it happily for many years almost every day.</li>
            <li> Also good for quick touch-ups</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love Helen of Troy products</li>
            <li> Of course, they don&#x27;t make it any more.</li>
            <li> Was going to return this and am glad I did not, my Conair blew up after 2 months.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love these and keep buying them ....  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I had 1 from &amp;#34;Helen of Troy&amp;#34; and it lasted more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love everything about this brush.....</li>
            <li> This product has been part of my hair care arsenal for many years now.</li>
            <li> Have purchased six of these over the years because I love the way it works for me.</li>
            <li> I love this styling brush.  </li>
            <li> It does the job just  as well, though, so it is OK.</li>
            <li> Just wish the blow dryer was better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a competitor out there like itâ€¦unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> When and if I find a comparable product that works better, I&#x27;ll buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li> Perfect hot air brush, never fails, so dependable.</li>
            <li> ANYTHING is better than this for me.  </li>
            <li> I also love the semi-flexible bristles--they don&#x27;t scratch the scalp.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I loved this hot air brush in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> I had one of these Helen Of Troy hot air brushes which I used for years, and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> They are perfect for uncoordinated people like me who can&#x27;t use a brush and a blow dry simultaneously.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use and does not fry my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the rotating brush, the &amp;#34;curl release&amp;#34; control, and the easy to clean construction.  </li>
            <li> also didn&#x27;t like how easily it got stuck when I rolled it up in my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice hot temp</li>
            <li> I also liked how the hot brush immediately cooled when turning it off.  </li>
            <li> wanted to try this (after my Conair BC171NCS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush&#x27;s heating element stopped working after a year) since it was the highest rated product of its kind on Amazon</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled with the 1\\&quot; Helen of Troy Hot Brush.  </li>
            <li> I have fine an thinning hair.</li>
            <li> choice of speed and comfortable handle.</li>
            <li> I am talented enough to still be able to get my curl tangled, but it doesn&#x27;t happen often.</li>
            <li> There is a nice volume of warm air coming out to dry it.  </li>
            <li> I got this for quickly doing my hair and felt like if it were more powerful it would have helped.</li>
            <li> Love this hot air brush.</li>
            <li> I am now ordering the Conair Inifinty Pro curling iron brush (with hot air) and hope that is will work better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using a Helen of Troy hot air brush for many years.  </li>
            <li> It is best to use this on hair that does not have any oils in it when freshly washed and towel dried.</li>
            <li> The two-speed blower is nice and fast unlike the hot brushes I bought at the drugstores.</li>
            <li> If you have soft-silky hair, you will be able to get flowing gentle curls if you turn the rod from end to root.</li>
            <li> I got one longer wig &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; in the bristles and was able to turn it off and then pull off the brush end and gently untangle it with no damage to the wig.  </li>
            <li> The brush will tend to overheat and refuse to start again if you turn it off, but it will work again if you let it cool.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in a hurry, use your blow dryer on the cool setting to cool off the brush faster.</li>
            <li> If you like the sort of old Hollywood kind of curls</li>
            <li> The second one hasn&#x27;t been nearly as good.  </li>
            <li> Cool name.</li>
            <li> It works great on my fine limp hair and no tangling.</li>
            <li> These are the best hair dryers for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> The barrel doesn&#x27;t get very hot</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a smaller size, but I am still very pleased.</li>
            <li> Now it works like new and she is not cranky any more.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li> Great product, really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Made in China, and not so great or long lasting any more, I guess.  </li>
            <li> When I decided to order a new brush, I was thrilled to see that the same style number (#1574R) was still available!  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s fairly gentle on fine,</li>
            <li> I think the Helen of Troy 1\\&quot; Tangle Free, works very well</li>
            <li> I particularly like that the bristles are easily removed for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> This product does not get warm enough, and seems to just flatten my hair.</li>
            <li> well worth it since I have arthritis</li>
            <li> The price is much better on this than the store where I purchased the old one.  </li>
            <li> Best way to use it is to blow dry your hair until just a tiny bit damp and then use the hot air brush to curl.  </li>
            <li> Just the right size for my layered hair.  </li>
            <li> It would look great at first, but after a few hours the volume would be gone.</li>
            <li> I gave this an okay rating because it seems to create static and leaves my hair frizzier than the hot air brush I used previously.</li>
            <li> Great product, however, it only lasts about 1 1/2 years with daily use.  </li>
            <li> This kind of brush works very well on my short hair.</li>
            <li> Very light plastic and not enough power to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Have used the Vidal Sassoon and Helen of Troy hot air brushes for decades.</li>
            <li> I found that it was easily fixed by removing excess hair which was clogging both  ends of the unit preventing free air flow.  </li>
            <li> I keep replacing the item since I haven&#x27;t found it made any better by a different company.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I used one exactly like it that a friend had</li>
            <li> I have been using the Helen of Troy Tangle-Free Hot Air Brushes for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it one more time before I send it back.</li>
            <li> I also have the 1 and 1/2 in Helen of Troy Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush and like it as well, but when I shut it off</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference this hot air brush makes.</li>
            <li> I just tried to use this product for the first time.  </li>
            <li> On a good day it works well, but sometimes I have trouble releasing the curl.  </li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; of the brush don&#x27;t get caught so easily in the hair (if you are very carefully rolling up the ends), and there is a &amp;#34;release&amp;#34; button you push to make the barrel free wheeling</li>
            <li> This is a very wimpy hot air brush.</li>
            <li> It will not completely fix frizzing from friction but it did make the 4 wigs I used it on look much better.  </li>
            <li> This hot brush works really well.</li>
            <li> You simply need to unscrew the tip, and the bristles slide off the metal rod easily.  </li>
            <li> B0018CBBPW Helen of Troy 1574 Tangle Free Hot Air Brush, White, 1 Inch Barrel]]</li>
            <li> Did not give hair much lift.</li>
            <li> You just don&#x27;t won&#x27;t to put too much hair around it or it will over heat and shorten the life of the brush.</li>
            <li> I have another one that looks just like the one pictured, but which cost twice as much from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this will work well on very course kinky hair.</li>
            <li> Now I have hair pulled out, a whole patch on the side of my head.  </li>
            <li> but I was REALLY DISAPPOINTED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really consider wattage when purchasing this</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> and it really does untangle the hair from the brush.</li>
            <li> I went to a local store and bought a new one that is working just fine.  </li>
            <li> My wife used this product for years and loved it, but recently it overheated and would not work until it cooled down.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this is the first sign that it is getting too old.  </li>
            <li> but still cool enough to be used on synthetic wig hair if you want to change the style.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my five-year-old Conair 1&amp;#34; Hot Air Brush, but this does not come close to doing the curling/shaping/styling actions of my old Conair brush.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that the latest one I purchased constantly overheats and stops working.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair in place to get a good curl and only needs a few seconds on each section of hair.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is moderately short, then you will have no problem; it doesn&#x27;t get very hot though.</li>
            <li> This model seems less powerful and though it still dries and styles like previous models, it seems to get hotter more quickly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS STYLING TOOL</li>
            <li> I say unfortunately because the quality isn&#x27;t so great and seems to have degraded over the years.  </li>
            <li> and so cannot use both hands to use a normal curling iron.</li>
            <li> I use my normal hair dryer at first to damp dry my hair, then switch to the hot air brush.</li>
            <li> My work around is to push the button and manually unroll the brush, and that works, the the basic function should be such that I don&#x27;t have to do this, it should just unroll easily while the button is pressed.  </li>
            <li> This one will turn back on right after I shut it off.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, hair and it takes me a long time to dry it using this.</li>
            <li> In a few minutes, with little effort my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> When they quit I buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this brush.  </li>
            <li> This is low enough heat that it worked great to give some life back to a few wigs that I love but had gotten a little droopy and frizzed on the ends.  </li>
            <li> This is my third hot air brush in about 10 years.  </li>
            <li> After I bought my first one, several people asked me what I was doing differently--great product.</li>
            <li> only hot air brush I have ever used or ever will</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last a really long time, but for the price, is fine.  </li>
            <li> It is so much easier than juggling a blow dryer and a brush, and having the hair partly dry to start with speeds up the whole process.  </li>
            <li> I know it isn&#x27;t too hot nor has it been on for too long when it does this.  </li>
            <li> I have had several of this exact same hot air brush and they have lasted for several months.  </li>
            <li> The cord became damaged on my old air brush.  </li>
            <li> The bush provides a soft curl and is not damaging to your hair.</li>
            <li> My first one worked well and lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> I use a blow dryer to get my hair 70-80% dry, then use the hot air brush to style and finish drying.  </li>
            <li> Wash my hair, dry it 2/3 of the way and then use my Helen of Troy hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine just past shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> I also like the extra long electric cord since my outlet is pretty far from my mirror.  </li>
            <li> AND IT NEVER FAILS TO PERFORM AS EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse thick hair and the shorter bristles on many brushes does not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I quite have it down yet on how to work it right.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thought of trying other hot air brushes, but if it ain&#x27;t broke, why fix it.</li>
            <li> This is a lightweight, plastic piece of junk that DOES entangle my below-shoulder length, thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li> This particular brush only lasted a week and totally stopped working.  </li>
            <li> and if your not careful, you will have to cut your hair to get it out.  </li>
            <li> It is apparently the proffesional model, because this one is not well made by comparison.</li>
            <li> If you want to dry your hair and curl it at the same time, this really works.  </li>
            <li> but it has a tendency to make my hair very curly on the other hand.</li>
            <li> I either let my hair air dry for a few minutes after washing or dry it with a blow dryer briefly first, then curl and finish the drying process with this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s been on and is hot, it won&#x27;t turn back on until it&#x27;s cooled down.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be due to the fact I live in an old house and the electrical system is not terrific.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure I purchased the right one for me.  </li>
            <li> My short hair has gotten quite fine and thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the wattage, but definitely not hot enough for my hair, yet every time I shut it off it wouldn&#x27;t restart again until the brush was totally cool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since Amazon&#x27;s return policy is to bear the expenses myself, it will be cheaper and less hassle to just throw this out and find a store somewhere in my area where I can buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Nothing was wrong with the old handle but this was a little softer, so I was pleased.  </li>
            <li> This product is just the ticket if you want to blow dry your hair without being too harsh and give yourself a gentle massage at the scalp</li>
            <li> Over the years I have bought both Vidal Sasson and Helen of Troy hot air brushes, probably at least 6 of each.</li>
            <li> It really removes a lot of the frizzyness I usually have in my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced well for how long they last.</li>
            <li> flat ironing...</li>
            <li> For those who need it, the cord is extra long.</li>
            <li> The barrel isn&#x27;t big enough to grip much of my hair, I had to use very small sections at a time.</li>
            <li> Because they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This one feels a little more delicate than my previous one for some reason but it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> but it does have long flexible bristles).</li>
            <li> One was too small and the other too large.  </li>
            <li> As long as Helen of Troy makes &#x27;em, I&#x27;ll buy &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> However, I used it in hotels and other houses and the same thing happens.</li>
            <li> Have been using using this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m letting my hair air dry longer but still appreciate the curl it gives.</li>
            <li> I wait till my hair is only slightly damp, otherwise it takes too long.  </li>
            <li> Two heat levels is another plus whether using the brush on wet hair or using the brush on dry hair.</li>
            <li> ; is actually laughably puny next to the 1000 Watt Conair Hot Air Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Only go from root to tip, after drying to stretch the hair out slightly and tame any possible matting.</li>
            <li> Be careful with longer hair, you can get it tangled up in there</li>
            <li> Now when I use it, if i turn it off and set it down for a few seconds in order to pick up another section of hair,  I hear a \\&quot;click\\&quot; and it will not come back on.  </li>
            <li> The other two eventually expired--they start shutting off about five minutes into use after a number of years.  </li>
            <li> other brushes do.</li>
            <li> I have relatively short hair but the 3/4 &amp;#34; produces too small a curl for my taste.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> I am thinking of getting a second one with a small brush for tighter curls.</li>
            <li> First experience was very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I either let my hair air dry for awhile, as I have thick hair, or partially dry it with my blow dryer, then use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long i have had it now, probably a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> In addition, the bristles are somewhat flexible, which means there is less chance they will snap off.  </li>
            <li> I, unfortunately, put it back in the box and never did try to send it back.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this hot air brush. So easy to use and does not fry my hair. Also good for quick touch-ups</li>
            <li> This is the best hot air brush I have ever had, and I&#x27;ve had many.  This one has several features which appeal to me.  I particularly like that the bristles are easily removed for cleaning.  You simply need to unscrew the tip, and the bristles slide off the metal rod easily.  In addition, the bristles are somewhat flexible, which means there is less chance they will snap off.  I also like the extra long electric cord since my outlet is pretty far from my mirror.  Two heat levels is another plus whether using the brush on wet hair or using the brush on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Easy to use with wonderful results</li>
            <li> Love Helen of Troy products</li>
            <li> I loved this hot air brush in the beginning.  I&#x27;m not sure how long i have had it now, probably a couple of years.  Now when I use it, if i turn it off and set it down for a few seconds in order to pick up another section of hair,  I hear a \\&quot;click\\&quot; and it will not come back on.  It is as though it has overheated, yet I know it isn&#x27;t too hot nor has it been on for too long when it does this.  It is frustrating to have to wait every time it does this for it to recycle and come on again.  Maybe this is the first sign that it is getting too old.  So I&#x27;m looking for another brand this time.  I have a larger 1 1/2 inch curling brush by Conair and it does not do this.</li>
            <li> If you want to dry your hair and curl it at the same time, this really works.  There is a nice volume of warm air coming out to dry it.  I cannot find these in the stores anymore and I am very glad that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> Have used the Vidal Sassoon and Helen of Troy hot air brushes for decades. When they quit I buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People seem to get confused (and from some reviews really mad) about the tangle free aspect of the brush. There is a release button (way to close to the power switch) that releases the brush to roll when you&#x27;re finished with that curl. I am talented enough to still be able to get my curl tangled, but it doesn&#x27;t happen often. If I just pay attention to how I roll it up, it slides out with a perfect curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a piece of tape over the power button so I don&#x27;t turn off the unit when I&#x27;m releasing a curl. If it&#x27;s been on and is hot, it won&#x27;t turn back on until it&#x27;s cooled down. I just use the breaker plug buttons to turn it off and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, course, layered hair. In a few minutes, with little effort my hair looks great. I&#x27;ve thought of trying other hot air brushes, but if it ain&#x27;t broke, why fix it. As long as Helen of Troy makes &#x27;em, I&#x27;ll buy &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> My wife used this product for years and loved it, but recently it overheated and would not work until it cooled down.  I found that it was easily fixed by removing excess hair which was clogging both  ends of the unit preventing free air flow.  Now it works like new and she is not cranky any more.</li>
            <li> Burnt up after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I have permed chin length hair. I had a Belson hot air brush and used it happily for many years almost every day. Of course, they don&#x27;t make it any more. Purchased this as replacement and have not been too happy with it.  I used my Belson on air-dryed hair to soften the waves. This product does not get warm enough, and seems to just flatten my hair. I am now ordering the Conair Inifinty Pro curling iron brush (with hot air) and hope that is will work better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is made of plastic and the air coming out it lukewarm to warm.</li>
            <li> Was going to return this and am glad I did not, my Conair blew up after 2 months.  Its always good to go with your instincts.</li>
            <li> Great product, however, it only lasts about 1 1/2 years with daily use.  I keep replacing the item since I haven&#x27;t found it made any better by a different company.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and I love it. I have replaced it several times. The only problem is that the latest one I purchased constantly overheats and stops working. I thought it might be due to the fact I live in an old house and the electrical system is not terrific. However, I used it in hotels and other houses and the same thing happens. I always remove the hair but that does not eliminate the problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I used one exactly like it that a friend had and she let me try hers.  I don&#x27;t think I quite have it down yet on how to work it right.  On a good day it works well, but sometimes I have trouble releasing the curl.  I have thin hair and my friend has thick hair so I am not sure I purchased the right one for me.  It does work well for my friend though!</li>
            <li> Did not give hair much lift.</li>
            <li> I love these and keep buying them ....  Because they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I got this for quickly doing my hair and felt like if it were more powerful it would have helped. The barrel isn&#x27;t big enough to grip much of my hair, I had to use very small sections at a time. It may work for lightly wavy hair which is thin.</li>
            <li> Great price for this very effective product.  It is easy to use and works very well.  Great for traveling. I should get another for a spare.</li>
            <li> Sadly this was not what I expected. Very light plastic and not enough power to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I like this because when I want a looser style but still have lift, this comes in very handy.  Be careful with longer hair, you can get it tangled up in there and if your not careful, you will have to cut your hair to get it out.  :)  Nice hot temp but still cool enough to be used on synthetic wig hair if you want to change the style.</li>
            <li> This is a brand I trusted. I had 1 from &amp;#34;Helen of Troy&amp;#34; and it lasted more than 10 years. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is my third hot air brush in about 10 years.  The other two eventually expired--they start shutting off about five minutes into use after a number of years.  The good thing is that this gives you time to replace it.  I couldn&#x27;t live without this brush.  Best way to use it is to blow dry your hair until just a tiny bit damp and then use the hot air brush to curl.  After I bought my first one, several people asked me what I was doing differently--great product.</li>
            <li> I have fine an thinning hair. This doesn&#x27;t even work on it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years and it works great.  You just don&#x27;t won&#x27;t to put too much hair around it or it will over heat and shorten the life of the brush. It&#x27;s priced well for how long they last. Mine lasts for 6 months or longer.  And don&#x27;t cover up the vent at the bottom of the brush either.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for my layered hair.  Doesnt tangle and I dont burn myself like I tend to do with a curling iron.  Holds my hair in place to get a good curl and only needs a few seconds on each section of hair.  I recommend this curling brush!</li>
            <li> I love it.  It works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Helen of Troy Tangle-Free Hot Air Brushes for years.  They are perfect for uncoordinated people like me who can&#x27;t use a brush and a blow dry simultaneously.  Unfortunately, they burn out in less than a year.  However, it isn&#x27;t an option for me to use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have both a 3/4&amp;#34; and a 1 1/2&amp;#34; air brush.  One was too small and the other too large.  I&#x27;d hope to get a 1 1/4&amp;#34; but was unable to find one...and I&#x27;m so glad!  The 1&amp;#34; is perfect and it works great!</li>
            <li> I have used Helen of Troy for years and they work great.  This is my 3rd one, different size.  It is the best.  Won&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse thick hair and the shorter bristles on many brushes does not work for me.  Love everything about this brush.....choice of speed and comfortable handle.</li>
            <li> I have had several of this exact same hot air brush and they have lasted for several months.  (I use it every day)  This particular brush only lasted a week and totally stopped working.  I, unfortunately, put it back in the box and never did try to send it back.  I went to a local store and bought a new one that is working just fine.  None of these last forever, but should last longer than a week.</li>
            <li> First experience was very frustrating. I&#x27;m not sure of the wattage, but definitely not hot enough for my hair, yet every time I shut it off it wouldn&#x27;t restart again until the brush was totally cool. I&#x27;ll try it one more time before I send it back.</li>
            <li> This product has been part of my hair care arsenal for many years now. This model seems less powerful and though it still dries and styles like previous models, it seems to get hotter more quickly. I&#x27;m letting my hair air dry longer but still appreciate the curl it gives. It&#x27;s my fourth or fifth buy and well worth it since I have arthritis and so cannot use both hands to use a normal curling iron. Not having to use both a hair dryer and a curler is space saving as well.</li>
            <li> Have purchased six of these over the years because I love the way it works for me. I wish they would last longer.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is the perfect size for my hair length.  I either let my hair air dry for a few minutes after washing or dry it with a blow dryer briefly first, then curl and finish the drying process with this hot air brush.  It gives my hair body without the lines  a curling iron leaves.</li>
            <li> The cord became damaged on my old air brush.  The price is much better on this than the store where I purchased the old one.  The bush provides a soft curl and is not damaging to your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years at times when I didn&#x27;t want to use a regular curling brush.  If it goes out, as electrical appliances do, I&#x27;ll purchase another one.</li>
            <li> I love this styling brush.  It works great on my fine limp hair and no tangling.</li>
            <li> Release tab very hard to push down. Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful curling iron ever!! It is not metal so no burning.  It dries your hair as it is curling and it is the perfect size.  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> These are the best hair dryers for thin, fine hair. Over the years I have bought both Vidal Sasson and Helen of Troy hot air brushes, probably at least 6 of each. The both overheat in about a year, but I think the Helen of Troy lasts a bit longer. No tangles and nicely styled hair!</li>
            <li> The barrel is too big for my hair length. Unfortunately I ordered two of them, one for me and one for my mom.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months and have not had any problems with it.  I also have the 1 and 1/2 in Helen of Troy Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush and like it as well, but when I shut it off I can&#x27;t turn it back on for about 5 minutes.  This one will turn back on right after I shut it off.</li>
            <li> I have another one that looks just like the one pictured, but which cost twice as much from my hairdresser. It is apparently the proffesional model, because this one is not well made by comparison. It does the job just  as well, though, so it is OK.</li>
            <li> This product is just the ticket if you want to blow dry your hair without being too harsh and give yourself a gentle massage at the scalp (It doesn&#x27;t vibrate a lot but it does have long flexible bristles). If your hair is moderately short, then you will have no problem; it doesn&#x27;t get very hot though. It is best to use this on hair that does not have any oils in it when freshly washed and towel dried. If you have soft-silky hair, you will be able to get flowing gentle curls if you turn the rod from end to root. Never try to curl your hair from root to tip with this because it will tangle. Only go from root to tip, after drying to stretch the hair out slightly and tame any possible matting. I do not believe this will work well on very course kinky hair.</li>
            <li> Great! Half the price of &#x27;off the shelf&#x27;, including Wal-mart.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Helen of Troy hot air brush for many years.  When I decided to order a new brush, I was thrilled to see that the same style number (#1574R) was still available!  This comes in three sizes, but I ordered the 1&amp;#34; size again.  I would highly recommend this product.  I love the rotating brush, the &amp;#34;curl release&amp;#34; control, and the easy to clean construction.  By the way,  my old brush still works perfectly!</li>
            <li> may have to return.  stopped working in middle of using it and smelled as if it burned out.</li>
            <li> I love this !! I plan to buy the bigger one next</li>
            <li> This is a very wimpy hot air brush. I have very fine, hair and it takes me a long time to dry it using this. However, I have not gotten my hair tangled up in the brush. Just wish the blow dryer was better. Not a good choice.</li>
            <li> only hot air brush I have ever used or ever will</li>
            <li> I gave this an okay rating because it seems to create static and leaves my hair frizzier than the hot air brush I used previously. Don&#x27;t think it heats up enough BUT at least it doesn&#x27;t overheat and shut off like other brushes do. It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for years.  I just burn them up from extensive use---but will continue to purchase another, and another.</li>
            <li> I had one of these Helen Of Troy hot air brushes which I used for years, and I loved it.  When it finally wore out, I replaced it with what appears to be the same brush with an improved handle.  Nothing was wrong with the old handle but this was a little softer, so I was pleased.  I received this brush on Dec 29, used it about two times a week (so approximately eight times), and on Jan 28 it simply would not turn on.  Neither the test nor reset button makes any difference, and there is no lint caught in it.  It has not been dropped or exposed to any elements, and I used it on my hair after drying.&lt;br /&gt;Since Amazon&#x27;s return policy is to bear the expenses myself, it will be cheaper and less hassle to just throw this out and find a store somewhere in my area where I can buy a new one.  I will not likely be buying this type of item through Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Great curling brush, easy to use, quick styling</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase. Great hair dryer/ styler. Have been using using this product for a very long time. Just needed to replace the one I have been using almost 10 years. Great product, really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this. Easiest way to add volume to the roots!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on my synthetic wigs.  This is low enough heat that it worked great to give some life back to a few wigs that I love but had gotten a little droopy and frizzed on the ends.  It will not completely fix frizzing from friction but it did make the 4 wigs I used it on look much better.  Wigs are very expensive and this was such a small investment to extend their wearable life.  I also liked how the hot brush immediately cooled when turning it off.  I got one longer wig &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; in the bristles and was able to turn it off and then pull off the brush end and gently untangle it with no damage to the wig.  I have no idea how it works on human hair.  I will post an update if my daughter will allow me to curl her hair with it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Was delivered as promised</li>
            <li> My short hair has gotten quite fine and thin. I used a round barrel brush to style my hair. It would look great at first, but after a few hours the volume would be gone. I can&#x27;t believe the difference this hot air brush makes. The volumes stays and I only have to touch-up the following day. I use my normal hair dryer at first to damp dry my hair, then switch to the hot air brush. This is a great product and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My stylist introduced me to this item, and it&#x27;s the only thing she uses to style hair (of any type and length).  I&#x27;ve had mine for several years and use it daily.  Love it! I use a blow dryer to get my hair 70-80% dry, then use the hot air brush to style and finish drying.  It is so much easier than juggling a blow dryer and a brush, and having the hair partly dry to start with speeds up the whole process.  The brush will tend to overheat and refuse to start again if you turn it off, but it will work again if you let it cool.  If you&#x27;re in a hurry, use your blow dryer on the cool setting to cool off the brush faster.</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a year and love it. It works great, gives a lot of body to my hair. I either let my hair air dry for awhile, as I have thick hair, or partially dry it with my blow dryer, then use this. I an so happy that I have 3 sizes, 3/4\\&quot;, 1\\&quot;, &amp; 1.5\\&quot; as my hair is layered. I just bought my mom a 1\\&quot; for her birthday and she is thrilled.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to style my hair after a shower! It really removes a lot of the frizzyness I usually have in my hair but it has a tendency to make my hair very curly on the other hand. If you like the sort of old Hollywood kind of curls it&#x27;s a great tool though!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a competitor out there like itâ€¦unfortunately.  I say unfortunately because the quality isn&#x27;t so great and seems to have degraded over the years.  My first one worked well and lasted a long time.  The second one hasn&#x27;t been nearly as good.  First, the idea of this brush is great:  the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; of the brush don&#x27;t get caught so easily in the hair (if you are very carefully rolling up the ends), and there is a &amp;#34;release&amp;#34; button you push to make the barrel free wheeling so you can unroll the curled end without tangling.  The barrel doesn&#x27;t get very hot so it&#x27;s fairly gentle on fine, colored hair like mine.  BUTâ€¦.here&#x27;s the negativeâ€¦..I&#x27;ve had two of these in the last couple of years that had a brush barrel that tended to stick when the release button was pushed.  My work around is to push the button and manually unroll the brush, and that works, the the basic function should be such that I don&#x27;t have to do this, it should just unroll easily while the button is pressed.  When I bought my second brush, I had to return it because of the barrel not releasing well, but the replacement did the same thing.  Made in China, and not so great or long lasting any more, I guess.  When and if I find a comparable product that works better, I&#x27;ll buy it.</li>
            <li> I just tried to use this product for the first time.  My hair is fine just past shoulder length.  First 10 seconds my hair tangled so badly it took me an hour to remove the brush from it.  Now I have hair pulled out, a whole patch on the side of my head.  I don&#x27;t know whether to fume or cry.&lt;br /&gt;Tange-free?&lt;br /&gt;NO NO NO!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Cool name. Nice handle. That&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try this (after my Conair BC171NCS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush&#x27;s heating element stopped working after a year) since it was the highest rated product of its kind on Amazon but I was REALLY DISAPPOINTED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really consider wattage when purchasing this but its &amp;#34;Powerful 250 Watt&amp;#34; is actually laughably puny next to the 1000 Watt Conair Hot Air Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t like how easily it got stuck when I rolled it up in my hair. I think it&#x27;s due to the unforgiving hard plastic bristles, compared to the Conair&#x27;s flexible bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sending it back and going to try another Conair brush, which comes with THREE attachments and the Helen of Troy came with none.</li>
            <li> Nice tool, but not for longer hair.  This is definitely for shorter to ear length hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS AND IT NEVER FAILS TO PERFORM AS EXPECTED. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS STYLING TOOL</li>
            <li> This works great to add volume.  I wait till my hair is only slightly damp, otherwise it takes too long.  Good for my purposes.</li>
            <li> The curl release button does not work, poorly made. Still usable w/o this. I have relatively short hair but the 3/4 &amp;#34; produces too small a curl for my taste. I plan to keep this one as I used it, but I already ordered the 1&amp;#34;. I like the freedom of using only one tool.</li>
            <li> My third brush.  Don&#x27;t last a really long time, but for the price, is fine.  This kind of brush works very well on my short hair.</li>
            <li> very easy to use does not get too hot, it works best on damp hair</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve got this BIG wooden horse rally this Saturday to surprise the s*** out of the neighbors.  Wanted my hair to look good for the event!  Trojans - here we come!  Helen of Troy</li>
            <li> This product works well for me. I dont want curl just curve.</li>
            <li> Perfect hot air brush, never fails, so dependable.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my five-year-old Conair 1&amp;#34; Hot Air Brush, but this does not come close to doing the curling/shaping/styling actions of my old Conair brush.  This is a lightweight, plastic piece of junk that DOES entangle my below-shoulder length, thick, fine hair. I doubted it would give me even six months of service, so I promptly returned it.</li>
            <li> no.  tangles hair.  I thought I&#x27;d try it- based on reviews.  don&#x27;t.  flat ironing... ANYTHING is better than this for me.  simply not good for my hair.  ( collarbone length, blunt cut)  no.</li>
            <li> My hair is rather short.However; it was still quite effective. I would have preferred a smaller size, but I am still very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled with the 1\\&quot; Helen of Troy Hot Brush.  I have fine hair and the brush holds each swatch of hair perfectly without tangles or breakage.  The two-speed blower is nice and fast unlike the hot brushes I bought at the drugstores. For those who need it, the cord is extra long. I also love the semi-flexible bristles--they don&#x27;t scratch the scalp. Darn good product.</li>
            <li> great product - I prefer the 1&amp;#34; diameter now that I have a shorter haircut.</li>
            <li> This hot brush works really well.</li>
            <li> Does a great job!  Love it.</li>
            <li> It is great easy to use. I use it every day. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It works very well.  It&#x27;s a great product. I had a smaller one and opted to buy the larger one and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This one feels a little more delicate than my previous one for some reason but it gets the job done.  Wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.  This is the 3rd one I have owned.  They seem to last a couple years and then fizzle out.  I was happy to see they still make them and I was able to buy this one off Amazon.  It smooths my hair and I can turn my hair under to a bob or flip it up if I want.  I use it every other day.  Wash my hair, dry it 2/3 of the way and then use my Helen of Troy hot air brush.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> I think the Helen of Troy 1\\&quot; Tangle Free, works very well and it really does untangle the hair from the brush. I am thinking of getting a second one with a small brush for tighter curls. Buy it and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara[[ASIN:B0018CBBPW Helen of Troy 1574 Tangle Free Hot Air Brush, White, 1 Inch Barrel]]</li>
            <li> It does a great job and quite quickly to style the hair.  If you want more curl this is a great curl brush.</li>
