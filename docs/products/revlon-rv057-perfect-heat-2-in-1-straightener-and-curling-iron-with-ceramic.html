    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It worked very good for me both ways.</li>
            <li>The curling iron works great, and if you are looking for a curling iron I would recommend a Revlon.</li>
            <li>The Conair is working great</li>
            <li>Decided on this one because I thought that the curling iron was a great added feature.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>For the love of hair, do NOT buy this product!</li>
            <li>I liked the combo b/c I travel a lot and its convenient.  </li>
            <li>When I bought it I liked it.  </li>
            <li>I liked the way it worked</li>
            <li>I was so excited because it offered the ceramic curling/straightening capability in one unit for a great price.  </li>
            <li>It heats up okay, but without grabbing the tip of it</li>
            <li>On top of all of this, the hinge snapped one day while I was using it and the straightener literally fell apart.  </li>
            <li>I love the convenience of heating up one iron and having both options.</li>
            <li>I really love the idea f being able to use one product to achieve streight hair with the ends curled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using both for more years than I&#x27;d like to admit.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a need to invest in anything more pricey.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect to travel, you only need one appliance for 2 or more styles.  </li>
            <li>and it lasted for more than 3 years.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and purchase a better quality straightener.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast, works beautifully on my hair, and is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>It is great as a curling iron, well...as good as any other you&#x27;d get at Target or Wal Mart</li>
            <li>From reading all the other reviews, I thought this would be the best deal for a straightner/curling iron in one.</li>
            <li>I liked this product when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li>, it gets VERY hot!</li>
            <li>Also, the curling iron function didn&#x27;t let me smoothly curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>Most of the other manufactures of curling iron are happy selling seperate streightners and curling irons.</li>
            <li>I had an original Revlon RV057</li>
            <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t clamp tightly on your hair, but it did a good impromptu job.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and the dial allows you to control the amount of heat.</li>
            <li>so you constantly have to check to make sure you didn&#x27;t switch it off!</li>
            <li>This iron is a nice combination between curling and flat iron.</li>
            <li>Also the on/off button is right where you would lay your hand on the handle to hold the straightenter</li>
            <li>When I first bought this product, I was it&#x27;s biggest fan.</li>
            <li>The size is great for mid to long hair.</li>
            <li>It just slides right out, so you can&#x27;t really do much curling.  </li>
            <li>You had to hold the end tight to get a good straight</li>
            <li>if you are going to do this to keep your hair nice nad soft and healty you should either use Dove or Sheer Blonde/Brilliant Brunette</li>
            <li>The whole thing pretty much fell apart on me--with the first thing to go being the lever that holds the straightener together when using the curling function.</li>
            <li>Heats VERY quickly, auto shut off, several settings.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even get a decent semi curl out of it!</li>
            <li>First, the plates don&#x27;t clamp down enough to straighten my hair and Second most importantly how easy it is to BURN yourself.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find one just like this that did not pull my hair and break, at a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>since its also a curling iron it heats up around the whole area.</li>
            <li>Thought this combo was a good idea especially for travel, one less thing to pack.</li>
            <li>This is better than average the straightener</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, due to the fact that the straightener does not close completely, my hair still isn&#x27;t perfectly straight when I am through.  </li>
            <li>went through three of these in less than a year because the locking device that keeps it closed so that you can use it as a regular curling iron breaks VERY EASILY!!</li>
            <li>and it does an amazing job on my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a new one with a ceramic plates.</li>
            <li>I will be investing in a new one after doing some research</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t securely close onto the hair thus having to repeat the same section multiple times or use both hands.</li>
            <li>I bought this as I had a Revlon straightener in the past and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted several years, even having been beaten up a bit by traveling.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get anywhere hot enough even when put on 25.</li>
            <li>I had to turn mine up to the highest temperature, and then the outside of the barrel was the only part that really got hot.</li>
            <li>When you do close it, you can clearly see a gap between into between the ceramic plates.</li>
            <li>The hinge is in the middle so not as much strain is put on it.  </li>
            <li>The plates don&#x27;t close together completely</li>
            <li>I was still able to use it, though, until this morning when I woke up and for no reason at all, the whole thing pretty much was broken in half.</li>
            <li>I have happily replaced this flat iron with a new one, but I don&#x27;t know if the emotional scarring the Revlon straightener left behind will ever heal.  </li>
            <li>It curls great and the straightening was not too bad.  </li>
            <li>(if you are a light red head (like me) go with the blonde shampoo and darker red heads go with the brunette shampoos) and if you are too lazy to use a blow dryer with a strighterner than you should use wet 2 straight</li>
            <li>The little locking tab broke withing the first week.</li>
            <li>It did take some getting used to using the straightener part, but not long</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It did take some getting used to using the straightener part, but not long</li>
            <li> but I sometimes wanted it to just be sleeker so the flat iron worked well enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Bought a flat iron for the 1st time.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;lock\\&quot; to close the flat iron and use the curl broke.  </li>
            <li> The straightener had a couple of nicks/chips on the flat plate.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is straight</li>
            <li> My hair is almost naturally straight just with a little wave here and there, and it couldnt even straighten out the little waves.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to be  that big of an issue and as my other one wasnt working</li>
            <li> After using this, my hair looked worse than it did when I first woke up.  </li>
            <li> I had it on 5 and dropped it on my arm with less than one second of contact.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, my excitement quickly faded.  </li>
            <li> It smells like the plastic on it is burning, the straightener doesn&#x27;t even clamp closed on my hair to straighten it .</li>
            <li> Please be careful though</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely close together so even with my THICK hair</li>
            <li> After only a few uses (a week span time), the clamp knobs popped off, the lock feature broke and the ceramic itself started to chip!</li>
            <li> this wasn&#x27;t due to any misuse or abuse on my part.  </li>
            <li> The curling iron is just average.  </li>
            <li> You have to squeeze the black part on the end really hard to make it actually touch your hair, and if you do that little pieces of your hair get snagged on the plate and pulled out.</li>
            <li> It lasted less than 6 months</li>
            <li> and after I use it my hair is a frizzy poofed out mess and no straightness to it at all.</li>
            <li> The curling iron doesn&#x27;t clamp tight onto my hair</li>
            <li> Quickly realized why this was so bad.</li>
            <li> I came back to it a day later and the part that was broken from the little use I gave it was 10X worse.</li>
            <li> , went to use it the next day and it was broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for a few years, must be discontinued, couldn&#x27;t find anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I had to hold the straightener together very tightly to get it to work.  </li>
            <li> After about 3 minutes of having it plugged in at the medium setting,  thick,  black smoke started coming out of the end.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> so it only straightens your hair in random places.  </li>
            <li> i use this straightener everyday!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clamp down all the way and it makes my hair look worse.</li>
            <li> it hardly worked.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it much at first but now that I started I&#x27;m very disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> The locking device on it, is horrible, it takes several tries to get it to lock shut.</li>
            <li> Basically on the plastic part that holds the two sides \\&quot;together\\&quot; is broken to the point that if I let it separate I can see the inside wires.</li>
            <li> The product is simply very poorly made and a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong</li>
            <li> I received this straightener/curling iron as a christmas present and it is the worst product ever.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it is in the garbage now.  </li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> should which made it very difficult to straighten.  </li>
            <li> and they sent me a replacement that is so badly constructed that I can see the wires in the joint .</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightening iron today and boy am I disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This straightener is completely terrible!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> From reading all the other reviews, I thought this would be the best deal for a straightner/curling iron in one. The curling iron works great, and if you are looking for a curling iron I would recommend a Revlon. However, the straightner did not work on my hair at all. My hair is almost naturally straight just with a little wave here and there, and it couldnt even straighten out the little waves. I had to turn mine up to the highest temperature, and then the outside of the barrel was the only part that really got hot. When you clamp the straightner together the plates do not touch. You have to squeeze the black part on the end really hard to make it actually touch your hair, and if you do that little pieces of your hair get snagged on the plate and pulled out. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product is unsafe.  The heat dial goes up to 20.  I had it on 5 and dropped it on my arm with less than one second of contact.  I received third degree burns that did not heal for three weeks and will probably leave a 1\\&quot; x 3\\&quot; scar on my arm for life.  I can&#x27;t even imagine what it would do set on 20, probably burn your hair off and anything else it touches.  It should be recalled.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  I liked the combo b/c I travel a lot and its convenient.  Also both heat at the same time so I can use either.  However, after using one for a month the hinge broke.  Thinking I had a defective one, I returned it and got another.  The same thing happened.    I would recommend the Conair Ceramic 2-N-1 Straightener &amp; Curling Iron instead.  The hinge is in the middle so not as much strain is put on it.  The Conair is working great so if you want a 2 in 1 combo I would skip the Revlon and get the Conair.    [[ASIN:B000H8ABZY Conair Ceramic 2-N-1 Straightener &amp; Curling Iron]]</li>
            <li> I purchased this item at Wal-mart.  I was so excited because it offered the ceramic curling/straightening capability in one unit for a great price.  Sadly, my excitement quickly faded.  After only a few uses (a week span time), the clamp knobs popped off, the lock feature broke and the ceramic itself started to chip! Trust me this wasn&#x27;t due to any misuse or abuse on my part.  The product is simply very poorly made and a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as I had a Revlon straightener in the past and absolutely love it. I was looking for a new one with a ceramic plates. Decided on this one because I thought that the curling iron was a great added feature. Boy was I wrong brought it home, went to use it the next day and it was broken. It didn&#x27;t seem to be  that big of an issue and as my other one wasnt working and I didn&#x27;t have time to go return it I figured I would use it then return it when I had time the next day. I was very disappointed. It heats up okay, but without grabbing the tip of it It doesn&#x27;t securely close onto the hair thus having to repeat the same section multiple times or use both hands. I came back to it a day later and the part that was broken from the little use I gave it was 10X worse. Basically on the plastic part that holds the two sides \\&quot;together\\&quot; is broken to the point that if I let it separate I can see the inside wires. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again, and after looking at the reviews now I shouldn&#x27;t have even bought it to begin with.</li>
            <li> Words cannot express my dissatisfaction with this product.  It takes me close to ten minutes to straighten my hair, even on the highest heat setting.  What&#x27;s more, due to the fact that the straightener does not close completely, my hair still isn&#x27;t perfectly straight when I am through.  Inside of the straightener are screws holding it together, and my hair regularly gets caught on the screws and ripped out.  On top of all of this, the hinge snapped one day while I was using it and the straightener literally fell apart.  I have happily replaced this flat iron with a new one, but I don&#x27;t know if the emotional scarring the Revlon straightener left behind will ever heal.  For the love of hair, do NOT buy this product!</li>
            <li> I just bought my second one of these Revlon curling/straightener irons.  The first one lasted several years, even having been beaten up a bit by traveling.  It did take some getting used to using the straightener part, but not long and it does an amazing job on my thick hair.  It heats up fast, works beautifully on my hair, and is easy to handle.  I love the convenience of heating up one iron and having both options.</li>
            <li> I recieved the revlon 2 in 1 straightner and curling iron as a christmas present a couple years ago. I didn&#x27;t use it much at first but now that I started I&#x27;m very disappointed with it. It doesn&#x27;t clamp down all the way and it makes my hair look worse. I have thick hair that is straight and after I use it my hair is a frizzy poofed out mess and no straightness to it at all. I will be investing in a new one after doing some research</li>

The curling iron doesn&#x27;t clamp tight onto my hair either so I don&#x27;t even get a decent semi curl out of it! When you do close it, you can clearly see a gap between into between the ceramic plates. Also the on/off button is right where you would lay your hand on the handle to hold the straightenter so you constantly have to check to make sure you didn&#x27;t switch it off!</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product, I was it&#x27;s biggest fan. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t clamp tightly on your hair, but it did a good impromptu job. The whole thing pretty much fell apart on me--with the first thing to go being the lever that holds the straightener together when using the curling function. I was still able to use it, though, until this morning when I woke up and for no reason at all, the whole thing pretty much was broken in half.</li>
            <li> Not only will it straighten but also add curl--the way you want it. Would not be without it.</li>
            <li> The little locking tab broke withing the first week. When I called Revlon, they said \\&quot;not my problem, call Helen of Troy\\&quot;. I did - and they sent me a replacement that is so badly constructed that I can see the wires in the joint .</li>
            <li> When I bought it I liked it.  It curls great and the straightening was not too bad.  You had to hold the end tight to get a good straight but it worked.  Then I noticed it was pulling my hair through the sides...ouch!  Then eventually the spring broke inside and it would not pop open like it should which made it very difficult to straighten.  Needless to say it is in the garbage now.  I wish I could find one just like this that did not pull my hair and break, at a reasonable cost.  The CHI version of this is around $130.00.</li>
            <li> I really love the idea f being able to use one product to achieve streight hair with the ends curled. I had looked in every store to find one of these 2 in 1 irons and finally found it on Amazon. Most of the other manufactures of curling iron are happy selling seperate streightners and curling irons. I like having the convienance of only having to have one to do 2 jobs</li>
            <li> This iron is a nice combination between curling and flat iron. I&#x27;ve been using both for more years than I&#x27;d like to admit. The size is great for mid to long hair. It heats up quickly and the dial allows you to control the amount of heat. I don&#x27;t see a need to invest in anything more pricey. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Bought a flat iron for the 1st time. This one has a bonus of switching over to a curling iron as well. It worked very good for me both ways. Please be careful though, it gets VERY hot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for a few years, must be discontinued, couldn&#x27;t find anywhere.  The \\&quot;lock\\&quot; to close the flat iron and use the curl broke.  It&#x27;s perfect to travel, you only need one appliance for 2 or more styles.  Heats VERY quickly, auto shut off, several settings.</li>
            <li> It is great as a curling iron, well...as good as any other you&#x27;d get at Target or Wal Mart but if you do buy it and plan on using it as a straightener, be prepared to buy it often.   &lt;br /&gt;I went through three of these in less than a year because the locking device that keeps it closed so that you can use it as a regular curling iron breaks VERY EASILY!!</li>
            <li> Bought it and returned it the next day. Thought this combo was a good idea especially for travel, one less thing to pack. Quickly realized why this was so bad. First, the plates don&#x27;t clamp down enough to straighten my hair and Second most importantly how easy it is to BURN yourself. since its also a curling iron it heats up around the whole area. Dont get your fingers too close or get too close trying to straighten the layer closest to your neck.. STAY AWAY FROM CURLING IRON/STRAIGTENER COMBOS!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron yesterday.  The straightener had a couple of nicks/chips on the flat plate.  Quality control anyone???  They caught onto my hair and pulled it out.  I had to hold the straightener together very tightly to get it to work.  Also, the curling iron function didn&#x27;t let me smoothly curl my hair.  The clamp doesn&#x27;t hold the hair onto the iron.  It just slides right out, so you can&#x27;t really do much curling.  I am keeping my fingers crossed that rite-aid will let me return it because of the chips on the flat-iron plate.</li>
            <li> I had an original Revlon RV057 and it lasted for more than 3 years.  It got so rusty I decided it was time to get another one I did. It lasted less than 6 months I liked the way it worked but I going to try another brand maybe it&#x27;ll last longer.</li>
            <li> I liked this product when I first bought it.  My hair isn&#x27;t curly but I sometimes wanted it to just be sleeker so the flat iron worked well enough for me.  However it soon fell apart.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightening iron today and boy am I disappointed.  It doesn&#x27;t completely close together so even with my THICK hair it hardly worked.  After about 3 minutes of having it plugged in at the medium setting,  thick,  black smoke started coming out of the end.  Save your money and purchase a better quality straightener.  This piece of junk is going back tomorrow!</li>
            <li> This straightener is completely terrible!! The plates don&#x27;t close together completely so it only straightens your hair in random places.  After using this, my hair looked worse than it did when I first woke up.  The curling iron is just average.  Do not buy this, it will NOT work.</li>
            <li> I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE THEY ARE TRYING TO GET 69.99 FOR THIS</li>
            <li> This is better than average the straightener but hte curling iron doesnt work that well. i use this straightener everyday! if you are going to do this to keep your hair nice nad soft and healty you should either use Dove or Sheer Blonde/Brilliant Brunette (if you are a light red head (like me) go with the blonde shampoo and darker red heads go with the brunette shampoos) and if you are too lazy to use a blow dryer with a strighterner than you should use wet 2 straight</li>
