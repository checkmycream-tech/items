            <li>I will say it is nice that you can use the shower head that comes with it</li>
            <li>with that said, I&#x27;m so thrilled with the condition of my hair now.</li>

            <li>Good Luck :)</li>
            <li>but im thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Spectacular thing, this.</li>
            <li>I solved the problem by using another handheld (note that this package comes is its own shower head).  </li>
            <li>However, I opted to keep my own shower head.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>but now I think it&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my hair and skin were incredibly softer.</li>
            <li>This unit is very easy to install, it does not require any tools for installation.</li>

            <li>So many people seemed to say that it worked wonders for them....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was because their was maybe more moisture in the ends, and like humidity makes your hair frizzy</li>
            <li>this was leaving more moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li>Love the showers now and my skin and health thank you.</li>

            <li>My skin immediately felt better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M a stylish myself</li>
            <li>I love the water filter.  </li>
            <li>:)))</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to carry in as many jugs.</li>
            <li>Then I figured I&#x27;d spend a bit more $$ to try this.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and was so pleased, I chose this model to purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>have used it a week, and my hair is about 1,000,000 times better.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love my shower purification system.</li>
            <li>The water feels so much better</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret it, again, you can find cheaper than that.</li>
            <li>I checked the o-ring and put on more veggy oil trying to stop the leak.  </li>
            <li>I have called their warranty phone number many times, and there is no answer.  </li>
            <li>I have done so, many times, but no return phone calls.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>The price is good too for such good quality,  I tried drinking the water and it&#x27;s much better than most drinking water filters.  </li>
            <li>use city water as I live in an apartment, and I&#x27;m sure it works just as great for well water as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went onto amazon to look for shampoos for well water, thinking that was a good first option.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about all the skin stuff, I have pretty good skin already, but I can tell you</li>
            <li>Different means fantastic and great!!!</li>

            <li>I think this is the most important benefit for me.</li>
            <li>So far this works great.</li>

            <li>Easy install.</li>
            <li>it is easy to install.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference after the first couple showers, Amazingly my hair does not get tangled up even if I don&#x27;t comb it after my showers</li>
            <li>and I was fine.</li>
            <li>I did pretty extensive research in regards to what shower head filter would work best with well water.  </li>
            <li>It may work just fine</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
            <li>to install, Works fine.</li>
            <li>but this Jonathan was fine.</li>
            <li>and my hair felt dramatically better the very first time I took the shower with the filter installed.  </li>
            <li>My hair is now soft, smooth, shiny, and bright.  </li>
            <li>This makes a huge difference on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>And this softner has made a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference and is keeping my hair color from turning, and it has also improved my skin</li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal.  </li>
            <li>We are on a  well and this filter has made a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>, so it was worth it to spend a bit more.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so smooth and bouncy and I can go some longer without a touch-up.  </li>
            <li>I did my research and found this one to be the purification system that fit my needs.</li>
            <li>The water pressure is great and the water feels different.</li>
            <li>The water feels smooth and silky on my skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel fabulous.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use de-frizzing products or shine enhancing products and my hair looks glossy and smooth about 90% of the time.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Loved it and helps to keep skin clear</li>
            <li>and there is no weird orange color coming out into my hair!!</li>
            <li>Very gooooood!!!  </li>
            <li>I originally went to Home Depot and got a cheap filter, which did NOT work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my hair and skin since using this product not to mention my shower wall and tub are easier to clean now.</li>
            <li>It was super easy to install</li>
            <li>but Atlas Supply Chain was more than willing to help me out and fix the problem immediately.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I will say that my hair&#x27;s behavior is more consistent than before using this filter, BUT I have also changed environments and I know that plays a role and can&#x27;t fully give credit to the filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>lowers the original shower head which makes me have to bend</li>
            <li>pretty sure it was because of this product because I told myself if anything were to change about my skin or hair after using it</li>
            <li>Worth the cost!</li>
            <li>This is product is so worth the money!</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost of the shower unit!</li>
            <li>The water no longer has a sulpher like smell and the condition of our hair has improved significantly.</li>
            <li>Felt clean, fresh, and healthier!</li>
            <li>Water smells clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>Imagine spending all that time blow drying my hair straight, only to feel my roots have an incredible amount of build up, an hour after showering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t softer and the glass shower wasn&#x27;t any easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the right item if it wasn&#x27;t for all of you people!</li>
            <li>and I noticed a huge difference after the first shower!</li>
            <li>But I also want say Thank You to all the people writing reviews, their experiences with this product, it has been a such a good help and support</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even comb through my hair, I had to use so much conditioner just to brush it which then would cause more breakage.   </li>
            <li>Just how many showers can a filter this size, really perform (well) before needing to be changed?  </li>
            <li>After researching for this item for a good price on different websites, I found it on here at Amazon.com</li>
            <li>I am so thankful for this product &amp; am a true believer in what it can do &amp; will do for you as well.  </li>
            <li>The shower head has good pressure and several spray options.</li>
            <li>It worked so well that when I moved 6 months ago I bought it for my city water that is full of chlorine.  </li>
            <li>I felt a softer skin at 1st shower then got a bit better after 2nd shower, felt my hair better after nd shower...</li>
            <li>Also as you can see from the photo, I was able to keep using my old shower head attached to the filter!!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase, so far so good.</li>
            <li>The 3-star rating is really just saying that the shower head gives adequate water pressure and installed easily.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love the new filter.  </li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference within days of use, it is easy to install too.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it does exactly what I want - gives me soft, manageable hair in the shower!!!</li>
            <li>My hair was very soft, smooth and manageable after one wash and my roommate commented on how shiny my hair looked!</li>
            <li>It looks like another company&#x27;s product, but trust me it is completely different and way better!  </li>
            <li>leaves your skin and hair feeling super soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>i feel clean for the first time since moving to LA.</li>
            <li>Works great and it came within a few days</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much stronger and my skin is just nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This shower filter lives up to its promise and gives you healthy, soft, manageable hair.  </li>
            <li>It costs a fortune for me to import the filter replacement, but definitely worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>No matter what the cost, it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>A plumber said it wasn&#x27;t worth trying to adapt it for the shower plumbing.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say there isn&#x27;t a massive difference in the condition of my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the $50.00 in filter change every 6 months.</li>
            <li>I bought this and used my own double shower head</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>So far I have really enjoyed this.</li>
            <li>But it is really worth it for all the benefits.</li>
            <li>So much more water came out, which leads me to believe the old one was just clogged or something</li>
            <li>) Skin - so far I dont see a difference, but I&#x27;ll update this as I use it more often.</li>
            <li>After using this my hair has become a lot more manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Boy, it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Guaranteed to be worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I wish I had returned it after the first month for a full refund.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall good product that works as I expected.  </li>
            <li>I love my girlfriend very much and I live justfFlorida.</li>
            <li>I have a water softener, but without this little filter it wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li>Who knew the right kind of water would make such a difference!?</li>
            <li>Easy to install although I could not attach my own shower head/handheld combination as the somewhat oddly positioned mount of the filter prevented me from screwing in the assembly.  </li>
            <li>After buying this house, right away my girlfriend</li>
            <li>My shower head connected right up to this with no issues.  </li>
            <li>but really I had the feeling of clean water,after the shower</li>
            <li>I live in an area of hard water and found this to work great!!</li>
            <li>From chunks of hair after every wash to only a few was the best feeling.</li>
            <li>The set up was relatively easy - just detach old shower head and screw the pieces in.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth and soft and I felt clean-not filmy!</li>
            <li>After using the shower filtration system once I was able to use half the product and comb through my hair easily.</li>
            <li>This product has made a huge difference &amp; completely fixed my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve written.</li>
            <li>Regardless it turned out pretty well for me on my end.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re wondering why I didn&#x27;t just use regular water.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well, but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li>The first person to use it was my husband, without knowing what it did.</li>
            <li>On my first shower I was surprise, the amount of hair that fell was like ten at the most.</li>
            <li>This filter does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>While at a conference in Sardinia, Italy, I noticed that although I was using the same shampoo from home, my hair got progressively softer and more manageable as the week progressed.  </li>
            <li>No lie, after the first shower my hair was noticeably smoother and softer and my skin felt softer.</li>
            <li>The first time I washed my hair with the Jonathan filter</li>
            <li>As usual, great product, fast divert,</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize exactly how damaging well water was until I took my first shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing more research to find an actual shower water softener because this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li>and I would need to go back to the salon more often.  </li>
            <li>This filter does such a better job.  </li>
            <li>Water pressure, intense!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and there ---I want the color to last more than one washing --.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was too pricey --</li>
            <li>Especially if you buy it on Amazon -- so much better than retail ($95).</li>
            <li>Just used this for the first time</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t tell which exactly helped me to stop loosing hair.</li>
            <li>Either way, I bought this because of the reviews on helping with this exact problem, and the combination stopped the hair loss.</li>
            <li>I may be a bit more critical if I payed $100...</li>
            <li>hair/skin are softer, overall better condition.</li>
            <li>After my first shower with it, I didn&#x27;t need body lotion.</li>
            <li>But I definitely no longer smell the overwhelming chlorine smell I had before.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, this filter does not claim to help with well water, just chlorine and maybe some heavy metals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall quality is good as far as holding up so far with the exception of the plastic color.&lt;br /&gt;However, for me, after a few years of use, there&#x27;s too many cons</li>
            <li>And my skin feels amazing too - it&#x27;s not dried out and red.      </li>
            <li>I think between the filter and the malibu treatment, I should get my bright blonde highlight back.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin so soft and clean feeling</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft and even the shower stays clean.  </li>
            <li>After my first shower I had much needed relief from all the chemicals in my city water.</li>
            <li>It is a good idea to place a basin under the hower head when you first run the water through it because the water is initially tinted black and then clears quickly.</li>
            <li>Your dry, tacky feeling skin will be reborn as smooth as an angel baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser did not believe that it helped my hair as the texture is not what it was prior to having well water, and my hair does not process color as easily as it used to.</li>
            <li>the spray it strong and had different levels you can change it to</li>
            <li>I have well water with a large filter.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It works OK, the only problem is where do I get new filters for the thing.</li>
            <li>But a friend went out of the country and when she came back she said that any where else her hair is fine</li>
            <li>just my first use my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry after getting out of the shower, my acne hasn&#x27;t itched nearly as much, and it didn&#x27;t bother eczema at all!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to install</li>
            <li>In combination with Malibu shampoo - my hair is clean and light and the psoriasis on scalp and hair loss is less.</li>
            <li>I really feel like this company care about customer satisfaction</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a religious lotion user after the shower but once or twice since changing to this shower filter I have forgotten to moisturize because it just leaves your skin so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s shiny and smooth using the same shampoos and conditioners I always use.  </li>
            <li>Then I blamed my hair dresser for using too much hair dye.</li>
            <li>It is softer, and the frayed edges have decreased greatly.  </li>
            <li>It really does work &amp; I&#x27;m sooo thankful I found it.</li>
            <li>If you really do have a problem with hair lost</li>
            <li>Thought I wanted to get a whole house water softener, but when I saw the prices, I reconsidered.  </li>
            <li>I use color/bleach on my hair and have noticed it to be much softer as well.</li>
            <li>The water feels smooth, and no longer has a gross taste.</li>
            <li>, how important the water is in your daily hair care.</li>
            <li>My water at home has way too much chlorine.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work for me.  </li>
            <li>This really helps my hair and see a ton of difference,  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to spend too much for the product.</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely just loves it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use as much product in my hair.</li>
            <li>I want to note that I have a reverse osmosis plus charcoal whole house filter, which I installed when I built my home.  </li>
            <li>Now it takes much longer for that to develop</li>
            <li>I have been using this water shower purification system for a month and it has made both my hair &amp; skin feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I never trusted the drinking water -- get 3-5 gallon jugs -- but if I capture the shower cold it is delicious</li>
            <li>this product really works, i order one</li>
            <li>every year!&lt;br /&gt;It has really helped to rid my tumbled marble in the shower from</li>
            <li>I had so much iron in my water that the shower wall has rust stains on it.  </li>
            <li>and my hair has been transforming into a much softer and silkier texture.</li>
            <li>Really helped with problems I was having with hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely life changing haha</li>
            <li>So Yes, BUY THIS if you are loosing too much hair and have well water.</li>
            <li>Did not seem to have much of an impact.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much softer and helped with the winter</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it did much for my hair.</li>
            <li>This filter did not do much if anything, for the calcium and magnesium in the water.</li>
            <li>I bought this at $50 on an Amazon Lightning Deal, so I am writing this review with the premise of paying that much for this product.  </li>
            <li>my whole family likes this product.  </li>
            <li>that said, i can say that it really has improved my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Really saved the day.</li>
            <li>She knocks open the bathroom door like a wild crackhead searching for eyedrops and more Crack.</li>
            <li>So, I decided to step it up a notch and purchases the most expensive shower/water filter I could find (Jonathan Water Purification System)...and to be perfectly honest, we still don&#x27;t see an improvement in how our hair feels/behaves.  </li>
            <li>Well, I have been using it for 3 months and although it has improved my hair texture only slightly, the effects on my skin are remarkable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious to see how long the water filter will last, but so far it is working great!  </li>
            <li>I have well water with a hardness off 41 which is technically not very hard.</li>
            <li>Makes hair very soft- great for places with hard water!</li>
            <li>Since using this product my hair feels normal again!</li>
            <li>The Filter is brilliant and really works, during the shower I didn&#x27;t smell any Chlorine and also The water felt different, sounds dumb</li>
            <li>My update on this product - The filter is good for less than 4 months only.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t remember this kind of sensation since I was a child, I didn&#x27;t even used my body lotion after or any specific hair conditioner and usually my hair and skin really needs super Hydration after the shower.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m probably allergic to the metals/chemicals in my water (I have pretty sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>An absolute rats nest of snarles and tangles which isn&#x27;t normal for me.</li>
            <li>and although we do use a water softener, it just doesn&#x27;t get the water good enough to not turn my blonde dyed hair brassy yellow.</li>
            <li>For years I struggled with my curly auburn DRY hair, buying every moisturizing product available, including Marrakesh oil.    </li>
            <li>Also has very good pressure which we had a hard time getting with other shower heads.  </li>
            <li>and I quickly realized our hair was becoming trashed by the hard water.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>recommend it highly</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>But with that high speed water go through.</li>
            <li>I would highly doubt that the filter function does anything.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I vividly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>They seem a little better now.</li>
            <li>and I really appreciate the professional response with immediate solution.</li>
            <li>to remember the real feel of a natural water.</li>
            <li>Normally it takes me a lot of time and product to comb through my hair after a shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BEWARE…be absolutely sure it will work for you, or it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a try if you have mysterious skin/hair issues that correlate with a water source change.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you live in an apartment.</li>
            <li>It was a very noticeable difference because she and I live in Florida so you can guarantee that 90% of the water is tainted because the government here is clearly trying to move along the mortality process of the ever growing elderly population.</li>
            <li>Bought this because my hair and face feel icky after taking a shower at my new apt.</li>
            <li>After doing MAJOR research online, I found this shower filter &amp; decided to buy it after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, fine hair that started getting very dry &amp; thinning, by the handful.</li>
            <li>but I notice that if I only use the single head it seems to filter better.  </li>
            <li>Three months later I am THRILLED to say that those highlights I paid that expensive colorist tons of money for are still there, still platinum, and still looking super natural exactly like I wanted!</li>
            <li>Worked much better first few times after that no different from filters you can buy at lowes or home depot.wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>Live in well water area...</li>
            <li>and we didn&#x27;t buy a new one since).</li>
            <li>Have to buy new one.</li>
            <li>Where I house sit, the well water comes out of the regular shower head orange and as a light blonde that is a No-Go.</li>
            <li>My hair felt SO clean and was much easier to manage with less frizz.</li>
            <li>However, my skin started becoming itchy and red dry spots started appearing on my face and over my body.</li>
            <li>Since installing the filter my long hair takes 10 minutes to dry and my styling takes better and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>My skin is soft!</li>
            <li>I have used various filters for my shower and I like this one so much!</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of use the natural color of my hair is returning!</li>
            <li>The FIRST thing she asked me when I told her my hair always turned yellow</li>
            <li>And within 1 week, iron residue on the shower walls again and the water tastes and feels exactly the same as when we had no filter at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Completely changed my hair and skin bavk to normal.</li>
            <li>My hair feels normal and soft.</li>
            <li>and I could instantly feel the difference in my hair after the first week.</li>
            <li>Still thinking about a new water softener (old one broke 2 years ago</li>
            <li>Only down side is the price, but if health is important to you, then get it!</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, my hair behaves *much* better with hard city water.  </li>
            <li>I love this solution and recommend it to anyone with hard water.</li>
            <li>so I have to clean the shower less frequently.  </li>
            <li>my skin and hair were soft and silky</li>
            <li>The three spray settings on the shower head cover all your potential wants.  </li>
            <li>or she&#x27;ll go completely bonkers.</li>
            <li>I remember I have just replaced the soft water filter.</li>
            <li>He said his skin really felt different, it felt hydrated.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My skin also benefits from the soft water</li>
            <li>And for the record, when ever we travel to hotels (or friend&#x27;s homes) with soft water, we&#x27;re always blown away by the look/feel of each others hair, after showering.  </li>
            <li>you would think the filter system would last longer then that expecially when I paid 60 dollars for the whole setup.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the shower filter for about 3 weeks now and it has really helped my skin and hair immensely!</li>
            <li>and so I was dealing with no water softener which completely destroyed my hair.  </li>
            <li>Installed the system and completely cleaned the shower to get rid of all iron residue to gauge the filter&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I thought our only option would be to install a water softener for the whole house, but found this option by searching online.</li>
            <li>Keeps your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Our rental is on well water and has old copper pipes.</li>
            <li>So far there are no green stains at all on the tiles.</li>
            <li>My hair went from being soft and manageable to sticky, tangly, and even started breaking off.  </li>
            <li>I have to go to my hairdresser for a professional malibu treatment every two weeks to get the mineral buildup out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Skin definitely feels much softer.</li>
            <li>The pipes in my apartment are old</li>
            <li>This may not work for everyone, but it completely restored my hair.</li>
            <li>The product developed a leak between the head and the filter element about a month after installation.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair...</li>
            <li>I noticed that this does not have as much pressure as the regular shower</li>
            <li>my hair is soft and manageable and my skin feels moisturized.  </li>
            <li>So far I have determined that my skin is much softer and I do not require near the shampoo I did formerly.  </li>
            <li>No Calcium Lime or rus and no heavy metals thx medicine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, sure enough, I started feeling itchy after a few day, but I figured it could just be all in my head</li>
            <li>This was easy to install, however the shower head they include with it has very little pressure.  </li>
            <li>I live in an area with very hard water with many minerals.  </li>
            <li>It definitely helps when you don&#x27;t want to send a lot on a system to connect to your main water supply.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curley hair that grabs onto chemicals and makes an instant mess of things.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels 100% back to normal, if not even healthier and softer.</li>
            <li>First run through got rid of the accumulated carbon, as expected.  </li>
            <li>One day back at home, after using the filter once, hair back to being soft and manageable again, using the same exact shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Where I live (southern ohio)</li>
            <li>I finally decided after 5 years and 3 moves to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking at this product for over a year on Sephora.com and finally decided to purchase it as part of my new hair care regimen.</li>
            <li>I live in a rural area but still receive city water.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have the chance to try it right away but last night when I got home from work I spent litterally 5 minutes to substitute my old regular shower head with the filter.</li>
            <li>If you color your hair - as I do - it&#x27;s worth every penny because what&#x27;s the point is paying all of that money for a certain hair color only to have it ruined by hard water?  </li>
            <li>Also, living in Chicago with all the rusted water pipes, I can say my skin never felt this smooth and never liked this shiny before.</li>
            <li>I actually called the other products rep and was told that due to the similarities that the confusion did happen, but that the Jonathan actually removed more minerals out of the water than their product did.  </li>
            <li>So soft I could actually run my comb through it.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, my natural hair shine was totally gone!  </li>
            <li>I put my old one back on.</li>
            <li>a simple adjustment to the shower head fixed that.  </li>
            <li>She believes in all this voodoo water blood magic nonsense and it was an easy anniversary present to keep her feeble mind satisfied until the next anti-psychotic script was filled.. for me of course because she drives me insane.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to for a higher flow shower head for half the price, consider [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>After using Jonathan filter for about 10 days I am pleased to report that my hair is no longer super dry, has lots of shine, and does not look crazy on day 2.</li>
            <li>but hey.. no matter what, rain what made my skin &amp; hair feel much softer than this filter or any other filter I&#x27;ve tried b4, trust me, I just wish we could have a rainwater harvesting system in our house</li>
            <li>My hair seems a lot more lively and shiny, whereas before it would get dull and limp.</li>
            <li>Installation was simple and the product is relatively unassuming as far as shower space is concerned.  </li>
            <li>As soon as they are old enough to take showers, I will definitely be buying another!</li>
            <li>I had read other reviews and some stated the Jonathan product was the exact same as another well known product with a different label.  </li>
            <li>I bought this filter 6 years ago when my well water was hard and full of iron.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste any more time or money on hair products until you correct your water problem and this little gem will do just that!   </li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the excellent reviews, and I must say I was a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean and bought this product because I noticed that my hair was falling out at an alarming rate.  </li>
            <li>It must be the high chlorine and other chemicals in the water that this filter removes.  </li>
            <li>And, my skin is much softer and less itchy.  </li>
            <li>and I let it dry naturally,</li>
            <li>I did start using Alterna moisturizing shampoo and conditioner at the same time, and it took a few weeks to see positive changes in my hair and skin</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, blonde hair</li>
            <li>We live in a hard water area and for years I have been using a High Output filters which removed chlorine but did not help my hair a bit.  </li>
            <li>I still bought it because I don&#x27;t have bad allergic reactions to anything that I know of and this product has an overall good review.</li>

            <li> It is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Used my own shower head.</li>
            <li> was: what kind of water do you have, well or city?</li>
            <li> I will say it is nice that you can use the shower head that comes with it</li>
            <li> with that said, I&#x27;m so thrilled with the condition of my hair now.</li>
            <li> but I just replaced it with my own shower head</li>

            <li> Good Luck :)</li>
            <li> but im thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Spectacular thing, this.</li>
            <li> I solved the problem by using another handheld (note that this package comes is its own shower head).  </li>
            <li> However, I opted to keep my own shower head.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> but now I think it&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my hair and skin were incredibly softer.</li>
            <li> This unit is very easy to install, it does not require any tools for installation.</li>

            <li> So many people seemed to say that it worked wonders for them....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was because their was maybe more moisture in the ends, and like humidity makes your hair frizzy</li>
            <li> this was leaving more moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li> Love the showers now and my skin and health thank you.</li>
            <li> As many have stated, I have well water.  </li>
            <li> I think this is better, anyway.</li>
            <li> My skin immediately felt better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M a stylish myself</li>
            <li> I love the water filter.  </li>
            <li> :)))</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to carry in as many jugs.</li>
            <li> Then I figured I&#x27;d spend a bit more $$ to try this.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and was so pleased, I chose this model to purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> have used it a week, and my hair is about 1,000,000 times better.</li>
            <li> It is even better than it was before the damage.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love my shower purification system.</li>
            <li> The water feels so much better</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed it and if you are thinking about it just get something</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret it, again, you can find cheaper than that.</li>
            <li> I checked the o-ring and put on more veggy oil trying to stop the leak.  </li>
            <li> I have called their warranty phone number many times, and there is no answer.  </li>
            <li> I have done so, many times, but no return phone calls.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> :):) whoever you are.</li>

            <li> The price is good too for such good quality,  I tried drinking the water and it&#x27;s much better than most drinking water filters.  </li>
            <li> use city water as I live in an apartment, and I&#x27;m sure it works just as great for well water as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went onto amazon to look for shampoos for well water, thinking that was a good first option.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about all the skin stuff, I have pretty good skin already, but I can tell you</li>
            <li> Different means fantastic and great!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing however are the results;  I LOVE IT.  </li>

            <li> I think this is the most important benefit for me.</li>
            <li> So far this works great.</li>
            <li> Good seller and fast shipping.</li>

            <li> it is easy to install.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference after the first couple showers, Amazingly my hair does not get tangled up even if I don&#x27;t comb it after my showers</li>
            <li> and I was fine.</li>
            <li> I did pretty extensive research in regards to what shower head filter would work best with well water.  </li>
            <li> It may work just fine</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
            <li> to install, Works fine.</li>
            <li> but this Jonathan was fine.</li>
            <li> and my hair felt dramatically better the very first time I took the shower with the filter installed.  </li>
            <li> My hair is now soft, smooth, shiny, and bright.  </li>
            <li> This makes a huge difference on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> And this softner has made a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference and is keeping my hair color from turning, and it has also improved my skin</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal.  </li>
            <li> We are on a  well and this filter has made a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li> , so it was worth it to spend a bit more.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so smooth and bouncy and I can go some longer without a touch-up.  </li>
            <li> I did my research and found this one to be the purification system that fit my needs.</li>
            <li> The water pressure is great and the water feels different.</li>
            <li> The water feels smooth and silky on my skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel fabulous.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use de-frizzing products or shine enhancing products and my hair looks glossy and smooth about 90% of the time.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Loved it and helps to keep skin clear</li>
            <li> and there is no weird orange color coming out into my hair!!</li>
            <li> Very gooooood!!!  </li>
            <li> I originally went to Home Depot and got a cheap filter, which did NOT work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my hair and skin since using this product not to mention my shower wall and tub are easier to clean now.</li>
            <li> It was super easy to install</li>
            <li> but Atlas Supply Chain was more than willing to help me out and fix the problem immediately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I will say that my hair&#x27;s behavior is more consistent than before using this filter, BUT I have also changed environments and I know that plays a role and can&#x27;t fully give credit to the filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> lowers the original shower head which makes me have to bend</li>
            <li> pretty sure it was because of this product because I told myself if anything were to change about my skin or hair after using it</li>
            <li> Worth the cost!</li>
            <li> This is product is so worth the money!</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost of the shower unit!</li>
            <li> The water no longer has a sulpher like smell and the condition of our hair has improved significantly.</li>
            <li> Felt clean, fresh, and healthier!</li>
            <li> Water smells clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> Imagine spending all that time blow drying my hair straight, only to feel my roots have an incredible amount of build up, an hour after showering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t softer and the glass shower wasn&#x27;t any easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the right item if it wasn&#x27;t for all of you people!</li>
            <li> and I noticed a huge difference after the first shower!</li>
            <li> But I also want say Thank You to all the people writing reviews, their experiences with this product, it has been a such a good help and support</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even comb through my hair, I had to use so much conditioner just to brush it which then would cause more breakage.   </li>
            <li> Just how many showers can a filter this size, really perform (well) before needing to be changed?  </li>
            <li> After researching for this item for a good price on different websites, I found it on here at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I am so thankful for this product &amp; am a true believer in what it can do &amp; will do for you as well.  </li>
            <li> The shower head has good pressure and several spray options.</li>
            <li> It worked so well that when I moved 6 months ago I bought it for my city water that is full of chlorine.  </li>
            <li> I felt a softer skin at 1st shower then got a bit better after 2nd shower, felt my hair better after nd shower...</li>
            <li> Also as you can see from the photo, I was able to keep using my old shower head attached to the filter!!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase, so far so good.</li>
            <li> The 3-star rating is really just saying that the shower head gives adequate water pressure and installed easily.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love the new filter.  </li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference within days of use, it is easy to install too.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it does exactly what I want - gives me soft, manageable hair in the shower!!!</li>
            <li> My hair was very soft, smooth and manageable after one wash and my roommate commented on how shiny my hair looked!</li>
            <li> It looks like another company&#x27;s product, but trust me it is completely different and way better!  </li>
            <li> leaves your skin and hair feeling super soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> i feel clean for the first time since moving to LA.</li>
            <li> Works great and it came within a few days</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much stronger and my skin is just nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This shower filter lives up to its promise and gives you healthy, soft, manageable hair.  </li>
            <li> It costs a fortune for me to import the filter replacement, but definitely worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> No matter what the cost, it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> A plumber said it wasn&#x27;t worth trying to adapt it for the shower plumbing.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say there isn&#x27;t a massive difference in the condition of my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth the $50.00 in filter change every 6 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this and used my own double shower head</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> So far I have really enjoyed this.</li>
            <li> But it is really worth it for all the benefits.</li>
            <li> So much more water came out, which leads me to believe the old one was just clogged or something</li>
            <li> ) Skin - so far I dont see a difference, but I&#x27;ll update this as I use it more often.</li>
            <li> After using this my hair has become a lot more manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Boy, it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Guaranteed to be worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I wish I had returned it after the first month for a full refund.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall good product that works as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I love my girlfriend very much and I live justfFlorida.</li>
            <li> I have a water softener, but without this little filter it wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li> Who knew the right kind of water would make such a difference!?</li>
            <li> Easy to install although I could not attach my own shower head/handheld combination as the somewhat oddly positioned mount of the filter prevented me from screwing in the assembly.  </li>
            <li> After buying this house, right away my girlfriend</li>
            <li> My shower head connected right up to this with no issues.  </li>
            <li> but really I had the feeling of clean water,after the shower</li>
            <li> I live in an area of hard water and found this to work great!!</li>
            <li> From chunks of hair after every wash to only a few was the best feeling.</li>
            <li> The set up was relatively easy - just detach old shower head and screw the pieces in.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth and soft and I felt clean-not filmy!</li>
            <li> After using the shower filtration system once I was able to use half the product and comb through my hair easily.</li>
            <li> This product has made a huge difference &amp; completely fixed my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve written.</li>
            <li> Regardless it turned out pretty well for me on my end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re wondering why I didn&#x27;t just use regular water.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> The first person to use it was my husband, without knowing what it did.</li>
            <li> On my first shower I was surprise, the amount of hair that fell was like ten at the most.</li>
            <li> This filter does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> While at a conference in Sardinia, Italy, I noticed that although I was using the same shampoo from home, my hair got progressively softer and more manageable as the week progressed.  </li>
            <li> No lie, after the first shower my hair was noticeably smoother and softer and my skin felt softer.</li>
            <li> The first time I washed my hair with the Jonathan filter</li>
            <li> As usual, great product, fast divert,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize exactly how damaging well water was until I took my first shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing more research to find an actual shower water softener because this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li> and I would need to go back to the salon more often.  </li>
            <li> This filter does such a better job.  </li>
            <li> Water pressure, intense!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and there ---I want the color to last more than one washing --.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was too pricey --</li>
            <li> Especially if you buy it on Amazon -- so much better than retail ($95).</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell which exactly helped me to stop loosing hair.</li>
            <li> Either way, I bought this because of the reviews on helping with this exact problem, and the combination stopped the hair loss.</li>
            <li> I may be a bit more critical if I payed $100...</li>
            <li> hair/skin are softer, overall better condition.</li>
            <li> After my first shower with it, I didn&#x27;t need body lotion.</li>
            <li> But I definitely no longer smell the overwhelming chlorine smell I had before.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, this filter does not claim to help with well water, just chlorine and maybe some heavy metals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall quality is good as far as holding up so far with the exception of the plastic color.&lt;br /&gt;However, for me, after a few years of use, there&#x27;s too many cons</li>
            <li> And my skin feels amazing too - it&#x27;s not dried out and red.      </li>
            <li> I think between the filter and the malibu treatment, I should get my bright blonde highlight back.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin so soft and clean feeling</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft and even the shower stays clean.  </li>
            <li> After my first shower I had much needed relief from all the chemicals in my city water.</li>
            <li> It is a good idea to place a basin under the hower head when you first run the water through it because the water is initially tinted black and then clears quickly.</li>
            <li> Your dry, tacky feeling skin will be reborn as smooth as an angel baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser did not believe that it helped my hair as the texture is not what it was prior to having well water, and my hair does not process color as easily as it used to.</li>
            <li> the spray it strong and had different levels you can change it to</li>
            <li> I have well water with a large filter.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works OK, the only problem is where do I get new filters for the thing.</li>
            <li> But a friend went out of the country and when she came back she said that any where else her hair is fine</li>
            <li> just my first use my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry after getting out of the shower, my acne hasn&#x27;t itched nearly as much, and it didn&#x27;t bother eczema at all!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to install</li>
            <li> In combination with Malibu shampoo - my hair is clean and light and the psoriasis on scalp and hair loss is less.</li>
            <li> I really feel like this company care about customer satisfaction</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a religious lotion user after the shower but once or twice since changing to this shower filter I have forgotten to moisturize because it just leaves your skin so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s shiny and smooth using the same shampoos and conditioners I always use.  </li>
            <li> Then I blamed my hair dresser for using too much hair dye.</li>
            <li> It is softer, and the frayed edges have decreased greatly.  </li>
            <li> It really does work &amp; I&#x27;m sooo thankful I found it.</li>
            <li> If you really do have a problem with hair lost</li>
            <li> Thought I wanted to get a whole house water softener, but when I saw the prices, I reconsidered.  </li>
            <li> I use color/bleach on my hair and have noticed it to be much softer as well.</li>
            <li> The water feels smooth, and no longer has a gross taste.</li>
            <li> , how important the water is in your daily hair care.</li>
            <li> My water at home has way too much chlorine.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work for me.  </li>
            <li> This really helps my hair and see a ton of difference,  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to spend too much for the product.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely just loves it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use as much product in my hair.</li>
            <li> I want to note that I have a reverse osmosis plus charcoal whole house filter, which I installed when I built my home.  </li>
            <li> Now it takes much longer for that to develop</li>
            <li> I have been using this water shower purification system for a month and it has made both my hair &amp; skin feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I never trusted the drinking water -- get 3-5 gallon jugs -- but if I capture the shower cold it is delicious</li>
            <li> this product really works, i order one</li>
            <li> every year!&lt;br /&gt;It has really helped to rid my tumbled marble in the shower from</li>
            <li> I had so much iron in my water that the shower wall has rust stains on it.  </li>
            <li> and my hair has been transforming into a much softer and silkier texture.</li>
            <li> Really helped with problems I was having with hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely life changing haha</li>
            <li> So Yes, BUY THIS if you are loosing too much hair and have well water.</li>
            <li> Did not seem to have much of an impact.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s much softer and helped with the winter</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it did much for my hair.</li>
            <li> This filter did not do much if anything, for the calcium and magnesium in the water.</li>
            <li> I bought this at $50 on an Amazon Lightning Deal, so I am writing this review with the premise of paying that much for this product.  </li>
            <li> my whole family likes this product.  </li>
            <li> that said, i can say that it really has improved my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Really saved the day.</li>
            <li> She knocks open the bathroom door like a wild crackhead searching for eyedrops and more Crack.</li>
            <li> So, I decided to step it up a notch and purchases the most expensive shower/water filter I could find (Jonathan Water Purification System)...and to be perfectly honest, we still don&#x27;t see an improvement in how our hair feels/behaves.  </li>
            <li> Well, I have been using it for 3 months and although it has improved my hair texture only slightly, the effects on my skin are remarkable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see how long the water filter will last, but so far it is working great!  </li>
            <li> I have well water with a hardness off 41 which is technically not very hard.</li>
            <li> Makes hair very soft- great for places with hard water!</li>
            <li> Since using this product my hair feels normal again!</li>
            <li> The Filter is brilliant and really works, during the shower I didn&#x27;t smell any Chlorine and also The water felt different, sounds dumb</li>
            <li> My update on this product - The filter is good for less than 4 months only.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t remember this kind of sensation since I was a child, I didn&#x27;t even used my body lotion after or any specific hair conditioner and usually my hair and skin really needs super Hydration after the shower.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m probably allergic to the metals/chemicals in my water (I have pretty sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> An absolute rats nest of snarles and tangles which isn&#x27;t normal for me.</li>
            <li> and although we do use a water softener, it just doesn&#x27;t get the water good enough to not turn my blonde dyed hair brassy yellow.</li>
            <li> For years I struggled with my curly auburn DRY hair, buying every moisturizing product available, including Marrakesh oil.    </li>
            <li> Also has very good pressure which we had a hard time getting with other shower heads.  </li>
            <li> and I quickly realized our hair was becoming trashed by the hard water.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> recommend it highly</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> But with that high speed water go through.</li>
            <li> I would highly doubt that the filter function does anything.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I vividly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> They seem a little better now.</li>
            <li> and I really appreciate the professional response with immediate solution.</li>
            <li> to remember the real feel of a natural water.</li>
            <li> Normally it takes me a lot of time and product to comb through my hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BEWARE…be absolutely sure it will work for you, or it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a try if you have mysterious skin/hair issues that correlate with a water source change.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you live in an apartment.</li>
            <li> It was a very noticeable difference because she and I live in Florida so you can guarantee that 90% of the water is tainted because the government here is clearly trying to move along the mortality process of the ever growing elderly population.</li>
            <li> Bought this because my hair and face feel icky after taking a shower at my new apt.</li>
            <li> After doing MAJOR research online, I found this shower filter &amp; decided to buy it after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, fine hair that started getting very dry &amp; thinning, by the handful.</li>
            <li> but I notice that if I only use the single head it seems to filter better.  </li>
            <li> Three months later I am THRILLED to say that those highlights I paid that expensive colorist tons of money for are still there, still platinum, and still looking super natural exactly like I wanted!</li>
            <li> Worked much better first few times after that no different from filters you can buy at lowes or home depot.wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Live in well water area...</li>
            <li> and we didn&#x27;t buy a new one since).</li>
            <li> Have to buy new one.</li>
            <li> Where I house sit, the well water comes out of the regular shower head orange and as a light blonde that is a No-Go.</li>
            <li> My hair felt SO clean and was much easier to manage with less frizz.</li>
            <li> However, my skin started becoming itchy and red dry spots started appearing on my face and over my body.</li>
            <li> Since installing the filter my long hair takes 10 minutes to dry and my styling takes better and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> My skin is soft!</li>
            <li> I have used various filters for my shower and I like this one so much!</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use the natural color of my hair is returning!</li>
            <li> The FIRST thing she asked me when I told her my hair always turned yellow</li>
            <li> And within 1 week, iron residue on the shower walls again and the water tastes and feels exactly the same as when we had no filter at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Completely changed my hair and skin bavk to normal.</li>
            <li> My hair feels normal and soft.</li>
            <li> and I could instantly feel the difference in my hair after the first week.</li>
            <li> Still thinking about a new water softener (old one broke 2 years ago</li>
            <li> Only down side is the price, but if health is important to you, then get it!</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, my hair behaves *much* better with hard city water.  </li>
            <li> I love this solution and recommend it to anyone with hard water.</li>
            <li> so I have to clean the shower less frequently.  </li>
            <li> my skin and hair were soft and silky</li>
            <li> The three spray settings on the shower head cover all your potential wants.  </li>
            <li> or she&#x27;ll go completely bonkers.</li>
            <li> I remember I have just replaced the soft water filter.</li>
            <li> He said his skin really felt different, it felt hydrated.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My skin also benefits from the soft water</li>
            <li> And for the record, when ever we travel to hotels (or friend&#x27;s homes) with soft water, we&#x27;re always blown away by the look/feel of each others hair, after showering.  </li>
            <li> you would think the filter system would last longer then that expecially when I paid 60 dollars for the whole setup.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shower filter for about 3 weeks now and it has really helped my skin and hair immensely!</li>
            <li> and so I was dealing with no water softener which completely destroyed my hair.  </li>
            <li> Installed the system and completely cleaned the shower to get rid of all iron residue to gauge the filter&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I thought our only option would be to install a water softener for the whole house, but found this option by searching online.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Our rental is on well water and has old copper pipes.</li>
            <li> So far there are no green stains at all on the tiles.</li>
            <li> My hair went from being soft and manageable to sticky, tangly, and even started breaking off.  </li>
            <li> I have to go to my hairdresser for a professional malibu treatment every two weeks to get the mineral buildup out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Skin definitely feels much softer.</li>
            <li> The pipes in my apartment are old</li>
            <li> This may not work for everyone, but it completely restored my hair.</li>
            <li> The product developed a leak between the head and the filter element about a month after installation.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair...</li>
            <li> I noticed that this does not have as much pressure as the regular shower</li>
            <li> my hair is soft and manageable and my skin feels moisturized.  </li>
            <li> So far I have determined that my skin is much softer and I do not require near the shampoo I did formerly.  </li>
            <li> No Calcium Lime or rus and no heavy metals thx medicine</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, sure enough, I started feeling itchy after a few day, but I figured it could just be all in my head</li>
            <li> This was easy to install, however the shower head they include with it has very little pressure.  </li>
            <li> I live in an area with very hard water with many minerals.  </li>
            <li> It definitely helps when you don&#x27;t want to send a lot on a system to connect to your main water supply.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curley hair that grabs onto chemicals and makes an instant mess of things.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels 100% back to normal, if not even healthier and softer.</li>
            <li> First run through got rid of the accumulated carbon, as expected.  </li>
            <li> One day back at home, after using the filter once, hair back to being soft and manageable again, using the same exact shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Where I live (southern ohio)</li>
            <li> I finally decided after 5 years and 3 moves to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at this product for over a year on Sephora.com and finally decided to purchase it as part of my new hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> I live in a rural area but still receive city water.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have the chance to try it right away but last night when I got home from work I spent litterally 5 minutes to substitute my old regular shower head with the filter.</li>
            <li> If you color your hair - as I do - it&#x27;s worth every penny because what&#x27;s the point is paying all of that money for a certain hair color only to have it ruined by hard water?  </li>
            <li> Also, living in Chicago with all the rusted water pipes, I can say my skin never felt this smooth and never liked this shiny before.</li>
            <li> I actually called the other products rep and was told that due to the similarities that the confusion did happen, but that the Jonathan actually removed more minerals out of the water than their product did.  </li>
            <li> So soft I could actually run my comb through it.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, my natural hair shine was totally gone!  </li>
            <li> I put my old one back on.</li>
            <li> a simple adjustment to the shower head fixed that.  </li>
            <li> She believes in all this voodoo water blood magic nonsense and it was an easy anniversary present to keep her feeble mind satisfied until the next anti-psychotic script was filled.. for me of course because she drives me insane.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to for a higher flow shower head for half the price, consider [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> After using Jonathan filter for about 10 days I am pleased to report that my hair is no longer super dry, has lots of shine, and does not look crazy on day 2.</li>
            <li> but hey.. no matter what, rain what made my skin &amp; hair feel much softer than this filter or any other filter I&#x27;ve tried b4, trust me, I just wish we could have a rainwater harvesting system in our house</li>
            <li> My hair seems a lot more lively and shiny, whereas before it would get dull and limp.</li>
            <li> Installation was simple and the product is relatively unassuming as far as shower space is concerned.  </li>
            <li> As soon as they are old enough to take showers, I will definitely be buying another!</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews and some stated the Jonathan product was the exact same as another well known product with a different label.  </li>
            <li> I bought this filter 6 years ago when my well water was hard and full of iron.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste any more time or money on hair products until you correct your water problem and this little gem will do just that!   </li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the excellent reviews, and I must say I was a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean and bought this product because I noticed that my hair was falling out at an alarming rate.  </li>
            <li> It must be the high chlorine and other chemicals in the water that this filter removes.  </li>
            <li> And, my skin is much softer and less itchy.  </li>
            <li> and I let it dry naturally,</li>
            <li> I did start using Alterna moisturizing shampoo and conditioner at the same time, and it took a few weeks to see positive changes in my hair and skin</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, blonde hair</li>
            <li> We live in a hard water area and for years I have been using a High Output filters which removed chlorine but did not help my hair a bit.  </li>
            <li> I still bought it because I don&#x27;t have bad allergic reactions to anything that I know of and this product has an overall good review.</li>
            <li> Our water makes me gag sometimes and with this filter I can barely tell its well water, especially when I use the single shower head.  </li>
            <li> Never given an &amp;#34;I hate it&amp;#34; review before, but this product is very deserving.  </li>
            <li> Completely filters out hard water/ well water/ highly chlorinated water ...</li>
            <li> suffer from adult acne, eczema, dry skin all around and dry</li>
            <li> It felt gritty and greasy, as if I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair at all,  and my hair was flat and oily for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> ; I finally decided it was time to find a professional (aka super expensive) BLONDE colorist.</li>
            <li> Really wish it was made better :(</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is making as much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve only had it a week, so I can&#x27;t speak to its long term capabilities, but here is what i noticed so far&lt;</li>
            <li> I then spring into action and spray her down like a Venezuelan in a street riot.</li>
            <li> I live in a single household, so is there an average amount of time to replace?</li>
            <li> Water will initially be colored black for the first few gallons.</li>
            <li> And made worse, we live at the end of a main water line (there&#x27;s even a blow out in my yard, to deal with sentiment build up).  </li>
            <li> Just for a comparison, I stopped using the filter for one day when I went away on a business trip and my hair went back to being frizzy and dry again.      </li>
            <li> I can also tell a big difference in my skin - not as dry with the filter.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s if they actually drank this step above Tijuana swill.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s only for the few people that are sensitive/critical with &amp;#34;that sort of stuff.&amp;#34;  My husband doesn&#x27;t seem to notice a difference, but he isn&#x27;t one to pay attention to how soft skin his skin is.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t end with my hair either--my skin is much softer and more supple without all the chlorine, so much so that my husband even noticed and asked if I &amp;#34;bought new lotion or something?&amp;#34; No new lotion--I barely need skin lotion at all anymore, despite the frigid temps over the past few months.  </li>
            <li> Works fine for me, nothing wrong that I have noticed.</li>
            <li> For years I spent boku $$$$ on platinum highlights to my naturally blonde hair every other month, only to have them fade to dingy yellow within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have a high iron content in my water - installed this in my shower - no more problems.  </li>
            <li> So, sadly...I would not say this product does much to deal with hard water, at all.  </li>
            <li> , it just didn&#x27;t delivery what I desperately want - better</li>
            <li> Our home is around 100 yrs old, not sure when the plumbing was last done.</li>
            <li> I would give it a try, its a long term investment but</li>
            <li> My skin and hair are not nearly as soft as when I shower at my parents, with there water softener.  </li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t had it too long, so i can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s longevity…</li>
            <li> My hair and skin are much softer and the orange tint is no more!</li>
            <li> It makes for a disappointing shower, especially having extremely dry skin and fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair does not look or feel any differently like other reviews listed,</li>
            <li> The only reason I took off a star was due to the shower head-</li>
            <li> I happen to have very long hair</li>
            <li> I hope that this product stays on the market for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend this filter to anyone dealing with hard water and deals with skin issues.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you have hard water</li>
            <li> I bought this product, and I am not exaggerating when I tell you in ONE shampooing my hair was softer, I could comb through it and when it was dry my boyfriend put his hands through my hair and said, \\&quot;</li>
            <li> and my skin was getting so dry</li>
            <li> and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel so dry anymore.</li>
            <li> and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry.  </li>
            <li> Then when I would go to blow dry, I could fill sediment in my scalp.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know about that, but if it helps keep my skin and hair from being so dry and helps keep my colored hair from turning as brassy</li>
            <li> I bought this because my hair would feel dry on the ends and unclean at the roots.  </li>
            <li> It is softer, the color seems to stay longer and it doesn&#x27;t look as dry.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s probably enough nitrates in there to send half of the overweight Florida politicians into cardiac arrest.</li>
            <li> In the last year, I bought 10 different shampoos and conditioners - My hair always felt heavy and dry -</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have too high of hopes after reading reviews about hard water and how limited the options are.  </li>
            <li> I live in an area that serves-up extremely hard water (basically, rocks instead of water, sprays out the showerhead).  </li>
            <li> It took less than 24 hours for them to get back to me</li>
            <li> In fact as weird as this is, but my ends on my hair actually felt rougher and frizzier the first 10 showers or so.</li>
            <li> I got this because my hair was feeling like straw and altho I only color the grey plus a few strands here</li>
            <li> No success after numerous tries.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very full and shiny and I hated not having my normal hair!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to go back to the colorist since, they have stayed so &amp;#34;true!&amp;#34; Not only has my blonde been &amp;#34;fixed,&amp;#34; but my naturally thin, unmanageable and friz-prone hair is now soft, supple and even a little bit shiny (never in my life have I had shiny hair!).  </li>
            <li> I live in DC where we have hard water (due to calcium and magnesium).  </li>
            <li> : I have only had this product operational in my shower for a little under a month.</li>
            <li> We recently moved to a rental house and the water is really hard with various minerals in the water.  </li>
            <li> the water free of bad chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend product.</li>
            <li> it looks cheap and ugly as sin in my white shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used this shower head for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I found if I use no or minimal conditioner it helps</li>
            <li> Though expensive worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still had scale in my shower, spots all ovver my shower curtain, and rough, tangly hair.</li>
            <li> I am also hoping it filters out the iron too, because I was getting pink rings in my tub from it.</li>
            <li> I was so desperate for a Shower purification system after moving to my new college apartment that I found out had a high volume of iron in their water.</li>
            <li> Now, a few days later, my face and chest have a bunch of small red visible patches of dry skin that I have never seen develop on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it completely sealed as not to drip slightly when the water is on, but its very little water is dripping</li>
            <li> &amp; I instantly started noticing a major difference (for the worse) with my hair.</li>
            <li> I live in San Antonio and saying we have hard water is an understatement!</li>
            <li> but my hair is shinier, less dry and all together healthier after just one day.  </li>
            <li> My water is silky and my skin and hair are softer and less dry.</li>
            <li> I can wear my hair down without have to reach down my back because a hair is down between the bra and shirt.</li>
            <li> My shampoo lathered easily, which is typically difficult with hard water.</li>
            <li> My hair is still a dry, tangly mess after a shower.</li>
            <li> Have recommended to other neighbors.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve tried everything including other filters and adding things like Epsom salt, calcium and Vitamin C tabs to my bath water.  </li>
            <li> Also, you should know that I didn&#x27;t change any of my other habits or diet that I had before using this product while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is due to the carbon.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any other shower filtration systems but after a bit of research, this was the one I decided to buy.</li>
            <li> It was to the point where I actually was not able to comb through my hair</li>
            <li> so I saw this one after reading all reviews with other brands.</li>
            <li> and it does take a few extra minutes to rinse my hair thoroughly of product as the flow is a little weaker from the filtration process.</li>
            <li> I live in Denver CO, and the water is not great.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I think our next step is a professional household  water filtration system.  </li>
            <li> I no longer smell fluoride since it goes through active carbon.</li>
            <li> I had to keep scrubbing blue green stains off the shower tiles and my skin was dry and itchy and my hair dull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely an improvement over our hard water in Phoenix.</li>
            <li> My only negative remark would be my shower time has increased some.  </li>
            <li> My water still has iron in it and ruins my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was too late to send back to Amazon, but not to worry since the product has a 100-day warranty.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how long the filter lasts because i just installed it..</li>
            <li> We have acidic water that erodes our copper pipes and leaves blue green scum in the sinks and shower, not to mention my blond hair.</li>
            <li> My water seems to have very harsh chemicals that make my skin extreme dry after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> All those years of frustration, instead of hair,  washed down the drain as my hair has gotten softer.</li>
            <li> Ever since the day I began using it, my eczema has calmed down.</li>
            <li> As a hairdresser living in keywester Florida, irate what the water down here does to my hair.</li>
            <li> My scalp has very minimal flakes after 3 weeks of use!</li>
            <li> My hair and skin feels softer, less frizzy.</li>
            <li> but it started leaking less then a month of using it.</li>
            <li> My hair also has been less frizzy</li>
            <li> down.&lt;br /&gt;I find that annoying but doable; after a few months though, the &amp;#34;doable&amp;#34; becomes less and less for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, note the head attachment piece and make sure your shower head screws off like this</li>
            <li> Maybe it makes some difference on truly atrocious well water full of iron and sediment but it did not appear to help mine.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s your water.&amp;#34; After doing some research, I found out that the water in my city is high in minerals and very hard, so after looking into all sorts of expensive home-filtration systems (and ultimately deciding I couldn&#x27;t afford them)</li>
            <li> Water softener died and it is so expensive to get a new one that will remove iron from the water.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the filter did not last more than two months from how bad my water is, but it says to change it every few months</li>
            <li> She can smell fear and a little bit of urine.</li>
            <li> We have well water that is very hard and high in iron and made my hair very hard, brittle, and frizzy.</li>
            <li> The filter fixed all of that, the only bad thing is the shower head that comes with</li>
            <li> I got my Jonathan Water Shower Filter a few days ago</li>
            <li> It had gotten to the point where I was washing my hair with bottled water because tap water was was destroying my hair.    </li>
            <li> The description says that it filters heavy metals.</li>
            <li> waste your money if you have Iron Water.</li>
            <li> I would always feel itchy and my hair would look limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> it fell apart a few months after I bought it</li>
            <li> They both claimed to filter heavy metals.  </li>
            <li> 212 779-1700 is not available, please leave a message.  </li>
            <li> I have a few days remaining on my warranty, but there is no one at JP to talk to.  </li>
            <li> If you get a defective unit, as I did, you&#x27;ve just wasted your money ...</li>
            <li> I will update in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Bought because hard water due to minerals have been a issue for us.</li>
            <li> My family was losing lots of hair due to the hard water.</li>
            <li> Initially, I looked to a less expensive water/shower filter, but didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference or improvement with our hair.  </li>
            <li> but it still is hard to comb through and feels weighed down.</li>
            <li> I have a small shower so it did extend the water flow out a few inches but</li>
            <li> It also has plenty of power, doesn&#x27;t seem to slow down the flow at all.  </li>
            <li> Filter was not very effective, hair and skin still had residue on it.</li>
            <li> Recently moved into a home with very hard water!</li>
            <li> My hair was sticky, dried out, dull, my hair color was probably 2 shades darker because of the mineral deposits.  </li>
            <li> I have to say my water is so bad I was really hoping this would work since my hair has been to hell with my water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one who usually takes the time to write reviews (</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am not able to return this.</li>
            <li> not sure why this happens</li>
            <li> Only downside is having to buy expensive replacement filters.</li>
            <li> Solved our well water problems in a house with crawlspace too small for water softener.</li>
            <li> No more hair that feels like straw.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Aquasana and Culligan filters and was never completely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I have slightly past shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> It was bulky and was not able to be installed.&lt;br /&gt;THEN</li>
            <li> and I have NO more frizz whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this thing is working.  </li>
            <li> I miss having a detachable shower head, but we have a really small stall</li>
            <li> the water is really bad and my straight hair frizzes up and is dull and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> highly dislike that the plastic has changed color over time into this ugly cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very optimistic that this product would help my hair issues, but I was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Like a film on my skin, plus my hair would be difficult to dry and style.  </li>
            <li> but it does nothing to balance the PH level which is the root of the hard water problem.  </li>
            <li> Esp if you are on well water that has iron &amp; is hard water...</li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks of use before my skin started to not itch from all the minerals, iron and sulphur in our hard well water.</li>
            <li> Because of the hard water, I have to wash my face with bottled water after I wash my face in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have batttled with hard water in my apartment for years.</li>
            <li> I moved to an apartment with hard water and my hair is paying the price.  </li>
            <li> I never thought anything would get rid of the hard water of my shower.  </li>
            <li> but I also have hard water.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help with my really hard water and found this product.</li>
            <li> but you are still looking to not have hard water</li>
            <li> No residue from hard water</li>
            <li> Well, at least since college that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Know, however, that I did not feel icky after taking those showers and my hair, in fact, seemed softer, I guess.</li>
            <li> Every time I showered I still felt dirty and like I had soap still left on me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews....</li>
            <li> I bought this filter in hopes that it would help with my hair (which is colored, thick and below shoulder length) and it didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> I have really thick curly hair that&#x27;s always a bit unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical at first then during one of her knife throwing psychotic blind rage moments I took refuge in the shower.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews first, was skeptical, but was sick of hard water ruining my hair and staining it an orange tint.  </li>
            <li> but it is already back too having bad water</li>
            <li> Not to mention my highlights were turning an ugly, gritty orange color.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this after reviewing the reviews, unfortunately this did nothing for me, very disappointed that I bought this.</li>
            <li> We are in an area with very hard water.  </li>
            <li> I have very hard water with rust, chlorine tc.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of living in am apartment with very hard water.</li>
            <li> This filter takes out all the bad stuff that makes your hair and skin dry.  </li>
            <li> My water must have been awful (live in LA - hard water).</li>
            <li> It seemed to work for about a week and then hard water started again, and as expensive as they were</li>
            <li> A thought comes to my shrieking and exhausted brain.</li>
            <li> You need to install the filter to your shower neck WITHOUT the shower head attached, then run cold water through it for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this shower filter.</li>
            <li> I am so sad with my hair getting thinner lately..</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and the tap water is terrible.</li>
            <li> It was dull, dirty looking.</li>
            <li> It got to the point where my hair was just horrible, falling out, oily, just completely changed.  </li>
            <li> Little disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the town I live in has crazy awful water or what,</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> The hairdresser told me I had some of the worst hair she had ever seen and the only way to fix it was to cut it off to the roots.</li>
            <li> They failed.  </li>
            <li> I have Sebboric Dermatitis (spelled wrong)...</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s really expensive, hopefully we&#x27;ll get that some day, by now I just collect the rainwater boil it &amp; refresh myself water -once</li>
            <li> I bought this for my crazy vegan girlfriend.</li>
            <li> My one disappointment has been with my hair.</li>
            <li> I have well water in my home and always felt dirty when I got out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have well water which made my hair look and feel greasy and dirty, and this product filters out dirt and sediment, which makes my hair look and feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been washing my hair at work (at a salon) because the hard water made my hair feel HORRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> its depressing :(</li>
            <li> I have been living in this home with well water for 2 years &amp; my hair was so bad I couldn&#x27;t stand it.  </li>
            <li> it was so bad.  </li>
            <li> my bad hair was a result of bad water.  </li>
            <li> then you know how bad it is for your skin and hair not to mention the residue it leaves in your shower because of the iron in the water.</li>
            <li> I was desperate!  </li>
            <li> Installed this badboy, took a shower, and have been transformed into an angel sent from heaven to cure the rest of you non-believers of your dirty, sinful-water ways!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fearful, weary, and uncomfortabe.</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> My house has the worst water for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I used to come out of the shower and have terrible redness on my face.</li>
            <li> Terrible product did not help at all...</li>
            <li> water pressure is awful</li>
            <li> I have well water in my house and my hair was terrible.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazing. I can&#x27;t shower with out it! My skin and my hair have never been better!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Highly recommend if you live in an apartment. My hair went from lifeless to full of body and shine!</li>
            <li> I got my Jonathan Water Shower Filter a few days ago and I didn&#x27;t have the chance to try it right away but last night when I got home from work I spent litterally 5 minutes to substitute my old regular shower head with the filter. It was FANTASTIC!!! The Filter is brilliant and really works, during the shower I didn&#x27;t smell any Chlorine and also The water felt different, sounds dumb lol but really I had the feeling of clean water,after the shower my skin and hair were soft and silky, I don&#x27;t remember this kind of sensation since I was a child, I didn&#x27;t even used my body lotion after or any specific hair conditioner and usually my hair and skin really needs super Hydration after the shower.I vividly recommend this product! Love it! But I also want say Thank You to all the people writing reviews, their experiences with this product, it has been a such a good help and support I couldn&#x27;t find the right item if it wasn&#x27;t for all of you people! It&#x27;s beautiful to share! Anyway I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and I suggest also to get one!</li>
            <li> I had a problem at the beginning but Atlas Supply Chain was more than willing to help me out and fix the problem immediately. It took less than 24 hours for them to get back to me and I really appreciate the professional response with immediate solution. I really feel like this company care about customer satisfaction genuinely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the product!&lt;br /&gt;I felt IMMEDIATE difference with just one shower. I have read reviews like that I thought to myself &amp;#34;pppfft It can not be that good&amp;#34; but yes it is that GOOD. My hair feels so much stronger and my skin is just nice and soft. I&#x27;m a religious lotion user after the shower but once or twice since changing to this shower filter I have forgotten to moisturize because it just leaves your skin so smooth and silky. I already recommended to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft! My skin is soft! Love it!</li>
            <li> Installs easy. Seems to have improved water quality. Girlfriend says its better for her hair.</li>
            <li> I live in DC where we have hard water (due to calcium and magnesium).  I tried the Sprite shower filter which works great to remove chlorine from the water but it does nothing to balance the PH level which is the root of the hard water problem.  My hair was sticky, dried out, dull, my hair color was probably 2 shades darker because of the mineral deposits.  It had gotten to the point where I was washing my hair with bottled water because tap water was was destroying my hair.    I started using the Jonathan system about a week ago and my hair felt dramatically better the very first time I took the shower with the filter installed.  My hair is now soft, smooth, shiny, and bright.  And my skin feels amazing too - it&#x27;s not dried out and red.      This shower filter lives up to its promise and gives you healthy, soft, manageable hair.  If you color your hair - as I do - it&#x27;s worth every penny because what&#x27;s the point is paying all of that money for a certain hair color only to have it ruined by hard water?  I love this shower filter!</li>
            <li> This filter takes out all the bad stuff that makes your hair and skin dry.  Where I live (southern ohio) the water is really bad and my straight hair frizzes up and is dull and lifeless.  I immediately noticed a big difference in my hair - it&#x27;s shiny and smooth using the same shampoos and conditioners I always use.  And, my skin is much softer and less itchy.  It must be the high chlorine and other chemicals in the water that this filter removes.  I also put one in our home in Florida with the same results.  It&#x27;s definitely worth it!  And it&#x27;s a snap to install.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve written. This product is amazing and I felt compelled. I moved to a home with a well, and my hair started to break off. In my 20&#x27;s I was a hair model now in my 40s I thought it might be hormonal. I had all the testing done and I was fine. Then I blamed my hair dresser for using too much hair dye. Then I thought it might be my thyroid. I couldn&#x27;t even comb through my hair, I had to use so much conditioner just to brush it which then would cause more breakage.   I am a performer and my agent started telling me to do something with my hair!  I finally, figured out it might be the well. I bought this product, and I am not exaggerating when I tell you in ONE shampooing my hair was softer, I could comb through it and when it was dry my boyfriend put his hands through my hair and said, \\&quot; Oh, good now this hair drama is over\\&quot;  I can&#x27;t thank Jonathan enough for making this product. I hope they never go out of business so I can keep getting filters!   I don&#x27;t work for this company or have any stake except in keeping someone else from yelling at their hairdresser! LOL</li>
            <li> There is no difference in water.</li>
            <li> I had to come on here and rave about this product.  *Disclaimer: I have only had this product operational in my shower for a little under a month.* That disclaimer being said, I love it.  I have already (by wash two) noticed a difference in my hair.  It is softer, and the frayed edges have decreased greatly.  My skin also feels silkier.  Installation was simple and the product is relatively unassuming as far as shower space is concerned.  The three spray settings on the shower head cover all your potential wants.  My only negative remark would be my shower time has increased some.  I happen to have very long hair and it does take a few extra minutes to rinse my hair thoroughly of product as the flow is a little weaker from the filtration process.</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean and bought this product because I noticed that my hair was falling out at an alarming rate.  Well, I have been using it for 3 months and although it has improved my hair texture only slightly, the effects on my skin are remarkable.  This is the softest my skin has ever felt.  I am a believer!!  It costs a fortune for me to import the filter replacement, but definitely worth every penny.  Now if only my hair would stop falling out.......</li>
            <li> I recently moved into a home that has a well &amp; I instantly started noticing a major difference (for the worse) with my hair. I have naturally curly, fine hair that started getting very dry &amp; thinning, by the handful. Not to mention my highlights were turning an ugly, gritty orange color. After doing MAJOR research online, I found this shower filter &amp; decided to buy it after reading all the positive reviews. I&#x27;m not one who usually takes the time to write reviews (although I should b/c I rely on everyone else&#x27;s when I purchase products)...but, this filter is AMAZING...just like many reviewers already mentioned. It really does work &amp; I&#x27;m sooo thankful I found it. It&#x27;s only been about 5 days since I installed it but my hair is already dramatically better. The curls have come back &amp; I&#x27;m not losing a ton of hair when I shower, or after. I can&#x27;t rave enough about it....I will definitely be purchasing replacement filters because I won&#x27;t be living without this shower system anymore! Its a must have!!! Esp if you are on well water that has iron &amp; is hard water...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my crazy vegan girlfriend. She believes in all this voodoo water blood magic nonsense and it was an easy anniversary present to keep her feeble mind satisfied until the next anti-psychotic script was filled.. for me of course because she drives me insane. Regardless it turned out pretty well for me on my end. I was quite skeptical at first then during one of her knife throwing psychotic blind rage moments I took refuge in the shower. I figured since I was there I might as well turn on the shower and give it a whirl. It was a very noticeable difference because she and I live in Florida so you can guarantee that 90% of the water is tainted because the government here is clearly trying to move along the mortality process of the ever growing elderly population. My hair was a silky smooth and I was very pleased with the outcome of the product. It works well. I have never been so happy to have something expel liquid onto my nubile body.. Well, at least since college that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s June 5th and nearing two in the morning. The banshee is awake and out for blood.. Man&#x27;s blood. I am once again taking refuge in the shower. I hear her peddle through the house like Scooby-Doo. Tip tapping her feet to instill terror into my heart. I&#x27;m fearful, weary, and uncomfortabe. She can smell fear and a little bit of urine. I must face her and attempt to slip her an Ambien. She&#x27;s sort of like a dog during fourth of July you gotta put her to sleep or she&#x27;ll go completely bonkers. A thought comes to my shrieking and exhausted brain. I remember I have just replaced the soft water filter. I load fifteen tablets of Ambien CR into the filter and get it running. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re wondering why I didn&#x27;t just use regular water. I love my girlfriend very much and I live justfFlorida. I want to put her to sleep not kill her. There&#x27;s probably enough nitrates in there to send half of the overweight Florida politicians into cardiac arrest. That&#x27;s if they actually drank this step above Tijuana swill. She knocks open the bathroom door like a wild crackhead searching for eyedrops and more Crack. I then spring into action and spray her down like a Venezuelan in a street riot. She is immediately knocked out. I lay her in bed andwrite this review. Get the purifier! IIt&#x27;ll save your life! And the filters last forever. It&#x27;s been likea year  and we just replaced it. Maybe it&#x27;s because she doesn&#x27;t bathe...</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, but don&#x27;t expect miracles. It took about 2 weeks of use before my skin started to not itch from all the minerals, iron and sulphur in our hard well water. I don&#x27;t smell any more sulphur which is fantastic. I am using Malibu demineralizing treatments to get the rest of the brassiness out of my hair. I think between the filter and the malibu treatment, I should get my bright blonde highlight back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been losing lots of hair, I would leave a trail of hair every where. I took vitamins, I used different shampoos, treatments, all the things you can imagine and I was at the point of giving up and just blame stress. But a friend went out of the country and when she came back she said that any where else her hair is fine but when she comes home, she starts shedding a lot. I looked into it and found this.   After reading a couple of reviews, I just had to give it a try. The first person to use it was my husband, without knowing what it did. He said his skin really felt different, it felt hydrated. On my first shower I was surprise, the amount of hair that fell was like ten at the most. From chunks of hair after every wash to only a few was the best feeling. I can wear my hair down without have to reach down my back because a hair is down between the bra and shirt. I touch my hair and hair doesn&#x27;t fall in my hands. My hair looks shinning without putting any product on.   If you really do have a problem with hair lost I would give it a try, its a long term investment but worth it. I can&#x27;t imagine going back to regular water anymore.</li>
            <li> I have heard wonderful things about this product- and they are all true!&lt;br /&gt;I use city water as I live in an apartment, and I&#x27;m sure it works just as great for well water as well.&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from adult acne, eczema, dry skin all around and dry hair- this thing does wonders for all of the above!&lt;br /&gt;In just my first use my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry after getting out of the shower, my acne hasn&#x27;t itched nearly as much, and it didn&#x27;t bother eczema at all!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to install, the shower head itself works better than my original one and I even use it for baths and to wash my face in the mornings and nights.</li>
            <li> Live in well water area... is helping my hair and skin.  Also has very good pressure which we had a hard time getting with other shower heads.  Would purchase again!  Have recommended to other neighbors.</li>
            <li> This filter does exactly what it says it does. I have well water and after replacing our pump the rust was turning my blonde hair orange even with a water softener. After putting this in place (and a malibu hair treatment) my hair is blonde again and staying that way. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Filtered water does make difference. I live in Denver CO, and the water is not great. This makes a huge difference on my skin and hair. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Thought I wanted to get a whole house water softener, but when I saw the prices, I reconsidered.  I love this product because it does exactly what I want - gives me soft, manageable hair in the shower!!!</li>
            <li> After my first shower I had much needed relief from all the chemicals in my city water. I use color/bleach on my hair and have noticed it to be much softer as well. Glad I bought this, just wish I would have heard of it sooner.</li>
            <li> Easy to install. Used my own shower head. Noticeable difference in quality of water</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the excellent reviews, and I must say I was a little disappointed.  My skin and hair are not nearly as soft as when I shower at my parents, with there water softener.  I don&#x27;t know if the town I live in has crazy awful water or what, but I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy. My water seems to have very harsh chemicals that make my skin extreme dry after taking a shower. It&#x27;s like immediately after I finish, this white film basically covered my chest area, legs, knees and elbow. Now that I have install this water filter I no longer have this film covering my body. Also, I believe my hair is benefiting because it seems softer and fuller.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! My hair is soft and shiny. My skin also benefits from the soft water Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I live in an area that serves-up extremely hard water (basically, rocks instead of water, sprays out the showerhead).  And made worse, we live at the end of a main water line (there&#x27;s even a blow out in my yard, to deal with sentiment build up).  After buying this house, right away my girlfriend and I quickly realized our hair was becoming trashed by the hard water.  Initially, I looked to a less expensive water/shower filter, but didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference or improvement with our hair.  So, I decided to step it up a notch and purchases the most expensive shower/water filter I could find (Jonathan Water Purification System)...and to be perfectly honest, we still don&#x27;t see an improvement in how our hair feels/behaves.  Sadly, I think our next step is a professional household  water filtration system.  And for the record, when ever we travel to hotels (or friend&#x27;s homes) with soft water, we&#x27;re always blown away by the look/feel of each others hair, after showering.  So, sadly...I would not say this product does much to deal with hard water, at all.  Not to mention, the actual filter on this system is only slightly larger than one which would be installed on a sink.  Just how many showers can a filter this size, really perform (well) before needing to be changed?  Think about that, people...</li>
            <li> Makes your skin so soft and clean feeling</li>
            <li> I did pretty extensive research in regards to what shower head filter would work best with well water.  I had read other reviews and some stated the Jonathan product was the exact same as another well known product with a different label.  My research proved that to be untrue.  I actually called the other products rep and was told that due to the similarities that the confusion did happen, but that the Jonathan actually removed more minerals out of the water than their product did.  Internally there are differences.  The Jonathan is a bit more expensive and so are the replacement filters, but my problem was not Chlorine (city water) but well water, so it was worth it to spend a bit more.  The brasiness is leaving my hair and I would suggest this to anyone dealing with well water who is having an issue.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the box, the quality of the product was obvious. This unit is very easy to install, it does not require any tools for installation. My wife reports that she can feel and see a differene in her hair. If I had hair I am sure that I would concur.</li>
            <li> Works great and it came within a few days</li>
            <li> I live in an area of hard water and found this to work great!!</li>
            <li> Best water filtration system ever. The water feels smooth, and no longer has a gross taste. Also, living in Chicago with all the rusted water pipes, I can say my skin never felt this smooth and never liked this shiny before. Only down side is the price, but if health is important to you, then get it!</li>
            <li> Hair &amp; skin feel great!  Love it!</li>
            <li> For years I struggled with my curly auburn DRY hair, buying every moisturizing product available, including Marrakesh oil.    In the last year, I bought 10 different shampoos and conditioners - My hair always felt heavy and dry - nothing seemed to work.   While at a conference in Sardinia, Italy, I noticed that although I was using the same shampoo from home, my hair got progressively softer and more manageable as the week progressed.  Finally I realized the answer was the water!!  This filter system is a God-send.  All those years of frustration, instead of hair,  washed down the drain as my hair has gotten softer. This was the best money ever spent on my hair.  Don&#x27;t waste any more time or money on hair products until you correct your water problem and this little gem will do just that!   Update: Nov 20th - this filter is the single best purchase I have ever made on Amazon.  I was at a 5 day conference in DC recently without my filter, and again, my hair got progressivelly drier. One day back at home, after using the filter once, hair back to being soft and manageable again, using the same exact shampoo.  I can&#x27;t stress enough, how important the water is in your daily hair care. I use no products in my hair now, which will make up for the cost of the filters every 6 months. No matter what the cost, it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Installed over a month ago and still working well.  I am going to order replacement filters since I am very happy with this product.  Without this filter my shower will turn orange in just a couple of days.  I needed something to stop by blonde hair turning orange.  Water softener died and it is so expensive to get a new one that will remove iron from the water.  I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> been using this for years. I finally decided after 5 years and 3 moves to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I have used various filters for my shower and I like this one so much! My water at home has way too much chlorine. No lie, after the first shower my hair was noticeably smoother and softer and my skin felt softer. I even travel with it sometimes... Where I house sit, the well water comes out of the regular shower head orange and as a light blonde that is a No-Go. I bring this with me and it feels just as great as the first time I used it and there is no weird orange color coming out into my hair!!</li>
            <li> Works great,  The price is good too for such good quality,  I tried drinking the water and it&#x27;s much better than most drinking water filters.  The shower head is good quality too,</li>
            <li> yay! my hair is so happy with this filtration system. the difference is noticeable. thank you amazon community of reviewers for steering me toward this product!</li>
            <li> Works fine for me, nothing wrong that I have noticed.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use the natural color of my hair is returning!</li>
            <li> This filter is amazing.  You will see immediate results-- I&#x27;ve only used it for three days but my hair is shinier, less dry and all together healthier after just one day.  Just for a comparison, I stopped using the filter for one day when I went away on a business trip and my hair went back to being frizzy and dry again.      I didn&#x27;t notice any difference with my skin but I&#x27;ve never had any issues with my skin to begin with. All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awful! It leaked and had the improper washer to prevent it from doing so. A plumber said it wasn&#x27;t worth trying to adapt it for the shower plumbing.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this after reviewing the reviews, unfortunately this did nothing for me, very disappointed that I bought this. Unfortunately I am not able to return this.</li>
            <li> Very easy to install. Made both my hair and skin feel softer than ive ever felt before.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say there isn&#x27;t a massive difference in the condition of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;However, I will say that my hair&#x27;s behavior is more consistent than before using this filter, BUT I have also changed environments and I know that plays a role and can&#x27;t fully give credit to the filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lowers the original shower head which makes me have to bend down.&lt;br /&gt;I find that annoying but doable; after a few months though, the &amp;#34;doable&amp;#34; becomes less and less for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, note the head attachment piece and make sure your shower head screws off like this requires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly dislike that the plastic has changed color over time into this ugly cream.&lt;br /&gt;So it looks cheap and ugly as sin in my white shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall quality is good as far as holding up so far with the exception of the plastic color.&lt;br /&gt;However, for me, after a few years of use, there&#x27;s too many cons and I&#x27;m opting for a silver one in another brand.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for 3 days but it is already back too having bad water you would think the filter system would last longer then that expecially when I paid 60 dollars for the whole setup. Little disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work for me.  My house has the worst water for my hair.  For whatever reason, my hair behaves *much* better with hard city water.  I thought this might do the trick - I&#x27;ve tried everything including other filters and adding things like Epsom salt, calcium and Vitamin C tabs to my bath water.  It may work just fine, it just didn&#x27;t delivery what I desperately want - better hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very easy to install and I was worried it would lower my shower head height because I&#x27;m tall, but it didn&#x27;t.  It just moves it out a bit.</li>
            <li> It has made such a difference in my hair and body.  I love love love it.  My hair is so smooth and bouncy and I can go some longer without a touch-up.  My skin feels and looks so soft.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Service!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shower filter for about 3 weeks now and it has really helped my skin and hair immensely! I used to come out of the shower and have terrible redness on my face. I think I&#x27;m probably allergic to the metals/chemicals in my water (I have pretty sensitive skin). I have a water softener, but without this little filter it wasn&#x27;t very effective. Additionally, I&#x27;ve had stubborn dandruff and unruly hair for practically 10 years. I&#x27;ve wasted sooooo much money on hair, scalp and skin products. I finally feel this pH balancing filter is helping. My scalp has very minimal flakes after 3 weeks of use! This is amazing, and I will gladly purchase replacement filters when this one run&#x27;s out!</li>
            <li> We moved into an apartment while waiting for our house to be built and so I was dealing with no water softener which completely destroyed my hair.  We are in an area with very hard water.  It got to the point where my hair was just horrible, falling out, oily, just completely changed.  Searched for options and found this and it has saved my hair. Would recommend to anyone living in an apartment where they can&#x27;t have a water softener.</li>
            <li> This seems to work well for chlorine, but it is not a water softener.</li>
            <li> Bought this because my hair and face feel icky after taking a shower at my new apt. Because of the hard water, I have to wash my face with bottled water after I wash my face in the shower. Anyway, bought this product to not have to do that, and it seemed to work. However, my skin started becoming itchy and red dry spots started appearing on my face and over my body. I only used this product for one week. I probably took about 9-12 showers with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure it was because of this product because I told myself if anything were to change about my skin or hair after using it, it must be this product, and I looked over my skin and hair before using this product and paid close attention to my skin while using this product. I did this because I read a review with someone saying it made her break out with red marks. I still bought it because I don&#x27;t have bad allergic reactions to anything that I know of and this product has an overall good review. Also, you should know that I didn&#x27;t change any of my other habits or diet that I had before using this product while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, sure enough, I started feeling itchy after a few day, but I figured it could just be all in my head and I did not scratch or bother it in any way, so I kept using it. Now, a few days later, my face and chest have a bunch of small red visible patches of dry skin that I have never seen develop on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know, however, that I did not feel icky after taking those showers and my hair, in fact, seemed softer, I guess. Nevertheless, the side effects freaked me out so I have stopped using it and went back to my bottled water method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why this happens but it happens. So, Beware!</li>
            <li> Terrible product did not help at all...water pressure is awful</li>
            <li> For years I spent boku $$$$ on platinum highlights to my naturally blonde hair every other month, only to have them fade to dingy yellow within 2 weeks. After being told by my longtime stylist for years that my hair &amp;#34;just had too much red in it to stay blonde,&amp;#34; I finally decided it was time to find a professional (aka super expensive) BLONDE colorist. The FIRST thing she asked me when I told her my hair always turned yellow was: what kind of water do you have, well or city? When I told her I had city water, her response was: &amp;#34;It&#x27;s not your hair, it&#x27;s your water.&amp;#34; After doing some research, I found out that the water in my city is high in minerals and very hard, so after looking into all sorts of expensive home-filtration systems (and ultimately deciding I couldn&#x27;t afford them) I decided to try out this filter, in addition to Malibu Blonde hair treatments.  Three months later I am THRILLED to say that those highlights I paid that expensive colorist tons of money for are still there, still platinum, and still looking super natural exactly like I wanted! I haven&#x27;t had to go back to the colorist since, they have stayed so &amp;#34;true!&amp;#34; Not only has my blonde been &amp;#34;fixed,&amp;#34; but my naturally thin, unmanageable and friz-prone hair is now soft, supple and even a little bit shiny (never in my life have I had shiny hair!).  It doesn&#x27;t end with my hair either--my skin is much softer and more supple without all the chlorine, so much so that my husband even noticed and asked if I &amp;#34;bought new lotion or something?&amp;#34; No new lotion--I barely need skin lotion at all anymore, despite the frigid temps over the past few months.  I CANNOT believe the improvement in my life since installing this thing, and even though the replacement filters are pricey, I will be buying them every 3 months from now on. I wish they made one for a bathtub faucet so my kids could use it for their baths! As soon as they are old enough to take showers, I will definitely be buying another!</li>
            <li> I live in San Antonio and saying we have hard water is an understatement! After one use with this filter my hair and skin feel better already. Also as you can see from the photo, I was able to keep using my old shower head attached to the filter!! Great product and great price. Installation was fairly easy as well!</li>
            <li> I have had this shower filter system for years and Love It! It&#x27;s totally worth the $50.00 in filter change every 6 months. My hair and skin feels softer, less frizzy. Easy to install and maintain. Shower head allows for different water pressure adjustment. Love it :-)</li>
            <li> I have well water with a large filter.  My water still has iron in it and ruins my hair.  The first time I washed my hair with the Jonathan filter it was amazing!  So soft I could actually run my comb through it.  No tangles and the shine was amazing.  Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> As usual, great product, fast divert,</li>
            <li> I moved into a house with well water and my hair was turning orange and my skin was getting so dry and it was so itchy and my white shower floor was always orange. I bought this and used my own double shower head and it works great. My hair and shower floor isn&#x27;t turning orange anymore and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel so dry anymore. I&#x27;m not itchy anymore and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry.  I used my shower head instead of the one it came with because I like a double one but I notice that if I only use the single head it seems to filter better.  Our water makes me gag sometimes and with this filter I can barely tell its well water, especially when I use the single shower head.  This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> We have well water that has iron in it. The description says that it filters heavy metals. Installed the system and completely cleaned the shower to get rid of all iron residue to gauge the filter&#x27;s effectiveness. For the first 2 days, it was great! Water tasted and felt great. On the third day, I started to taste the iron in the water again. And within 1 week, iron residue on the shower walls again and the water tastes and feels exactly the same as when we had no filter at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am thoroughly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money if you have Iron Water.</li>
            <li> It looks like another company&#x27;s product, but trust me it is completely different and way better!  It removes whatever it is in the water (probably chlorine) that makes my hair look like hay.  I have a different head of hair with this filter.  It is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This really helps my hair and see a ton of difference,  but it started leaking less then a month of using it. Really wish it was made better :(</li>
            <li> My husband and I moved into a house with well water. I didn&#x27;t realize exactly how damaging well water was until I took my first shower. I got out, after shampooing and conditioning and I couldn&#x27;t pull a brush through my hair.  An absolute rats nest of snarles and tangles which isn&#x27;t normal for me. Then when I would go to blow dry, I could fill sediment in my scalp. It felt gritty and greasy, as if I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair at all,  and my hair was flat and oily for the rest of the day. I was freaking out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went onto amazon to look for shampoos for well water, thinking that was a good first option. I stumbled upon this Jonathan water filter and read the reviews. So many people seemed to say that it worked wonders for them.... I hesitently decided to give it a try, despite the cost and my being broke after the holidays....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH MY GOD. This filter has saved my life! My hair feels 100% back to normal, if not even healthier and softer. It is absolutely amazing. I have nothing but great things to say about it and give it my highest recommendation.  It&#x27;s easy to install, lasts up to 6 months. Completely filters out hard water/ well water/ highly chlorinated water ... leaves your skin and hair feeling super soft and healthy.  If your situation is similar mine, do not second guess this. Works wonders, I tell you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. This is the longest review I have ever written about anything. That is how wonderful this product is!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, seemed very easy to install. I will update my review tomorrow morning when I take another shower. Read the directions before installation. You need to install the filter to your shower neck WITHOUT the shower head attached, then run cold water through it for a few minutes. Water will initially be colored black for the first few gallons. This is due to the carbon.</li>
            <li> I have only used this shower head for a few weeks. I am not sure if it is making as much of a difference. In fact as weird as this is, but my ends on my hair actually felt rougher and frizzier the first 10 showers or so. I don&#x27;t know if it was because their was maybe more moisture in the ends, and like humidity makes your hair frizzy this was leaving more moisture in my hair. They seem a little better now. I did my research and found this one to be the purification system that fit my needs. I read reviews that it was like bathing in Algerian springs, I don&#x27;t know about that, but if it helps keep my skin and hair from being so dry and helps keep my colored hair from turning as brassy then I will be very pleased. I will say it is nice that you can use the shower head that comes with it and or a shower sprayer.</li>
            <li> After researching for this item for a good price on different websites, I found it on here at Amazon.com I was so desperate for a Shower purification system after moving to my new college apartment that I found out had a high volume of iron in their water. Every time I showered I still felt dirty and like I had soap still left on me. Eww. Once I installed and used this shower head, I was impressed with the non soapy feeling on my skin, and noticed that my hair color wasn&#x27;t fading as fast :) Great Buy!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any other shower filtration systems but after a bit of research, this was the one I decided to buy. It&#x27;s an excellent product that is great for hair and skin! I&#x27;m very happy I bought it. Only downside is having to buy expensive replacement filters.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My water is silky and my skin and hair are softer and less dry.</li>
            <li> My well water is filtered and still does work with my hair. Since using this product my hair feels normal again!</li>
            <li> Worked much better first few times after that no different from filters you can buy at lowes or home depot.wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference having this product. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I have well water in my house and my hair was terrible.  My stylist recommended this product and I am very happy with it. My hair has improved greatly. Good seller and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Nothing change my hair and skin. Not happy with this shower filter.</li>
            <li> We have well water that is very hard and high in iron and made my hair very hard, brittle, and frizzy. I tried using products to strip the iron build up from my hair as well as tried using baking soda and vinegar on my hair. None of those options worked. I thought our only option would be to install a water softener for the whole house, but found this option by searching online. Boy, am I glad we did! This makes such a noticeable difference in my hair - with the filter it&#x27;s soft, shiny, and looks great. I can also tell a big difference in my skin - not as dry with the filter. I also no longer have to use detangler in my daughter&#x27;s hair. I love this solution and recommend it to anyone with hard water.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and it works great on her skin. I recommend this product to everyone. Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  Love the showers now and my skin and health thank you.</li>
            <li> This filter has changed my life!  I waited about a month to review even thought it was awesome from day 1!  As many have stated, I have well water.  I have been living in this home with well water for 2 years &amp; my hair was so bad I couldn&#x27;t stand it.  It was to the point where I actually was not able to comb through my hair it was so bad.  I was desperate!  This product has made a huge difference &amp; completely fixed my hair.  I have color treated very fine hair.  I am so thankful for this product &amp; am a true believer in what it can do &amp; will do for you as well.  Thank you Jonathan Beauty!!</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair soft and shiny. The water pressure is great and the water feels different. Different means fantastic and great!!!</li>
            <li> Shower purification is working good including the shower head. If you don&#x27;t want to spend too much for the product.</li>
            <li> Noticed a great difference with this filter! Felt clean, fresh, and healthier! I just wish it lasted longer, and I&#x27;m hoping to get a replacement soon!!</li>
            <li> I never do reviews, but this product is great. Solved our well water problems in a house with crawlspace too small for water softener. I think this is better, anyway. No more hair that feels like straw.</li>
            <li> Our rental is on well water and has old copper pipes. I had to keep scrubbing blue green stains off the shower tiles and my skin was dry and itchy and my hair dull. I have had this filter for several weeks now. My skin immediately felt better. My husband also felt a difference immediately. The shower head has good pressure and several spray options. So far there are no green stains at all on the tiles. My one disappointment has been with my hair. It feels stickier after washing. I found if I use no or minimal conditioner it helps but it still is hard to comb through and feels weighed down. The color has improved though.</li>
            <li> Made a huge difference!! Love it!! Hair has never felt so great...I&#x27;M a stylish myself and I&#x27;ve been telling everyone!</li>
            <li> I have batttled with hard water in my apartment for years. It makes for a disappointing shower, especially having extremely dry skin and fine hair. I would always feel itchy and my hair would look limp and greasy. I have tried the Aquasana and Culligan filters and was never completely satisfied with the results. I just got my Jonathan filter last week. It was super easy to install and I noticed a huge difference after the first shower! My shampoo lathered easily, which is typically difficult with hard water. My skin felt smooth and soft and I felt clean-not filmy! My hair was very soft, smooth and manageable after one wash and my roommate commented on how shiny my hair looked! She also loves the filter. I would highly reccomend this filter to anyone dealing with hard water and deals with skin issues. Its a makeover for your skin and hair! Worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I bought this as I was hoping that it would help with the condition of my hair.  I moved to an apartment with hard water and my hair is paying the price.  My hair went from being soft and manageable to sticky, tangly, and even started breaking off.  I have to go to my hairdresser for a professional malibu treatment every two weeks to get the mineral buildup out of my hair.  I thought that this water filter would enable me to stop that and although it does remove the chlorine it doesn&#x27;t do anything about the minerals.  I&#x27;m doing more research to find an actual shower water softener because this isn&#x27;t it.  Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> So far, so good! Skin definitely feels much softer. My wife absolutely just loves it. Happy Wife, Happy Life!</li>
            <li> So far I have really enjoyed this. It was very easy to install and begin using. The water feels smooth and silky on my skin. Ever since the day I began using it, my eczema has calmed down. My hair also has been less frizzy and I don&#x27;t use as much product in my hair. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I love the water filter.  It makes my hair feel fabulous.</li>
            <li> Bought for my GF. She loves it</li>
            <li> Wow!  What a difference this has made!</li>
            <li> I have  never written a review for ANYTHING before but oh my goodness, I just had to write one for this system! This is product is so worth the money! The first time I used it my hair and skin were incredibly softer. Who knew the right kind of water would make such a difference!? I will be getting a unit for each shower in my home.</li>
            <li> good product and good price.  recommend it highly</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin and hair silky, shiny and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps the water free of bad chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at this product for over a year on Sephora.com and finally decided to purchase it as part of my new hair care regimen. I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my hair and skin since using this product not to mention my shower wall and tub are easier to clean now. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for 6 months now and can&#x27;t imagine how I showered without it.  I have well water in my home and always felt dirty when I got out of the shower.  Like a film on my skin, plus my hair would be difficult to dry and style.  Since installing the filter my long hair takes 10 minutes to dry and my styling takes better and lasts longer.  My skin feels clean and more supple.  I color my hair and the color lasts longer and looks great.  Before, the color would start to turn and I would need to go back to the salon more often.  I want to note that I have a reverse osmosis plus charcoal whole house filter, which I installed when I built my home.  This filter does such a better job.  Also I have a glass enclosure in my shower that would get spots and film from all the metals and impurities in my water.  Now it takes much longer for that to develop so I have to clean the shower less frequently.  What an added bonus!!!  My only gripe?  $50 for replacement cartridges. OUCH!  But it is really worth it for all the benefits.</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING!!  After spending hundreds of dollars on carifying shampoos and designer conditioners it occured to me my bad hair was a result of bad water.  This system has saved me buckets of money.  I bought this filter 6 years ago when my well water was hard and full of iron.  It worked so well that when I moved 6 months ago I bought it for my city water that is full of chlorine.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I have fine, curley hair that grabs onto chemicals and makes an instant mess of things.  This is the BEST filter and  I would recommend it if you want the best water for your hair and skin.</li>
            <li> It works OK, the only problem is where do I get new filters for the thing. Jonathan Shower replacment filters</li>
            <li> I bought this filter in hopes that it would help with my hair (which is colored, thick and below shoulder length) and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. I did start using Alterna moisturizing shampoo and conditioner at the same time, and it took a few weeks to see positive changes in my hair and skin BUT.. with that said, I&#x27;m so thrilled with the condition of my hair now. I don&#x27;t use de-frizzing products or shine enhancing products and my hair looks glossy and smooth about 90% of the time. Well worth the cost of the shower unit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a definite difference after installing the filter. My hair seems a lot more lively and shiny, whereas before it would get dull and limp. I like it!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s skin doesn&#x27;t itch anymore and the water feels a bit softer. It&#x27;s definitely an improvement over our hard water in Phoenix.</li>
            <li> I have well water which made my hair look and feel greasy and dirty, and this product filters out dirt and sediment, which makes my hair look and feel cleaner. It also makes my bleach blonde hair lighter/normal, it got rid of the orangy reddish tint the well water had caused.</li>
            <li> Very gooooood!!!  Noticeably difference in the hair.  Really love it!!</li>
            <li> I see no changes in the month I used it.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this product before. Bought because hard water due to minerals have been a issue for us. It definitely helps when you don&#x27;t want to send a lot on a system to connect to your main water supply.</li>
            <li> Great product, skin and hair look and feel better.</li>
            <li> My existing shower head was what came with the apartment. The water pressure was horrible, and i always got out of the shower feeling like my hair was greasy. Imagine spending all that time blow drying my hair straight, only to feel my roots have an incredible amount of build up, an hour after showering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I bought this baby. Now I&#x27;ve only had it a week, so I can&#x27;t speak to its long term capabilities, but here is what i noticed so far&lt;br /&gt;a) Water pressure, intense! So much more water came out, which leads me to believe the old one was just clogged or something&lt;br /&gt;b) My hair felt SO clean and was much easier to manage with less frizz. It looked like a proper hair do, and not some pasty, grease at the roots (gross)&lt;br /&gt;c) Skin - so far I dont see a difference, but I&#x27;ll update this as I use it more often. I have oily acne prone skin, so im hoping cleaner water will fix this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One question for current users of this product...how do you know when it&#x27;s time to replace the filter? I live in a single household, so is there an average amount of time to replace? Thanks!</li>
            <li> Makes hair very soft- great for places with hard water!</li>
            <li> No noticeable changes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this water shower purification system for a month and it has made both my hair &amp; skin feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Received shipment in perfect order and in the allocated time predicted.  Product was just as advertised and easy to install.</li>
            <li> I got this because my hair was feeling like straw and altho I only color the grey plus a few strands here and there ---I want the color to last more than one washing --. This product is fantastic. My water must have been awful (live in LA - hard water). I actually get compliments again on the shine and texture of my hair...AND the color lasts 4-5 weeks again. The bonus: I could instantly feel the difference on my skin...much softer...I now also use the shower to fill up the tub AND I capture the water in a container to wash my face at night after taking off makeup. The pipes in my apartment are old so I never trusted the drinking water -- get 3-5 gallon jugs -- but if I capture the shower cold it is delicious :))) and I don&#x27;t have to carry in as many jugs. Best purchase ever!! At first I thought it was too pricey -- but now I think it&#x27;s worth it!!! Especially if you buy it on Amazon -- so much better than retail ($95).</li>
            <li> Water does not smell like chlorine!!!!!!! I think this is the most important benefit for me. Filter has to be replaced every 6 months. Hair color stays longer and skin feels softer. I highly recommend it. WAter  feels and tastes like bottled water.</li>
            <li> I bought this filter about 2 years ago because wear I lived used well water. If you have well water then you know how bad it is for your skin and hair not to mention the residue it leaves in your shower because of the iron in the water. The filter fixed all of that, the only bad thing is the shower head that comes with it fell apart a few months after I bought it but I just replaced it with my own shower head and it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference after the first couple showers, Amazingly my hair does not get tangled up even if I don&#x27;t comb it after my showers</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t notice any difference in water quality. It doesn&#x27;t make water feel slimy like a water softener would. My hair and skin seem to be the same after several weeks of use. Still thinking about a new water softener (old one broke 2 years ago and we didn&#x27;t buy a new one since).</li>
            <li> 19-Nov-2012 - So far this works great. I would certainly recommend it. There is definitely a difference between before and after using this. Though expensive worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;02-April-2013 - My update on this product - The filter is good for less than 4 months only. Have to buy new one.</li>
            <li> I bought this from sephora on a whim several years ago and I was amazed at the difference in my hair. I have really thick curly hair that&#x27;s always a bit unmanageable. After using this my hair has become a lot more manageable and soft. It&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.</li>
            <li> I never thought anything would get rid of the hard water of my shower.  I originally went to Home Depot and got a cheap filter, which did NOT work.  Then I figured I&#x27;d spend a bit more $$ to try this.  Boy, it is worth every penny.  And easy to install too.  I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews....</li>
            <li> fast shipping and works good</li>
            <li> this product really works, i order one every year!&lt;br /&gt;It has really helped to rid my tumbled marble in the shower from&lt;br /&gt;having chronic mineral stains to having none!</li>
            <li> We recently moved to a rental house and the water is really hard with various minerals in the water.  I bought this because my hair would feel dry on the ends and unclean at the roots.  Furthermore, my natural hair shine was totally gone!  My hair is naturally very full and shiny and I hated not having my normal hair!  I tried different shampoos and it did not make a difference.  We can&#x27;t get a water softener for the house because its a rental, so this is a great solution!  I&#x27;m curious to see how long the water filter will last, but so far it is working great!  Easy to install.  I can&#x27;t get it completely sealed as not to drip slightly when the water is on, but its very little water is dripping so I&#x27;m not worried about it.  Also, our water pressure increased with using the filter, which made my husband happy!</li>
            <li> Used it for over week and didn&#x27;t notice anything.. the Culligan unit out their for 1/3 the price is much better!</li>
            <li> Read the reviews first, was skeptical, but was sick of hard water ruining my hair and staining it an orange tint.  I really noticed a difference within days of use, it is easy to install too.  My hair and skin are much softer and the orange tint is no more!</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time and I LOVE it. Normally it takes me a lot of time and product to comb through my hair after a shower. After using the shower filtration system once I was able to use half the product and comb through my hair easily. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and was so pleased, I chose this model to purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install, Works fine. Water smells clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> Product works well. I have very hard water with rust, chlorine tc. And this softner has made a huge difference in my hair. It is softer, the color seems to stay longer and it doesn&#x27;t look as dry.</li>
            <li> I have slightly past shoulder length hair. Something happened over the last year and my hair turned to wheat. It was falling out in clumps in the shower. It was dull, dirty looking. I tried the baking soda routine, I tried clarifying. I went to the salon. The hairdresser told me I had some of the worst hair she had ever seen and the only way to fix it was to cut it off to the roots. I tried dozens of shampoos and conditioners. My daughter went to the salon and said the hairdresser told her the same thing. Her hair was falling out in clumps in the shower too. So I researched more- found some random article on hair that stated it could be the water in my house (I moved a year ago). So I went to Amazon, I am a prime member. I found this, the reviews seemed good so I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it a week, and my hair is about 1,000,000 times better. It is even better than it was before the damage. It cost me about $55 with my membership. I don&#x27;t know about all the skin stuff, I have pretty good skin already, but I can tell you I wish I had just ordered this before trying anything else for my hair. I am thrilled. This may not work for everyone, but it completely restored my hair. And a side benefit, the water pressure increased when using this. I love it. I dont care what the cost of it was, it could have been $250 and I would be thankful I got it. I am getting another for my daughter. It is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps-</li>
            <li> I have tried two shower filters before using this one.  They both claimed to filter heavy metals.  They failed.  This product is the only one that truly does what it says.  Guaranteed to be worth every penny.  I had so much iron in my water that the shower wall has rust stains on it.  As soon as I attached this filter, I could immediately smell and taste that the metals were gone!  My hair feels back to normal and I feel wonderful in my own shower.  Thank you Jonathan!!</li>
            <li> This product, although seeming to be standard size, did not work on my elderly mother&#x27;s shower. It was bulky and was not able to be installed.&lt;br /&gt;THEN…I discovered it is NOT RETURNABLE! I saw nowhere in the description anything about a NO RETURN POLICY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE…be absolutely sure it will work for you, or it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love my shower purification system. The water feels so much better and my hair has been transforming into a much softer and silkier texture. I am so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but there are much cheaper than it. I really enjoyed it and if you are thinking about it just get something I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret it, again, you can find cheaper than that. Good Luck :)</li>
            <li> Never given an &amp;#34;I hate it&amp;#34; review before, but this product is very deserving.  The product developed a leak between the head and the filter element about a month after installation.  I checked the o-ring and put on more veggy oil trying to stop the leak.  No success after numerous tries.  It was too late to send back to Amazon, but not to worry since the product has a 100-day warranty.  Wrong!  I went on line to file the warranty registration and was eventually successful.  Except for a &amp;#34;Congratulations!&amp;#34; message however, there has been no  communication from the company.  I have called their warranty phone number many times, and there is no answer.  Please try it yourself: 1-888-228-4247.  All you get is a message that mailbox 212 779-1700 is not available, please leave a message.  I have done so, many times, but no return phone calls.  I have also sent messages via their Contact Us link, but no response.  I have a few days remaining on my warranty, but there is no one at JP to talk to.  Bottom line: THERE IS NO WARRANTY ON THIS PRODUCT!!  If you get a defective unit, as I did, you&#x27;ve just wasted your money ... and I bought 2 spare filters based on the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Completely changed my hair and skin bavk to normal. I had moved somewhere with well water and it was ruining my hair. Easy to install. Works beautifully. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Really helped with problems I was having with hair and scalp.  In combination with Malibu shampoo - my hair is clean and light and the psoriasis on scalp and hair loss is less.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made of plastic.......</li>
            <li> Ive had months and months of issues trying to get a water softener installed in my home when i bought this. I&#x27;d been washing my hair at work (at a salon) because the hard water made my hair feel HORRIBLE.  I didn&#x27;t have too high of hopes after reading reviews about hard water and how limited the options are.  This shower head has saved me. My hair feels normal and soft. I love it. Not sure how long the filter lasts because i just installed it..but im thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I live in an area with very hard water with many minerals.  This has made it so that my body no longer itches when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you have hard water</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Great customer service</li>
            <li> Good product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two people I change the filter every six months</li>
            <li> OMG. I have Sebboric Dermatitis (spelled wrong)... but I also have hard water. My hair has been falling out for the last 6  months... went to the doc and got some shampoo... etc... not helping. Coworker told me to get a showerhead filter... so I saw this one after reading all reviews with other brands. This one looked awesome.... installed it two days ago and I have NO more frizz whatsoever. I have naturally wavy hair... and I let it dry naturally, no frizz!! I am so sad with my hair getting thinner lately.. its depressing :( I have noticed and my coworkers have noticed... just in two days with the filter. Absolutely life changing haha I hope that this product stays on the market for a very long time. I was going to chop off all of my hair .... so I&#x27;m going to wait now!!!! I love you Jonathan! :):):) whoever you are.</li>
            <li> This item will not install if you presently have a Kohler shower head since the Kohler pipe opening is larger than than the opening on the Jonathan filter which needs to be screwed onto the pipe.  I would have to call a plumber to change the pipe leading from the shower wall, which I am not prepared to do.</li>
            <li> I live in a rural area but still receive city water. Our home is around 100 yrs old, not sure when the plumbing was last done. Installed this badboy, took a shower, and have been transformed into an angel sent from heaven to cure the rest of you non-believers of your dirty, sinful-water ways! Your chlorine smells will be gone! Your dry, tacky feeling skin will be reborn as smooth as an angel baby&#x27;s bottom! BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I felt a softer skin at 1st shower then got a bit better after 2nd shower, felt my hair better after nd shower... but hey.. no matter what, rain what made my skin &amp; hair feel much softer than this filter or any other filter I&#x27;ve tried b4, trust me, I just wish we could have a rainwater harvesting system in our house, that&#x27;s really expensive, hopefully we&#x27;ll get that some day, by now I just collect the rainwater boil it &amp; refresh myself water -once in a while- to remember the real feel of a natural water. I wish I could find some walter that is that good, not yet. but this Jonathan was fine.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this thing is working.  The 3-star rating is really just saying that the shower head gives adequate water pressure and installed easily.  I can&#x27;t tell a difference in the water coming from the system -- seems like the water from before.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel any different and my skin is basically the same.  But, I know sometimes it takes a while to see results, so I am on week 3 and will re-evaluate in a month or so to see if this thing is actually living up to what it promised.</li>
            <li> I noticed that this does not have as much pressure as the regular shower and I end up having to rinse my hair a bit longer. I have well water and switched to this as well as once a week Murad so I can&#x27;t tell which exactly helped me to stop loosing hair. Either way, I bought this because of the reviews on helping with this exact problem, and the combination stopped the hair loss. So Yes, BUY THIS if you are loosing too much hair and have well water. Should also consider the murad bran shampoo/conditioner/scalp treatment and some B vitamins. I am cured!!! :)</li>
            <li> I no longer smell fluoride since it goes through active carbon. But with that high speed water go through. I would highly doubt that the filter function does anything.</li>
            <li> Purchased to improve my scalp condition. Did not seem to have much of an impact.Restricted water flow after three months with two people taking daily showers. If you are looking to for a higher flow shower head for half the price, consider [[ASIN:B0006VVN1S Culligan WSH-C125 Wall-Mount 10,000 Gallon Capacity Filtered Showerhead, Chrome Finish]].</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help with my really hard water and found this product. I have to say my water is so bad I was really hoping this would work since my hair has been to hell with my water. I love this product and I could instantly feel the difference in my hair after the first week. The only bad thing is that the filter did not last more than two months from how bad my water is, but it says to change it every few months anyways I think.</li>
            <li> I was very optimistic that this product would help my hair issues, but I was sorely disappointed. I&#x27;m back to showering at a friend&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li> I have well water and although we do use a water softener, it just doesn&#x27;t get the water good enough to not turn my blonde dyed hair brassy yellow. So I bought this shower filter specifically to help maintain my hair color. It has made a huge difference and is keeping my hair color from turning, and it has also improved my skin, it&#x27;s much softer and helped with the winter dryvflaky skin I get. I will definitely keep using this system!</li>
            <li> It seemed to work for about a week and then hard water started again, and as expensive as they were it&#x27;s cost prohibitive to replace every week.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Nordstrom and used it for 5 months. It is easy to install and is well made. I can&#x27;t say that it did much for my hair. I have well water with a hardness off 41 which is technically not very hard. This filter did not do much if anything, for the calcium and magnesium in the water. My hair is still a dry, tangly mess after a shower. My hairdresser did not believe that it helped my hair as the texture is not what it was prior to having well water, and my hair does not process color as easily as it used to. To be fair, this filter does not claim to help with well water, just chlorine and maybe some heavy metals. I purchased it based on reviews written by people who have well water. Maybe it makes some difference on truly atrocious well water full of iron and sediment but it did not appear to help mine. I still had scale in my shower, spots all ovver my shower curtain, and rough, tangly hair. For the price, I would not purchase again. I wish I had returned it after the first month for a full refund. If you have well water and want to try it, I suggest checking Nordstrom or another retailer with a no questions asked return policy.</li>
            <li> I could literally smell chlorine in my shower before using this.</li>
            <li> We have acidic water that erodes our copper pipes and leaves blue green scum in the sinks and shower, not to mention my blond hair. This filter took care of the shower and hair contamination.  I wish I knew about it 10 years ago!</li>
            <li> Great system that works exactly as described.  The filtration system works and you can notice the difference in the softness of your hair and skin... but that&#x27;s only for the few people that are sensitive/critical with &amp;#34;that sort of stuff.&amp;#34;  My husband doesn&#x27;t seem to notice a difference, but he isn&#x27;t one to pay attention to how soft skin his skin is.  The set up was relatively easy - just detach old shower head and screw the pieces in.  I miss having a detachable shower head, but we have a really small stall so it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal.  I bought this at $50 on an Amazon Lightning Deal, so I am writing this review with the premise of paying that much for this product.  I may be a bit more critical if I payed $100... it should perform miracles at that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product that works as I expected.  I would only recommend it on a steep discount.</li>
            <li> Be bought 2 (home and condo) and my wife loves them (protects water to her hair).  Very simple to install; simply remove existing shower head, screw on Jonathan water show (fits existing std shower pipe threads / washer included - I also used plumbers pipe thread tape to prevent leaks).  The best thing is no noticeable water pressure loss!  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Easy install. Not to bulky. My family was losing lots of hair due to the hard water. I hope this works.</li>
            <li> Overall it helped. It was great product. You can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> my whole family likes this product.  my hair is soft and manageable and my skin feels moisturized.  I highly recommend this product.  My sister already bought one.  it is easy to install.  it fit perfectly with my Kohler shower hardware.  It is a good idea to place a basin under the hower head when you first run the water through it because the water is initially tinted black and then clears quickly.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t had it too long, so i can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s longevity…that said, i can say that it really has improved my skin and hair. moving from NYC to LA, my hair took a beating. i now realize it was the water quality. hair/skin are softer, overall better condition. i feel clean for the first time since moving to LA. it&#x27;s worth a try if you have mysterious skin/hair issues that correlate with a water source change.</li>
            <li> Loved it and helps to keep skin clear</li>
            <li> Great product - does the job.  I have a high iron content in my water - installed this in my shower - no more problems.  It works!</li>
            <li> So far I have determined that my skin is much softer and I do not require near the shampoo I did formerly.  Any benefits to my hair is yet to be determined.</li>
            <li> Spectacular thing, this. Really saved the day. My hair blow-dries silky smooth with not a spec of contaminant in it! : D BIG sigh of relief. Well-water - NO bueno!</li>
            <li> We are on a  well and this filter has made a huge improvement.  The water no longer has a sulpher like smell and the condition of our hair has improved significantly.</li>
            <li> Love it .. My hair fall is getting better with 2 months of using it. Just wish there was a indicator when filter need to be replaced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited several weeks to see how this item performed and I just don&#x27;t see any difference in my water.  My hair does not look or feel any differently like other reviews listed, etc.  I would not purchase another one.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It takes out all the rust and iron in my well water.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the new filter.  Easy to install although I could not attach my own shower head/handheld combination as the somewhat oddly positioned mount of the filter prevented me from screwing in the assembly.  I solved the problem by using another handheld (note that this package comes is its own shower head).  I also think that I could have purchased some adapters in a hardware store which would have allowed me to attached the shower head I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing however are the results;  I LOVE IT.  We live in a hard water area and for years I have been using a High Output filters which removed chlorine but did not help my hair a bit.  After using Jonathan filter for about 10 days I am pleased to report that my hair is no longer super dry, has lots of shine, and does not look crazy on day 2.</li>
            <li> Ths shower Filter is great  havet had any problems since we bought afew months ago! No Calcium Lime or rus and no heavy metals thx medicine</li>
            <li> So far-after using this only twice - I can tell a difference in my hair. I live in Florida and the tap water is terrible. You have to buy distilled water for your steam iron, coffee pot, etc., so they aren&#x27;t ruined by the various chemicals that build up.  This was easy to install, however the shower head they include with it has very little pressure.  I put my old one back on. I like the sleek design of the unit.  I have a small shower so it did extend the water flow out a few inches but a simple adjustment to the shower head fixed that.  I will update in a few weeks.  The only reason I took off a star was due to the shower head- I need one with substantial pressure.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all my clients.  As a hairdresser living in keywester Florida, irate what the water down here does to my hair. This filter stops it from turning brassy. But this if you are a blonde. It&#x27;s also very good in the skin. After my first shower with it, I didn&#x27;t need body lotion.</li>
            <li> great filter for when you don&#x27;t own home but you are still looking to not have hard water the spray it strong and had different levels you can change it to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit bulky because of the filter.  However, I opted to keep my own shower head.  My shower head connected right up to this with no issues.  First run through got rid of the accumulated carbon, as expected.  But I definitely no longer smell the overwhelming chlorine smell I had before.  It&#x27;s doing great.  I am also hoping it filters out the iron too, because I was getting pink rings in my tub from it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.  My hair wasn&#x27;t softer and the glass shower wasn&#x27;t any easier to clean.  I don&#x27;t think it works.</li>
            <li> This thing is the bomb for anyone with well water and especially if you&#x27;re spending money at the salon for color.  I have fine, thin, blonde hair and it&#x27;s been a hairsaver.  I use the Ion shampoo/conditioner with this filter and my hair hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this good in the years since we moved to well water.  It also has plenty of power, doesn&#x27;t seem to slow down the flow at all.  My skin is loving it too, don&#x27;t even need to lotion afterward! Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> I have bought many of these filters and love them  It leaves my hair so soft and even the shower stays clean.  No residue from hard water</li>
            <li> Great product! Bought this because of living in am apartment with very hard water. Was able to tell the difference immediately.</li>
            <li> Filter was not very effective, hair and skin still had residue on it.</li>
            <li> Recently moved into a home with very hard water! I&#x27;m so happy this filter works! My hair feels so much better now! Great product!</li>
