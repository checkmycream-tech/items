            <li>Grandelash MD works great</li>

            <li>Now she&#x27;s also on an every-other-week regimen, which is great because it stretches the product.</li>

            <li>Even used it to fill in my brows and it works great there too.  </li>
            <li>Great product, but made my eyes itch.</li>
            <li>The price has gone up, the name keeps changing but the product is great.  </li>

            <li>But it worked great for about 4 months.</li>
            <li>It did a great job on my eyebrows, and my lashes as well.</li>

            <li>I never leave reviews for products, however, this product does as described and the results I have experienced have been absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Loved it!!&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good for those of us over 50 with thinning brows.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>I have done latisse and loved it, however I did not like how my eyelids turned purple/reddish color.</li>
            <li>Lilash worked well for a good year.</li>
            <li>But let&#x27;s be fair.</li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s a good product and works.</li>
            <li>I used Lilash before while it was still legally available in the US and that stuff was awesome.</li>
            <li>I also pair it with the mascara, which is also good stuff.</li>
            <li>and my lashes are still looking good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now on week 8 of using GrandeLash MD, and my lashes have all evened out and filled in so beautifully!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s avery good product.</li>
            <li>Good for eyebrows too.</li>
            <li>My lashes have never looked this good.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because the reviews were good.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are twice their length now and look as good as when I had the extensions.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve followed the instructions fairly closely</li>
            <li>This may be a good thing if you&#x27;ve had irritation or side effects with the product to have a gentler alternative like Grandelash MD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this works fairly well</li>
            <li>It took a good 8 weeks to see results (applying just once a day), my lashes are now fuller and longer.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at my salon, and honestly, this is a great price on Amazon too.</li>
            <li>Bought Rapid Lash and thought that worked really good</li>
            <li>For a non-prescription product, it works fairly well.</li>
            <li>but it took me a good 2/2.5 months to see a difference and by 3 months</li>
            <li>I had my doubts, but when my daughter recommended it, I knew it had to be good.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cheaper option to Latisse, which I&#x27;ve used before and loved (was just looking for a cheaper option.)  </li>
            <li>But I never stopped using this product, my lashes looked too good to stop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sooo delighted with this product.</li>
            <li>Her eyelashes are gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I thought I ruined my lashes for good.</li>
            <li>surprisingly one star because my lashes became longer and thicker, somehow.</li>
            <li>I was going to wait after 10 weeks to be fair since that is what is claimed on the website.</li>
            <li>I saw good ratings and I bought it.</li>
            <li>and I could notice results that I loved at Christmas.</li>
            <li>She wasnt as good about applying it each morning and night</li>
            <li>I am so excited for when they catch up because they are already beautiful!</li>
            <li>Even if I pull on them, they are really strong now too!!</li>
            <li>love love love this product!!!</li>

            <li>I had read so many great reviews on this product</li>
            <li>Still I am very pleased with the result.</li>

            <li>own opinion: I WILL NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li>For those who think this is not a helpful review, good luck growing your eyelashes. :)</li>
            <li>#34;it&#x27;s not the real deal&amp;#34; but I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>it was my own fault.</li>
            <li>Aging isn&#x27;t nice at</li>
            <li>I think that Grandelash MD will eventually work, but it will take longer or may not be as effective as Latisse.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to have a product that lives up to its advertisement and does the job.</li>
            <li>I can honestly see a difference in my lashes and eyebrows since I started using them.  </li>
            <li>my eyelashes are longer but it would&#x27;ve been nice if I could&#x27;ve tried it for a longer period time.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t impressed because it was to much maintenance</li>
            <li>By the time I used the whole tube I saw great results!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this and will use it until the day I croak.</li>
            <li>He can be brutally honest, so I trusted his opinion.  </li>
            <li>When the lashes began to fall out I noticed a lot of my own lashes were coming out as well.  </li>
            <li>I am using it on my brows, &amp; they are filling in nicely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that this stuff is getting popular</li>
            <li>So that was kind of a dissapointment.</li>
            <li>Kind of defeats the purpose</li>
            <li>I use it once a day before bed and keep eye drops handy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>Decided this product was not for me after ordering spontaneously.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this from my salon for $75, so this is a great price.</li>
            <li>Best for me...tried others  but found GrandeLash MD  has worked well for my particular complexion and needs.  </li>
            <li>My husband commented that seeing my beautiful eyes, looking sooo pretty without the &amp;#34;spider legs&amp;#34; as he called the extensions!</li>
            <li>It is a high end salon and they do wonderful work.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product since my daughter has had wonderful results with it.</li>
            <li>when it comes to your eyelashes is best to think of them as normal hair..</li>
            <li>I first used this product through Nordstrom&#x27;s then through Drugstore.com at an incredible price, couldn&#x27;t find it this time there</li>
            <li>Once she started using this her lashes are amazing and super sexy!!</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to tons of people and I&#x27;m super happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Yes your eyelashes will grown and become very strong.</li>
            <li>….Grandlash is very easy to use ……….</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply with the brush.</li>
            <li>but it is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to so many people and they all love it!  </li>
            <li>Great product -- really works!!  </li>
            <li>Very&#x27; good product, I used Latisse for years and this product is very close to Latisse&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have been told from complete strangers that my eyelashes are beautiful!  </li>
            <li>i was kinda overapplying the product because more effective result.</li>
            <li>was happy for the most part with results, would enjoy a bit more color or darkness</li>
            <li>Love the eyeliner applicator and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>My cousin recommended Grand lash and honestly the best product I have gotten so far .</li>
            <li>This is still going strong!  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love my lashes!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>I had a good start, and I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several months but was thrilled to discover it at a great cost savings on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;History: I had eyelash extensions for about a year and really liked them - not having to wear mascara and looking good right out of bed in the morning, but did not like the hassle and expense of maintaining them.  </li>
            <li>This serum is a great alternative to eyelash extensions, and they are real!</li>
            <li>Worked great on first tube, then ran out.</li>
            <li>The first order of this worked great.</li>
            <li>and I can say that I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>Although when I first began to use this product, I experienced some redness in my eyes, it went away and hasn&#x27;t bothered me since.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty great.</li>
            <li>me felt pretty, the magic tube made this one a happy girl.</li>
            <li>, the look of the package is nice, the appliction is easy, no irritation.  </li>
            <li>HUGE amount of growth after about 3 weeks!</li>
            <li>I was hoping that based on price I would have a better result.</li>
            <li>My friend had better luck.  </li>
            <li>I got better results with this product.</li>
            <li>The longer lashes make my eyes look more awake.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.  </li>
            <li>This works to grow eyelashes, to be sure.  </li>
            <li>This product is great works really well......</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>The difference is I don&#x27;t have the brown color on my eyelids that Latisse leaves for most people.</li>
            <li>She was blown away by the length of the top AND bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>Within two weeks of using Grand lash</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing again for sure.</li>
            <li>Results from LiLash worked so much better, but for the price, I may order another tube of GrandeLash.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t great...just ok.</li>
            <li>I love GrandeLASH MD.</li>
            <li>(Still love Benefit&#x27;s Roller Curl mascara though</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>More length than volume but the volume is Better than before.</li>
            <li>and I swear the grandlash works better.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works if you follow the instructions, and the price is great.</li>
            <li>However, I am not seeing much more volume or darkness with them.  </li>
            <li>It defines and adds a bit more length to the lashes without a lot of clumping and does not flake.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love a compliment....</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, they are much better now.  </li>
            <li>just spend more money on mascaras instead.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will look for a better product.  </li>
            <li>Need more time to see results</li>
            <li>Try this, you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I read the instructions and (as per the information) it did take a bit more time until I saw results</li>
            <li>Many reviews did not mention side effects.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>: I notice that every time I wash my face MORE lashes were falling out.</li>
            <li>and I have ordered more.  </li>
            <li>This is great, and really works.</li>
            <li>Glad I risked it and now I&#x27;m enjoying prettier eyes.</li>
            <li>most people said it started working in two weeks or so.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I have lashes better than when I was a youngster.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve reordered this many times.  </li>
            <li>-received it after more than a week of purchase&lt;</li>
            <li>I Love It</li>
            <li>I have only used the product for 3 weeks and my lashes are looking amazing !!!</li>
            <li>Month two brought more eyelashes, thicker eyelashes, longer eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Should I give it more time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You just need to give it more time.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t anything that can&#x27;t be handled and I am very happy overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love GrandeLASH; I have found that it has thickened my eye lashes as well as some lengthening.  </li>
            <li>Always satisfied with my Amazon purchases</li>
            <li>Neulash was Much better.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This alongside fiber lash mascara &#x3D; better than extensions and falsies.</li>
            <li>I Love this product.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Grande Lash leads as  an award winning lash builder.  </li>
            <li>It works, it&#x27;s been a month, but I can see my lashes getting longer and darker, I would recommend this product, in fact , I bought one more.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and it was about $20.00 more.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll buy a couple more as a gift for one of my relatives and for me before I run out of this one.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are much more thicker now, I was able to recreate the shape of them in a way and they are also much more darker.</li>
            <li>Beware this did make my lashes a lil better</li>
            <li>My lashes are not yet the desired length, but at this rate I am confident it will get there...and soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I had also taken up the habit of pulling at my eyelashes while I did schoolwork which caused more to fall out.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so pleased with this product that I also plan on trying out their eyeliner also.</li>
            <li>This product is supposed to also &amp;#34;thicken&amp;#34; your lashes, Im not so sure about my lashes being any thicker</li>
            <li>makes my lashes grow with more volume</li>
            <li>Lashes longer, thicker and more healthy.  </li>
            <li>Well, My tube ran out, and I didn&#x27;t order more so</li>
            <li>I saw a difference within a week or two but more towards my outer edge lashes.</li>
            <li>Some notable difference</li>
            <li>I have found if you hang in there 3 or 4 months you will not be able to question the results.</li>
            <li>It has given me a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>I bought the mascara also and love it.  </li>
            <li>It did seem to work a bit better for my brows.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>The best last growth product I have used!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I seem to lose more eyelashes, more</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply close to the lash line.</li>
            <li>So, with that being said, I love this product.</li>
            <li>Professionals have told me that this is the best lash product and is the only one that can be worn with lash extensions.  </li>
            <li>If you stop using it for more than a 2 week period your lashes will start to fall out.  </li>
            <li>the better</li>
            <li>this helps :)</li>
            <li>I use Laura Mercier, MAC, etc.... mainstream products that most of us can use -</li>
            <li>I am a nurse in a dermatology practice and I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how many compliments I get on my lashes from patients.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love GrandeLASH MD</li>
            <li>so... it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I would buy more at this price.</li>
            <li>I love the enhancer</li>
            <li>AND I love the complimenting mascara.</li>
            <li>Rest assured, it&#x27;s totally safe and harmless.</li>
            <li>think many testimonials and before/</li>
            <li>In any case, advice for using Grandelash MD, be patient :)</li>
            <li>In any case, advice for using Grandelash MD, be patient :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to continue using it and watch them grow even more.</li>
            <li>Herd it worked, love it, doesent grow bald parts of eyebrows but deffinately grew, darkened,</li>
            <li>I am assuming that additional time will make a more noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Takes about 4 weeks to see the change, but then it just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>I am glad I ordered the correct GrandLash this time.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I never dreamed that I could have eyebrows and eyelashes that I would be able to see someday without lots of pencil and mascara...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy the product from Amazon, but a spa and paid about $10 more.  </li>
            <li>had I taken better care of them by taking off my mascara before bed.</li>
            <li>and of course my mother has too, but no surprise there! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months, and my lashes look much better and longer.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Love the results.  </li>
            <li>I could not wear make-up after the surgery and after some time passed, my husband asked me not to bother with make-up any more.  </li>
            <li>After two months of use, my lashes were so cute.</li>
            <li>I personally love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My sister used it and it was fantastic!  </li>
            <li>This really works great.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my grand las on may 9, and it&#x27;s not working.</li>
            <li>I was able to see results within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Oh and one more thing</li>
            <li>I purchased this from my reputable salon where I get my eyelash extensions done.</li>
            <li>I love my lash extensions and wanted to do everything to keep my lashes healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I even tried to tap out more liquid, but nothing.</li>
            <li>It is cute design package, and I am now using.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t wear makeup every day any more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE AFTER ONE MONTH:  I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I never got SO many compliments on my eyes and my lashes as when I was using that product.</li>
            <li>So after using many different lash growth products on the market I can confidently say GrandeLash MD is the best (in my opinion).</li>
            <li>I discussed this product with him and he felt this would be okay.  </li>
            <li>and I love this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Patti</li>
            <li>Now my lashes are more than twice the length they have ever been.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed that it actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li>Not even done with it yet :-)</li>
            <li>Also, when I put my mascara on, it works MUCH better than before</li>
            <li>I got 2 more</li>
            <li>Works better for them anyway</li>
            <li>I read many reviews on this that it works</li>
            <li>My thinning lashes are now fuller and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is a staple for me now.</li>
            <li>Love it and will order again... :-)</li>
            <li>So glad I found this.</li>
            <li>Takes time for results but love the results.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE</li>
            <li>People ask me if I&#x27;m okay because the skin around my eyes turned reddish/dark.</li>
            <li>Ive used about 4 different eye lash serums and Li Lash and this one worked the best.</li>
            <li>my eyelashes were almost touching my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Works better than Latisse.</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find it on the Internet.  </li>
            <li>Great, fast service.</li>
            <li>Both of my daughters love the product and you cannot believe the comments they both get.</li>
            <li>Great price, much cheaper than buying it at a Salon where it runs about $75.00 instead of the prices here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love grande lash</li>
            <li>I ordered Grandelash last week of January and after 4 days i received it. :D</li>
            <li>I applied it to my top and bottom</li>
            <li>cause it holds the curl better.</li>
            <li>I noticed more lashes and an increase in length after just one week.</li>
            <li>Within 3 or 4 weeks they were noticeably longer and more pronounced.  </li>
            <li>And see for yourself. : )</li>
            <li>but I was expecting to see  more of a difference.</li>
            <li>I went to Ultra to buy some powder and concealer when one of the make up artist&#x27;s asked if it was ok to put the product on.  </li>
            <li>unfortunately is more pronounced at the bottom.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product;simply because it works.</li>
            <li>I made sure I took an antihistamine,I stopped rubbing my eyes,and I used a skin lightener under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this product couple times by now, and I absolutely love how my lashes grow when I use it.</li>
            <li>I am sure that Latisse would work better and faster</li>
            <li>Love the stuff.  </li>
            <li>I shall keep on using this with the hopes it will be better.</li>
            <li>Do to all the itching, I&#x27;m sure my eyelashes are falling out even more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The mascara is ok but this product is what has made my lashes longer.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Works magic when partnered with the Grande Mascara, which I&#x27;ve been purchasing with it as a set.  </li>
            <li>love grandelash</li>
            <li>Love this product and will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li>If I am going with light makeup or a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look, I don&#x27;t bother to fill them in because I don&#x27;t need to!  </li>
            <li>and I ordered some more.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes seem darker and fuller and I&#x27;m told that they&#x27;ll improve even more the longer</li>
            <li>fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product twice before and it works much better than Latisse for me.  </li>
            <li>I sure would like to be able to use it.</li>
            <li>and my lashes are longer for sure.  </li>
            <li>I have never been more satisfied .</li>
            <li>i went on line and bought 3 more for my cousin, my daughter and sister.</li>
            <li>but i wasn&#x27;t deterred and was sure i would see results soon.</li>
            <li>why would this &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; product bought at a salon work so much better than the 4 i bought on line??</li>
            <li>This product worked better that Latisse for me.  </li>
            <li>I use it every night before bed religiously with superb results.</li>
            <li>GrandeLASH MD is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff....</li>
            <li>I have been using Grand Lash for 2 years now</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it and it works.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes grew in better and they were longer.  </li>
            <li>my top lashes look like falsies with mascara.  </li>
            <li>have tried others but this is better (for me)</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Great product, it has really helped my eyelashes grow.  </li>
            <li>I love having a problem with my lashes touching the lenses of my sunglasses.</li>
            <li>Am so glad I tried this before I purchased the prescription product for twice the money.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Definitivament longer eyelashes and eyebrows more defined.</li>
            <li>but that may require more than a months time.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>Mostly for length of lashes, but also increased density of eyebrows..</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>it mentioned in the package insert that those of us who are a bit more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; night get better results that way.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>Ive used rapid lash and feel this has given me better results.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It works better than I remember Lilash working.  </li>
            <li>The longer lashes make it worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>using it most days at night (after make up is removed)for 2 months now</li>
            <li>I experienced very mild irritation in my eyes on maybe two occasions during the first week and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>Thanks beautiful product N easy to apply</li>
            <li>My friend uses once every day or every other day and is still happy and looking great after 10+ months using this product.</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!!!  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m 50, my lashes are medium brown, blondish tips, and look great with mascara, but I wanted them to look decent without mascara and also wanted to restore the number of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with it and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>A great value; highly recommend.</li>
            <li>so happy that my $35 is not a waste!!</li>
            <li>I normally would not use a product with these ingredients as well; however, I&#x27;m so happy with the results, I disregarded the health concerns.  </li>
            <li>And at first I loved it.</li>
            <li>Went from nubs to long and beautiful lashes!</li>
            <li>I had noticed my best friends lashes were really long one day, seeming overnight.</li>
            <li>They are long and beautiful!</li>
            <li>I bought my first GrandeLASH from a high end salon and it worked wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>I am so excited!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using it for 3 plus month and the result is fantastic on the eyelashes and eyebrows, better than latisse for sure</li>
            <li>Castor oil is also a good, natural option but won&#x27;t grow lashes quick enough...for those who want faster results this serum is good.</li>
            <li>I loved Smart Lash</li>
            <li>Light pinky mostly after applying product.</li>
            <li>sure your eyes are makeup free before applying.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell it works great</li>
            <li>I did not purchase the grand lash mascara- just using whatever I have always used with fantastic</li>
            <li>However they suggested using grande lash to keep my lashes from becoming brittle and damaged.</li>
            <li>they look fabulous, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was worried that my lashes were going to look &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34; but everything has been great and natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could get a referral fee or even a free tube for referring so many friends here to buy it.  </li>
            <li>(I guess because they were becoming longer) and</li>
            <li>my friend had INCREDIBLE lashes all of a sudden &amp;</li>
            <li>This works fantastic and i have used Revitalash before for a lot more money.  </li>
            <li>was using the serum night and morning and was really seeing good results, but when I re-ordered the serum I decided to use the mascara and liner as well.</li>
            <li>Good product , fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Had bought this at a Salon for 75.00 and loved it, it really works if you don&#x27;t have a reaction from it.</li>
            <li>I have used this for 2 months now and I can really see the difference longer fuller lashes, I will continue using product for maintenance good bye latissa.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good quality</li>
            <li>This product works very well and really creates longer more beautiful lashes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!  </li>
            <li>After 3 agonizing days, I went to the eye doctor, who said this stuff is full of acids!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and I noticed results within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>and I received the product very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>so it was easy to apply along my eyelash line.</li>
            <li>Excellent, I&#x27;m fully satisfied, just few weeks I&#x27;ve been using this product, I can see the difference.</li>
            <li>Grandlash MD is so easy to use</li>
            <li>Does cause some skin irritation at application site that is easily covered with make up and does improve with time.</li>
            <li>I wear it at night because it caused very mild irritation.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Make sure that your lashes are clean.  </li>
            <li>I take off my makeup with coconut oil, wash my face, and then use a Q-tip to make sure my lashline is clean before applying Grandelash.  </li>
            <li>now I can easily apply each application under 3 seconds per eye with one swoop.</li>
            <li>easy to use and worked within a week</li>
            <li>I had noticeable results very quickly.</li>
            <li>I saved alittle money from not buying in my salon but this seemed not to be quite as strong.</li>
            <li>This product is effective, in one week I could tell that my eyelashes were growing, after a month they look great, but I have notice that I don&#x27;t have more, maybe a little thicker.</li>
            <li>I could be a poster child for Grande Lash MD, it is an amazing product that REALLY works!</li>
            <li>almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a great experience with the original product and will purchase directly through them.</li>
            <li>but no complaint here BC longer is good for me</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get a good nights sleep and see if I wake up looking &#x27;normal&#x27;</li>
            <li>They are so healthy and full and with a curler and mascara</li>
            <li>They are now softer, longer and more full.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best eyelash conditioner I have used.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product because hands down it is the best product for lash growth.</li>
            <li>So I thought, huh, must be fine.  </li>
            <li>i would test on skin first but for me it works great no irritation and in 3 weeks my lashes are much longer.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Grande lash seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>I was using Latisse for over two years and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be fine</li>
            <li>but I do feel more feminine with a bit more lash;)  </li>
            <li>I received the product just fine.</li>
            <li>and have used this for them as well, and they are already thickening quickly!</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are much longer and fuller, they are also more curved now and darker!</li>
            <li>Thanks for my lovely lashes!  </li>
            <li>but I refused to let it mess with my best feature, my eyes!  </li>
            <li>My lashes are now super long n super sexy!!!!</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference in the length and thickness of my lashes.</li>
            <li>, I used it every night and sometimes in the morning for about two months and noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>&amp; I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference  around month 2 to 3.  </li>
            <li>Noticed huge difference in length after 12 weeks.</li>
            <li>did go to the Grandelash website and they show a tube with the wording that she says is the genuine stuff</li>
            <li>I ordered this after using another well know lash serum because it has such great reviews.</li>
            <li>Symptoms include burning, pain, light sensitivity, redness and $210 in doctor visits, prescriptions, and time off work.</li>
            <li>BOTH extremely cheap.</li>
            <li>SO now depends On what ur comfortable spending.  </li>
            <li>Takes about 3 weeks and you will see fantastic results.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to purchase this product at a spa &amp; esthetics trade show in May.  </li>
            <li>I applied a light coat to my lashes.</li>
            <li>I now only apply once in the evening - great product.</li>
            <li>Great product just have to be patient - I&#x27;ve noticed a change after the fourth week.  </li>
            <li>They only time I experienced and discomfort from this product</li>
            <li>The color of my brows did not change, but they filled in quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I still darken them a bit with brow liner because they are so light, but I am no longer drawing on my face.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a lot of extra volume, but the length is great.</li>
            <li>opted for using a more natural method, now I just put some vaseline in my eyelashes and eyebrows before going to bed, and avoided plucking them for a while - and they look much much better :)</li>
            <li>Once it starts working it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>I did research on grande lash and some reviews were fabulous and others not.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I used this product last year and had great results.</li>
            <li>This one was recommended, and although it did take a few weeks to see results, I am very happy with the length and fullness of my lashes, and with no reaction!</li>
            <li>+ FREE Bonuses]]</li>
            <li>But I like that it glides on smoothly and is at night.</li>
            <li>I had spots on my lash line where the lashes were sparser on one eye that are now all filled in.</li>
            <li>love those remarks--puts a smile on my face</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several months now and it works great.</li>
            <li>If my lashes weren&#x27;t so light colored</li>
            <li>Compared to Latisse it is dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>and then Revitalash and Lilash - all of which worked, all of which are no longer available.  </li>
            <li>this is important as I use alot of organic and plant based ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have turned my mother, sister, and friends onto this product and they all have seen fantastic results as well!!!ate your eyes.</li>
            <li>Eyelashes are longer and brows are filled in where sparse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been ordering this product from a local distributor and it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth paying $10 more.</li>
            <li>So, I went ahead and used it on my upper and lower lashes and had great results there as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to buy a product that actually does what it says its going to do.  </li>
            <li>I question if the product that I received was the genuine product.  </li>
            <li>I was just happy to have lashes back.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>But the complete process took a good 4 months.</li>
            <li>my lashes did grow long and beautiful</li>
            <li>GrandeLash by far is superior.</li>
            <li>So far so good even though I won&#x27;t see results yet</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>I started using Grandelash and am so impressed by how much longer my lashes are in just only a month.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Now long and beautiful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if I should&#x27;ve bought this product directly from their own website, as it states on the Grandelashmd.com website, that not all products sold online are authentic, and that there are counterfeit retailers selling this on Amazon, eBay and Groupon.  </li>
            <li>My right eyelashes started to curl up more</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>It really works!!!  </li>
            <li>It works exactly like Latisse, but it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost of Latisse!!  </li>
            <li>Really works!!!</li>
            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>I tried it the first tube worked!!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT !!!!</li>
            <li>Stuff really works!!!</li>
            <li>Trust me, it really works!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>this would be the second time i purchase this product very effective</li>
            <li>I do not wear make-up, so the application is easy and quick.  </li>
            <li>Amazon makes ordering easy, and ships quickly.</li>
            <li>With this product eyelashes grow super long and beautiful</li>
            <li>and I already have significantly longer lashes.</li>
            <li>It has enhanced my eyelashes and brows significantly.  </li>
            <li>Was worth the money!</li>
            <li>BUT in 3 weeks my lashes grew significantly.</li>
            <li>I just ordered another bottle even though I am not out of the original and another for my friend for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Significantly thickened and lengthen my lashes.</li>
            <li>I have used it on both eyes first, and found out I am losing way to many eyelashes on my eyes.</li>
            <li>But still saw a hugely significant difference.</li>
            <li>For the first month I applied A LOT every night, to the top lash and bottom.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure that will work for maintenance.  </li>
            <li>When I first got the curler my eyelashes rested just below the top of the curler.  </li>
            <li>Excited my expectations.</li>
            <li>First month I used it just at night but for most days now I use it in the am as well.</li>
            <li>It looks like there is a significant increase in blood supply to the area that accounts for the pinkish hue.  </li>
            <li>Also, I am an Esthetician/Makeup Artist and I recommend this product to all of my clients who are trying to achieve significant lash growth results without a prescription product.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Incredible stuff, and so much more cost effective and gratifying than the fake ones.</li>
            <li>Give it a couple of weeks to show any significant growth, and try using it morning and evening for maximum effect.  </li>
            <li>:) really works!..</li>
            <li>i originally bought this product from a salon per a friends recommendation.</li>
            <li>It did take about 3 months for the maximum effect, but it was so worth it!  </li>
            <li>This works so well and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>My tube is the GrandeLASH MD original.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Lilash which worked great, but Grandelash works even better and is a little cheaper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I had been more diligent and used it twice daily for a full month I would have seen better results.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with my eyelashes now, and how long they are!</li>
            <li>thought I&#x27;d try this for a change but STEER clear,  now if you want blood red eyes for a Halloween costume, then this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>and sometimes I don&#x27;t thoroughly clean them off before applying it.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth the buy, and the price is awesome when compared to other products on the market right now.</li>
            <li>Completely recommended this magic tube!</li>
            <li>My husband asked me if I was wearing fake lashes-in a good way;) -they look so good!!!</li>
            <li>This clear liquid that I apply every night is simply magic!</li>
            <li>My friend used it and her lashes look gorgeous- long and full!</li>
            <li>But most do not have a timeframe for results and therefore aren&#x27;t very realistic in the expectations of what Grandelash MD will provide.</li>
            <li>I will most certainly be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li>nothing special...</li>
            <li>I love it and can certainly see the difference when I use it.</li>
            <li>and they checked amazon and bought it right away!</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and expected great results.</li>
            <li>and my eyelids are bright red and tender!  </li>
            <li>I stopped using it after 5 months and my own lashes still look healthy and long.</li>
            <li>my lashes look wonderful, they are so long and lush.</li>
            <li>I have pretty good lashes for some one 60 years old..</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; on Amazon?</li>
            <li>I went and Bought 6 more FOR MUCH MUCH cheaper</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually true though.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, GrandeLASH works much quicker and my end results seem to be much better than while using Latisse.  </li>
            <li>but my top and bottom lashes have grown so much.. also using for my brows..</li>
            <li>The brows got so full</li>
            <li>they would except my return and issue a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay so I&#x27;ll start off by saying this really does make your eyelashes longer.</li>
            <li>Much better than a prescription that I paid 2x as much for.</li>
            <li>My lashes are much longer then I ever had and I have more lashes than I ever had.</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments on my lashes, even a couple people who asked if they were real.  </li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of this type of product and none of them worked.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Grande Lash and within weeks I had full lashes again.  </li>
            <li>and now they are full.  </li>
            <li>The instruction states that the full results shows if you continue using it for a month.</li>
            <li>My natural lashes are nice, but there is a reason I went for the lash extensions.</li>
            <li>Also, the product took almost the full time to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>Many thanks.</li>
            <li>My lashes look full and lustrous since I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li>If you want to condition you lashes use castor oil, sweet almond oil, or olive oil.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it took 2 months of nightly use, but it really works.</li>
            <li>cannot say enough good things about this product</li>
            <li>but my bottom grew also - so much so that my bottom look like they should be my top lashes and</li>
            <li>and my eyebrows are full</li>
            <li>I am excited about and very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>I used GrandeLASHfor about 4 weeks when I could honestly say I saw a major difference!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I only saw some improvement after the first month or so, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was just imagining things.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 3 months now and I am in love with my new eyelashes and eyebrows!</li>
            <li>First night was fine.</li>
            <li>It happened so quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product does what it says it will and quickly.  </li>
            <li>Shipping came quickly also..</li>
            <li>Made a tremendous difference.  </li>
            <li>Came quick and I can&#x27;t comment on the product I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now</li>
            <li>Great price, fast shipping, would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>But that cleared up quickly</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my eyes in any way and it soaks in quickly</li>
            <li>Grew quickly.</li>
            <li>My lashes were adequate before, but</li>
            <li>I am lucky to get it applied every night.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work quickly too.</li>
            <li>but it goes away relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>She bought me my first tube and within 1 month, I could see a huge difference in the length and thickness of my lashes.  </li>
            <li>This has proven to be much more effective that Latisse or any other product I have</li>
            <li>Worked great at first, lashes really got noticeably longer, but then after using for a year or more they went back to normal and the stuff really has no effect any more</li>
            <li>But having said that, this is a terrific, cost-conscious alternative that works nearly as well, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and has given me some gorgeous lashes!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need much in the way of eye makeup for day wear, and in the evening they are flat out glam when worn with a great cateye liner.  </li>
            <li>I tried extensions at a salon last year and honestly, this is a better look, much cheaper</li>
            <li>I LOVED how long my eyelashes got.</li>
            <li>I was a long time user of Lilash which I loved but at $150 a pop</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to make my lashes much fuller, but the length has definitely increased and with the right mascara, my lashes look great.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t follow it on a daily basis due to very mild irritation..but very nice results!</li>
            <li>Well, it took a good 2 months, but now my brows are MUCH darker and the thin spots are somewhat filled in!!!  </li>
            <li>This product is better than more expensive enhancers that I have tried and is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sure that this itchy reaction will happen to many other customers who might be interested in buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I LOVE grande lash and have used it for months, but just purchased a new bottle from CH Cycles</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like the existing ones have grown and been curled, so I&#x27;m going to see if it seems like any new ones are joining the party.</li>
            <li>I have experienced slight burning</li>
            <li>Was happy to find it on Amazon for less money.</li>
            <li>amazing,actually works, i basically never had lashes,well almost none,-the joy of being a caucasion,this works after 4 weeks, after using now for less than 3 months</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I have eyelashes that actually look good.  </li>
            <li>They are almost now the length they were before I lost them so long story short.. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now on my 2nd tube because I loved it so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking the first week of use!</li>
            <li>This REALLY works!!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend !!!</li>
            <li>I have noticeable eyelashes for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for exactly 3 weeks and now see the results!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!  </li>
            <li>Test use first!</li>
            <li>I really had to stop using it as often because my eyelashes were hitting my sunglasses!!  </li>
            <li>It does exactly as advertised!  </li>
            <li>this is the real one!!</li>
            <li>It arrived fast!!</li>
            <li>The difference was significant but she told me you had to consistent using it</li>
            <li>I say that I will be back for more?!</li>
            <li>, I took a before pic and a 4 week pic, and my lashes are not only longer, but have come in fuller and more volumous as well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just purchased my second tube, and I&#x27;ve been really, really pleased!</li>
            <li>Ive bought this product before directly from the distriutor at a trade show in new york and loved the product.</li>
            <li>Luckily Amazon was kind enough to let me return even though I opened it.</li>
            <li>I saw a major difference very quickly!</li>
            <li>i have used a couple of others lash enhancer products, (one good, the other not so good) but was taken by the positive feedback and low</li>
            <li>I could NOT believe how amazing my eyelashes were after only 30 days.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use the enhancer everyday until the lashes are the length I&#x27;m happy with.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how longer, darker lashes can make one look younger.  </li>
            <li>Within three to five days I could really tell a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Amazing results... would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Wishing you much success.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Worth the price</li>
            <li>and I rarely use it.  </li>
            <li>I love that it does what it says it does, but my eyes do get watery and sensitive.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>apply it mostly at night and frequently in the morning.</li>
            <li>My lashes are longer, curling on their own, and it seems like they are finally starting to darken.</li>
            <li>But it was well worth it</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>After doing some research on eyelash conditioners and growth serums, I finally came across Grandelash as a cheaper and well-rated alternative to Latisse, and a safer and more financially secure alternative of purchasing careprost with an online check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I so happened to have an allergy with this product which happens sometimes , the seller could have just answer me in a professional way for me to be satisfied with my concern .</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what makes this product worth the price...</li>
            <li>I am NOT really great about remembering to use it like I should, and it still has been GREAT !!!  </li>
            <li>I only use this once a week and am loving the results. 😀</li>
            <li>I am not THAT sensitive, so I can&#x27;t understand why there are not a LOT more reviews saying that this product is causing a lot of burning, redness and irritation.  </li>
            <li>it worked even better on my 21 year old daughter, and faster results.</li>
            <li>I started with the serum only for a month and liked the results, so I added the makeup as well to see what would happen.  </li>
            <li>Takes about a month to see results but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I rarely wear mascara anymore.</li>
            <li>This is so worth the money.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just a fun thing to do a couple of times a year</li>
            <li>It takes a couple of months but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Second night I woke up to burning stinging eyes and my eyelash extensions where falling out in clumps along with my own eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Not only did my extensions fall out but my own lashes fell out as well.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>My eyelids were slightly red and sensitive at the beginning, but once I got over that it has been great.</li>
            <li>Although it does still cause some redness to the skin around my eyes, I feel that it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>I think this product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but it is worth a try</li>
            <li>I actually have to wax my brows to tidy things up -</li>
            <li>It is worth the money - got plenty of compliments on eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I tried it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>well worth it.</li>
            <li>I think, though, when the bottle gets low, the product is not as effective, so I&#x27;m replacing.</li>
            <li>I decided to stop use as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Lost most of my natural lashes from years of extensions.  </li>
            <li>Takes about 6-8 weeks to see results but definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It took about 3 months to see a difference, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It actually thickened my lashed more and got a fantastic length</li>
            <li>Best of all, when I do use a curler and mascara, people have asked if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff - my friends thought I was wearing false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I have used Latisse since 2012 and have found this product more effective in less time!</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loved it very much, and she used it every single day.  </li>
            <li>(By the way, she has tried several other products, and she likes this one best.)</li>
            <li>One of the few products I&#x27;ve ever written a review on but felt like i needed to because I LOVE this!!</li>
            <li>Now I use it every few nights and I love my lashes!!</li>
            <li>You will see results after a few weeks of use... love this product!!</li>
            <li>wats more important is if my lashes grown,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on my first or two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to do an update on the growth of my eyelashes in the next couple of weeks</li>
            <li>I had been using Librow and LOVED it, but tried switching to this due to my salon&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li>you can use it every OTHER day and still keep your good results, but, DON&#x27;T RUN OUT OF IT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My lashes are so long I&#x27;m going to have to trim them because they are touching my eyeglasses!</li>
            <li>right around 27, they started falling out.</li>
            <li>every morning I would look in the mirror hoping to see a change right around 5 weeks</li>
            <li>I have continued to use it on just one eye and used it on the corner of my right eye.</li>
            <li>I apply right at the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(right on my lash line).</li>
            <li>Right now (into my sixth week)</li>
            <li>on right before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>Apply it carefully right on the lash line after cleansing the face at night.</li>
            <li>I used this product maybe for two years right now,only 1-2 times per month,just keep up with my eeyelashes.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see right for 4 days until the serum wore out of my</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product (and the reasonable price compared to others similar products) and have purchased twice now.</li>
            <li>But after the first three weeks the lashes started to rapidly grow back at an amazing rate and after a month the gap is no longer noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I have always had nice thick and long lashes, but as I got older they weren&#x27;t as impressive.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows had gotten so sparse and light, and that&#x27;s the main reason I got</li>
            <li>Mascara definitely feels heavier on my eyes but that is not a bad problem to have :)</li>
            <li>Every single day, everywhere I go, people are constantly asking me if my lashes are real because they are so beautiful!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re consistent, this stuff really works!!  </li>
            <li>Bluured vision and high sensitivity to light.</li>
            <li>I think it works better then Latisse and cost less and has more to use.</li>
            <li>My lashes aren&#x27;t as full as they used to be and when I&#x27;m stressed, whole sections of my lashes will fall out.</li>
            <li>It really does work...just be consistant and use it for the full three months.</li>
            <li>This eyelash enhancer is amazing, eye lashes have grown back and are long and strong!</li>
            <li>I am not a skeptic, but like most people (probably yourself included), I have purchased numerous products with their bold and blaring claims to do wonderful things for you only to eventually toss them (or the remainder of them) in the trash and chalk it up to another learned lesson and waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;NOT</li>
            <li>I notice new pretty lashes every day that look gorgeous with even a tiny bit of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more expenisve on their main site which is why I was trying a new product.</li>
            <li>in a relativly short period of time I have noticed much longer lashes that look amazing when I put on mascara.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used it for a few years now and more than 10 of my friends/colleagues are now using it and love it as well.</li>
            <li>This product is okay doesn&#x27;t work as well as Lilash, worth spending the extra money.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon for this product is very reasonable with no shipping charge.</li>
            <li>Now I only fill in my brows if I&#x27;m rocking a full-on made up look, and I have to be very light handed</li>
            <li>Now I use it every other day and so far my lashes still look great.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this because the price was reasonable and it&#x27;s got pretty good consumer review from other site.</li>
            <li>My lashes have thickened a little, but the results are not as good as the Le Lash product for me.</li>
            <li>I checked ingredients against my real tube and the first ingredient of this is Deonized Water!  </li>
            <li>aslo noticed that the fine hair on my face around my eyes (which normally isn&#x27;t visable)grew as well.(I had to be really close to the mirror to see it.)</li>
            <li>About a month ago a lady stopped me in the store and was pretty amazed and a little animated about how good they looked.  </li>
            <li>far as my lashes are concerned, this product made a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>I try to be consistent by using it every night or every morning...</li>
            <li>I get compliments almost daily and have purchased 3 tubes for friends and family and am buying 2 more tubes today.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a skeptic but this product really works!</li>
            <li>this was my first purchase of something Like this.</li>
            <li>Except when something really work&#x27;s is when I WILL write one!</li>
            <li>For the first week or two I could not use it twice a day on my lashes.  </li>
            <li>+ my eyelashes are much fuller!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many from the drug stores, and found they all fell short.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>it really does work!</li>
            <li>I first heard about it from the Salon</li>
            <li>My eyelashes really growing  now !</li>
            <li>Both upper and lower have more length.  </li>
            <li>It is now the beginning of August and my first tube is out.</li>
            <li>but for now, I&#x27;m definitely ordering more of the GrandeLASH MD Enhancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, with continued use - twice a day consistently - the irritation lessened.  </li>
            <li>I first noticed my friends eyelashes and thought I&#x27;d give this a try myself.  </li>
            <li>others have mentioned at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been asked if these are my real eyelashes!  </li>
            <li>I used it twice a day at first and didn&#x27;t think it was working at all until after about 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>and they are not getting better and are constantly watering.</li>
            <li>I did exactly what it said to do</li>
            <li>I initially bought this to put on my brows to help re-growth but started putting on my top lash line</li>
            <li>Just be sure not to use it until you are going to bed because if you open your eyes with this stuff on your lashes, it will sting until you wash it out.</li>
            <li>The first day, I applied it on at night.  </li>
            <li>The product does NOT last more than 2 months).</li>
            <li>The product does NOT last more than 2 months).</li>
            <li>Hope to find out that the results will begin to be evident soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you start out, you have to apply this morning and night to mimic the dosage in latisse (probably for the first 6 weeks).  </li>
            <li>I would recommend applying this every night until the first tube runs out.</li>
            <li>and it makes them even longer dramatically and thicker, plus more lashes overall.</li>
            <li>Thanks Grande Lash!</li>
            <li>first month I applied once per day just like my eyeliner</li>
            <li>I first tried this product at the suggestion of my waxer a year ago.</li>
            <li>Every female needs this product - it will make your eyes look absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li>Since I have blonde lashes, I still wear a lot of mascara, but I love looking at them and feel like they give me an awake</li>
            <li>It starts working about two weeks, first your lash line might be irritated but skip a night then continue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used this type of product that worked so fast!</li>
            <li>Lashes got longer first and then darker after 8 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I used it 2x per day the first three weeks, and then switched to every night.  </li>
            <li>I love not having to wear  Mascara on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>BUT GrandeLASH has me ready to toss out the falsies!</li>
            <li>I will be going back to Librow for sure.</li>
            <li>I started using this product once a day and at first I did feel my eyelids itchy, but just where the liquid had been placed.  </li>
            <li>I waited until the redness went away, then tried it again to make sure the product was making my eyes red.  </li>
            <li>This took about 3 months of nightly use before I saw results but it really works!</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s been about a month and a week since I started my first treatment</li>
            <li>This product REALLY WORKS!  </li>
            <li>I saw results within the first week at two applications a day.</li>
            <li>Of course, it works faster and more effectively on younger people - under 30.</li>
            <li>really does work!</li>
            <li>For the first 2-3 weeks I thought I had bought a product that did not work.  </li>
            <li>Every night, I would dip the brush in only one time to spread across the top of both eyelids.</li>
            <li>This stuff has worked very well!  </li>
            <li>Put it on lightly like eyeliner and you will have no trouble.</li>
            <li>Will assume an allergic reaction, but regardless, I had to throw it away and will see a dermatologist for a more medically approved version of this item.</li>
            <li>I have blonde normally; I love not having to wear mascara.</li>
            <li>It really worked on my eyelashes!</li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>starting to notice longer lashes :)</li>
            <li>OK, so I actually bought this product almost a year ago.</li>
            <li>I was OK filling in my brows with powder or pencil, but my lashes were getting more and more difficult to work with.</li>
            <li>Mine were touching the middle of my eyebrows</li>
            <li>I stopped using this more than a year ago and the red marks on my eyelids are still there!</li>
            <li>Not only did they grow longer, but they seemed to fill in more and looked thicker.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to stick it out</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>This stuff really does grow your lashes!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works...really!  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted for about 3 months.  </li>
            <li>Now my lashes rest just above the top of the curler.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this at my hair salon, for a much higher price, and used as directed once a day, in the morning.  </li>
            <li>product really works!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>These products have really made a difference!</li>
            <li>This is NOT the real Grande Lash!  </li>
            <li>Today is the first day I&#x27;ve tried to use mascara</li>
            <li>and it burned my eyes alittle to much!</li>
            <li>I had more when I was younger and, as my mother likes to remind me</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t exactly walk around looking like a stoned vampire.</li>
            <li>Exactly as indicated.</li>
            <li>I just ordered several more containers because others who have noticed the difference want to try it as well.</li>
            <li>Be patient though - keep it up every night for the first 3 months -</li>
            <li>I started using this product consistently about 5 weeks ago and both my friends</li>
            <li>I reddened eyes, burst blood vessels on the first day of use.</li>
            <li>it really works!</li>
            <li>Well, I am here to say that I am pleasantly pleased and on my second bottle!</li>
            <li>I had just had a fill but waited 4 days to use Grande Lash and followed the exact instructions.</li>
            <li>Works exactly like it says, but you do have to apply it twice a day.</li>
            <li>If you are consistent with the applications; your lashes will grow.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever written a review here</li>
            <li>The first couple of days when I started using it</li>
            <li>just rubbing the brush along my lash line, so it gets both top and bottom at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I am a bit of a product junkie so after my first tube of GrandeLash MD ran out I switched to a cheaper lash growth product on the market.</li>
            <li>Have really noticed a difference in My  lashes, so have everyone else!</li>
            <li>I sure wish integrate would come back!!</li>
            <li>For those who had eye redness,  I had that my first day...</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much!)</li>
            <li>Your eyelashes will get longer first before they get thicker.</li>
            <li>people are asking if they really are my eyelashes!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before applying it, I took a picture of my lashes first.</li>
            <li>the first week, I noticed my eyelashes getting darker and fuller but the length is still the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really works!</li>
            <li>more sparse lashes that I was left with.</li>
            <li>but I exspected more, the length stayed the same.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was make up (since I started wearing mascara again).</li>
            <li>I used it every night for the first three months, and now I&#x27;m using it twice a week to maintain the results.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Although my eyelashes are longer, the tips are still bleached out (most likely from the sun)</li>
            <li>I have used many eyelash serums over the years and this one definitely works!  </li>
            <li>I used Jan Marini when she first came out</li>
            <li>After 3 months I can really see the results!</li>
            <li>My lashes are much longer!</li>
            <li>I am interested in ordering this product.  </li>
            <li>Is anyone willing to put them on here via a review.</li>
            <li>have allergies and need to know the exact contents before I order.</li>
            <li>Together they give me bombshell lashes that are so stellar</li>
            <li>I dont need to use m&amp;aacute;scara much!</li>
            <li>My first review is below -</li>
            <li>My lashes are longer and starting to become more fuller.</li>
            <li>I must say I was a skeptic at first because of the price, but the pictures convinced me to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought I was imaging it...</li>
            <li>After washing my face I first apply my night cream</li>
            <li>Most definitely will buy again and again...</li>
            <li>I purchased this first at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>I used the product twice a day (for the first month).  </li>
            <li>#34;POP&amp;#34; which is exactly what I had hoped for and the fact that there is the lengthening serum in the mascara</li>
            <li>Grande Lash MD really works!</li>
            <li>It takes about a month of consistent use to see any results.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I will say that the first couple weeks of using this product SEVERELY irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>first started using this product in July--it is now October.</li>
            <li>My lashes are much longer, darker and stronger!</li>
            <li>I never had that happen with the first one.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>the first 2or 3 days.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes were touching ABOVE my eye brows!!!!</li>
            <li>You have to use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally puny and light coloured lashes.</li>
            <li>There was a bit of irritation for the first two weeks</li>
            <li>This was also a much better price than what I paid at my local hair salon!  </li>
            <li>purchased my first tube from Amazon</li>
            <li>So, exactly 6 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen good results in my eyelashes just in a few months</li>
            <li>A few coats of mascara, and I&#x27;m good.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are long and full!!</li>
            <li>The other thing I wish I could change (and I&#x27;m sure this is not very common) is that the corner lashes on the top are almost TOO curly, so now when I put on mascara</li>
            <li>Since I rely on product reviews so much before purchasing most items I thought it was only right to write a review myself.  </li>
            <li>very much differed from those with positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately I was smart enough to discontinue using this hazardous product after only 2 applications.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not just the length (other serums deliver length), but it&#x27;s the fullness that is so amazing.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited about results so far.</li>
            <li>I feel very good about where my lashes are right now and look forward to the next few weeks!)</li>
            <li>one thing do, one of my aunts stopped using the GrandeLASH and her eyelashes went back to their original size!</li>
            <li>this product takes time to see results though if you are older so be patient but it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li>and I think that it took longer to work than a younger person, but after a good 3 months it actually made a difference.  </li>
            <li>Reordered and it didn&#x27;t seem to last nearly 3 months and didn&#x27;t seem as effective.</li>
            <li>You have to perservere through the first 21 days but after that, you certainly notice a difference in the length and thickness.</li>
            <li>My upper and lower lashes are long, full and fabulous!!</li>
            <li>My sister gave this to me as a gift and with all the positive feedback I&#x27;ve decided to continue ordering.</li>
            <li>I honestly never post reviews, but this eyelash serum is beyond amazing!</li>
            <li>I have huge gaps from loss of lashes a and can barely use mascara.</li>
            <li>i am 28 years old and started using this product once in the morning and once at night for about 2 months and my lashes grew so long they were touching the lids of my eyes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many comments about how long my lashes are and was even asked if I got extensions.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many brands of lash enhancers and this one a long with Li Lash</li>
            <li>It actually didn&#x27;t burn my eyes or irritate my skin at all as other reviewers experienced.</li>
            <li>I have had so many compliments on my lashes being so long and have recommended this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d ask my sisters and they didn&#x27;t see much of a change at first.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for quite some time and get more compliments on my long lashes.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on how long my lashes are.</li>
            <li>Results were pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I am happy enough to buy this product again, even though I have to say that I have no experience with other lash enhancers.</li>
            <li>You pretty much have to use it forever.</li>
            <li>This was the first one I tried and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I used Latisse and loved the results but got fed up with always having irritated eyelids.</li>
            <li>My brows look dark and are filling in SO nicely</li>
            <li>I used it in the past and had good results</li>
            <li>I have quit using it and ordered my old tried and true Revialash.</li>
            <li>I had recently gotten single eyelash extensions, I loved them the first time and decided to get then again.</li>
            <li>Came quickly, not a lot of waiting, which is nice.</li>
            <li>They are not quite as long as when I used Latisse, but I&#x27;m really hoping that if I keep using it, I will see more growth.</li>
            <li>But well, I think if you want to maintained your eyelashes long and thick you&#x27;ll just have to keep buying the product and stay happy with how it works!</li>
            <li>I had pulled out a large section of my eyelashes with a defective eyelash curler and the gap</li>
            <li>I now use Smart Lash.</li>
            <li>However, after those first few weeks I suddenly noticed results - and what great results.  </li>
            <li>I used to use revitalash and this is as similar, great results and half the cost.</li>
            <li>As an aside, when I purchased the product it was also half the price it is now making it more economical than Revitalash.  </li>
            <li>But after the first day I apply I become slightly excited about the future result.</li>
            <li>Must confess to waking up with red eyes most mornings, but it always goes away quickly after simply splashing some water in my face.</li>
            <li>One of my high school students told me today that I have pretty lashes.</li>
            <li>but now I have thicker eyelashes which is a huge blessing for Asian eyes.</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>I still use mascara to really show them up</li>
            <li>I will buy another tube very soon.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and don&#x27;t really notice any changes in eyelash length and volume.</li>
            <li>Actually VERY costly.</li>
            <li>Almost FREE actually.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d really working</li>
            <li>It really does do what it says...</li>
            <li>This product really worked for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks , grande lash</li>
            <li>It really does work.  </li>
            <li>No irritating side effects and works just as described-</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>The second time around didn&#x27;t go so smoothly.</li>
            <li>It really worked on me.</li>
            <li>I used morning and night and saw FAST results.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like they were breaking off, and my eye lides were really itchy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants longer, fuller lashes.</li>
            <li>it really works.</li>
            <li>I use it on my brows as well and can see a real difference.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I was terrified to lose my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;-2 months of using it:(I used this product for 2 whole months</li>
            <li>I was terrified to lose my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;-2 months of using it:(I used this product for 2 whole months</li>
            <li>but it really worked for me.</li>
            <li>GrandeLash MD really does work.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t work for me but has been working really well for my sister.</li>
            <li>, it worked and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>After about two weeks I could really notice a difference in the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li>It really helped the bald spot grow back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another tip is to apply it very close to the lash line/root of ur lashes so it will reduce the blotchy appearance etc</li>
            <li>So they didn&#x27;t get darker but with mascara they really really stand out.</li>
            <li>I really think they change the formula from the version sold in pricey salons.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really thickens my eyelashes and eyebrows after a week.</li>
            <li>and I believe it really has made my eyelashes grow longer.  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t as fast</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even curl my lashes anymore, because then they&#x27;re just too much.</li>
            <li>As mine were quite skimpy, it took 2-3 months, with twice a day applications, to see real change.  </li>
            <li>I have very fin hair, so maybe that&#x27;s the problem.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>It takes about three to four weeks to see a real difference, but</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Grande Lash.</li>
            <li>Much better then what I had expected.</li>
            <li>I really like Grande lash.</li>
            <li>and I was amazed at how much my lashes grew.</li>
            <li>My take on this Because it really works.</li>
            <li>they have really grown thank grandelash</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Just made a month, waiting a bit longer to see real results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>I am a hair salon owner and bought this product through the distributor not from amazon, but regardless the results were really more than I expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks Barbara Rochester</li>
            <li>This product does burn my eyes if I put too much on.</li>
            <li>Also, I received this product in record time, fastest shipping ever for standard shipping, (which was free, I might add).</li>
            <li>so I thought I had really found a reliable source.  </li>
            <li>I have tried at least 3 or 4 different eyelash enhancers; this is by far the best!!</li>
            <li>I have to say it really works.</li>
            <li>None of these type of products have really worked for me, so that&#x27;s not to say it won&#x27;t work for someone else.</li>
            <li>Made them sooo much longer and a heck of a lot stronger.</li>
            <li>But... during that time I also noticed some intense, unwanted side effects.</li>
            <li>lashes are much longer, although not any thicker.</li>
            <li>Once I added the liner and the mascara to the serum, the results really amped up.  </li>
            <li>Both my lashes and my brows have become more sparse as I&#x27;ve aged, and that&#x27;s been a struggle for me.</li>
            <li>Every day I&#x27;m asked if my lashes are real.</li>
            <li>Not as much as lashes)</li>
            <li>so much I purchased two tubes and it still was cheaper than one Latisse.</li>
            <li>GrandeLASH! I highly recommend it too!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This product really does work.</li>
            <li>Used the product at night for 5 days straight.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>I was really hopeful to find an alternative to Latisse.  </li>
            <li>This produce resulted in minimal growth - yes I followed instructions to the letter - and to top it off when I stopped my lashes</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>This really works,  thank you for your very prompt shipment too</li>
            <li>This product really does work</li>
            <li>A real difference.</li>
            <li>Eyebrows are much thicker and growing in around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really did not need thicker lashes</li>
            <li>I get asked if they are my real lashes all the time.</li>
            <li>I have been using Grande Lash MD since September 2013 and my eyelashes have grown so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks for giving me the opportunity to buy it on Amazon</li>
            <li>They do not get &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; as much as they get &amp;#34;length&amp;#34; (just FYI)</li>
            <li>I did not notice them getting much thicker</li>
            <li>Can really notice with mascara.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>and it really shows.  </li>
            <li>This eyelash enhancer really works.</li>
            <li>Love this product and will continue to purchase it as it has helped give me long full eyelashes after losing some of my eyelashes after getting an eye lash extension - this product has restored my lashes and made them thicker and fuller - I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments without even using mascara.</li>
            <li>My lashes are much thicker snd longer after two months of use.</li>
            <li>My brows have always been uneven--with one being really sparse--and I have seen them even up quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice that as much.</li>
            <li>Works very well, after 2weeks</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>On my eyebrows though I don&#x27;t see as much difference yet.</li>
            <li>It takes usally 3 weeks to really see the difference, but your eyelashes really grow.  </li>
            <li>this product really works, all my friends noticed after about 6 weeks .My</li>
            <li>This really does work,  </li>
            <li>after six weeks I have much longer lashes,  I don&#x27;t think they are thicker</li>
            <li>I now use it once a day and my lashes are so much thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my eyes and on my pocket book.</li>
            <li>I used a whole tube of librow before this</li>
            <li>and it REALLY worked...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much  length yet.</li>
            <li>My lash are fuller and much longer.  </li>
            <li>The wand is a brush, much like a liquid eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li>It really do work, I now have lashes that I can see.</li>
            <li>This stuff really make my lashes longer.</li>
            <li>It also works very well on my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I have very blond hair, so this helps add some color to both eyelashes and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I am 56 and have very sparse eyelashes.</li>
            <li>it really works in about 3 weeks after using grande lash</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>so I bought it from Amazon at a much affordable price.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this with high hopes!</li>
            <li>really wish this had worked for me...</li>
            <li>Now we both use it and we are really happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My lashes are much longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li>, SHE RECOMENDED FOR HER FRIENDS, THANKS, REGRDS</li>
            <li>Much of the time, I just want to scratch my eyes out.</li>
            <li>And to my amazement my lashes are so much fuller and they are lengthening.</li>
            <li>I really did not notice much improvement, but I may have skipped a night or two and maybe that made a difference,</li>
            <li>As the directions stated it took about 6 wks of once a day application to really see a difference</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>but I have noticed my eyelashes are much longer</li>
            <li>Really works but give it time.</li>
            <li>Am at 8 weeks and am still waiting on lash thickness and hopefully darkening as I have light blonde eyelashes.</li>
            <li>how much younger you look with your brows filled in.  </li>
            <li>I went and bought some and used it faithfully almost very day at night.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t feel the loss of money so much</li>
            <li>after one month it was very visible...</li>
            <li>Really works as the information states.  </li>
            <li>Very disappointed😔</li>
            <li>this product really really works.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really use it now.</li>
            <li>Well, it really works.</li>
            <li>Just go buy Revitalash, as that stuff works very well.</li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t be the real thing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake and makes your lashes really &amp;</li>
            <li>This product works better than expected.</li>
            <li>This really works, however you need to continue using it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>
            <li>and I am suspecting it is not the real product.  </li>
            <li>grandeLash MD worked very well in lengthening my lashes but didn&#x27;t make them fuller.</li>
            <li>She wants to be done</li>
            <li>i dont wear mascara,lashes are really that long.downside</li>
            <li>This really worked.</li>
            <li>Took a while to work but really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>I would not write a review, but this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to trying this product out for eyelash growth</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>My lashes absolutely got longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to Latisse and this is so much cheaper</li>
            <li>I was more than pleased with this product as I saw results within a few days of starting to use it.  </li>
            <li>My lashes were short and thinning and they have filled out and have become noticeably longer.  </li>
            <li>It has taken about 8 weeks before really seeing results.  </li>
            <li>Got it fast.  </li>
            <li>and I have yet to see a real noticeable difference...</li>
            <li>This is a product that really works.  </li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I started using this product, and it really delivers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>but it really did.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I took a before picture so that I could show you the difference.  </li>
            <li>I want to keep using it, but it just hurts my eyes too much.</li>
            <li>I say honestly, because you are checking everyday for a change</li>
            <li>but I really see a difference, it&#x27;s my second tube and even after the first purchase I noticed my lashes were longer and stronger!!</li>
            <li>I love my new long lashes.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>Within 3 weeks I noticed the result, I always had short eyelashes and now they are much longer and thicker!!!</li>
            <li>It took about a month for me to see results, but WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Only reason I did not give a full 5 stars, which could have to do with my eyes being sensitive, but my eyes get pretty red later on in the day and will dry out (possibly a little more with this) but works AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>been using this since my first review but just got a new order and</li>
            <li>Love my long lush lashes!</li>
            <li>My lashes have grown long and strong with this product.</li>
            <li>But my eyes r fine back to normal.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and just takes a few seconds for a quick swipe alnong</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this product only to have to return it.  </li>
            <li>they look like there shorter than my normal lashes!</li>
            <li>I have used other products that worked better and quicker, This burns my eyes.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t apply the enhancer to any area on your eyes where lashes don&#x27;t normally grow!  </li>
            <li>I just may need more time after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li>At first, I got a little scared because I noticed that many of my eyelashes started to fall out</li>
            <li>My eyes after use of this product not getting it in my eyes, makes my eyes so sensitive to light that I have pain within the back of eyeball, evidently some seeps into eyes.</li>
            <li>I compared this to another product that is way cheaper and the other product works better for me.</li>
            <li>I did not see very much growth there were a few more lashes then before</li>
            <li>I was very careful to make sure none of the product got into my eyes</li>
            <li>I actually have pretty long lashes, but I am a blonde and my top lashes are a light brown and almost transluscent at the tip.  </li>
            <li>Took about two months to see major results, but it is worth the time and effort.  </li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t care about the price, but she wants high quality product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame they raised the cost so high because the product really works.</li>
            <li>As much as I wanted for better results and read about every review on various websites, nowhere did I see anyone report facial hair in unusual places - under the outer corners of the eyes.</li>
            <li>Now my lashes are back to being lush and full!  </li>
            <li>Wow what a positive force that I really needed.</li>
            <li>This product is much cheaper on Amazon, it normally retails for over $60.  </li>
            <li>and unfortunately I lost my beautiful lashes and was out $40.00.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first tube, it&#x27;s lasted me 5 months so far.  </li>
            <li>I mean is, before you apply it on ur lash line, make sure that ur brush isn&#x27;t too soaked with the product or else when u apply it, ur going to have a more blotchy red appearance on ur eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought she had a new mascara on!  </li>
            <li>I feel like I have a new toy to play with!</li>
            <li>I have bought it over and over again and cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>I am going to have to get some new glasses now!</li>
            <li>I ripped off half of my lashes maybe more.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are longer and black love this product.</li>
            <li>With using this product, over time, my eyelashes became black, top and bottom and have grown to my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I guess I need to apply more than typical?</li>
            <li>and I must say GrandeLASH works just as well, but the price is more than half.  </li>
            <li>I am an older woman and my eyelashes were thinning out and were getting shorter.</li>
            <li>sure you follow the instructions as the secret ingredient is what is used in glaucoma drops so it is important not to get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>once in the morning and once at night, because I am 50 and I read in the directions that if you are older, you will see faster results using it this way.</li>
            <li>Although I only apply once at night, the product only lasts a couple of weeks at most.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that their darker or thicker, as my main reason for using it, is for the length.</li>
            <li>but I am older and it says 6 weeks for results.</li>
            <li>It is super simple to apply and the results are AHHHH-Mazing!  </li>
            <li>Mainly, in length, some fullness, but not to the degree that length increases.</li>
            <li>I initially purchased this in June since so many of my lashes fell out after having my eyeliner tattooed on my upper lids.  </li>
            <li>So I gave myself a break then started up a couple days later only on the tops and was able to use without incident for about 8 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My eyes became super red</li>
            <li>I noticed that as I&#x27;m getting a bit older, my lashes were fretting sparser and shorter.</li>
            <li>This product brought back my long, full lashes!!  </li>
            <li>Works very good in one month my lashes were so long my husband told me to stop using it, because they were long and dark.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try something that could possibly help fatten, lengthen my puny excuse for eyelashes.</li>
            <li>If I were to buy this product from GrandeLASH MD direct,  if my were results weren&#x27;t as proclaimed or positive in anyway</li>
            <li>and very sensitive!</li>
            <li>At first she was starting to doubt herself because you really cant see much results.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>One of my friends who works at a high end salon sells Grandelash to her clients.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Please read my full review (as detailed and accurate as possible) for more information about my bad experience with this product and you will understand .</li>
            <li>I have used other products that have cost more and I guess the old saying</li>
            <li>This by far works better than any other lash lengthening product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I wish it would work a little better .  </li>
            <li>I guess I have to give it  a little more time</li>
            <li>and I am seeing complete results!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have noticed longer lash length and also more hair growth in my eyebrows where it was getting a little sparse.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who really wants to see a difference in their lashes!!</li>
            <li>MADE MY UPPER LASHES FALL OUT IN CERTAIN SPOTS WITH IN THE FIRST WEEK OF USING IT.</li>
            <li>This product works extremely well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I was super skeptical about this product, but I have purchased it more than once now and plan to never stop!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I did not experience anything great from using this product.  </li>
            <li>so i thought perhaps it was my fault for putting too much on or being a sensitive time of the month,</li>
            <li>NO fuller, NO thick.</li>
            <li>NO fuller, NO thick.</li>
            <li>It really works and looks so natural.  </li>
            <li>It also never caused me to have darkened eyelids (which never bothered me because I just used a light pink shadow anyways...</li>
            <li>and my lashes are SO long and full.  </li>
            <li>no secondary effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because the instruction states this is normal and after some time it goes away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but in the instructions it stated that it was normal</li>
            <li>but my eyes are allot more green</li>
            <li>Getting lash extensions is not only more expensive but it will also damage you own lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I only put a minimal amount to my upper eye lid but this product wasn&#x27;t good .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I my eyelashes returned to normal.</li>
            <li>But after 8 weeks you will have long full lashes.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, when you first use it, your eyes aren&#x27;t used to the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now, and my lashes are long and full.</li>
            <li>my eyes became normal.</li>
            <li>and my lashes stayed consistently long and full.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are full and long.</li>
            <li>Her lashes are so long and full since using it.</li>
            <li>to a reputable salon to buy this product, don&#x27;t waste your money on line.</li>
            <li>my lashes are long and full.  </li>
            <li>I think I should be waiting for a few more months, then I&#x27;ll review it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will continue to use it for a few more months.</li>
            <li>,it made my eyelids rose colored,,well red basically, so have to wear white eyeshadow to cover up the red eyelids,im in my forties</li>
            <li>The irritation is not bad and my lashes are still long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian with short straight lashes and never had such good looking long lashes before thanks to</li>
            <li>I grew tired of the time and expense even though I loved the lashes.  </li>
            <li>and when i do wear mascara people ask me if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes, that&#x27;s how good they look now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands that work fine.</li>
            <li>I seriously can&#x27;t believe how much better my lashes look!  </li>
            <li>My eyes became super sensitive to sunlight, regardless of whether I was actually looking at the sun or not.</li>
            <li>About...5 months of use, I started getting compliments on my lashes left and right.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and after 3 weeks, my right eye is back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>used revitalash every night for 5 years, and it made my eyelashes super long</li>
            <li>I am going to keep going to see if in addition to being super long and curved they also get darker and fuller.</li>
            <li>I am always skeptical to use miraculous products but this really works :) I started with the liquid to grow my lashes now I am using mascara from the same line and my lashes look like to die for :)</li>
            <li>My eyes turned dark red if I got some in my eye the night before, and they would stay bright red all day, it was embarrassing.  </li>
            <li>My skin in both areas became more sensitive to touch and got a little darker in color.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve had darker under eye circles since, but that might be natural as there is precious little sunlight in overcast Indiana in the winter.  </li>
            <li>My lashes have also darkened where the new growth is.</li>
            <li>I buy this for a friend of mine, she loves it, enhanced her lashes to a new length.</li>
            <li>This formula basically prolongs the shedding of your lashes (basically your lashes do not shed as new lashes come in)</li>
            <li>Plan to stay with this product  until a new formula improves it, always will to try.</li>
            <li>but I am giving new growth time to grow.</li>
            <li>The new product did NOT work as well for me as the GrandeLash MD had.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed new growth.</li>
            <li>My brow and lashes are normally dark but fine.  </li>
            <li>My moms had the absolutely shortest lashes in existence and she got enough length by Christmas that she could really grab onto with her mascara wand and also see with no makeup.</li>
            <li>However.....my lashes are long and pretty!  </li>
            <li>my lashes will be back to looking long, thick and gorgeous!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t caused me any irritation or any discoloration on my eyelids, and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They look very natural.</li>
            <li>&quot; This product has done nothing to help the growth of my lashes and made my eyes very sensitive.</li>
            <li>It gave me red itchy and puffy eyes the first week of use, but I continued using it expecting results.  </li>
            <li>Not absolutely sure if it has to do with the Grand Lashe or not,</li>
            <li>I had no side effects and now I only apply once every other day before I go to bed top and bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li>I did suffer some irritation at first, even receiving comments about how red my eyelids appeared to be.  </li>
            <li>I used the product once for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>but I have no complaints thus far!</li>
            <li>but when I did, wow!</li>
            <li>In the inside corner of the same eye 3 lashes grew longer a bit ticker than the first one.</li>
            <li>In the inside corner of the same eye 3 lashes grew longer a bit ticker than the first one.</li>
            <li>the first day of application, my eyes started feeling itchy n red.</li>
            <li>It definitely works, and my lashes are much longer!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first tube 4 months later.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t know if having long eyelashes is worth the side effects.</li>
            <li>It must be used consistently and you will see your lashes growing by 3-4 weeks, especially when mascara is applied.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it would work for me if it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes--my left eye especially turned red in the inside corner.</li>
            <li>One thing to remember though, the lashes grow in different lengths at first Just keep using it, and the others will catch up.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that actually worked.  </li>
            <li>My natural lashes are longer than falsies!</li>
            <li>For the first three days my eyelids were red and looked like I had on some eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I tried a different lash enhancer first however had a reaction from it.  </li>
            <li>Within the first week my eyes were red and itchy.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that REALLY works!</li>
            <li>No side effects so far!</li>
            <li>I mainly bought it for my eyebrows that had fallen out, and it really worked to fill them back in.  </li>
            <li>It made my lashes nice and long but it also made them a little thinner</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see fantastic results, but no problems with redness or any irritation.</li>
            <li>and this is the only product that has brought my lashes back full force.</li>
            <li>but it made my skin around my eyes so dark on bottom an red on top of my lid</li>
            <li>I have been a user of GrandeLASH MD for 2 solid years, purchasing the product from the company direct at a higher price.  </li>
            <li>I had long lashes most of my life but, as I aged, my lashes got skimpier and shorter.  </li>
            <li>Of course, when I stopped using it, my lashes returned to their normal (short, straight) length.</li>
            <li>After a full 4 weeks of only applying every evening, my lashes were longer and fuller than they had ever been, even when i was younger.</li>
            <li>After Using it for a several months I saw an old roommate, and the first thing she said to me was &amp;</li>
            <li>You actually look like you have false eyelashes when in fact they are your own!  </li>
            <li>I typically do not leave reviews, but I highly recommend users purchase directly from Grande.</li>
            <li>I did read all the reviews prior to ordering and all of them were positive</li>
            <li>Several people at work have started using  it and also seen positive results.</li>
            <li>It took a while to notice a difference, six weeks approximately, but then I&#x27;m in love with the product!</li>
            <li>They got dark enough and so full that I don&#x27;t need mascara (and they were pretty blond before).  </li>
            <li>I used LiLash in the past, which was more expensive, and definitely worked more quickly, but they both work very well in the end.</li>
            <li>Did nothing for my eyelashes but made hair grow tremendously underneath my eyes, right above my cheekbone (I don&#x27;t know how because I only applied on lash line) and it is very noticiable since I have dark hair</li>
            <li>I was a Latisse user for 2 years but swtiched (this is less expensive and it felt time for a change) and I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li>However, using it two times daily, I am noticing a slight increase in lashes and, maybe, a tad more brows.  </li>
            <li>Her salon sold it for over $100 (which is why you should obviously buy on Amazon for HALF the price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are instructed to use one dip for each eye (apply to the top lid and the bottom).</li>
            <li>I used to have naturally long eyelashes but lost all the length and many lashes due to my job</li>
            <li>My eyes continue itching and red but only after applying the product, next morning my eyes were fine.</li>
            <li>I rather spend $65 for a genuine product not a watered down product!</li>
            <li>I apply first to my right eye, and then, without re-dipping into the tube, I turn the brush to the opposite side and apply to the other eye.</li>
            <li>(I have very dark brown hair and light skin).  </li>
            <li>Within 2 months, I really noticed my lashes really growing long!!!</li>
            <li>Face was clean and dry prior to application.</li>
            <li>It is clear color.</li>
            <li>I see some improvement to upper lashes, not so much on lower and nothing on brows.</li>
            <li>By the third week I could tolerate twice a day on my lashes (I think I was probably using too much in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>one really irritated my eyes, leaving the red when i woke.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes are normally short and will not curl, thanks to this</li>
            <li>no matter how old you are (I&#x27;m 51 by the way)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still too early to tell if this product works or not.  </li>
            <li>D so far see no visible difference.</li>
            <li>I developed blisters on both cornea of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Works very well but caused my eyes to be really red and blood shot.  </li>
            <li>So far, I get a bit of redness on the eyelids but not discoloration or stinging.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin around my eyes</li>
            <li>I also took care to completely remove my mascara and eyeliner before applying.</li>
            <li>Its been 3 months and all I could say is wow</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t overdo it because it can darken your skin near your eyes.  </li>
            <li>This is something you apply to your lash line to enhance growth of natural lashes.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It is not a fix for lashes - much like a moisturizer is not a fix for facial imperfections.  </li>
            <li>so I can just be completely ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it did not work as fast nor last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m OLD</li>
            <li>then WOW.</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to buy this product because I read some reviews of people who had developed redness on the eyelids, but it didn&#x27;t happened to me.</li>
            <li>I also used on my eyebrows, because I over plucked one of my eyebrows so much that I have a bald spot on one, and last night, after 7-8 days of being using this product twice a day I&#x27;m seeing hair growing on the bald spot!</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far this product has been working for me.</li>
            <li>It has taken about 2 months for this product to provide the WOW factor ...</li>
            <li>I would definately recomend this to someone like me with short, straight lashes.</li>
            <li>I am 47 years old</li>
            <li>Now my eyelashes are much longer, appear much darker and are definitely visible enough to make my eyes stand out.  </li>
            <li>I have spare lashes that are different in length, after a month of using the product, my lashes length is even, they curl in one direction and appear much fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Within 3 weeks you could see a considerable difference.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just have really sensitive skin or eyelids</li>
            <li>My lashes are longer, thicker, and don&#x27;t fall out near as often.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not toooooo overly sensitive but</li>
            <li>used the product twice a day for the first two week, then once a day until my lashes got so long</li>
            <li>So far 6 of my girlfriends are using the lash enhansor and liking the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is, by far, my #1 beauty product.  </li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning with blood shot eyes &amp; does make them sensitive after some time.</li>
            <li>and I have had teenage girls ask me if they&#x27;re real.</li>
            <li>My lashes were straight and short.</li>
            <li>So far, no eyelash growth.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re far longer than they used to be, no curler needed and, when I do use mascara, they are SO noticeable.</li>
            <li>It completely enhances and elongates lashes.  </li>
            <li>I brought maximum strength eye drops for red eye and it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>As far as thickness and darkness</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be natural ingredients that help moisturizer and help your natural lashes grow.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m an old, into my 60s.  </li>
            <li>My bottom lashes are completely transparent.  </li>
            <li>I am 64 years old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural blond</li>
            <li>I still need to use mascara because my lashes are naturally blond and this hasn&#x27;t made a noticable difference in the darkness.</li>
            <li>let them fall out naturally.  </li>
            <li>I am 25 years old</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing to make my eye lashes grow, my eyelashes remaind the same with some lashes falling out, gimmick.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was reasonably priced and after reading the reviews, it sounded similar to Latisse.</li>
            <li>I have noticed longer eyelashes, but the con far outweigh the growth as it has caused discoloration on my eyelids -which</li>
            <li>It takes about six weeks to really see a big difference.</li>
            <li>Still think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced for the results I&#x27;ve seen thus far.</li>
            <li>My friend recommended this product and her lashes were lush, darker and longer</li>
            <li>but so far all I see is my lashes ar longer and the bottom lash has no improvement.</li>
            <li>it is all natural</li>
            <li>This is the only product that really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young 65 years old.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to splurge on myself early for the holidays...</li>
            <li>and/or SPF day cream then apply it directly on my eyelids (not lashes).  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.  </li>
            <li>i am sensitive to a lot of products but not this.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes grew to unexpected lengths.</li>
            <li>Very hapoy with the product you can finally see my eyelashes again!  </li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you stop using the product your lashes go back to the way they were which again makes my suspect this product is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>i would have given 5 stars but the time I have had too use it is too short to really see how it works.</li>
            <li>I had to leave work early because my eyes were burning and so sensitive.</li>
            <li>It was like it was old or had been used (Geeze, I hope not).</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>So I went from using one product to another directly.</li>
            <li>But my eyes were too sensitive for that</li>
            <li>I think that people will notice more your dark circles than you eyelashes if they  are long.</li>
            <li>I think that people will notice more your dark circles than you eyelashes if they  are long.</li>
            <li>(I love a few brands) and people regularly think I&#x27;m wearing falsies.</li>
            <li>It will give you full and dark lashes before you even finish one bottle.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve already had success with a growth formula and are no longer using it daily, use this daily or between &#x27;growth&#x27; doses to maintain the roots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately three months and my lashes and eyebrows look spectacular.</li>
            <li>This is nice in that it&#x27;s a clear liquid on a thin brush --</li>
            <li>/&gt;The effects don&#x27;t last permanently, but if someone has a few weeks of prep time to grow your lashes, this is a nice alternative to fake lashes (especially if you have a good plumping mascara).</li>
            <li>It looked like she had been using Latisse, only no \\&quot;spidery\\&quot; length I see with some gals, nice and thick.</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin and eyes, and although this product does itch sometimes after long use, my eyes are fine, not red, not irritating, not changing color like other products on the market.</li>
            <li>The only thing is last time I stopped using it right away</li>
            <li>I am of Native American decent and have been blessed with short straight lashes.</li>
            <li>There is slight stinging that is bothersome, but not painful and goes away.</li>
            <li>It took a full month to see any difference, but it did make my lashes longer and slightly fuller.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so powerful, you need to be pretty careful of where it gets on your face, otherwise, the areas which you want to remain hairless (like the areas to the right and left of the ends of your lash line) might start to grow a little fuzz...</li>
            <li>I mentioned earlier, the only downside is the initial use is pretty much guaranteed to irritate your eyes.</li>
            <li>Love the product but find it odd that my first tube lasted 2 months, and my second tube lasted only 2 weeks, despite using it less frequently than I was using the first tube initially.</li>
            <li>Is not as long as and fuller as I want it to be yet , but I believe I will get there in few more weeks .</li>
            <li>But the 2nd order was not the same as the first.</li>
            <li>I took a chance and ordered a third tube and after a month of using it, my eyebrows and eyelashes are back to how they were before I started my first tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the first week or two, I used it twice daily, then only at night.</li>
            <li>After the first two months, I have been using it about every second night just to make it last longer</li>
            <li>However, saw quick results on my brows (less than 3 weeks).</li>
            <li>It was watered down and barely kept my eyebrows and eyelashes full.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes, which were pretty short and nonexistent, are now so long, I can&#x27;t wear my old sunglasses anymore!</li>
            <li>I researched various eyelash enhancers and this was rated high with a lot of reviewers which is why I chose this product.  </li>
            <li>I had such high expectations about this product.</li>
            <li>I had several friends who highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>When I take my makeup off my lids are a little red and irritated so I just put on a good moisturizer after my bath then wait a few hours then put the GrandLashMD</li>
            <li>I only used it at night before because my eyes are easily irritated and it did irritate my eyes if I used it everyday.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that a LOT of the positive reviews of this product are from people who have only left one review on Amazon and that one review is to talk this product up.</li>
            <li>The side effects I experienced were slightly unpleasant, but not to the point of stopping my use of it.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t need to wait this long because I saw a difference almost immediately - not in length, of course but, for the fact that my lashes started to \\&quot;curl\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>When I curl them I can really see how long they are.  </li>
            <li>However, a word of caution...when I first started using the product, my eyes were not used to the solution, and it would make my eyes red during the first few months I was using it.</li>
            <li>Once I stopped using it, 2 days later my eyes felt normal again.</li>
            <li>and my lashes went back to normal.  </li>
            <li>There is a pink line along where I apply the GrandeLash which at first concerned me.  </li>
            <li>And I also feel like they are going back to its normal length with time if you don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li>I FIND IT IS OK ABOUT THE SAME AS OTHER EYE LASH SERUMS ONLY A LITTLE BIT HIGHER IN PRICE ,BUT</li>
            <li>I would have never imagined that this product would deliver exactly what it promises, but holy cow, my eyelashes have NEVER looked so lush.</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old and had noticed that my lashes were thinning  out and my 42 year old daughter had used Grand Lash MD and and had thick long lashes, so I tried it and within 6 weeks I had longer thicker lashes that friends were complimenting and  wanted to know what the product was all about....</li>
            <li>I can also notice new eyelashes that are working there way up to the length of my regular eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a new and improved product, because the packaging was similar.  </li>
            <li>This works really well and made my lashes very long.  </li>
            <li>My lashes existed but werent very long and were completely straight.</li>
            <li>I used it too much on the bottom lashes and the tiny facial hairs just under the eye grew and darkened as well.  </li>
            <li>my eyelashes are back to their initial fullness and much longer and curlier than ever before.</li>
            <li>My lashes are definitly longer (not fake lash long but enough to continue purchasing the product!)</li>
            <li>and I get much longer lashes using just my regular daily mascara.  </li>
            <li>I started using it early in December and by February my eyelashes looked better than extensions or false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Having had short, straight, average lashes my whole life</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nothing major.</li>
            <li>I purchased it the first time in February 2013 and can&#x27;t remember how many days it took to actually notice, but alas, I DID notice!</li>
            <li>We applied it day and night for the first months and now just every other night for maintenance.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any major results but it claims that you will in 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>This is my first lash boosting product, so I can&#x27;t compare it with other ones.</li>
            <li>In the mornings, I wake up with major crust in my eyes.</li>
            <li>This product caused major irritation to my eyes including severe redness and burning.</li>
            <li>Because of the other review I took a chance and tried GrandeLASH MD for the first time almost 6months ago.  </li>
            <li>My clients love that I wear little to no make-up and so do I. Less work for a busy woman.</li>
            <li>But it does make them stronger and less prone to breakage and fall-out, and it definitely enhances the results when used as supplement to those true growth-inducing products.</li>
            <li>so my lashes are very light and have always been thin.  </li>
            <li>For month two, I applied twice a day right at the rootline of my eyelashes (less like eyeliner)...which I should have been doing during month one.</li>
            <li>but if it saves just one lady the same trouble worth the effort!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over 40 and won&#x27;t wear false eyelashes (mainly because I can never get them to fit</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have mentioned that it stings your eyes, and that is true, but only for the first few applications.</li>
            <li>I figure I&#x27;ll be able to back down to every other day during month four, if not sooner.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and eczema and at first the product stings my eyelids a little</li>
            <li>I wish I could say the same for this product because I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li>but they have thinned and such since high school, 2 weeks after starting this</li>
            <li>My eyelashes have grown very long and new lashes have grown in too!  </li>
            <li>At about week 5 or so, I DEFINITELY see longer lashes on the top, and the bottom lashes are starting to fill in where I had some gaps with hardly anything.  </li>
            <li>It gives my eyelashes an even darker appearance and I generally wear eyeliner in that area anyway</li>
            <li>While this may give different results for different users, this made my lashes amazing and thick and long.  </li>
            <li>Because my skin is so sensitive, I only applied once a day every night and again I had no issues.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if they are selling old bottles that don&#x27;t have the same effect for your lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 47 years old, and until I started using this, had short, stubby blond lashes.  </li>
            <li>Will be buying another tube in the near future to start growing out my lashes again for my wedding.</li>
            <li>Like I said earlier, I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am/was a natural blonde</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s terrific!!!!</li>
            <li>, I once again had complete upper and lower lash line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 65, of Northern European stock and have naturally stubby lashes.  </li>
            <li>When you first try it, use it daily until your lashes are LONG, then you only need to use it about every 3 days.  </li>
            <li>On my second day of use my eyes turned completely blood-red.</li>
            <li>At the end of it, my lashes were nearly gone and the ones that were left seemed shorter.  </li>
            <li>I barely use it because</li>
            <li>I thought I was imagining it, but when I compared my lashes with the old photos, the change was obvious.</li>
            <li>When I started I could barely get my lashes into an eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>I may have to consider purchasing directly from the manufacturer or switching to something else completely next time.</li>
            <li>Later I found another brand which didn&#x27;t do the job nearly as well, so I returned to GrandeLash.  </li>
            <li>I have always had a bare spot in one of my eyebrows, but the hair is now growing in.</li>
            <li>I spent so much time growing, naturally shedded and grew back the length they were before.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve aged my lashes have really thinned out.</li>
            <li>They are full, long and dark.</li>
            <li>- I visited her in July and immediately noticed how long, dark and full her lashes were.  </li>
            <li>My lashes for two years have become thick and long and more than I could have hoped for.  </li>
            <li>OK people, it takes about 1 year to get long thick lashes.  </li>
            <li>Sure beats trying to put on false lashes.</li>
            <li>Especially after having hardly no lashes left after 2 years of eyelash extensions😟</li>
            <li>are common place for a truly effective lash product and typically goes away after 1-2 weeks, once your body acclimates to the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and i could start to see some new long lashes after about a month.</li>
            <li>after a long conversation with them, i&#x27;m convinced that new shipments are paraben-free.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it because my right eye was dried out, teared up when I read or watch tv.  </li>
            <li>I felt a slight sting when I first used it</li>
            <li>Some redness occurred the first two (2) weeks along with slight itchiness (was not bothersome to me because thereafter it went away).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a small improvement on my eyebrows, but not as quick as seen in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>It seriously works, and makes my lashes outrageously long and healthy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It caused some minor redness on my eyelids at first but that didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>The only complaint, when I first started wearing the product, it really irritated my eyes.  </li>
            <li>(The person from the other review might have been applying too much.</li>
            <li>It takes about 6-8 weeks to really start seeing results, but then I can decrease my use to every other day.</li>
            <li>I looked into this product because I had a friend who had experienced the same issues and started using this product, figuring she&#x27;d give it a shot since it was less expensive than Latisse.</li>
            <li>Mainly because it seemed to irritate my eyes - making them feel a bit dry + red.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks, far short of the required 2 to 3 months to see any results.</li>
            <li>Use it every night for the past 6 weeks and WOW it really works!</li>
            <li>The only downfall is my sensitive eyes can only handle this one or twice a week.</li>
            <li>Also, my eyes are sensitive and this is the only lash enhancer I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t leave me with red, irritated eyes.</li>
            <li>Then, you can just maintain the growth by only using it a few nights a week,,, definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>For me it is worth the little discomfort!  </li>
            <li>The first couple times you put it on, it will sting a little bit.</li>
            <li>It did burn a little but cleared up after the first week of use.</li>
            <li>first my eyelids burned a little.  </li>
            <li>A little redness at first but got used to it</li>
            <li>The price was around $25.00 less then the exact same one sold at my hair salon.</li>
            <li>Like super stubby short and were barely past my eyelids.</li>
            <li>I waited 5 days for it to clear up and then reapplied to only my upper lashes and eyebrows and so far no new problems.</li>
            <li>About long: let me be clear in this.</li>
            <li>About long: let me be clear in this.</li>
            <li>However my daughter, a young adult will not use it due to the petroleum products in it.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a co-worker with lush, long lashes and commented on them to her.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to make my eyes pop with some long natural lashes.  </li>
            <li>At 46 years old I&#x27;d never had long lashes.</li>
            <li>The first few months I used this every night--now just 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li>I had read that women over 50 should apply 2x a day, and I was doing that after the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I wasted my money</li>
            <li>The first few applications did irritate my eyes, some burning and redness, but that went away after a couple uses.</li>
            <li>but it takes a week to start the growth and your eyelashes grow a little crazy but after two weeks they are full and longer and thicker than ever!!!!</li>
            <li>The length is more subtle than I expected but my lashes are thicker.</li>
            <li>but I religiously did each day when I got up and right before bed only missing 2night in 3months.</li>
            <li>just a little irritation the first week .I noticed fuller lashes within the 3rd week.</li>
            <li>The first couple times i used the product the skin around my eyes turned red and burned a little but with use that subsided.</li>
            <li>I used City Lash previously and absolutely</li>
            <li>I am very sadden by this experience because now my lashes are even LESS noticeable</li>
            <li>I started using this in September, after I weaned my baby, and three months later my lashes are long and lush.  </li>
            <li>and my lashes are not only LONG but lush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more then 10 enhancers in the past few years.</li>
            <li>The first few days of using it, my eyes were red and itchy but I shrugged it off thinking maybe it&#x27;ll go away.</li>
            <li>The first few days this made the skin around my eyes very red and itchy.</li>
            <li>Only drawback was getting used to the feel of it the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>and it can definitely cause irritation the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li>My lashes became longer like in 6 months,but everyone ask if they are artificial and a good thing they are staying long.</li>
            <li>So much so that I slowed down and only use it once every 3 days.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product in September because I was losing eyelashes due to stress and possibly getting older</li>
            <li>It is now just under two months of use and my upper lashes are nearly TWICE as long as they have ever been in my life!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say I did try using it twice a day for the first few days (as the directions say some women experience faster growth with twice daily use) but the color around my eyes started to look different.  </li>
            <li>I realized that I used too much so the next day I used less and no redness occurred</li>
            <li>I tapered the daily use down to just once a week thinking maybe the daily use was too much for me.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have blonde, very thin, fine eyelashes, and lost some when I bought a new eyelash curler that pulled a portion of them out.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes its a little too much.</li>
            <li>I thought this might HELP a little, but it is has REALLY improved my lashes.  </li>
            <li>They are so long now, I can barely wear mascara!  </li>
            <li>getting older and losing my eyebrows is not fun, i tried this product and now i have them back.</li>
            <li>When I woke up this morning my eyes were bright red bloodshot, swollen and painful to the touch.</li>

            <li> Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and cheaper than latisse.</li>
            <li> I now use it every two days and the lashes are looking great.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me she was using Grandelash MD and had gotten some great results.</li>
            <li> This works great.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the price, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great results.</li>
            <li> my lashes do grow with this and they look great.</li>
            <li> Now so happy.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> what I experienced is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> It has proven to be the best of its kind on the market.</li>
            <li> Great Product</li>
            <li> While this product is great by itself, the combination of the MD and the Mascara is a can&#x27;t miss.</li>
            <li> Grandelash MD works great</li>
            <li> It works great -- even after a couple of days my eye lashes seemed fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> Now she&#x27;s also on an every-other-week regimen, which is great because it stretches the product.</li>
            <li> Great price too.</li>
            <li> and it still works great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great products for the price.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has a great price on this.</li>
            <li> Great results.  </li>
            <li> It worked great for me, I got mine from RoyalCosmetics.net</li>
            <li> Even used it to fill in my brows and it works great there too.  </li>
            <li> Great product, but made my eyes itch.</li>
            <li> The price has gone up, the name keeps changing but the product is great.  </li>
            <li> Great product and price.  </li>
            <li> Great price,</li>

            <li> I know I need to continue using this to maintain my lashes, but I am happy to do so.</li>
            <li> Works great for lashed.</li>
            <li> But it worked great for about 4 months.</li>
            <li> It did a great job on my eyebrows, and my lashes as well.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t Latisse but a great substitute.</li>
            <li> Great, lashes were longer within 3 wks</li>
            <li> works great on  me, no side effects.</li>

            <li> Love it works great!!</li>
            <li> So happy! :)</li>
            <li> I also used it along my hairline successfully.</li>
            <li> But it was remarkable.  </li>
            <li> you will be fine and have awesome results.  </li>
            <li> I never leave reviews for products, however, this product does as described and the results I have experienced have been absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good for those of us over 50 with thinning brows.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> I have done latisse and loved it, however I did not like how my eyelids turned purple/reddish color.</li>
            <li> Lilash worked well for a good year.</li>
            <li> But let&#x27;s be fair.</li>
            <li> I still think it&#x27;s a good product and works.</li>
            <li> I used Lilash before while it was still legally available in the US and that stuff was awesome.</li>
            <li> I also pair it with the mascara, which is also good stuff.</li>
            <li> and my lashes are still looking good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on week 8 of using GrandeLash MD, and my lashes have all evened out and filled in so beautifully!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s avery good product.</li>
            <li> Good for eyebrows too.</li>
            <li> My lashes have never looked this good.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because the reviews were good.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are twice their length now and look as good as when I had the extensions.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve followed the instructions fairly closely</li>
            <li> This may be a good thing if you&#x27;ve had irritation or side effects with the product to have a gentler alternative like Grandelash MD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this works fairly well</li>
            <li> It took a good 8 weeks to see results (applying just once a day), my lashes are now fuller and longer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this at my salon, and honestly, this is a great price on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> Bought Rapid Lash and thought that worked really good</li>
            <li> For a non-prescription product, it works fairly well.</li>
            <li> but it took me a good 2/2.5 months to see a difference and by 3 months</li>
            <li> I had my doubts, but when my daughter recommended it, I knew it had to be good.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper option to Latisse, which I&#x27;ve used before and loved (was just looking for a cheaper option.)  </li>
            <li> But I never stopped using this product, my lashes looked too good to stop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sooo delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> Her eyelashes are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I thought I ruined my lashes for good.</li>
            <li> surprisingly one star because my lashes became longer and thicker, somehow.</li>
            <li> I was going to wait after 10 weeks to be fair since that is what is claimed on the website.</li>
            <li> I saw good ratings and I bought it.</li>
            <li> and I could notice results that I loved at Christmas.</li>
            <li> She wasnt as good about applying it each morning and night</li>
            <li> I am so excited for when they catch up because they are already beautiful!</li>
            <li> Even if I pull on them, they are really strong now too!!</li>
            <li> love love love this product!!!</li>
            <li> love this product use it with the mascara great combo....</li>
            <li> I have seen a great change and have recieved many compliments on my eyes.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The packaging is great and amount of product is okay.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it helps my lashes grow along with using this great mascara along side.</li>
            <li> I was on some very potent antibiotics after a surgery and my eyelashes all but disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I had read so many great reviews on this product</li>
            <li> Still I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> That, right there, was wonderful for me.</li>
            <li> Most of their great review are written from their own website.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it from now on!</li>
            <li> But works on lashes for sure!</li>
            <li> so I love it!</li>
            <li> Works, I really love it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product, my lashes are longer and fuller!</li>
            <li> The result after the first apply is quite impressive.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it as I love the results!</li>
            <li> Does the job better than any others I tried!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>

            <li> own opinion: I WILL NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For those who think this is not a helpful review, good luck growing your eyelashes. :)</li>
            <li> #34;it&#x27;s not the real deal&amp;#34; but I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> it was my own fault.</li>
            <li> Aging isn&#x27;t nice at</li>
            <li> I think that Grandelash MD will eventually work, but it will take longer or may not be as effective as Latisse.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to have a product that lives up to its advertisement and does the job.</li>
            <li> I can honestly see a difference in my lashes and eyebrows since I started using them.  </li>
            <li> my eyelashes are longer but it would&#x27;ve been nice if I could&#x27;ve tried it for a longer period time.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t impressed because it was to much maintenance</li>
            <li> By the time I used the whole tube I saw great results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with this and will use it until the day I croak.</li>
            <li> He can be brutally honest, so I trusted his opinion.  </li>
            <li> When the lashes began to fall out I noticed a lot of my own lashes were coming out as well.  </li>
            <li> I am using it on my brows, &amp; they are filling in nicely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that this stuff is getting popular</li>
            <li> So that was kind of a dissapointment.</li>
            <li> Kind of defeats the purpose</li>
            <li> I use it once a day before bed and keep eye drops handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> Decided this product was not for me after ordering spontaneously.  </li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this from my salon for $75, so this is a great price.</li>
            <li> Best for me...tried others  but found GrandeLash MD  has worked well for my particular complexion and needs.  </li>
            <li> My husband commented that seeing my beautiful eyes, looking sooo pretty without the &amp;#34;spider legs&amp;#34; as he called the extensions!</li>
            <li> It is a high end salon and they do wonderful work.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product since my daughter has had wonderful results with it.</li>
            <li> when it comes to your eyelashes is best to think of them as normal hair..</li>
            <li> I first used this product through Nordstrom&#x27;s then through Drugstore.com at an incredible price, couldn&#x27;t find it this time there</li>
            <li> Once she started using this her lashes are amazing and super sexy!!</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to tons of people and I&#x27;m super happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Yes your eyelashes will grown and become very strong.</li>
            <li> ….Grandlash is very easy to use ……….</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply with the brush.</li>
            <li> but it is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to so many people and they all love it!  </li>
            <li> Great product -- really works!!  </li>
            <li> Very&#x27; good product, I used Latisse for years and this product is very close to Latisse&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have been told from complete strangers that my eyelashes are beautiful!  </li>
            <li> i was kinda overapplying the product because more effective result.</li>
            <li> was happy for the most part with results, would enjoy a bit more color or darkness</li>
            <li> Love the eyeliner applicator and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> My cousin recommended Grand lash and honestly the best product I have gotten so far .</li>
            <li> This is still going strong!  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love my lashes!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> I had a good start, and I was so excited.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months but was thrilled to discover it at a great cost savings on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;History: I had eyelash extensions for about a year and really liked them - not having to wear mascara and looking good right out of bed in the morning, but did not like the hassle and expense of maintaining them.  </li>
            <li> This serum is a great alternative to eyelash extensions, and they are real!</li>
            <li> Worked great on first tube, then ran out.</li>
            <li> The first order of this worked great.</li>
            <li> and I can say that I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> Although when I first began to use this product, I experienced some redness in my eyes, it went away and hasn&#x27;t bothered me since.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great.</li>
            <li> me felt pretty, the magic tube made this one a happy girl.</li>
            <li> , the look of the package is nice, the appliction is easy, no irritation.  </li>
            <li> HUGE amount of growth after about 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> I was hoping that based on price I would have a better result.</li>
            <li> My friend had better luck.  </li>
            <li> I got better results with this product.</li>
            <li> The longer lashes make my eyes look more awake.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  </li>
            <li> This works to grow eyelashes, to be sure.  </li>
            <li> This product is great works really well......</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> The difference is I don&#x27;t have the brown color on my eyelids that Latisse leaves for most people.</li>
            <li> She was blown away by the length of the top AND bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks of using Grand lash</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing again for sure.</li>
            <li> Results from LiLash worked so much better, but for the price, I may order another tube of GrandeLash.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t great...just ok.</li>
            <li> I love GrandeLASH MD.</li>
            <li> (Still love Benefit&#x27;s Roller Curl mascara though</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> More length than volume but the volume is Better than before.</li>
            <li> and I swear the grandlash works better.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works if you follow the instructions, and the price is great.</li>
            <li> However, I am not seeing much more volume or darkness with them.  </li>
            <li> It defines and adds a bit more length to the lashes without a lot of clumping and does not flake.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a compliment....</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, they are much better now.  </li>
            <li> just spend more money on mascaras instead.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I will look for a better product.  </li>
            <li> Need more time to see results</li>
            <li> Try this, you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I read the instructions and (as per the information) it did take a bit more time until I saw results</li>
            <li> Many reviews did not mention side effects.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> : I notice that every time I wash my face MORE lashes were falling out.</li>
            <li> and I have ordered more.  </li>
            <li> This is great, and really works.</li>
            <li> Glad I risked it and now I&#x27;m enjoying prettier eyes.</li>
            <li> most people said it started working in two weeks or so.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I have lashes better than when I was a youngster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reordered this many times.  </li>
            <li> -received it after more than a week of purchase&lt;</li>
            <li> I Love It</li>
            <li> I have only used the product for 3 weeks and my lashes are looking amazing !!!</li>
            <li> Month two brought more eyelashes, thicker eyelashes, longer eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Should I give it more time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You just need to give it more time.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t anything that can&#x27;t be handled and I am very happy overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love GrandeLASH; I have found that it has thickened my eye lashes as well as some lengthening.  </li>
            <li> Always satisfied with my Amazon purchases</li>
            <li> Neulash was Much better.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This alongside fiber lash mascara &#x3D; better than extensions and falsies.</li>
            <li> I Love this product.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Grande Lash leads as  an award winning lash builder.  </li>
            <li> It works, it&#x27;s been a month, but I can see my lashes getting longer and darker, I would recommend this product, in fact , I bought one more.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and it was about $20.00 more.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll buy a couple more as a gift for one of my relatives and for me before I run out of this one.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are much more thicker now, I was able to recreate the shape of them in a way and they are also much more darker.</li>
            <li> Beware this did make my lashes a lil better</li>
            <li> My lashes are not yet the desired length, but at this rate I am confident it will get there...and soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I had also taken up the habit of pulling at my eyelashes while I did schoolwork which caused more to fall out.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so pleased with this product that I also plan on trying out their eyeliner also.</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to also &amp;#34;thicken&amp;#34; your lashes, Im not so sure about my lashes being any thicker</li>
            <li> makes my lashes grow with more volume</li>
            <li> Lashes longer, thicker and more healthy.  </li>
            <li> Well, My tube ran out, and I didn&#x27;t order more so</li>
            <li> I saw a difference within a week or two but more towards my outer edge lashes.</li>
            <li> Some notable difference</li>
            <li> I have found if you hang in there 3 or 4 months you will not be able to question the results.</li>
            <li> It has given me a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> I bought the mascara also and love it.  </li>
            <li> It did seem to work a bit better for my brows.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> The best last growth product I have used!</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I seem to lose more eyelashes, more</li>
            <li> Make sure to apply close to the lash line.</li>
            <li> So, with that being said, I love this product.</li>
            <li> Professionals have told me that this is the best lash product and is the only one that can be worn with lash extensions.  </li>
            <li> If you stop using it for more than a 2 week period your lashes will start to fall out.  </li>
            <li> the better</li>
            <li> this helps :)</li>
            <li> I use Laura Mercier, MAC, etc.... mainstream products that most of us can use -</li>
            <li> I am a nurse in a dermatology practice and I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how many compliments I get on my lashes from patients.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love GrandeLASH MD</li>
            <li> so... it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I would buy more at this price.</li>
            <li> I love the enhancer</li>
            <li> AND I love the complimenting mascara.</li>
            <li> Rest assured, it&#x27;s totally safe and harmless.</li>
            <li> think many testimonials and before/</li>
            <li> In any case, advice for using Grandelash MD, be patient :)</li>
            <li> In any case, advice for using Grandelash MD, be patient :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to continue using it and watch them grow even more.</li>
            <li> Herd it worked, love it, doesent grow bald parts of eyebrows but deffinately grew, darkened,</li>
            <li> I am assuming that additional time will make a more noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Takes about 4 weeks to see the change, but then it just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered the correct GrandLash this time.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I never dreamed that I could have eyebrows and eyelashes that I would be able to see someday without lots of pencil and mascara...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the product from Amazon, but a spa and paid about $10 more.  </li>
            <li> had I taken better care of them by taking off my mascara before bed.</li>
            <li> and of course my mother has too, but no surprise there! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months, and my lashes look much better and longer.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Love the results.  </li>
            <li> I could not wear make-up after the surgery and after some time passed, my husband asked me not to bother with make-up any more.  </li>
            <li> After two months of use, my lashes were so cute.</li>
            <li> I personally love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> My sister used it and it was fantastic!  </li>
            <li> This really works great.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my grand las on may 9, and it&#x27;s not working.</li>
            <li> I was able to see results within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Oh and one more thing</li>
            <li> I purchased this from my reputable salon where I get my eyelash extensions done.</li>
            <li> I love my lash extensions and wanted to do everything to keep my lashes healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I even tried to tap out more liquid, but nothing.</li>
            <li> It is cute design package, and I am now using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t wear makeup every day any more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE AFTER ONE MONTH:  I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I never got SO many compliments on my eyes and my lashes as when I was using that product.</li>
            <li> So after using many different lash growth products on the market I can confidently say GrandeLash MD is the best (in my opinion).</li>
            <li> I discussed this product with him and he felt this would be okay.  </li>
            <li> and I love this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Patti</li>
            <li> Now my lashes are more than twice the length they have ever been.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed that it actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li> Not even done with it yet :-)</li>
            <li> Also, when I put my mascara on, it works MUCH better than before</li>
            <li> I got 2 more</li>
            <li> Works better for them anyway</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on this that it works</li>
            <li> My thinning lashes are now fuller and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is a staple for me now.</li>
            <li> Love it and will order again... :-)</li>
            <li> So glad I found this.</li>
            <li> Takes time for results but love the results.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE</li>
            <li> People ask me if I&#x27;m okay because the skin around my eyes turned reddish/dark.</li>
            <li> Ive used about 4 different eye lash serums and Li Lash and this one worked the best.</li>
            <li> my eyelashes were almost touching my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Works better than Latisse.</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to find it on the Internet.  </li>
            <li> Great, fast service.</li>
            <li> Both of my daughters love the product and you cannot believe the comments they both get.</li>
            <li> Great price, much cheaper than buying it at a Salon where it runs about $75.00 instead of the prices here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love grande lash</li>
            <li> I ordered Grandelash last week of January and after 4 days i received it. :D</li>
            <li> I applied it to my top and bottom</li>
            <li> cause it holds the curl better.</li>
            <li> I noticed more lashes and an increase in length after just one week.</li>
            <li> Within 3 or 4 weeks they were noticeably longer and more pronounced.  </li>
            <li> And see for yourself. : )</li>
            <li> but I was expecting to see  more of a difference.</li>
            <li> I went to Ultra to buy some powder and concealer when one of the make up artist&#x27;s asked if it was ok to put the product on.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately is more pronounced at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product;simply because it works.</li>
            <li> I made sure I took an antihistamine,I stopped rubbing my eyes,and I used a skin lightener under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product couple times by now, and I absolutely love how my lashes grow when I use it.</li>
            <li> I am sure that Latisse would work better and faster</li>
            <li> Love the stuff.  </li>
            <li> I shall keep on using this with the hopes it will be better.</li>
            <li> Do to all the itching, I&#x27;m sure my eyelashes are falling out even more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The mascara is ok but this product is what has made my lashes longer.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Works magic when partnered with the Grande Mascara, which I&#x27;ve been purchasing with it as a set.  </li>
            <li> love grandelash</li>
            <li> Love this product and will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> If I am going with light makeup or a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look, I don&#x27;t bother to fill them in because I don&#x27;t need to!  </li>
            <li> and I ordered some more.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes seem darker and fuller and I&#x27;m told that they&#x27;ll improve even more the longer</li>
            <li> fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice before and it works much better than Latisse for me.  </li>
            <li> I sure would like to be able to use it.</li>
            <li> and my lashes are longer for sure.  </li>
            <li> I have never been more satisfied .</li>
            <li> i went on line and bought 3 more for my cousin, my daughter and sister.</li>
            <li> but i wasn&#x27;t deterred and was sure i would see results soon.</li>
            <li> why would this &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; product bought at a salon work so much better than the 4 i bought on line??</li>
            <li> This product worked better that Latisse for me.  </li>
            <li> I use it every night before bed religiously with superb results.</li>
            <li> GrandeLASH MD is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff....</li>
            <li> I have been using Grand Lash for 2 years now</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it and it works.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes grew in better and they were longer.  </li>
            <li> my top lashes look like falsies with mascara.  </li>
            <li> have tried others but this is better (for me)</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Great product, it has really helped my eyelashes grow.  </li>
            <li> I love having a problem with my lashes touching the lenses of my sunglasses.</li>
            <li> Am so glad I tried this before I purchased the prescription product for twice the money.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Definitivament longer eyelashes and eyebrows more defined.</li>
            <li> but that may require more than a months time.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li> Mostly for length of lashes, but also increased density of eyebrows..</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> it mentioned in the package insert that those of us who are a bit more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; night get better results that way.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> Ive used rapid lash and feel this has given me better results.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It works better than I remember Lilash working.  </li>
            <li> The longer lashes make it worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> using it most days at night (after make up is removed)for 2 months now</li>
            <li> I experienced very mild irritation in my eyes on maybe two occasions during the first week and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Thanks beautiful product N easy to apply</li>
            <li> My friend uses once every day or every other day and is still happy and looking great after 10+ months using this product.</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!!!  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m 50, my lashes are medium brown, blondish tips, and look great with mascara, but I wanted them to look decent without mascara and also wanted to restore the number of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with it and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> A great value; highly recommend.</li>
            <li> so happy that my $35 is not a waste!!</li>
            <li> I normally would not use a product with these ingredients as well; however, I&#x27;m so happy with the results, I disregarded the health concerns.  </li>
            <li> And at first I loved it.</li>
            <li> Went from nubs to long and beautiful lashes!</li>
            <li> I had noticed my best friends lashes were really long one day, seeming overnight.</li>
            <li> They are long and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I bought my first GrandeLASH from a high end salon and it worked wonderfully!  </li>
            <li> I am so excited!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using it for 3 plus month and the result is fantastic on the eyelashes and eyebrows, better than latisse for sure</li>
            <li> Castor oil is also a good, natural option but won&#x27;t grow lashes quick enough...for those who want faster results this serum is good.</li>
            <li> I loved Smart Lash</li>
            <li> Light pinky mostly after applying product.</li>
            <li> sure your eyes are makeup free before applying.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell it works great</li>
            <li> I did not purchase the grand lash mascara- just using whatever I have always used with fantastic</li>
            <li> However they suggested using grande lash to keep my lashes from becoming brittle and damaged.</li>
            <li> they look fabulous, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was worried that my lashes were going to look &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34; but everything has been great and natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could get a referral fee or even a free tube for referring so many friends here to buy it.  </li>
            <li> (I guess because they were becoming longer) and</li>
            <li> my friend had INCREDIBLE lashes all of a sudden &amp;</li>
            <li> This works fantastic and i have used Revitalash before for a lot more money.  </li>
            <li> was using the serum night and morning and was really seeing good results, but when I re-ordered the serum I decided to use the mascara and liner as well.</li>
            <li> Good product , fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Had bought this at a Salon for 75.00 and loved it, it really works if you don&#x27;t have a reaction from it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 months now and I can really see the difference longer fuller lashes, I will continue using product for maintenance good bye latissa.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good quality</li>
            <li> This product works very well and really creates longer more beautiful lashes.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!  </li>
            <li> After 3 agonizing days, I went to the eye doctor, who said this stuff is full of acids!</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and I noticed results within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> and I received the product very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> so it was easy to apply along my eyelash line.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I&#x27;m fully satisfied, just few weeks I&#x27;ve been using this product, I can see the difference.</li>
            <li> Grandlash MD is so easy to use</li>
            <li> Does cause some skin irritation at application site that is easily covered with make up and does improve with time.</li>
            <li> I wear it at night because it caused very mild irritation.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Make sure that your lashes are clean.  </li>
            <li> I take off my makeup with coconut oil, wash my face, and then use a Q-tip to make sure my lashline is clean before applying Grandelash.  </li>
            <li> now I can easily apply each application under 3 seconds per eye with one swoop.</li>
            <li> easy to use and worked within a week</li>
            <li> I had noticeable results very quickly.</li>
            <li> I saved alittle money from not buying in my salon but this seemed not to be quite as strong.</li>
            <li> This product is effective, in one week I could tell that my eyelashes were growing, after a month they look great, but I have notice that I don&#x27;t have more, maybe a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I could be a poster child for Grande Lash MD, it is an amazing product that REALLY works!</li>
            <li> almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a great experience with the original product and will purchase directly through them.</li>
            <li> but no complaint here BC longer is good for me</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get a good nights sleep and see if I wake up looking &#x27;normal&#x27;</li>
            <li> They are so healthy and full and with a curler and mascara</li>
            <li> They are now softer, longer and more full.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best eyelash conditioner I have used.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product because hands down it is the best product for lash growth.</li>
            <li> So I thought, huh, must be fine.  </li>
            <li> i would test on skin first but for me it works great no irritation and in 3 weeks my lashes are much longer.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Grande lash seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I was using Latisse for over two years and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be fine</li>
            <li> but I do feel more feminine with a bit more lash;)  </li>
            <li> I received the product just fine.</li>
            <li> and have used this for them as well, and they are already thickening quickly!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are much longer and fuller, they are also more curved now and darker!</li>
            <li> Thanks for my lovely lashes!  </li>
            <li> but I refused to let it mess with my best feature, my eyes!  </li>
            <li> My lashes are now super long n super sexy!!!!</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in the length and thickness of my lashes.</li>
            <li> , I used it every night and sometimes in the morning for about two months and noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> &amp; I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference  around month 2 to 3.  </li>
            <li> Noticed huge difference in length after 12 weeks.</li>
            <li> did go to the Grandelash website and they show a tube with the wording that she says is the genuine stuff</li>
            <li> I ordered this after using another well know lash serum because it has such great reviews.</li>
            <li> Symptoms include burning, pain, light sensitivity, redness and $210 in doctor visits, prescriptions, and time off work.</li>
            <li> BOTH extremely cheap.</li>
            <li> SO now depends On what ur comfortable spending.  </li>
            <li> Takes about 3 weeks and you will see fantastic results.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to purchase this product at a spa &amp; esthetics trade show in May.  </li>
            <li> I applied a light coat to my lashes.</li>
            <li> I now only apply once in the evening - great product.</li>
            <li> Great product just have to be patient - I&#x27;ve noticed a change after the fourth week.  </li>
            <li> They only time I experienced and discomfort from this product</li>
            <li> The color of my brows did not change, but they filled in quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I still darken them a bit with brow liner because they are so light, but I am no longer drawing on my face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a lot of extra volume, but the length is great.</li>
            <li> opted for using a more natural method, now I just put some vaseline in my eyelashes and eyebrows before going to bed, and avoided plucking them for a while - and they look much much better :)</li>
            <li> Once it starts working it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> I did research on grande lash and some reviews were fabulous and others not.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I used this product last year and had great results.</li>
            <li> This one was recommended, and although it did take a few weeks to see results, I am very happy with the length and fullness of my lashes, and with no reaction!</li>
            <li> + FREE Bonuses]]</li>
            <li> But I like that it glides on smoothly and is at night.</li>
            <li> I had spots on my lash line where the lashes were sparser on one eye that are now all filled in.</li>
            <li> love those remarks--puts a smile on my face</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months now and it works great.</li>
            <li> If my lashes weren&#x27;t so light colored</li>
            <li> Compared to Latisse it is dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> and then Revitalash and Lilash - all of which worked, all of which are no longer available.  </li>
            <li> this is important as I use alot of organic and plant based ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have turned my mother, sister, and friends onto this product and they all have seen fantastic results as well!!!ate your eyes.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are longer and brows are filled in where sparse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this product from a local distributor and it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth paying $10 more.</li>
            <li> So, I went ahead and used it on my upper and lower lashes and had great results there as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to buy a product that actually does what it says its going to do.  </li>
            <li> I question if the product that I received was the genuine product.  </li>
            <li> I was just happy to have lashes back.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> But the complete process took a good 4 months.</li>
            <li> my lashes did grow long and beautiful</li>
            <li> GrandeLash by far is superior.</li>
            <li> So far so good even though I won&#x27;t see results yet</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> I started using Grandelash and am so impressed by how much longer my lashes are in just only a month.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Now long and beautiful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if I should&#x27;ve bought this product directly from their own website, as it states on the Grandelashmd.com website, that not all products sold online are authentic, and that there are counterfeit retailers selling this on Amazon, eBay and Groupon.  </li>
            <li> My right eyelashes started to curl up more</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> It really works!!!  </li>
            <li> It works exactly like Latisse, but it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost of Latisse!!  </li>
            <li> Really works!!!</li>
            <li> It really works!!!</li>
            <li> I tried it the first tube worked!!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT !!!!</li>
            <li> Stuff really works!!!</li>
            <li> Trust me, it really works!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> this would be the second time i purchase this product very effective</li>
            <li> I do not wear make-up, so the application is easy and quick.  </li>
            <li> Amazon makes ordering easy, and ships quickly.</li>
            <li> With this product eyelashes grow super long and beautiful</li>
            <li> and I already have significantly longer lashes.</li>
            <li> It has enhanced my eyelashes and brows significantly.  </li>
            <li> Was worth the money!</li>
            <li> BUT in 3 weeks my lashes grew significantly.</li>
            <li> I just ordered another bottle even though I am not out of the original and another for my friend for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Significantly thickened and lengthen my lashes.</li>
            <li> I have used it on both eyes first, and found out I am losing way to many eyelashes on my eyes.</li>
            <li> But still saw a hugely significant difference.</li>
            <li> For the first month I applied A LOT every night, to the top lash and bottom.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure that will work for maintenance.  </li>
            <li> When I first got the curler my eyelashes rested just below the top of the curler.  </li>
            <li> Excited my expectations.</li>
            <li> First month I used it just at night but for most days now I use it in the am as well.</li>
            <li> It looks like there is a significant increase in blood supply to the area that accounts for the pinkish hue.  </li>
            <li> Also, I am an Esthetician/Makeup Artist and I recommend this product to all of my clients who are trying to achieve significant lash growth results without a prescription product.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Incredible stuff, and so much more cost effective and gratifying than the fake ones.</li>
            <li> Give it a couple of weeks to show any significant growth, and try using it morning and evening for maximum effect.  </li>
            <li> :) really works!..</li>
            <li> i originally bought this product from a salon per a friends recommendation.</li>
            <li> It did take about 3 months for the maximum effect, but it was so worth it!  </li>
            <li> This works so well and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My tube is the GrandeLASH MD original.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Lilash which worked great, but Grandelash works even better and is a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I had been more diligent and used it twice daily for a full month I would have seen better results.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my eyelashes now, and how long they are!</li>
            <li> thought I&#x27;d try this for a change but STEER clear,  now if you want blood red eyes for a Halloween costume, then this product is perfect.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I don&#x27;t thoroughly clean them off before applying it.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth the buy, and the price is awesome when compared to other products on the market right now.</li>
            <li> Completely recommended this magic tube!</li>
            <li> My husband asked me if I was wearing fake lashes-in a good way;) -they look so good!!!</li>
            <li> This clear liquid that I apply every night is simply magic!</li>
            <li> My friend used it and her lashes look gorgeous- long and full!</li>
            <li> But most do not have a timeframe for results and therefore aren&#x27;t very realistic in the expectations of what Grandelash MD will provide.</li>
            <li> I will most certainly be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> nothing special...</li>
            <li> I love it and can certainly see the difference when I use it.</li>
            <li> and they checked amazon and bought it right away!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and expected great results.</li>
            <li> and my eyelids are bright red and tender!  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it after 5 months and my own lashes still look healthy and long.</li>
            <li> my lashes look wonderful, they are so long and lush.</li>
            <li> I have pretty good lashes for some one 60 years old..</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; on Amazon?</li>
            <li> I went and Bought 6 more FOR MUCH MUCH cheaper</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually true though.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, GrandeLASH works much quicker and my end results seem to be much better than while using Latisse.  </li>
            <li> but my top and bottom lashes have grown so much.. also using for my brows..</li>
            <li> The brows got so full</li>
            <li> they would except my return and issue a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ll start off by saying this really does make your eyelashes longer.</li>
            <li> Much better than a prescription that I paid 2x as much for.</li>
            <li> My lashes are much longer then I ever had and I have more lashes than I ever had.</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments on my lashes, even a couple people who asked if they were real.  </li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of this type of product and none of them worked.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Grande Lash and within weeks I had full lashes again.  </li>
            <li> and now they are full.  </li>
            <li> The instruction states that the full results shows if you continue using it for a month.</li>
            <li> My natural lashes are nice, but there is a reason I went for the lash extensions.</li>
            <li> Also, the product took almost the full time to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> Many thanks.</li>
            <li> My lashes look full and lustrous since I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li> If you want to condition you lashes use castor oil, sweet almond oil, or olive oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it took 2 months of nightly use, but it really works.</li>
            <li> cannot say enough good things about this product</li>
            <li> but my bottom grew also - so much so that my bottom look like they should be my top lashes and</li>
            <li> and my eyebrows are full</li>
            <li> I am excited about and very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I used GrandeLASHfor about 4 weeks when I could honestly say I saw a major difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I only saw some improvement after the first month or so, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was just imagining things.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 months now and I am in love with my new eyelashes and eyebrows!</li>
            <li> First night was fine.</li>
            <li> It happened so quickly.  </li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will and quickly.  </li>
            <li> Shipping came quickly also..</li>
            <li> Made a tremendous difference.  </li>
            <li> Came quick and I can&#x27;t comment on the product I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping, would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> But that cleared up quickly</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my eyes in any way and it soaks in quickly</li>
            <li> Grew quickly.</li>
            <li> My lashes were adequate before, but</li>
            <li> I am lucky to get it applied every night.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work quickly too.</li>
            <li> but it goes away relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> She bought me my first tube and within 1 month, I could see a huge difference in the length and thickness of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> This has proven to be much more effective that Latisse or any other product I have</li>
            <li> Worked great at first, lashes really got noticeably longer, but then after using for a year or more they went back to normal and the stuff really has no effect any more</li>
            <li> But having said that, this is a terrific, cost-conscious alternative that works nearly as well, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and has given me some gorgeous lashes!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need much in the way of eye makeup for day wear, and in the evening they are flat out glam when worn with a great cateye liner.  </li>
            <li> I tried extensions at a salon last year and honestly, this is a better look, much cheaper</li>
            <li> I LOVED how long my eyelashes got.</li>
            <li> I was a long time user of Lilash which I loved but at $150 a pop</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to make my lashes much fuller, but the length has definitely increased and with the right mascara, my lashes look great.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t follow it on a daily basis due to very mild irritation..but very nice results!</li>
            <li> Well, it took a good 2 months, but now my brows are MUCH darker and the thin spots are somewhat filled in!!!  </li>
            <li> This product is better than more expensive enhancers that I have tried and is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sure that this itchy reaction will happen to many other customers who might be interested in buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I LOVE grande lash and have used it for months, but just purchased a new bottle from CH Cycles</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like the existing ones have grown and been curled, so I&#x27;m going to see if it seems like any new ones are joining the party.</li>
            <li> I have experienced slight burning</li>
            <li> Was happy to find it on Amazon for less money.</li>
            <li> amazing,actually works, i basically never had lashes,well almost none,-the joy of being a caucasion,this works after 4 weeks, after using now for less than 3 months</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I have eyelashes that actually look good.  </li>
            <li> They are almost now the length they were before I lost them so long story short.. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my 2nd tube because I loved it so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking the first week of use!</li>
            <li> This REALLY works!!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend !!!</li>
            <li> I have noticeable eyelashes for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for exactly 3 weeks and now see the results!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!  </li>
            <li> Test use first!</li>
            <li> I really had to stop using it as often because my eyelashes were hitting my sunglasses!!  </li>
            <li> It does exactly as advertised!  </li>
            <li> this is the real one!!</li>
            <li> It arrived fast!!</li>
            <li> The difference was significant but she told me you had to consistent using it</li>
            <li> I say that I will be back for more?!</li>
            <li> , I took a before pic and a 4 week pic, and my lashes are not only longer, but have come in fuller and more volumous as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just purchased my second tube, and I&#x27;ve been really, really pleased!</li>
            <li> Ive bought this product before directly from the distriutor at a trade show in new york and loved the product.</li>
            <li> Luckily Amazon was kind enough to let me return even though I opened it.</li>
            <li> I saw a major difference very quickly!</li>
            <li> i have used a couple of others lash enhancer products, (one good, the other not so good) but was taken by the positive feedback and low</li>
            <li> I could NOT believe how amazing my eyelashes were after only 30 days.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the enhancer everyday until the lashes are the length I&#x27;m happy with.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how longer, darker lashes can make one look younger.  </li>
            <li> Within three to five days I could really tell a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Amazing results... would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wishing you much success.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Worth the price</li>
            <li> and I rarely use it.  </li>
            <li> I love that it does what it says it does, but my eyes do get watery and sensitive.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> apply it mostly at night and frequently in the morning.</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer, curling on their own, and it seems like they are finally starting to darken.</li>
            <li> But it was well worth it</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> After doing some research on eyelash conditioners and growth serums, I finally came across Grandelash as a cheaper and well-rated alternative to Latisse, and a safer and more financially secure alternative of purchasing careprost with an online check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I so happened to have an allergy with this product which happens sometimes , the seller could have just answer me in a professional way for me to be satisfied with my concern .</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what makes this product worth the price...</li>
            <li> I am NOT really great about remembering to use it like I should, and it still has been GREAT !!!  </li>
            <li> I only use this once a week and am loving the results. 😀</li>
            <li> I am not THAT sensitive, so I can&#x27;t understand why there are not a LOT more reviews saying that this product is causing a lot of burning, redness and irritation.  </li>
            <li> it worked even better on my 21 year old daughter, and faster results.</li>
            <li> I started with the serum only for a month and liked the results, so I added the makeup as well to see what would happen.  </li>
            <li> Takes about a month to see results but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear mascara anymore.</li>
            <li> This is so worth the money.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just a fun thing to do a couple of times a year</li>
            <li> It takes a couple of months but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Second night I woke up to burning stinging eyes and my eyelash extensions where falling out in clumps along with my own eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Not only did my extensions fall out but my own lashes fell out as well.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> My eyelids were slightly red and sensitive at the beginning, but once I got over that it has been great.</li>
            <li> Although it does still cause some redness to the skin around my eyes, I feel that it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> I think this product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but it is worth a try</li>
            <li> I actually have to wax my brows to tidy things up -</li>
            <li> It is worth the money - got plenty of compliments on eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I tried it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> well worth it.</li>
            <li> I think, though, when the bottle gets low, the product is not as effective, so I&#x27;m replacing.</li>
            <li> I decided to stop use as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Lost most of my natural lashes from years of extensions.  </li>
            <li> Takes about 6-8 weeks to see results but definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It took about 3 months to see a difference, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It actually thickened my lashed more and got a fantastic length</li>
            <li> Best of all, when I do use a curler and mascara, people have asked if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff - my friends thought I was wearing false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I have used Latisse since 2012 and have found this product more effective in less time!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it very much, and she used it every single day.  </li>
            <li> (By the way, she has tried several other products, and she likes this one best.)</li>
            <li> One of the few products I&#x27;ve ever written a review on but felt like i needed to because I LOVE this!!</li>
            <li> Now I use it every few nights and I love my lashes!!</li>
            <li> You will see results after a few weeks of use... love this product!!</li>
            <li> wats more important is if my lashes grown,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on my first or two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to do an update on the growth of my eyelashes in the next couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I had been using Librow and LOVED it, but tried switching to this due to my salon&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li> you can use it every OTHER day and still keep your good results, but, DON&#x27;T RUN OUT OF IT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My lashes are so long I&#x27;m going to have to trim them because they are touching my eyeglasses!</li>
            <li> right around 27, they started falling out.</li>
            <li> every morning I would look in the mirror hoping to see a change right around 5 weeks</li>
            <li> I have continued to use it on just one eye and used it on the corner of my right eye.</li>
            <li> I apply right at the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (right on my lash line).</li>
            <li> Right now (into my sixth week)</li>
            <li> on right before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> Apply it carefully right on the lash line after cleansing the face at night.</li>
            <li> I used this product maybe for two years right now,only 1-2 times per month,just keep up with my eeyelashes.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see right for 4 days until the serum wore out of my</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product (and the reasonable price compared to others similar products) and have purchased twice now.</li>
            <li> But after the first three weeks the lashes started to rapidly grow back at an amazing rate and after a month the gap is no longer noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have always had nice thick and long lashes, but as I got older they weren&#x27;t as impressive.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows had gotten so sparse and light, and that&#x27;s the main reason I got</li>
            <li> Mascara definitely feels heavier on my eyes but that is not a bad problem to have :)</li>
            <li> Every single day, everywhere I go, people are constantly asking me if my lashes are real because they are so beautiful!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re consistent, this stuff really works!!  </li>
            <li> Bluured vision and high sensitivity to light.</li>
            <li> I think it works better then Latisse and cost less and has more to use.</li>
            <li> My lashes aren&#x27;t as full as they used to be and when I&#x27;m stressed, whole sections of my lashes will fall out.</li>
            <li> It really does work...just be consistant and use it for the full three months.</li>
            <li> This eyelash enhancer is amazing, eye lashes have grown back and are long and strong!</li>
            <li> I am not a skeptic, but like most people (probably yourself included), I have purchased numerous products with their bold and blaring claims to do wonderful things for you only to eventually toss them (or the remainder of them) in the trash and chalk it up to another learned lesson and waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;NOT</li>
            <li> I notice new pretty lashes every day that look gorgeous with even a tiny bit of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more expenisve on their main site which is why I was trying a new product.</li>
            <li> in a relativly short period of time I have noticed much longer lashes that look amazing when I put on mascara.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it for a few years now and more than 10 of my friends/colleagues are now using it and love it as well.</li>
            <li> This product is okay doesn&#x27;t work as well as Lilash, worth spending the extra money.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon for this product is very reasonable with no shipping charge.</li>
            <li> Now I only fill in my brows if I&#x27;m rocking a full-on made up look, and I have to be very light handed</li>
            <li> Now I use it every other day and so far my lashes still look great.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because the price was reasonable and it&#x27;s got pretty good consumer review from other site.</li>
            <li> My lashes have thickened a little, but the results are not as good as the Le Lash product for me.</li>
            <li> I checked ingredients against my real tube and the first ingredient of this is Deonized Water!  </li>
            <li> aslo noticed that the fine hair on my face around my eyes (which normally isn&#x27;t visable)grew as well.(I had to be really close to the mirror to see it.)</li>
            <li> About a month ago a lady stopped me in the store and was pretty amazed and a little animated about how good they looked.  </li>
            <li> far as my lashes are concerned, this product made a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I try to be consistent by using it every night or every morning...</li>
            <li> I get compliments almost daily and have purchased 3 tubes for friends and family and am buying 2 more tubes today.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic but this product really works!</li>
            <li> this was my first purchase of something Like this.</li>
            <li> Except when something really work&#x27;s is when I WILL write one!</li>
            <li> For the first week or two I could not use it twice a day on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> + my eyelashes are much fuller!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many from the drug stores, and found they all fell short.</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> it really does work!</li>
            <li> I first heard about it from the Salon</li>
            <li> My eyelashes really growing  now !</li>
            <li> Both upper and lower have more length.  </li>
            <li> It is now the beginning of August and my first tube is out.</li>
            <li> but for now, I&#x27;m definitely ordering more of the GrandeLASH MD Enhancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, with continued use - twice a day consistently - the irritation lessened.  </li>
            <li> I first noticed my friends eyelashes and thought I&#x27;d give this a try myself.  </li>
            <li> others have mentioned at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been asked if these are my real eyelashes!  </li>
            <li> I used it twice a day at first and didn&#x27;t think it was working at all until after about 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> and they are not getting better and are constantly watering.</li>
            <li> I did exactly what it said to do</li>
            <li> I initially bought this to put on my brows to help re-growth but started putting on my top lash line</li>
            <li> Just be sure not to use it until you are going to bed because if you open your eyes with this stuff on your lashes, it will sting until you wash it out.</li>
            <li> The first day, I applied it on at night.  </li>
            <li> The product does NOT last more than 2 months).</li>
            <li> The product does NOT last more than 2 months).</li>
            <li> Hope to find out that the results will begin to be evident soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you start out, you have to apply this morning and night to mimic the dosage in latisse (probably for the first 6 weeks).  </li>
            <li> I would recommend applying this every night until the first tube runs out.</li>
            <li> and it makes them even longer dramatically and thicker, plus more lashes overall.</li>
            <li> Thanks Grande Lash!</li>
            <li> first month I applied once per day just like my eyeliner</li>
            <li> I first tried this product at the suggestion of my waxer a year ago.</li>
            <li> Every female needs this product - it will make your eyes look absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li> Since I have blonde lashes, I still wear a lot of mascara, but I love looking at them and feel like they give me an awake</li>
            <li> It starts working about two weeks, first your lash line might be irritated but skip a night then continue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this type of product that worked so fast!</li>
            <li> Lashes got longer first and then darker after 8 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I used it 2x per day the first three weeks, and then switched to every night.  </li>
            <li> I love not having to wear  Mascara on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> BUT GrandeLASH has me ready to toss out the falsies!</li>
            <li> I will be going back to Librow for sure.</li>
            <li> I started using this product once a day and at first I did feel my eyelids itchy, but just where the liquid had been placed.  </li>
            <li> I waited until the redness went away, then tried it again to make sure the product was making my eyes red.  </li>
            <li> This took about 3 months of nightly use before I saw results but it really works!</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s been about a month and a week since I started my first treatment</li>
            <li> This product REALLY WORKS!  </li>
            <li> I saw results within the first week at two applications a day.</li>
            <li> Of course, it works faster and more effectively on younger people - under 30.</li>
            <li> really does work!</li>
            <li> For the first 2-3 weeks I thought I had bought a product that did not work.  </li>
            <li> Every night, I would dip the brush in only one time to spread across the top of both eyelids.</li>
            <li> This stuff has worked very well!  </li>
            <li> Put it on lightly like eyeliner and you will have no trouble.</li>
            <li> Will assume an allergic reaction, but regardless, I had to throw it away and will see a dermatologist for a more medically approved version of this item.</li>
            <li> I have blonde normally; I love not having to wear mascara.</li>
            <li> It really worked on my eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Really works!  </li>
            <li> starting to notice longer lashes :)</li>
            <li> OK, so I actually bought this product almost a year ago.</li>
            <li> I was OK filling in my brows with powder or pencil, but my lashes were getting more and more difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> Mine were touching the middle of my eyebrows</li>
            <li> I stopped using this more than a year ago and the red marks on my eyelids are still there!</li>
            <li> Not only did they grow longer, but they seemed to fill in more and looked thicker.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to stick it out</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> This stuff really does grow your lashes!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works...really!  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted for about 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Now my lashes rest just above the top of the curler.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased this at my hair salon, for a much higher price, and used as directed once a day, in the morning.  </li>
            <li> product really works!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> These products have really made a difference!</li>
            <li> This is NOT the real Grande Lash!  </li>
            <li> Today is the first day I&#x27;ve tried to use mascara</li>
            <li> and it burned my eyes alittle to much!</li>
            <li> I had more when I was younger and, as my mother likes to remind me</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t exactly walk around looking like a stoned vampire.</li>
            <li> Exactly as indicated.</li>
            <li> I just ordered several more containers because others who have noticed the difference want to try it as well.</li>
            <li> Be patient though - keep it up every night for the first 3 months -</li>
            <li> I started using this product consistently about 5 weeks ago and both my friends</li>
            <li> I reddened eyes, burst blood vessels on the first day of use.</li>
            <li> it really works!</li>
            <li> Well, I am here to say that I am pleasantly pleased and on my second bottle!</li>
            <li> I had just had a fill but waited 4 days to use Grande Lash and followed the exact instructions.</li>
            <li> Works exactly like it says, but you do have to apply it twice a day.</li>
            <li> If you are consistent with the applications; your lashes will grow.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever written a review here</li>
            <li> The first couple of days when I started using it</li>
            <li> just rubbing the brush along my lash line, so it gets both top and bottom at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I am a bit of a product junkie so after my first tube of GrandeLash MD ran out I switched to a cheaper lash growth product on the market.</li>
            <li> Have really noticed a difference in My  lashes, so have everyone else!</li>
            <li> I sure wish integrate would come back!!</li>
            <li> For those who had eye redness,  I had that my first day...</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much!)</li>
            <li> Your eyelashes will get longer first before they get thicker.</li>
            <li> people are asking if they really are my eyelashes!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before applying it, I took a picture of my lashes first.</li>
            <li> the first week, I noticed my eyelashes getting darker and fuller but the length is still the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really works!</li>
            <li> more sparse lashes that I was left with.</li>
            <li> but I exspected more, the length stayed the same.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was make up (since I started wearing mascara again).</li>
            <li> I used it every night for the first three months, and now I&#x27;m using it twice a week to maintain the results.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Although my eyelashes are longer, the tips are still bleached out (most likely from the sun)</li>
            <li> I have used many eyelash serums over the years and this one definitely works!  </li>
            <li> I used Jan Marini when she first came out</li>
            <li> After 3 months I can really see the results!</li>
            <li> My lashes are much longer!</li>
            <li> I am interested in ordering this product.  </li>
            <li> Is anyone willing to put them on here via a review.</li>
            <li> have allergies and need to know the exact contents before I order.</li>
            <li> Together they give me bombshell lashes that are so stellar</li>
            <li> I dont need to use m&amp;aacute;scara much!</li>
            <li> My first review is below -</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer and starting to become more fuller.</li>
            <li> I must say I was a skeptic at first because of the price, but the pictures convinced me to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought I was imaging it...</li>
            <li> After washing my face I first apply my night cream</li>
            <li> Most definitely will buy again and again...</li>
            <li> I purchased this first at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I used the product twice a day (for the first month).  </li>
            <li> #34;POP&amp;#34; which is exactly what I had hoped for and the fact that there is the lengthening serum in the mascara</li>
            <li> Grande Lash MD really works!</li>
            <li> It takes about a month of consistent use to see any results.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I will say that the first couple weeks of using this product SEVERELY irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> first started using this product in July--it is now October.</li>
            <li> My lashes are much longer, darker and stronger!</li>
            <li> I never had that happen with the first one.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> the first 2or 3 days.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes were touching ABOVE my eye brows!!!!</li>
            <li> You have to use it consistently.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally puny and light coloured lashes.</li>
            <li> There was a bit of irritation for the first two weeks</li>
            <li> This was also a much better price than what I paid at my local hair salon!  </li>
            <li> purchased my first tube from Amazon</li>
            <li> So, exactly 6 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen good results in my eyelashes just in a few months</li>
            <li> A few coats of mascara, and I&#x27;m good.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are long and full!!</li>
            <li> The other thing I wish I could change (and I&#x27;m sure this is not very common) is that the corner lashes on the top are almost TOO curly, so now when I put on mascara</li>
            <li> Since I rely on product reviews so much before purchasing most items I thought it was only right to write a review myself.  </li>
            <li> very much differed from those with positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately I was smart enough to discontinue using this hazardous product after only 2 applications.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just the length (other serums deliver length), but it&#x27;s the fullness that is so amazing.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited about results so far.</li>
            <li> I feel very good about where my lashes are right now and look forward to the next few weeks!)</li>
            <li> one thing do, one of my aunts stopped using the GrandeLASH and her eyelashes went back to their original size!</li>
            <li> this product takes time to see results though if you are older so be patient but it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> and I think that it took longer to work than a younger person, but after a good 3 months it actually made a difference.  </li>
            <li> Reordered and it didn&#x27;t seem to last nearly 3 months and didn&#x27;t seem as effective.</li>
            <li> You have to perservere through the first 21 days but after that, you certainly notice a difference in the length and thickness.</li>
            <li> My upper and lower lashes are long, full and fabulous!!</li>
            <li> My sister gave this to me as a gift and with all the positive feedback I&#x27;ve decided to continue ordering.</li>
            <li> I honestly never post reviews, but this eyelash serum is beyond amazing!</li>
            <li> I have huge gaps from loss of lashes a and can barely use mascara.</li>
            <li> i am 28 years old and started using this product once in the morning and once at night for about 2 months and my lashes grew so long they were touching the lids of my eyes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many comments about how long my lashes are and was even asked if I got extensions.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of lash enhancers and this one a long with Li Lash</li>
            <li> It actually didn&#x27;t burn my eyes or irritate my skin at all as other reviewers experienced.</li>
            <li> I have had so many compliments on my lashes being so long and have recommended this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d ask my sisters and they didn&#x27;t see much of a change at first.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for quite some time and get more compliments on my long lashes.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on how long my lashes are.</li>
            <li> Results were pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I am happy enough to buy this product again, even though I have to say that I have no experience with other lash enhancers.</li>
            <li> You pretty much have to use it forever.</li>
            <li> This was the first one I tried and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I used Latisse and loved the results but got fed up with always having irritated eyelids.</li>
            <li> My brows look dark and are filling in SO nicely</li>
            <li> I used it in the past and had good results</li>
            <li> I have quit using it and ordered my old tried and true Revialash.</li>
            <li> I had recently gotten single eyelash extensions, I loved them the first time and decided to get then again.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, not a lot of waiting, which is nice.</li>
            <li> They are not quite as long as when I used Latisse, but I&#x27;m really hoping that if I keep using it, I will see more growth.</li>
            <li> But well, I think if you want to maintained your eyelashes long and thick you&#x27;ll just have to keep buying the product and stay happy with how it works!</li>
            <li> I had pulled out a large section of my eyelashes with a defective eyelash curler and the gap</li>
            <li> I now use Smart Lash.</li>
            <li> However, after those first few weeks I suddenly noticed results - and what great results.  </li>
            <li> I used to use revitalash and this is as similar, great results and half the cost.</li>
            <li> As an aside, when I purchased the product it was also half the price it is now making it more economical than Revitalash.  </li>
            <li> But after the first day I apply I become slightly excited about the future result.</li>
            <li> Must confess to waking up with red eyes most mornings, but it always goes away quickly after simply splashing some water in my face.</li>
            <li> One of my high school students told me today that I have pretty lashes.</li>
            <li> but now I have thicker eyelashes which is a huge blessing for Asian eyes.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> I still use mascara to really show them up</li>
            <li> I will buy another tube very soon.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and don&#x27;t really notice any changes in eyelash length and volume.</li>
            <li> Actually VERY costly.</li>
            <li> Almost FREE actually.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d really working</li>
            <li> It really does do what it says...</li>
            <li> This product really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks , grande lash</li>
            <li> It really does work.  </li>
            <li> No irritating side effects and works just as described-</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> The second time around didn&#x27;t go so smoothly.</li>
            <li> It really worked on me.</li>
            <li> I used morning and night and saw FAST results.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like they were breaking off, and my eye lides were really itchy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants longer, fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> it really works.</li>
            <li> I use it on my brows as well and can see a real difference.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> I was terrified to lose my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;-2 months of using it:(I used this product for 2 whole months</li>
            <li> I was terrified to lose my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;-2 months of using it:(I used this product for 2 whole months</li>
            <li> but it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> GrandeLash MD really does work.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me but has been working really well for my sister.</li>
            <li> , it worked and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> After about two weeks I could really notice a difference in the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li> It really helped the bald spot grow back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another tip is to apply it very close to the lash line/root of ur lashes so it will reduce the blotchy appearance etc</li>
            <li> So they didn&#x27;t get darker but with mascara they really really stand out.</li>
            <li> I really think they change the formula from the version sold in pricey salons.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really thickens my eyelashes and eyebrows after a week.</li>
            <li> and I believe it really has made my eyelashes grow longer.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t as fast</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even curl my lashes anymore, because then they&#x27;re just too much.</li>
            <li> As mine were quite skimpy, it took 2-3 months, with twice a day applications, to see real change.  </li>
            <li> I have very fin hair, so maybe that&#x27;s the problem.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> It takes about three to four weeks to see a real difference, but</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Grande Lash.</li>
            <li> Much better then what I had expected.</li>
            <li> I really like Grande lash.</li>
            <li> and I was amazed at how much my lashes grew.</li>
            <li> My take on this Because it really works.</li>
            <li> they have really grown thank grandelash</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Just made a month, waiting a bit longer to see real results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> I am a hair salon owner and bought this product through the distributor not from amazon, but regardless the results were really more than I expected.</li>
            <li> Thanks Barbara Rochester</li>
            <li> This product does burn my eyes if I put too much on.</li>
            <li> Also, I received this product in record time, fastest shipping ever for standard shipping, (which was free, I might add).</li>
            <li> so I thought I had really found a reliable source.  </li>
            <li> I have tried at least 3 or 4 different eyelash enhancers; this is by far the best!!</li>
            <li> I have to say it really works.</li>
            <li> None of these type of products have really worked for me, so that&#x27;s not to say it won&#x27;t work for someone else.</li>
            <li> Made them sooo much longer and a heck of a lot stronger.</li>
            <li> But... during that time I also noticed some intense, unwanted side effects.</li>
            <li> lashes are much longer, although not any thicker.</li>
            <li> Once I added the liner and the mascara to the serum, the results really amped up.  </li>
            <li> Both my lashes and my brows have become more sparse as I&#x27;ve aged, and that&#x27;s been a struggle for me.</li>
            <li> Every day I&#x27;m asked if my lashes are real.</li>
            <li> Not as much as lashes)</li>
            <li> so much I purchased two tubes and it still was cheaper than one Latisse.</li>
            <li> GrandeLASH! I highly recommend it too!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product really does work.</li>
            <li> Used the product at night for 5 days straight.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> I was really hopeful to find an alternative to Latisse.  </li>
            <li> This produce resulted in minimal growth - yes I followed instructions to the letter - and to top it off when I stopped my lashes</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> This really works,  thank you for your very prompt shipment too</li>
            <li> This product really does work</li>
            <li> A real difference.</li>
            <li> Eyebrows are much thicker and growing in around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really did not need thicker lashes</li>
            <li> I get asked if they are my real lashes all the time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Grande Lash MD since September 2013 and my eyelashes have grown so much.</li>
            <li> Thanks for giving me the opportunity to buy it on Amazon</li>
            <li> They do not get &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; as much as they get &amp;#34;length&amp;#34; (just FYI)</li>
            <li> I did not notice them getting much thicker</li>
            <li> Can really notice with mascara.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> and it really shows.  </li>
            <li> This eyelash enhancer really works.</li>
            <li> Love this product and will continue to purchase it as it has helped give me long full eyelashes after losing some of my eyelashes after getting an eye lash extension - this product has restored my lashes and made them thicker and fuller - I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments without even using mascara.</li>
            <li> My lashes are much thicker snd longer after two months of use.</li>
            <li> My brows have always been uneven--with one being really sparse--and I have seen them even up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice that as much.</li>
            <li> Works very well, after 2weeks</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> On my eyebrows though I don&#x27;t see as much difference yet.</li>
            <li> It takes usally 3 weeks to really see the difference, but your eyelashes really grow.  </li>
            <li> this product really works, all my friends noticed after about 6 weeks .My</li>
            <li> This really does work,  </li>
            <li> after six weeks I have much longer lashes,  I don&#x27;t think they are thicker</li>
            <li> I now use it once a day and my lashes are so much thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my eyes and on my pocket book.</li>
            <li> I used a whole tube of librow before this</li>
            <li> and it REALLY worked...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much  length yet.</li>
            <li> My lash are fuller and much longer.  </li>
            <li> The wand is a brush, much like a liquid eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> It really do work, I now have lashes that I can see.</li>
            <li> This stuff really make my lashes longer.</li>
            <li> It also works very well on my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I have very blond hair, so this helps add some color to both eyelashes and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I am 56 and have very sparse eyelashes.</li>
            <li> it really works in about 3 weeks after using grande lash</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> so I bought it from Amazon at a much affordable price.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this with high hopes!</li>
            <li> really wish this had worked for me...</li>
            <li> Now we both use it and we are really happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lashes are much longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li> , SHE RECOMENDED FOR HER FRIENDS, THANKS, REGRDS</li>
            <li> Much of the time, I just want to scratch my eyes out.</li>
            <li> And to my amazement my lashes are so much fuller and they are lengthening.</li>
            <li> I really did not notice much improvement, but I may have skipped a night or two and maybe that made a difference,</li>
            <li> As the directions stated it took about 6 wks of once a day application to really see a difference</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> but I have noticed my eyelashes are much longer</li>
            <li> Really works but give it time.</li>
            <li> Am at 8 weeks and am still waiting on lash thickness and hopefully darkening as I have light blonde eyelashes.</li>
            <li> how much younger you look with your brows filled in.  </li>
            <li> I went and bought some and used it faithfully almost very day at night.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t feel the loss of money so much</li>
            <li> after one month it was very visible...</li>
            <li> Really works as the information states.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed😔</li>
            <li> this product really really works.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really use it now.</li>
            <li> Well, it really works.</li>
            <li> Just go buy Revitalash, as that stuff works very well.</li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t be the real thing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake and makes your lashes really &amp;</li>
            <li> This product works better than expected.</li>
            <li> This really works, however you need to continue using it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>
            <li> and I am suspecting it is not the real product.  </li>
            <li> grandeLash MD worked very well in lengthening my lashes but didn&#x27;t make them fuller.</li>
            <li> She wants to be done</li>
            <li> i dont wear mascara,lashes are really that long.downside</li>
            <li> This really worked.</li>
            <li> Took a while to work but really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> I would not write a review, but this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this product out for eyelash growth</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> My lashes absolutely got longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to Latisse and this is so much cheaper</li>
            <li> I was more than pleased with this product as I saw results within a few days of starting to use it.  </li>
            <li> My lashes were short and thinning and they have filled out and have become noticeably longer.  </li>
            <li> It has taken about 8 weeks before really seeing results.  </li>
            <li> Got it fast.  </li>
            <li> and I have yet to see a real noticeable difference...</li>
            <li> This is a product that really works.  </li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> I started using this product, and it really delivers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is the real deal.</li>
            <li> but it really did.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I took a before picture so that I could show you the difference.  </li>
            <li> I want to keep using it, but it just hurts my eyes too much.</li>
            <li> I say honestly, because you are checking everyday for a change</li>
            <li> but I really see a difference, it&#x27;s my second tube and even after the first purchase I noticed my lashes were longer and stronger!!</li>
            <li> I love my new long lashes.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> Within 3 weeks I noticed the result, I always had short eyelashes and now they are much longer and thicker!!!</li>
            <li> It took about a month for me to see results, but WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Only reason I did not give a full 5 stars, which could have to do with my eyes being sensitive, but my eyes get pretty red later on in the day and will dry out (possibly a little more with this) but works AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> been using this since my first review but just got a new order and</li>
            <li> Love my long lush lashes!</li>
            <li> My lashes have grown long and strong with this product.</li>
            <li> But my eyes r fine back to normal.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and just takes a few seconds for a quick swipe alnong</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this product only to have to return it.  </li>
            <li> they look like there shorter than my normal lashes!</li>
            <li> I have used other products that worked better and quicker, This burns my eyes.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t apply the enhancer to any area on your eyes where lashes don&#x27;t normally grow!  </li>
            <li> I just may need more time after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> At first, I got a little scared because I noticed that many of my eyelashes started to fall out</li>
            <li> My eyes after use of this product not getting it in my eyes, makes my eyes so sensitive to light that I have pain within the back of eyeball, evidently some seeps into eyes.</li>
            <li> I compared this to another product that is way cheaper and the other product works better for me.</li>
            <li> I did not see very much growth there were a few more lashes then before</li>
            <li> I was very careful to make sure none of the product got into my eyes</li>
            <li> I actually have pretty long lashes, but I am a blonde and my top lashes are a light brown and almost transluscent at the tip.  </li>
            <li> Took about two months to see major results, but it is worth the time and effort.  </li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t care about the price, but she wants high quality product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame they raised the cost so high because the product really works.</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted for better results and read about every review on various websites, nowhere did I see anyone report facial hair in unusual places - under the outer corners of the eyes.</li>
            <li> Now my lashes are back to being lush and full!  </li>
            <li> Wow what a positive force that I really needed.</li>
            <li> This product is much cheaper on Amazon, it normally retails for over $60.  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately I lost my beautiful lashes and was out $40.00.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first tube, it&#x27;s lasted me 5 months so far.  </li>
            <li> I mean is, before you apply it on ur lash line, make sure that ur brush isn&#x27;t too soaked with the product or else when u apply it, ur going to have a more blotchy red appearance on ur eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought she had a new mascara on!  </li>
            <li> I feel like I have a new toy to play with!</li>
            <li> I have bought it over and over again and cannot live without it!</li>
            <li> I am going to have to get some new glasses now!</li>
            <li> I ripped off half of my lashes maybe more.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are longer and black love this product.</li>
            <li> With using this product, over time, my eyelashes became black, top and bottom and have grown to my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I guess I need to apply more than typical?</li>
            <li> and I must say GrandeLASH works just as well, but the price is more than half.  </li>
            <li> I am an older woman and my eyelashes were thinning out and were getting shorter.</li>
            <li> sure you follow the instructions as the secret ingredient is what is used in glaucoma drops so it is important not to get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> once in the morning and once at night, because I am 50 and I read in the directions that if you are older, you will see faster results using it this way.</li>
            <li> Although I only apply once at night, the product only lasts a couple of weeks at most.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that their darker or thicker, as my main reason for using it, is for the length.</li>
            <li> but I am older and it says 6 weeks for results.</li>
            <li> It is super simple to apply and the results are AHHHH-Mazing!  </li>
            <li> Mainly, in length, some fullness, but not to the degree that length increases.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this in June since so many of my lashes fell out after having my eyeliner tattooed on my upper lids.  </li>
            <li> So I gave myself a break then started up a couple days later only on the tops and was able to use without incident for about 8 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyes became super red</li>
            <li> I noticed that as I&#x27;m getting a bit older, my lashes were fretting sparser and shorter.</li>
            <li> This product brought back my long, full lashes!!  </li>
            <li> Works very good in one month my lashes were so long my husband told me to stop using it, because they were long and dark.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try something that could possibly help fatten, lengthen my puny excuse for eyelashes.</li>
            <li> If I were to buy this product from GrandeLASH MD direct,  if my were results weren&#x27;t as proclaimed or positive in anyway</li>
            <li> and very sensitive!</li>
            <li> At first she was starting to doubt herself because you really cant see much results.</li>
            <li> Excited to see how long they are in 2-3months.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> One of my friends who works at a high end salon sells Grandelash to her clients.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Please read my full review (as detailed and accurate as possible) for more information about my bad experience with this product and you will understand .</li>
            <li> I have used other products that have cost more and I guess the old saying</li>
            <li> This by far works better than any other lash lengthening product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I wish it would work a little better .  </li>
            <li> I guess I have to give it  a little more time</li>
            <li> and I am seeing complete results!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have noticed longer lash length and also more hair growth in my eyebrows where it was getting a little sparse.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who really wants to see a difference in their lashes!!</li>
            <li> MADE MY UPPER LASHES FALL OUT IN CERTAIN SPOTS WITH IN THE FIRST WEEK OF USING IT.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I was super skeptical about this product, but I have purchased it more than once now and plan to never stop!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not experience anything great from using this product.  </li>
            <li> so i thought perhaps it was my fault for putting too much on or being a sensitive time of the month,</li>
            <li> NO fuller, NO thick.</li>
            <li> NO fuller, NO thick.</li>
            <li> It really works and looks so natural.  </li>
            <li> It also never caused me to have darkened eyelids (which never bothered me because I just used a light pink shadow anyways...</li>
            <li> and my lashes are SO long and full.  </li>
            <li> no secondary effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because the instruction states this is normal and after some time it goes away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but in the instructions it stated that it was normal</li>
            <li> but my eyes are allot more green</li>
            <li> Getting lash extensions is not only more expensive but it will also damage you own lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I only put a minimal amount to my upper eye lid but this product wasn&#x27;t good .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I my eyelashes returned to normal.</li>
            <li> But after 8 weeks you will have long full lashes.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, when you first use it, your eyes aren&#x27;t used to the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now, and my lashes are long and full.</li>
            <li> my eyes became normal.</li>
            <li> and my lashes stayed consistently long and full.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are full and long.</li>
            <li> Her lashes are so long and full since using it.</li>
            <li> to a reputable salon to buy this product, don&#x27;t waste your money on line.</li>
            <li> my lashes are long and full.  </li>
            <li> I think I should be waiting for a few more months, then I&#x27;ll review it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will continue to use it for a few more months.</li>
            <li> ,it made my eyelids rose colored,,well red basically, so have to wear white eyeshadow to cover up the red eyelids,im in my forties</li>
            <li> The irritation is not bad and my lashes are still long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with short straight lashes and never had such good looking long lashes before thanks to</li>
            <li> I grew tired of the time and expense even though I loved the lashes.  </li>
            <li> and when i do wear mascara people ask me if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes, that&#x27;s how good they look now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands that work fine.</li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t believe how much better my lashes look!  </li>
            <li> My eyes became super sensitive to sunlight, regardless of whether I was actually looking at the sun or not.</li>
            <li> About...5 months of use, I started getting compliments on my lashes left and right.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and after 3 weeks, my right eye is back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> used revitalash every night for 5 years, and it made my eyelashes super long</li>
            <li> I am going to keep going to see if in addition to being super long and curved they also get darker and fuller.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical to use miraculous products but this really works :) I started with the liquid to grow my lashes now I am using mascara from the same line and my lashes look like to die for :)</li>
            <li> My eyes turned dark red if I got some in my eye the night before, and they would stay bright red all day, it was embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> My skin in both areas became more sensitive to touch and got a little darker in color.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve had darker under eye circles since, but that might be natural as there is precious little sunlight in overcast Indiana in the winter.  </li>
            <li> My lashes have also darkened where the new growth is.</li>
            <li> I buy this for a friend of mine, she loves it, enhanced her lashes to a new length.</li>
            <li> This formula basically prolongs the shedding of your lashes (basically your lashes do not shed as new lashes come in)</li>
            <li> Plan to stay with this product  until a new formula improves it, always will to try.</li>
            <li> but I am giving new growth time to grow.</li>
            <li> The new product did NOT work as well for me as the GrandeLash MD had.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed new growth.</li>
            <li> My brow and lashes are normally dark but fine.  </li>
            <li> My moms had the absolutely shortest lashes in existence and she got enough length by Christmas that she could really grab onto with her mascara wand and also see with no makeup.</li>
            <li> However.....my lashes are long and pretty!  </li>
            <li> my lashes will be back to looking long, thick and gorgeous!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t caused me any irritation or any discoloration on my eyelids, and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They look very natural.</li>
            <li> &quot; This product has done nothing to help the growth of my lashes and made my eyes very sensitive.</li>
            <li> It gave me red itchy and puffy eyes the first week of use, but I continued using it expecting results.  </li>
            <li> Not absolutely sure if it has to do with the Grand Lashe or not,</li>
            <li> I had no side effects and now I only apply once every other day before I go to bed top and bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li> I did suffer some irritation at first, even receiving comments about how red my eyelids appeared to be.  </li>
            <li> I used the product once for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> but I have no complaints thus far!</li>
            <li> but when I did, wow!</li>
            <li> In the inside corner of the same eye 3 lashes grew longer a bit ticker than the first one.</li>
            <li> In the inside corner of the same eye 3 lashes grew longer a bit ticker than the first one.</li>
            <li> the first day of application, my eyes started feeling itchy n red.</li>
            <li> It definitely works, and my lashes are much longer!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first tube 4 months later.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know if having long eyelashes is worth the side effects.</li>
            <li> It must be used consistently and you will see your lashes growing by 3-4 weeks, especially when mascara is applied.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it would work for me if it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes--my left eye especially turned red in the inside corner.</li>
            <li> One thing to remember though, the lashes grow in different lengths at first Just keep using it, and the others will catch up.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that actually worked.  </li>
            <li> My natural lashes are longer than falsies!</li>
            <li> For the first three days my eyelids were red and looked like I had on some eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I tried a different lash enhancer first however had a reaction from it.  </li>
            <li> Within the first week my eyes were red and itchy.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that REALLY works!</li>
            <li> No side effects so far!</li>
            <li> I mainly bought it for my eyebrows that had fallen out, and it really worked to fill them back in.  </li>
            <li> It made my lashes nice and long but it also made them a little thinner</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see fantastic results, but no problems with redness or any irritation.</li>
            <li> and this is the only product that has brought my lashes back full force.</li>
            <li> but it made my skin around my eyes so dark on bottom an red on top of my lid</li>
            <li> I have been a user of GrandeLASH MD for 2 solid years, purchasing the product from the company direct at a higher price.  </li>
            <li> I had long lashes most of my life but, as I aged, my lashes got skimpier and shorter.  </li>
            <li> Of course, when I stopped using it, my lashes returned to their normal (short, straight) length.</li>
            <li> After a full 4 weeks of only applying every evening, my lashes were longer and fuller than they had ever been, even when i was younger.</li>
            <li> After Using it for a several months I saw an old roommate, and the first thing she said to me was &amp;</li>
            <li> You actually look like you have false eyelashes when in fact they are your own!  </li>
            <li> I typically do not leave reviews, but I highly recommend users purchase directly from Grande.</li>
            <li> I did read all the reviews prior to ordering and all of them were positive</li>
            <li> Several people at work have started using  it and also seen positive results.</li>
            <li> It took a while to notice a difference, six weeks approximately, but then I&#x27;m in love with the product!</li>
            <li> They got dark enough and so full that I don&#x27;t need mascara (and they were pretty blond before).  </li>
            <li> I used LiLash in the past, which was more expensive, and definitely worked more quickly, but they both work very well in the end.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my eyelashes but made hair grow tremendously underneath my eyes, right above my cheekbone (I don&#x27;t know how because I only applied on lash line) and it is very noticiable since I have dark hair</li>
            <li> I was a Latisse user for 2 years but swtiched (this is less expensive and it felt time for a change) and I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li> However, using it two times daily, I am noticing a slight increase in lashes and, maybe, a tad more brows.  </li>
            <li> Her salon sold it for over $100 (which is why you should obviously buy on Amazon for HALF the price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are instructed to use one dip for each eye (apply to the top lid and the bottom).</li>
            <li> I used to have naturally long eyelashes but lost all the length and many lashes due to my job</li>
            <li> My eyes continue itching and red but only after applying the product, next morning my eyes were fine.</li>
            <li> I rather spend $65 for a genuine product not a watered down product!</li>
            <li> I apply first to my right eye, and then, without re-dipping into the tube, I turn the brush to the opposite side and apply to the other eye.</li>
            <li> (I have very dark brown hair and light skin).  </li>
            <li> Within 2 months, I really noticed my lashes really growing long!!!</li>
            <li> Face was clean and dry prior to application.</li>
            <li> It is clear color.</li>
            <li> I see some improvement to upper lashes, not so much on lower and nothing on brows.</li>
            <li> By the third week I could tolerate twice a day on my lashes (I think I was probably using too much in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> one really irritated my eyes, leaving the red when i woke.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are normally short and will not curl, thanks to this</li>
            <li> no matter how old you are (I&#x27;m 51 by the way)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still too early to tell if this product works or not.  </li>
            <li> D so far see no visible difference.</li>
            <li> I developed blisters on both cornea of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Works very well but caused my eyes to be really red and blood shot.  </li>
            <li> So far, I get a bit of redness on the eyelids but not discoloration or stinging.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin around my eyes</li>
            <li> I also took care to completely remove my mascara and eyeliner before applying.</li>
            <li> Its been 3 months and all I could say is wow</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t overdo it because it can darken your skin near your eyes.  </li>
            <li> This is something you apply to your lash line to enhance growth of natural lashes.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It is not a fix for lashes - much like a moisturizer is not a fix for facial imperfections.  </li>
            <li> so I can just be completely ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it did not work as fast nor last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m OLD</li>
            <li> then WOW.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy this product because I read some reviews of people who had developed redness on the eyelids, but it didn&#x27;t happened to me.</li>
            <li> I also used on my eyebrows, because I over plucked one of my eyebrows so much that I have a bald spot on one, and last night, after 7-8 days of being using this product twice a day I&#x27;m seeing hair growing on the bald spot!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far this product has been working for me.</li>
            <li> It has taken about 2 months for this product to provide the WOW factor ...</li>
            <li> I would definately recomend this to someone like me with short, straight lashes.</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old</li>
            <li> Now my eyelashes are much longer, appear much darker and are definitely visible enough to make my eyes stand out.  </li>
            <li> I have spare lashes that are different in length, after a month of using the product, my lashes length is even, they curl in one direction and appear much fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Within 3 weeks you could see a considerable difference.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have really sensitive skin or eyelids</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer, thicker, and don&#x27;t fall out near as often.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not toooooo overly sensitive but</li>
            <li> used the product twice a day for the first two week, then once a day until my lashes got so long</li>
            <li> So far 6 of my girlfriends are using the lash enhansor and liking the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is, by far, my #1 beauty product.  </li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning with blood shot eyes &amp; does make them sensitive after some time.</li>
            <li> and I have had teenage girls ask me if they&#x27;re real.</li>
            <li> My lashes were straight and short.</li>
            <li> So far, no eyelash growth.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re far longer than they used to be, no curler needed and, when I do use mascara, they are SO noticeable.</li>
            <li> It completely enhances and elongates lashes.  </li>
            <li> I brought maximum strength eye drops for red eye and it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> As far as thickness and darkness</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be natural ingredients that help moisturizer and help your natural lashes grow.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m an old, into my 60s.  </li>
            <li> My bottom lashes are completely transparent.  </li>
            <li> I am 64 years old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blond</li>
            <li> I still need to use mascara because my lashes are naturally blond and this hasn&#x27;t made a noticable difference in the darkness.</li>
            <li> let them fall out naturally.  </li>
            <li> I am 25 years old</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing to make my eye lashes grow, my eyelashes remaind the same with some lashes falling out, gimmick.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was reasonably priced and after reading the reviews, it sounded similar to Latisse.</li>
            <li> I have noticed longer eyelashes, but the con far outweigh the growth as it has caused discoloration on my eyelids -which</li>
            <li> It takes about six weeks to really see a big difference.</li>
            <li> Still think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced for the results I&#x27;ve seen thus far.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product and her lashes were lush, darker and longer</li>
            <li> but so far all I see is my lashes ar longer and the bottom lash has no improvement.</li>
            <li> it is all natural</li>
            <li> This is the only product that really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young 65 years old.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to splurge on myself early for the holidays...</li>
            <li> and/or SPF day cream then apply it directly on my eyelids (not lashes).  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.  </li>
            <li> i am sensitive to a lot of products but not this.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes grew to unexpected lengths.</li>
            <li> Very hapoy with the product you can finally see my eyelashes again!  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you stop using the product your lashes go back to the way they were which again makes my suspect this product is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> i would have given 5 stars but the time I have had too use it is too short to really see how it works.</li>
            <li> I had to leave work early because my eyes were burning and so sensitive.</li>
            <li> It was like it was old or had been used (Geeze, I hope not).</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> So I went from using one product to another directly.</li>
            <li> But my eyes were too sensitive for that</li>
            <li> I think that people will notice more your dark circles than you eyelashes if they  are long.</li>
            <li> I think that people will notice more your dark circles than you eyelashes if they  are long.</li>
            <li> (I love a few brands) and people regularly think I&#x27;m wearing falsies.</li>
            <li> It will give you full and dark lashes before you even finish one bottle.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve already had success with a growth formula and are no longer using it daily, use this daily or between &#x27;growth&#x27; doses to maintain the roots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately three months and my lashes and eyebrows look spectacular.</li>
            <li> This is nice in that it&#x27;s a clear liquid on a thin brush --</li>
            <li> /&gt;The effects don&#x27;t last permanently, but if someone has a few weeks of prep time to grow your lashes, this is a nice alternative to fake lashes (especially if you have a good plumping mascara).</li>
            <li> It looked like she had been using Latisse, only no \\&quot;spidery\\&quot; length I see with some gals, nice and thick.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin and eyes, and although this product does itch sometimes after long use, my eyes are fine, not red, not irritating, not changing color like other products on the market.</li>
            <li> The only thing is last time I stopped using it right away</li>
            <li> I am of Native American decent and have been blessed with short straight lashes.</li>
            <li> There is slight stinging that is bothersome, but not painful and goes away.</li>
            <li> It took a full month to see any difference, but it did make my lashes longer and slightly fuller.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so powerful, you need to be pretty careful of where it gets on your face, otherwise, the areas which you want to remain hairless (like the areas to the right and left of the ends of your lash line) might start to grow a little fuzz...</li>
            <li> I mentioned earlier, the only downside is the initial use is pretty much guaranteed to irritate your eyes.</li>
            <li> Love the product but find it odd that my first tube lasted 2 months, and my second tube lasted only 2 weeks, despite using it less frequently than I was using the first tube initially.</li>
            <li> Is not as long as and fuller as I want it to be yet , but I believe I will get there in few more weeks .</li>
            <li> But the 2nd order was not the same as the first.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and ordered a third tube and after a month of using it, my eyebrows and eyelashes are back to how they were before I started my first tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the first week or two, I used it twice daily, then only at night.</li>
            <li> After the first two months, I have been using it about every second night just to make it last longer</li>
            <li> However, saw quick results on my brows (less than 3 weeks).</li>
            <li> It was watered down and barely kept my eyebrows and eyelashes full.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes, which were pretty short and nonexistent, are now so long, I can&#x27;t wear my old sunglasses anymore!</li>
            <li> I researched various eyelash enhancers and this was rated high with a lot of reviewers which is why I chose this product.  </li>
            <li> I had such high expectations about this product.</li>
            <li> I had several friends who highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> When I take my makeup off my lids are a little red and irritated so I just put on a good moisturizer after my bath then wait a few hours then put the GrandLashMD</li>
            <li> I only used it at night before because my eyes are easily irritated and it did irritate my eyes if I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that a LOT of the positive reviews of this product are from people who have only left one review on Amazon and that one review is to talk this product up.</li>
            <li> The side effects I experienced were slightly unpleasant, but not to the point of stopping my use of it.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t need to wait this long because I saw a difference almost immediately - not in length, of course but, for the fact that my lashes started to \\&quot;curl\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> When I curl them I can really see how long they are.  </li>
            <li> However, a word of caution...when I first started using the product, my eyes were not used to the solution, and it would make my eyes red during the first few months I was using it.</li>
            <li> Once I stopped using it, 2 days later my eyes felt normal again.</li>
            <li> and my lashes went back to normal.  </li>
            <li> There is a pink line along where I apply the GrandeLash which at first concerned me.  </li>
            <li> And I also feel like they are going back to its normal length with time if you don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I FIND IT IS OK ABOUT THE SAME AS OTHER EYE LASH SERUMS ONLY A LITTLE BIT HIGHER IN PRICE ,BUT</li>
            <li> I would have never imagined that this product would deliver exactly what it promises, but holy cow, my eyelashes have NEVER looked so lush.</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and had noticed that my lashes were thinning  out and my 42 year old daughter had used Grand Lash MD and and had thick long lashes, so I tried it and within 6 weeks I had longer thicker lashes that friends were complimenting and  wanted to know what the product was all about....</li>
            <li> I can also notice new eyelashes that are working there way up to the length of my regular eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a new and improved product, because the packaging was similar.  </li>
            <li> This works really well and made my lashes very long.  </li>
            <li> My lashes existed but werent very long and were completely straight.</li>
            <li> I used it too much on the bottom lashes and the tiny facial hairs just under the eye grew and darkened as well.  </li>
            <li> my eyelashes are back to their initial fullness and much longer and curlier than ever before.</li>
            <li> My lashes are definitly longer (not fake lash long but enough to continue purchasing the product!)</li>
            <li> and I get much longer lashes using just my regular daily mascara.  </li>
            <li> I started using it early in December and by February my eyelashes looked better than extensions or false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Having had short, straight, average lashes my whole life</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nothing major.</li>
            <li> I purchased it the first time in February 2013 and can&#x27;t remember how many days it took to actually notice, but alas, I DID notice!</li>
            <li> We applied it day and night for the first months and now just every other night for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any major results but it claims that you will in 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is my first lash boosting product, so I can&#x27;t compare it with other ones.</li>
            <li> In the mornings, I wake up with major crust in my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product caused major irritation to my eyes including severe redness and burning.</li>
            <li> Because of the other review I took a chance and tried GrandeLASH MD for the first time almost 6months ago.  </li>
            <li> My clients love that I wear little to no make-up and so do I. Less work for a busy woman.</li>
            <li> But it does make them stronger and less prone to breakage and fall-out, and it definitely enhances the results when used as supplement to those true growth-inducing products.</li>
            <li> so my lashes are very light and have always been thin.  </li>
            <li> For month two, I applied twice a day right at the rootline of my eyelashes (less like eyeliner)...which I should have been doing during month one.</li>
            <li> but if it saves just one lady the same trouble worth the effort!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 40 and won&#x27;t wear false eyelashes (mainly because I can never get them to fit</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned that it stings your eyes, and that is true, but only for the first few applications.</li>
            <li> I figure I&#x27;ll be able to back down to every other day during month four, if not sooner.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and eczema and at first the product stings my eyelids a little</li>
            <li> I wish I could say the same for this product because I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li> but they have thinned and such since high school, 2 weeks after starting this</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have grown very long and new lashes have grown in too!  </li>
            <li> At about week 5 or so, I DEFINITELY see longer lashes on the top, and the bottom lashes are starting to fill in where I had some gaps with hardly anything.  </li>
            <li> It gives my eyelashes an even darker appearance and I generally wear eyeliner in that area anyway</li>
            <li> While this may give different results for different users, this made my lashes amazing and thick and long.  </li>
            <li> Because my skin is so sensitive, I only applied once a day every night and again I had no issues.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if they are selling old bottles that don&#x27;t have the same effect for your lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 years old, and until I started using this, had short, stubby blond lashes.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying another tube in the near future to start growing out my lashes again for my wedding.</li>
            <li> Like I said earlier, I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am/was a natural blonde</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s terrific!!!!</li>
            <li> , I once again had complete upper and lower lash line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65, of Northern European stock and have naturally stubby lashes.  </li>
            <li> When you first try it, use it daily until your lashes are LONG, then you only need to use it about every 3 days.  </li>
            <li> On my second day of use my eyes turned completely blood-red.</li>
            <li> At the end of it, my lashes were nearly gone and the ones that were left seemed shorter.  </li>
            <li> I barely use it because</li>
            <li> I thought I was imagining it, but when I compared my lashes with the old photos, the change was obvious.</li>
            <li> When I started I could barely get my lashes into an eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> I may have to consider purchasing directly from the manufacturer or switching to something else completely next time.</li>
            <li> Later I found another brand which didn&#x27;t do the job nearly as well, so I returned to GrandeLash.  </li>
            <li> I have always had a bare spot in one of my eyebrows, but the hair is now growing in.</li>
            <li> I spent so much time growing, naturally shedded and grew back the length they were before.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged my lashes have really thinned out.</li>
            <li> They are full, long and dark.</li>
            <li> - I visited her in July and immediately noticed how long, dark and full her lashes were.  </li>
            <li> My lashes for two years have become thick and long and more than I could have hoped for.  </li>
            <li> OK people, it takes about 1 year to get long thick lashes.  </li>
            <li> Sure beats trying to put on false lashes.</li>
            <li> Especially after having hardly no lashes left after 2 years of eyelash extensions😟</li>
            <li> are common place for a truly effective lash product and typically goes away after 1-2 weeks, once your body acclimates to the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> and i could start to see some new long lashes after about a month.</li>
            <li> after a long conversation with them, i&#x27;m convinced that new shipments are paraben-free.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because my right eye was dried out, teared up when I read or watch tv.  </li>
            <li> I felt a slight sting when I first used it</li>
            <li> Some redness occurred the first two (2) weeks along with slight itchiness (was not bothersome to me because thereafter it went away).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a small improvement on my eyebrows, but not as quick as seen in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> It seriously works, and makes my lashes outrageously long and healthy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It caused some minor redness on my eyelids at first but that didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The only complaint, when I first started wearing the product, it really irritated my eyes.  </li>
            <li> (The person from the other review might have been applying too much.</li>
            <li> It takes about 6-8 weeks to really start seeing results, but then I can decrease my use to every other day.</li>
            <li> I looked into this product because I had a friend who had experienced the same issues and started using this product, figuring she&#x27;d give it a shot since it was less expensive than Latisse.</li>
            <li> Mainly because it seemed to irritate my eyes - making them feel a bit dry + red.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks, far short of the required 2 to 3 months to see any results.</li>
            <li> Use it every night for the past 6 weeks and WOW it really works!</li>
            <li> The only downfall is my sensitive eyes can only handle this one or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Also, my eyes are sensitive and this is the only lash enhancer I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t leave me with red, irritated eyes.</li>
            <li> Then, you can just maintain the growth by only using it a few nights a week,,, definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> For me it is worth the little discomfort!  </li>
            <li> The first couple times you put it on, it will sting a little bit.</li>
            <li> It did burn a little but cleared up after the first week of use.</li>
            <li> first my eyelids burned a little.  </li>
            <li> A little redness at first but got used to it</li>
            <li> The price was around $25.00 less then the exact same one sold at my hair salon.</li>
            <li> Like super stubby short and were barely past my eyelids.</li>
            <li> I waited 5 days for it to clear up and then reapplied to only my upper lashes and eyebrows and so far no new problems.</li>
            <li> About long: let me be clear in this.</li>
            <li> About long: let me be clear in this.</li>
            <li> However my daughter, a young adult will not use it due to the petroleum products in it.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a co-worker with lush, long lashes and commented on them to her.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted to make my eyes pop with some long natural lashes.  </li>
            <li> At 46 years old I&#x27;d never had long lashes.</li>
            <li> The first few months I used this every night--now just 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> I had read that women over 50 should apply 2x a day, and I was doing that after the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I wasted my money</li>
            <li> The first few applications did irritate my eyes, some burning and redness, but that went away after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> but it takes a week to start the growth and your eyelashes grow a little crazy but after two weeks they are full and longer and thicker than ever!!!!</li>
            <li> The length is more subtle than I expected but my lashes are thicker.</li>
            <li> but I religiously did each day when I got up and right before bed only missing 2night in 3months.</li>
            <li> just a little irritation the first week .I noticed fuller lashes within the 3rd week.</li>
            <li> The first couple times i used the product the skin around my eyes turned red and burned a little but with use that subsided.</li>
            <li> I used City Lash previously and absolutely</li>
            <li> I am very sadden by this experience because now my lashes are even LESS noticeable</li>
            <li> I started using this in September, after I weaned my baby, and three months later my lashes are long and lush.  </li>
            <li> and my lashes are not only LONG but lush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more then 10 enhancers in the past few years.</li>
            <li> The first few days of using it, my eyes were red and itchy but I shrugged it off thinking maybe it&#x27;ll go away.</li>
            <li> The first few days this made the skin around my eyes very red and itchy.</li>
            <li> Only drawback was getting used to the feel of it the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> and it can definitely cause irritation the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li> My lashes became longer like in 6 months,but everyone ask if they are artificial and a good thing they are staying long.</li>
            <li> So much so that I slowed down and only use it once every 3 days.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product in September because I was losing eyelashes due to stress and possibly getting older</li>
            <li> It is now just under two months of use and my upper lashes are nearly TWICE as long as they have ever been in my life!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say I did try using it twice a day for the first few days (as the directions say some women experience faster growth with twice daily use) but the color around my eyes started to look different.  </li>
            <li> I realized that I used too much so the next day I used less and no redness occurred</li>
            <li> I tapered the daily use down to just once a week thinking maybe the daily use was too much for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have blonde, very thin, fine eyelashes, and lost some when I bought a new eyelash curler that pulled a portion of them out.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes its a little too much.</li>
            <li> I thought this might HELP a little, but it is has REALLY improved my lashes.  </li>
            <li> They are so long now, I can barely wear mascara!  </li>
            <li> getting older and losing my eyebrows is not fun, i tried this product and now i have them back.</li>
            <li> When I woke up this morning my eyes were bright red bloodshot, swollen and painful to the touch.</li>
            <li> The first few days of sensitivity are long forgotten and the results are fabulous!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The GrandeLASH MD really works, I am on my second tube in about 6 months and my lashes are so much longer, I have had friends ask me if I am wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> They are long, thick, full and silky again.</li>
            <li> The whole procedure for the lash extensions is so annoying that I wanted a result just like that, but using my own lashes.</li>
            <li> Initially they were  much fuller and longer, but has thinned out slightly!</li>
            <li> I use brow powder and stiff brush to fill in the thin spots and darken them all over, and they had gotten to the point where I was very self-conscious of them and wouldn&#x27;t ever go without them filled in.  </li>
            <li> They both work with small little new hairs growing out within weeks right befor your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this product right after all my fake lashes and real lashes fell out.</li>
            <li> Now that my hair is naturally thinning, due to age and decrease in hormones, I&#x27;ve had to resort to using an eyebrow pencil daily.</li>
            <li> My eyelids are slightly swollen and my eyes seem to be redder than normal.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks of use i can say it is well worth the money and well worth the uncomfortable feeling in the beginning!</li>
            <li> After 2 months of once daily use, my eyelashes are long enough to touch my upper eyelid when my eyes are open and I no longer have to use an eyelash curler to curl them.</li>
            <li> Burning sensation, followed by chronic eczema and extreme sensitivity to anything I put near my eyes.</li>
            <li> It does take a few months to see full results but after  using it for a little over 2 months</li>
            <li> Always believe the bad reviews if there are way to many good reviews like on this product, because the bad reviews are the real reviews where people actually spent money on this product and found out it is not working.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes red or last long.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking I was probably throwing away good money only to be disappointed by another product that didn&#x27;t deliver the results promised.  </li>
            <li> GrandeLASH MD definitely improved the length and dark color of my lashes after one month of use, but I was hoping for more dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> So far it works, my lashes are fuller but only slightly longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price so far.  </li>
            <li> I use it about 3 or 4 times a week for the past month and my eyelashes are looking much longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brown/caramel skin with dark features, early 30s.</li>
            <li> So basically, it took almost as long to see results as the product last.  </li>
            <li> This is the only one that gave me long eye lashes like it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Product lasts a long time too and you only apply once a day.</li>
            <li> I actually had to cut one because it got too long.</li>
            <li> (Probably because they weren&#x27;t long enough to curl.)</li>
            <li> and then they all got really long shortly thereafter.  </li>
            <li> I knew they&#x27;d grow back eventually, but how long would that take?  </li>
            <li> Last week, when I saw my daughter, I had NO MASCARA on, and she was not surprised.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that, even when curled, my lashes are so long they hit my glasses every time I blink.  </li>
            <li> I swear my eyelashes are close to 1/2&amp;#34; long now and my eyebrows are actually thicker now than they ever were and darker too.  </li>
            <li> like there&#x27;s another two (2) months left in bottle (goes a long way IF you follow the directions).  </li>
            <li> My lashes didn&#x27;t get as long &amp; the product didn&#x27;t even last two months!!  </li>
            <li> It also lasted a really long time, even with my using it daily.  </li>
            <li> I had to cut back from using it every day and people were making comments on how long my lashes were.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and just had a little redness initially, but nothing of consequence.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is the product does irritate my eyes a little bit if I use it too frequently.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes had become very skimpy and even with several coats of mascara they would hardly show.  </li>
            <li> Now, 2 months later, my lashes have never been so long in my life &amp; I&#x27;m 31!</li>
            <li> Seems to last a long time!</li>
            <li> May take a bit longer than some of the other more expensive products, but will eventually get the same results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two different aestheticians remark on my long lashes, and that&#x27;s saying something!</li>
            <li> Had several people comment on how long my eyelashes look!</li>
            <li> I am Asian and my lashes have never been very long</li>
            <li> As a teen I had very long lashes and did so until I hit my 50s.  </li>
            <li> I noticed there were many complaints about how ur eyes go crazy red.</li>
            <li> Just when I thought I noticed lash growth, the tube ran dry- after only 3 weeks of directed use.</li>
            <li> Another lash enhancer that I used last year actually made my lashes fall out, leaving an odd gap in the middle of my upper lashes on both eyes.  </li>
            <li> My eyes sometimes get red from it, and I thought I was only having minimal results, until about two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I suffered from an extreme skin allergy which made me loose my eyelashes and eyebrows completely.</li>
            <li> I inadvertenly purchased this product - merely enough solution for a single use and burned my eyes</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical this would work when I purchased it, but sure enough, within 6 weeks I could definitely see the difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 03/2017: I have been purchasing from an authorised seller (also online, but not here) for a few months now and am once again seeing results - lashes are growing, not so much fuller, but longer and hold a curl well as long as I don&#x27;t use a really wet mascara formula.</li>
            <li> It is not as fast working as lilash, and my lashes aren&#x27;t AS long, but they&#x27;re still long and thick enough that i get compliments on them.</li>
            <li> reddening of lids and under eyes, and yesterday woke up with HUGE black eye (obviously broken blood vessels, spreading over my entire lid- looks like I got slugged.)</li>
            <li> I apply it only once a night as some times only ever other night</li>
            <li> they are not consistently the same length, yet, but it is only week 6.  </li>
            <li> There was a little bit of irritation the first few days or maybe a week, but that is gone now.  </li>
            <li> At least, they weren&#x27;t straight out</li>
            <li> So here I am a year later and my lashes are back to average length again.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are really long and darker</li>
            <li> After about a month of use my eyelashes were long</li>
            <li> No comparison to others I&#x27;ve tried - my eyelashes are incredibly long.  </li>
            <li> No real side effects and after you&#x27;ve achieved the the length and thickness, you don&#x27;t need to use daily.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes to begin with it</li>
            <li> Even my lower eyelashes are looking fuller, which only get some residual from my eyes being closed when I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I have some really long lashes</li>
            <li> I thought that my lashes should be all long by now.</li>
            <li> My bottom lashes are sooooo long too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s with the disclaimer that it&#x27;s only MINIMAL</li>
            <li> i havent been using it that long</li>
            <li> People are now commenting on how long they are.</li>
            <li> If you want long eyelashes, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> but my friend said she had to stop using it because her lashes got too long.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks, my lashes were really long.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser use&#x27;s this and her lashes are so long.</li>
            <li> My lashes are not darker, but they got really long after about 4 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> none have fallen out and they still look long.</li>
            <li> and my lashes are so long after 2 months,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how long my eyelashes have gotten since I have been using this.  </li>
            <li> now I am ordering another and ll try and keep track of how long before I notice longer lashes.</li>
            <li> and they stayed long as long as I used it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a recommendation of a friend after noticing how long her eyelashes were.</li>
            <li> they were so long.</li>
            <li> This product works as it says it does, if you keep using it your lashes do fill in, I found that not all the lashes grew you seem to have your shorter lashes and then some long ones, maybe it was the way it was applied</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the long but spindly lashes I&#x27;ve seen with Latisse.</li>
            <li> after photos lead you to believe that you&#x27;ll have amazingly long lashes in no time.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have grown incredibly long &amp; think &amp; even helped my eyebrow growth.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> A friend of mine is a distributor of Grande Lash and since she uses the product and I saw how long her lashes looked, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This product will work as long as you use it every day.  </li>
            <li> It works as long as you continue to use it.</li>
            <li> almost non existent lashes are now long and lengthy.  </li>
            <li> Seriously long lashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re hoping to create long, luscious lashes with this product, don&#x27;t count on it.</li>
            <li> so I expected to see results earlier</li>
            <li> I have had people remark how long my lashes are.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> they are so long.</li>
            <li> I discovered it through a spa I went to after seeing the manicurists eyelashes and how long they were.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone looking grow long lashes.</li>
            <li> I will use it as long as its manufactured.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have grown so long I&#x27;ve had to trim them.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how long my lashes are now.  </li>
            <li> it was a complete waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to wear mascara anymore, and when I do my lashes are almost too long.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not natural.</li>
            <li> My lashes are so long now and curl somewhat</li>
            <li> My lashes got so long</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money and</li>
            <li> now her eyelashes are so long it hits her glasses.</li>
            <li> Now they are so long they touch my glasses when I wear them.</li>
            <li> I now have long brautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> Get remarks from people all the time about how long my lashes are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s only for length, not really for volume, so if you already have long lashes, this will just make them longer, not thicker.</li>
            <li> The stinging just went away yesterday and my eyes are slowly returning to their normal white color.</li>
            <li> The thin applicator brush makes it easy to apply and with a little care you do not get it in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately I experienced a very bad customer service</li>
            <li> This product definitely worked for me, my lashes are much longer now, however, there is a little bit of irritation in that my eyelids look a little bit pink.</li>
            <li> It worked better than Latisse at growing thicker, longer lashes, and is easier to use, as well as less expensive.</li>
            <li> In the beginning, after daily use for about a month, my lids became sensitive, a little red &amp; itchy, so I skipped a few days &amp; then resumed.</li>
            <li> and only IF I MESS UP and don&#x27;t put it on properly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this happened to other people or maybe my skin is just sensitive but having loner lashes is not worth it, if you have discoloration on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 and recently noticed that certain small sections of my lashes were missing.  </li>
            <li> Su I recommend it to those who want long lush dark lashes!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed by so many anti aging products but not this one!</li>
            <li> May. Look how long they look!</li>
            <li> My lashes are so long and look like they are eyelash extensions!</li>
            <li> I have tried other products but this is the only one that does what it says.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products that I&#x27;ve tried, this one actually improved both my lashes and brows.  </li>
            <li> my eye lashes are so long that they touch the lenses of my sun glasses!  </li>
            <li> My neighbor just told me she never noticed how long eyelashes are!</li>
            <li> have tried other products similar to this one as well, and none have done what they say they do..</li>
            <li> I have a friend who had to trim her lashes because they got so long!  </li>
            <li> and they look forever long!</li>
            <li> Other people may have a different reaction, but I felt that it was unsafe for me to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I now only use it every other night.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other users whose lids were left reddish and a  itchy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using it for a long time!</li>
            <li> Earlier in the year I had Lasik surgery and lost a lot of eye lashes due to the sticky eye drops.  </li>
            <li> Once my lashes came back I used it about every other day.  </li>
            <li> I now only use every other night to maintain my results.</li>
            <li> I know I have several of the other women saying they wished they could have my lashes.</li>
            <li> but now I have long and curved lashes!</li>
            <li> I do notice that it leaves my eyelids a bit red, but who cares when your eyelashes are creating tsunamis on the other side of the world?</li>
            <li> I get comments from strangers on how long my eyelashes are!</li>
            <li> I had lash extensions added on and were in love however they are expensive to keep up with!</li>
            <li> one morning I woke up and my eyelashes were so long!  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe how LONG my lashes have grown!</li>
            <li> I had nearly no lashes!</li>
            <li> My lashes are sooooo long!  </li>
            <li> Ive tried other similar non prescription products and non of them worked</li>
            <li> The next morning I woke up with extremely bloodshot eyes and burned looking eye lids.  </li>
            <li> Never had such red eyes or dark circles in my life!</li>
            <li> sure it must have been a fake!</li>
            <li> The lashes got very long as the months went by.  </li>
            <li> but now they are very long and</li>
            <li> It was dry after two weeks and should have (I thought)</li>
            <li> Around lunchtime, my eyes felt dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li> I seriously doubt that&#x27;s how much was in the tube.</li>
            <li> They were dry &amp; itchy--but nothing that a bottle of over the counter eye drops can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> How could this be if I had been using the &amp;#34;same product&amp;#34; from the manufacturer direct for two years and after two weeks of using the proclaimed same product from Grande Naturals my results changed dramatically in a negative way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t use it everyday because I was lazy.</li>
            <li> I had a 1/8 inch gap between the lashes on my upper lid and after using this product for a few weeks the lashes grew back and now are getting thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on more expensive products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll now only apply every other day, and not very much.</li>
            <li> no new growth and my lashes are looking thinner.</li>
            <li> Now something weird happened at first, I did my upper and lower and for some reason only my lower lashes looked like they were rimmed in pink.</li>
            <li> A single application as directed has caused severe injury to both of my eyes.</li>
            <li> It took at least three months to do the trick, but right around there, a few lashes became noticeably longer</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make your lashes super long like expensive prescription or hormone-infused products, so don&#x27;t expect it to.</li>
            <li> After using eyelash extensions for a few months when I finally had them removed I was left with very short stubby lashes and a lot less volume.</li>
            <li> it does make my eyelids dark but only while i&#x27;m using the product.</li>
            <li> Start noticing dark circles around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;-3 weeks: Itching and red eyes stop .</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used professional strengths that cost $100.00</li>
            <li> I do not normally write reviews.</li>
            <li> but left dark circles around my eyes on the skin.  </li>
            <li> My lashes grew to an unbelievable length and are quite lush.  </li>
            <li> Eyes and skin around eyes temporarily turned a dark red.</li>
            <li> so well it took me 2 month to see full result and everyone wanted to know if my eyelashes were fake</li>
            <li> I started using it at the beginning of January and had no problems with any stinging, so I started using it twice a day (not super religiously since I get lazy sometimes -- see previous note regarding neglect) and didn&#x27;t really notice anything but decided to give it time.</li>
            <li> It made my eyelashes grow back when the other products I tried didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> After 2 months my lashes are SO long!!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it as long as they make it!!</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer for older women like me (late 50&#x27;s), but it definitely works.</li>
            <li> the tube was basically dry when I began using it!</li>
            <li> I starting using this product less than three weeks ago</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s half the cost of Latisse, does not have the ingredient that may cause your iris to darken and a tube last about 3 months.  </li>
            <li> (less swollen but still red).</li>
            <li> By then, your lashes should be obviously longer and fuller and slightly darker.</li>
            <li> and that was only slightly.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the same product (so I thought) offered for half the price I jumped at the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The skin felt irritated, turned pink and dry, then became scaly.  </li>
            <li> The upper lashes were longer, previously damaged by extensions.</li>
            <li> Went to one time daily and the odd coloring went away.  </li>
            <li> , it was about $15 less when I bought it back in July.  </li>
            <li> I dont wake up with red eyes like other reviews have said about the other products.</li>
            <li> Totally works as long as you use it everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say a bottle should last you around a month and a half.</li>
            <li> My sister used this for a few months and the next thing I know, her lashes were insanely long and darker than they used to be.</li>
            <li> long and thick but natural, not overdone or anything.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical  at first, but definitely works.</li>
            <li> My eyes are pretty sensitive, so I was afraid it would cause me irritation.  </li>
            <li> This product really works, I have people asking me all the time if my eyelashes are false or mine, when I assure them that they are my eyelashes, then they ask me what did I do to make them get so long.</li>
            <li> My (once) thick eyelashes have barely grown back and they were SO sparse.</li>
            <li> eyes felt a little dry the next day</li>
            <li> Before I started using this product, my lashes were a mess from continuously wearing falsies and individual lashes.</li>
            <li> No need to pay thousands of dollars per year in lash extensions or to mess with falsies, this product will give you the same look without the hassle or expense.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been playing around with different eyelash serums and this was the one that finally gave me the long and thick eyelashes</li>
            <li> they were never long and usually uneven length</li>
            <li> I lost every single eyelash!  </li>
            <li> I get compliments evey single time I go out!</li>
            <li> Thought this product would work for me as it has over 800 positive reviews, but sadly, after 4 months, my lashes are the same length.</li>
            <li> They might be a little longer where the old growth is, but this product is NOT WORTH $60!  </li>
            <li> My little short lashes have never been so happy.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> and I notice a little irritation initially, but nothing I can&#x27;t deal with.  </li>
            <li> My formerly blonde lashes are now brown, a little thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> I started noticing a little extra length to my lashes when curling them--</li>
            <li> i would saying i still waiting for the result, i can see the a little approved by another 2 or 3 weeks later.</li>
            <li> and I think it may take me a little while as my lashes were damaged from trying the individual ones!</li>
            <li> /&gt;2nd week, my lashes have grown a Little longer, BIG difference when i put the mascara on</li>
            <li> Accidently, I put it close to my eye and dripped a little, it only irritated my eye momentarily.</li>
            <li> but if you use it religiously your bound to see a little bit of length</li>
            <li> Also, I got little sty pimples at my lash line later using the product</li>
            <li> Lids were a little red where I applied it and</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using GrandeLASH MD for as long as they make it!!!</li>
            <li> At the least I imagined that for nearly $40 I might get SOME results.... Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> My lids have a red cast, but figure that is a small price to pay for these long lashes.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes began thinning and became lighter in color beginning in my late 30&#x27;s early 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Often I don&#x27;t even need to wear mascara - they are long and dark enough for everyday wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried a few eyelash growth serums and this is the only one that works.....</li>
            <li> Some empty spaces can be notice between my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> So I used it only a few times a week.</li>
            <li> , it did nothing to grow the missing lashes back.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money after putting up with red eyes for weeks!</li>
            <li> I have naturally thin, straight lashes and Grandelash after about a month of use has increased the length and thickness dramatically.  </li>
            <li> I even got lashes in the bottom where I never really had</li>
            <li> I had gaps and my lash line was very sparse and thin.</li>
            <li> For a few weeks I would use it 4 or 5 out of a 7-day week and then eventually went back to using it every night.</li>
            <li> and still my eyelashes stay long, dark and noticeable.</li>
            <li> It does sting a bit but just apply carefully</li>
            <li> It thickens and lengthens your lashes in just a few short weeks.</li>
            <li> I only got a few lashes from it anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep trying and use it up but not much hope.  </li>
            <li> Only used that one a few days, but threw it out.  </li>
            <li> When the product arrived, it was basically empty.</li>
            <li> I spent over $50.00 on an empty gold tube.</li>
            <li> I expected something along the lines of either longer, fuller, or darker lashes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now, and I can see a big difference!</li>
            <li> Tried Latisse before from my doctor and it may have helped a bit but not much</li>
            <li> the vial was empty.</li>
            <li> I guess expected a miracle.  </li>
            <li> Took a few months to fully see all growth, but a big difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks every night before bed on my brows and upper and lower lash lines.</li>
            <li> Please be careful with this product.</li>
            <li> Their website is misleading so read it carefully.</li>
            <li> I had only a few eyebrows</li>
            <li> I have also seen growth in my lower lashes, which I&#x27;ll explain in a sec.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product  once daily for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Not much written on it by consumers</li>
            <li> Not really seeing any results from this and have been using it faithfully for both the brows and eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks, I noticed my glasses were getting blurry in the center.  </li>
            <li> Also, a few places in my brows have grown back in.  </li>
            <li> Three weeks into it, I feel like I have pink eye.</li>
            <li> I Look as if I aged 5 years in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> but I had read reviews and expected this.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t quite what I expected, based on what I saw with the girls in the office that day, but then again, they said you have to apply it morning and night.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.  </li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no side effects from Latisse.  </li>
            <li> I wear contacts regularly and switched to my glasses for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts regularly and switched to my glasses for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have to be careful to use minimal mascara or it looks overdone.</li>
            <li> However, be careful, it can burn eyes.</li>
            <li> Made my eyes pink for two days.  </li>
            <li> so that was what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have very short and few eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I will be a lifelong user of this product</li>
            <li> If they a minus stars it would have been 5.</li>
            <li> It may be expensive but if you want longer thicker lashes it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I also woke up a few times with bloodshot and itchy eyes -- however this side effect was temporary and after being awake for a few minutes the redness would completely subside.</li>
            <li> Now that I ran out and have not been as religiously using it, I slowly noticed that the length gets shorter, and the fullness and thickness are starting to diminish.</li>
            <li> In the outside corner of my right eye 1 lash grew larger then the other but very, extremely thin (like weak).</li>
            <li> In the outside corner of my right eye 1 lash grew larger then the other but very, extremely thin (like weak).</li>
            <li> It can a little while to see improvement, but if you&#x27;re patient and consistently put it on your eyes at least once a day you will see improvement!</li>
            <li> My pale blonde</li>
            <li> Five years ago I ripped just about every single lash out (my first time using fake eyelashes).</li>
            <li> My eyes itch like crazy; and are red/ bloodshot with huge dark bags under them.</li>
            <li> ridiculous transformation in just 4weeks so far.</li>
            <li> Then by day twenty,I looked in the mirror and suddenly realized how long and thick my lashes had become.</li>
            <li> The lashes were definitely longer and by 8 or 9 weeks they were long and thick including the lowere lashes.  </li>
            <li> However, I did notice almost immediately after about 2-3 weeks I barely lost a lash anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Still using and down to a few times a week to keep it up!</li>
            <li> I have long lashes and a little fuller</li>
            <li> Next thing -- this is all in the course of about a week -- they are so long I have to be careful putting on mascara because otherwise they can look slightly ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I had a quick and bad reaction to this product - very red and sore eyelids after 4-5 days of the recommended use.</li>
            <li> I now use every other night for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has  </li>
            <li> I admit I was skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> so I now use it every other day for maintenance.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are noticably longer and are not &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34; as I have seen with other products.  </li>
            <li> I was not willing to pay the $60</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but it really works!</li>
            <li> Have not tried any other products since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other eyelash enhancers and this one does work.  </li>
            <li> Never heed other people reviews if they are not Amazon Verified Purchase.</li>
            <li> The reviews here are from other site.</li>
            <li> Inside it has a small paper with instructions.ct (during day only, during night the serum).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for the &amp;#34;long lash&amp;#34; results, but it does irritate my eyes and makes them burn, so I use it every other night.</li>
            <li> If I take a couple days off, and start using every other day, I have no issues.  </li>
            <li> I went into Ulta the other day, and even the salesgirl couldn&#x27;t get over my lashes.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to other products.</li>
            <li> I have used other enhancers before (Latisse, Revitalash)</li>
            <li> I was allergic to Latisse and all the other lash builders on the market did not produce an iota of growth or length until again</li>
            <li> Also, im not sure if directly related to the product</li>
            <li> Will tell other about it.</li>
            <li> Well, I wanted to track the length of my lashes with this product over a long period of time as opposed to just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> news is after you get to your desired length you can use it every other day.</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical about trying another eyelash enhancer but GrandeLash absolutely works!</li>
            <li> I started with applications morning and night, then dropped to once a day or every other day once I reached my desired results.</li>
            <li> It took about 6 weeks of using it every other day to get the results I wanted.  </li>
            <li> other days not at all )  </li>
            <li> I started wiping the wand off so that the amount applied is reduced due to my eyes getting irritated.  </li>
            <li> Applied the product every other day.</li>
            <li> The other day I didn&#x27;t feel like wearing mascara</li>
            <li> thought I&#x27;d try GrandeLash after reading some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> I never got results like this from any other product.</li>
            <li> think I&#x27;ll try applying every other day to see if it lessens the darkening, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> ; - I did about 3 weeks on, 1 week off, and now I do every other week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now using it every other night.</li>
            <li> Ladies don&#x27;t look for other eyelash enhancer...</li>
            <li> After achieving the growth I backed off to every other day and eventually once a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this over the others because the other reviews stated how the liquid irritated the eyes.</li>
            <li> No itching or Irritation but pink!</li>
            <li> I had tried almost all the other eye enhancers &amp; nothing compares to Grande LASH MD.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m CERTAINLY not willing to spend $160.00 to find out in one month.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then last week I took a small compact 10X mirror and got a closer look.</li>
            <li> I have tried a dozen other products, some worked , some didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate, unlike other brands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are talking about.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so I am not sure why, but after I stopped using it everyday and did it every two to three days, my eyes settled down and it didn&#x27;t seem to affect the growth any.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the product for almost 2 months and have seen very minimal results.</li>
            <li> It was very minimal and doesn&#x27;t happen anymore.</li>
            <li> I have even had to trim a few lashes because they are too long!</li>
            <li> I used it for a few days, and when I stopped using it they stopped falling out a few days later...</li>
            <li> Completely changes my short, thin, blond lashes!</li>
            <li> , maybe the red will fade away in time, after i stop using it everyday and go to using just a few times a week as directed,will see i guess?</li>
            <li> Also, a trail of small hairs started to grow from my eyes down my cheeks, they were actually noticeable too!</li>
            <li> I mean demon vampire from hell red, not just slightly pink.</li>
            <li> My missing lashes were back and they were long and thick.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes, in a past life, were short, thin, and nearly invisible even with mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to using once every other day as maintenance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried RapidLash in the past and several other products with little to no results but thought id give GrandeLash a try.</li>
            <li> My lashes have been thin due to age and to top it off I added fake lashes which pulled out the little I had.</li>
            <li> By the second month I could hardly believe it.  </li>
            <li> It was hard enough loosing the hair on my head but loosing my eyelashes too..</li>
            <li> Before using this product my eyelashes were very short and hardly visible.</li>
            <li> I used the product 3 days in row, and I had a dull headache by the end of the day each day, and totally bloodshot eyes.</li>
            <li> No burning of or dark marks around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Also it made the area under my eyes dark.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Dark circles NEVER improved.</li>
            <li> They grew to the opposite direction, no natural form, extremely thin and not curly.</li>
            <li> I never had dark circles before and never use make up to cover imperfections around my eyes.</li>
            <li> They grew to the opposite direction, no natural form, extremely thin and not curly.</li>
            <li> I never had dark circles before and never use make up to cover imperfections around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product I didn&#x27;t realli expect my eyes to go red like some others complained.</li>
            <li> I did not like that and another issue is that it caused dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> As soon as I stopped using the product the dark circles went away.</li>
            <li> Sadly maybe it is just my brows, but I didn&#x27;t see much difference at all.</li>
            <li> Not sure what long term effects this could cause but its an avoidable issue if you apply correctly.</li>
            <li> Thanks to getting ill</li>
            <li> This product absolutely works, it looks like I have fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Only complaint doesn&#x27;t make them fuller</li>
            <li> It Really does work,  My lashes look fake.  </li>
            <li> Then, I began to notice that I was getting dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Its not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Now, after at least a week of not using the product, I am still experiencing symptoms as described above.</li>
            <li> I have given up on it, not worth the pain and redness of eye.</li>
            <li> Not really worth all the burning, excruciating pain in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and saw no change the first few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it...</li>
            <li> As I aged (I&#x27;m 62), my once long and thick eyelashes got shorter and sparse.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is it darkened my eyelid slightly.</li>
            <li> i cut the usage down to once a day for another month,</li>
            <li> You see it is a liquid and turning it upside down does make it spill all over.</li>
            <li> Works hands down.  </li>
            <li> Eyelashs are falling down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that it takes longer for this to work than with other products, but the cost can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> This product went on well, following direction, I applied it for 4 weeks, after shower in morning, then again at night, nothing, i mean nothing changed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really not one to write reviews about this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Dark circles still there but less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Dark circles still there but less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I do have a slight dark area around my eye but not so noticible as others have indicated.</li>
            <li> I waited to write this review since other serums I have used stopped working after a few months.  </li>
            <li> I did that for a few days and decided to apply to lashes every other day.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely tell you that it increases the amount of lashes, the length, and even a little bit how thick the lashes are.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and much less expensive than a prescription!</li>
            <li> This costs much less than Latisse</li>
            <li> This works like Latisse costs much less.  </li>
            <li> This product works in less than the time indicated on the instructions</li>
            <li> Less so with the volume, but a noticeable improvement for sure.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I thought I would try it out for less through Amazon.</li>
            <li> but my eyes started to show signs of irritation, redness and slight inflammation.  </li>
            <li> I heard it had less of the side effects.</li>
            <li> After using it for 3 months, I started noticing my lashes are slightly longer and now, after 4 months, its fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> I get asked on a regular basis if my eyelashes are fake, because with mascara they are giant.</li>
            <li> and it is just slight itching</li>
            <li> Eyebrows look slightly thicker.</li>
            <li> From previously using semi permanent lash extensions my lashes have suffered.</li>
            <li> I am 1/4 Japanese and unfortunately got the Asian lashes.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one cause it was less money.</li>
            <li> It works-but was disappointed that my first one didn&#x27;t last 3 mos.</li>
            <li> eyes did  look bloodshot after the application and have been slightly itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Losing less lashes now too.</li>
            <li> I have previously used Lilash and that worked as well-</li>
            <li> so the less chemicals you apply to them</li>
            <li> I do see an improvement in lash length and slight improvement in darkness.  </li>
            <li> Half the price though which I like.</li>
            <li> Would give it less if I could.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two and a half months</li>
            <li> When I have no mascara on, you can still see my previously invisible lashes.</li>
            <li> It works, but causes darkening and slight irritation of the skin.</li>
            <li> They are slightly darker.  </li>
            <li> In just two weeks I noticed a slight improvement in the length of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that without any make up, my brown lashes are now BLACK.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stop using it daily and maybe cut back to 3 days a week because they are beginning to look fake and are rubbing on the insides of my sunglasses.  </li>
            <li> looks to work just as well and less than $30.</li>
            <li> It shortened them and I  lost over half.</li>
            <li> I could tell after a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say they are darker because mine were black to begin with.</li>
            <li> This product DEFINITELY works, as evidenced by people asking me almost daily if I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes.</li>
            <li> they are now thicker and darker with less gray.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other brands (City lash, Olay, Rimmel, Loreal) and saw little to no difference in lashes.  </li>
            <li> While using the product I got dark circles but VERY dark.</li>
            <li> While using the product I got dark circles but VERY dark.</li>
            <li> Upon first though I have to say it was awkward to use because I don&#x27;t use makeup/mascara...</li>
            <li> After three months of nightly application of this product, my eyelashes seem incredibly long and thick.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes were so thick and long</li>
            <li> Long, fuller, thick lashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now they are amazingly long and thick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and noticed my lashes weren&#x27;t as long or thick as they used to be.</li>
            <li> I have long and thick lashes.</li>
            <li> and they are still long and thick.</li>
            <li> Now they are long and thick.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are so long and thick</li>
            <li> It caused a little discomfort and slight redness at first but my skin&lt;br /&gt;soon adapted to it and my lashes grew in like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a dramatic difference in my lashes after only two months, but no real difference with my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It took a little bit for me to notice growth, but now have thick long lashes.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Boosting serum, I&#x27;ve tried as well, twice, with little to no results.  </li>
            <li> I think lashes look a little longer.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get going</li>
            <li> After a little over 4 weeks, there has been no change.</li>
            <li> In the beginning I did experience a little redness in my eyes and lids.  </li>
            <li> I no longer had little gaps and my lashes were thicker and darker.</li>
            <li> I will try it a little longer since I have already bought it, but I can&#x27;t see any improvement yet.</li>
            <li> I was a little we worried about using any product.</li>
            <li> ONE night of using this (one little swipe across each eye lid NOT too close to the lash line)</li>
            <li> (And works a little on they eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Some length and a little thickness</li>
            <li> Latisse made my lashes a little longer but then my lashes stopped growing.</li>
            <li> Not worth the discomfort!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to suffer through some god awful side-effects this MIGHT be awesome, but just be warned there will probably be side effects...horrible, horrible side effects.</li>
            <li> They are a little darker.  </li>
            <li> It itched a little for about a week, but stopped, and it hasn&#x27;t changed my eye lense color at all.</li>
            <li> Just remember results will take a little time</li>
            <li> so I will sometimes have little &amp;#34;bald spots&amp;#34; in my lashline.  </li>
            <li> Helps a lot but wish it could make lashes a little longer.</li>
            <li> My lashes MAY have grown a little but not like I was told it would.  </li>
            <li> Just need little time and patients.</li>
            <li> I just started a little while ago</li>
            <li> I plan to try it again after a little time passes.</li>
            <li> I might have seen a little bit of growth.</li>
            <li> and although I noticed some difference in my lashes, it&#x27;s not significant, which is why I was going to wait to week 10.</li>
            <li> I had to cut down to using it to two days a week because they were getting out of control!</li>
            <li> WOW!..this does work…you need to use it 2X/daily to see the effects, then down to 1X/daily (at night) for maintenance, but you will see regrowth of both your eyelashes and eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I translate that to be WATERED DOWN!</li>
            <li> I hope the length of my lashes get even longer but other than that, this product works!!</li>
            <li> I have bought it a few time....</li>
            <li> i tried to get a return but could not based upon a few days after the amazon &amp;#34;1 month warranty&amp;#34;, and then perhaps it would be it was opened or used.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Although, you do not have to use it everyday, just continue to use it once a week or so.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week now as maintenance and have no problems with sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> People noticed that my eyes were bloodshot and looked like I had been crying.  </li>
            <li> Those few lashes that grew longer</li>
            <li> Only some of them grew longer but extremely thin not noticeable without mascara.</li>
            <li> Those few lashes that grew longer</li>
            <li> Only some of them grew longer but extremely thin not noticeable without mascara.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to waste it</li>
            <li> but it dried my eyes, so I decided to change brand to give a rest to my eyes...</li>
            <li> I used it as directed for 4 weeks and a few days on both lashes and brow.</li>
            <li> I find that if I do not use it regularly, my eye lashes do thin out some, so I do find that using it both morning and night helps my lashes stay longer.  </li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;ve been proven wrong.</li>
            <li> I am the type of person who gets discouraged after doing something for a few days and seeing no results.</li>
            <li> I also must say about 3 weeks ago I misplaced the tube i was using</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Can not see any difference waste of money.</li>
            <li> Definitely did find that to be irritating</li>
            <li> I missed a few nights here and</li>
            <li> I get comments everyday about my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li> were so short and thin.</li>
            <li> Some say it takes a few weeks.</li>
            <li> or I put it on to heavily and its ran in my eye.</li>
            <li> Lasts a few months, then I buy another.</li>
            <li> I did experience some faint discoloration on my eyelids, but it&#x27;s not objectionable as it looks like a soft eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Within a few (3?)</li>
            <li> &#x27;dead eyed&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was careful to apply it to the lash line, not too thick so to not have it ooze into my eyes.</li>
            <li> However it does take a few months so be patient.</li>
            <li> I noticed my eyelashes started growing after 4 weeks of applying twice a day everyday.</li>
            <li> Although it takes a few weeks longer to see results, this product works just as well as Latisse, at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> I waited a few days then tried the drops again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use everyday, I forget sometimes.  </li>
            <li> but I use it on my lashes a few times a week</li>
            <li> I used it every day until my short, thin lashes grew to my eyebrows (curled)- took about four weeks.</li>
            <li> Get compliments everyday.  </li>
            <li> My lashes were short and thin.  </li>
            <li> I use once everyday at nite..</li>
            <li> A few months ago I decided to get lash extensions.  </li>
            <li> did not help make my hair grow at all even for using for three weeks everyday</li>
            <li> Using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I forget to apply a few nights a week</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen an results yet and have been using faithfully everyday</li>
            <li> so sometimes you have a few longer strands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It take a few weeks to start seeing results</li>
            <li> or they look way too heavy.  </li>
            <li> a few lashes on each eye began to grow.  </li>
            <li> I used 2 times a day everyday for a month and gave up.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a change and feel it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> it may be cheaper, but it doesn&#x27;t work and is a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks, but I do see results.  </li>
            <li> even got a few pimples in my lash follicles.</li>
            <li> was a waste of my money</li>
            <li> (2 bottles lasted me 4 months--however after 2 months I started to skip a few days here and there).</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in the growth of my eyelashes within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with this seller.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to notice</li>
            <li> it was not cheap.  </li>
            <li> so I just purchased my tube a few days ago from here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My husband actually asked if I was wearing false lashes.  </li>
            <li> They actually look false with one coat of mascara.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased some false eye lashes in May and the false eyelashes came out along with my real lashes.</li>
            <li> I will pay a few dollars extra and continue with a product that works and isn&#x27;t irritating.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, GrandLASH is almost half the price of Latisse!  </li>
            <li> Over time a slightly longer and fuller lash developes!</li>
            <li> Placing another order now since it seems the price has dropped in about half!</li>
            <li> I read that that was the case for a couple people in other reviews prior to using this stuff and was extremely skeptical.</li>
            <li> I honestly considered throwing it away because I was afraid I would go blind!</li>
            <li> so my eyelashes are pale.  </li>
            <li> B00QDUX1UC False Eyelashes - 70 Pairs in 7 Different Styles Allows You to Select Your Look From Natural to Dramatic!</li>
            <li> They are sooo much longer than the fake lashes that I used to wear!</li>
            <li> people I work with and family and friends have noticed how long and thick my lashes are!</li>
            <li> I seriously had to back off and use this no more than twice a week to keep from looking like Tammy Faye!</li>
            <li> My lashes were very weak and short due the all the eye lashes extensions in the past.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works, it was not as dramatic for me as some of the pictures</li>
            <li> After the first few times though, it wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> I even recommended it to a friend and when i saw her months later i noticed a dramatic increase in the length and thickness of her lashes.  </li>
            <li> The growth is very slight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but I think my eyebrows are a little thicker.</li>
            <li> because I believe the second one I purchased (for less money) is a fake, a knockoff.</li>
            <li> think this is my first time reviewing so badly a product in Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was pretty shocked that this worked so well.</li>
            <li> I probably skipped a few days but never more than 2 days, so always 6/7 days out of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, although my eyelashes have always been long they are so sparse and thin that mascara always looks clumped.  </li>
            <li> After approximately 6 weeks you won&#x27;t believe how long your lashes are …..…..  </li>
            <li> It can cause redness, but usually goes away in a few days.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted this to work, but all it is doing so far is irritating the crap out of my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that I don&#x27;t have thick eyebrows and dark eyelashes, so I wanted to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> They are now just as long as my false lashes were.  </li>
            <li> Recommended this by a friend who told me it was the secret to her incredibly long lashes and this stuff works!</li>
            <li> far, Amazon.com is the least expensive place to buy it.</li>
            <li> I also have dry eye, so mascara is irritating</li>
            <li> and I have already seen a little bit of a difference!</li>
            <li> so I get a very little bit of irritation when I start using it again if I&#x27;ve taken a break</li>
            <li> This time I&#x27;m seeing very little growth and fullness</li>
            <li> I had very little expectation of this product tbh.</li>
            <li> Very little product.</li>
            <li> like the product but often the wand comes with very little product in it .</li>
            <li> Please be careful!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried individual lash extensions and found them too high maintenance, and I was always a bit fearful of latisse because of the risk of changing the color of your iris.</li>
            <li> Very noticeable and painful.</li>
            <li> I had some sad eyelashes prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I received an allergic reaction from the product and had to seek medical attention.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say within 3 weeks I noticed and a few weeks after that the compliments from others started!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, not many reviewers had issues with this product.  </li>
            <li> Inside it has a small paper with instructions.</li>
            <li> My friend gets extensions and she&#x27;s like you lashes look unbelievable</li>
            <li> I had to go to work with people constantly asking me what was wrong with my eyes.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not cute.</li>
            <li> I actually have a weird ocd disorder in which I pull out my eyebrows and eyelashes when I get stressed.</li>
            <li> It usually goes away within an hour of waking up for me if i put it on too close the night before.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product.</li>
            <li> Not sure about longer</li>
            <li> to counter act the redness and apply my shadow as usual.  </li>
            <li> Without mascara, I am not sure anyone would notice, but one coat</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and like it.</li>
            <li> I.get lazy or forget some nights.</li>
            <li> so im not sure if it works or not.</li>
            <li> No more fake lashes for me, i can just apply mascara and have the same effect...</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t need to use mascara everyday!</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse in the past</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice a difference until this past week.</li>
            <li> Not sure what that is all about</li>
            <li> my bottle is now empty and my lashes look worse than they ever have.</li>
            <li> I applied the product as indicated in the package but after the first use i have horrible bruised eyes, I definitely will not continue using this product at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now and have never been happier with my lashes!</li>
            <li> I only had the product for a couple of weeks when the brush broke off inside the tube, rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would get it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about fullness either</li>
            <li> (I usually apply twice a day).</li>
            <li> Last night someone asked me if I had false eyelashes on!</li>
            <li> it makes your lashes feels like hard or stiff.  </li>
            <li> it makes your lashes feels like hard or stiff.  </li>
            <li> The product needs to be applied to the base of the lid right where the eyelashes meet the eyelids.  </li>
            <li> there was only a very thin line.  </li>
            <li> and I have very thin blonde lashes</li>
            <li> it was like a miracle , my lashes went from thin stubby and hardly visible to long and thick , to the point that they hit my sunglasses.</li>
            <li> After ten days of my lashes looking the same, I was disappointed, but decided to at least finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> Never experienced any burning like other reviews.</li>
            <li> I already have some of that already since I&#x27;ve gotten a bit older, and it was really bad using this.</li>
            <li> After a whole month my lashes actually look worse!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had slight redness (very, very hard to notice) around the skin by the corners of my eyes and where the serum was applied to.</li>
            <li> What I hate is that the price has gone way way way up since my first order.</li>
            <li> All my friends ask me if i have  fake lashes,that&#x27;s how long they are</li>
            <li> I would get asked if they were fake lashes because they looked so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its person based reaction or it is common with everybody who uses it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m now backing down to once per day, maintenance, since I&#x27;m getting a \\&quot;false lash\\</li>
            <li> I would like to thank GrandLASH for coming up with a less irritating formula than Latisse &amp; Lilash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got random brow hairs sprouting up around my brows (and then I have to pluck them), but no new growth in the sparse patches of my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ow!(like soap in eyes but less painful actually)</li>
            <li> Not sure what I could have done wrong compared to the other days.</li>
            <li> an had hardly any lashes to even put mascara on.</li>
            <li> I can hardly see any improvement.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell, irritated eyes.</li>
            <li> This product has enhanced my eyebrows so I hardly use any pencil now.  </li>
            <li> But it makes my eyes burn and get very dry and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Latisse but hated the separate brush and either got too little or too much on it.</li>
            <li> I was distraught until I read the reviews on this product and instantly ordered it.</li>
            <li> night:after application following instructions my eyes were itching and burning like crazy</li>
            <li> That sucks.</li>
            <li> I have at least five others.  </li>
            <li> I bought the 2ml tube and have been using it now for at least 3 or 4 months.  </li>
            <li> I did not experience any burning (unless clumsy me literally got some in my eye...</li>
            <li> Common sense applies too....</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t get to try it for at least a month anyways.....</li>
            <li> now I get asked at least once a week if.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike is that my lower lashes have grown from it spreading in my sleep, they aren&#x27;t crazy, but it&#x27;s a side note.</li>
            <li> but I want to say I&#x27;ve noticed at least 1/4 inch growth.</li>
            <li> I felt clumsy...</li>
            <li> To say the least, I looked like a crack head</li>
            <li> I was desperate for anything to grow my eyelashes back!</li>
            <li> I would give this a negative 5 stars if that were an option.</li>
            <li> try to slowly ween yourself off of it.</li>
            <li> I had thin, uneven, eyelashes with gaps.</li>
            <li> but I could tell that they were coming in thick</li>
            <li> I used to wear thick liner to help thicken the look of lashes</li>
            <li> Gave to a friend and her lashes got really thick.</li>
            <li> even it&#x27;s unbelievable!</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean).  </li>
            <li> But seriously--once you get past that stage this product RULES!</li>
            <li> But seriously--once you get past that stage this product RULES!</li>
            <li> The first few days it gave me a terrible headache</li>
            <li> I was shocked that my facial hair was thicker and darker in this small 1\\&quot; diameter patch under each eye.</li>
            <li> One tube is very expensive and it only lasted 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have very small eyelashes</li>
            <li> My previously-short lashes are so long now, it&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> My lashes are crazy long.</li>
            <li> I have some crazy long ones.....</li>
            <li> This works just as well as Latisse and much much less!!!  </li>
            <li> When I was left with lousy lashes after walking around with lash extensions for half a year, I was very disappointed with the short, beat up,</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because it was DRY and barely any product to apply.</li>
            <li> My lashes are crazy long!  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are sooo crazy long!</li>
            <li> but this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re thinking about buying it, seriously go for it.</li>
            <li> I had serious doubts about it working</li>
            <li> I was looking for something less expensive.  </li>
            <li> so when I came across this product ( much less expensive than others I&#x27;ve seen )</li>
            <li> I even began to use this on my eyebrows and they turned darker (in a noticeable, yet subtle way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously-</li>
            <li> it was almost ridiculous ...</li>
            <li> I just finished a lot of research and was going to switch to a less expensive option, but since I KNOW this one works, I decided to keep with this product.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes look CRAZY LONG!!!</li>
            <li> You have to be patient as it takes a few weeks to see any results, but my lashes look fake.</li>
            <li> Just walking outside with my eyes cast downwards would cause a painful stinging sensation in my eyes the likes of which I&#x27;ve never felt before</li>
            <li> I read about this in a few blogs and though skeptical I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I spent a week in the Trauma Dept this summer after a terrible accident and the nurses kept trying to &amp;#34;remove my lashes&amp;#34; and several asked me what brand and/ or glue</li>
            <li> It did the same thing to my eyelids after two weeks of use :(</li>
            <li> (One tube lasts at least 4 months when used as directed!)</li>
            <li> I only use it twice a week, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed, I&#x27;ve already bought another tube to continue using after the initial 3 month period.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works because after the first use I woke up with a horrible migraine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working but very slowly.</li>
            <li> now  i use it once a week because my lashes are crazy long!!!!!!</li>
            <li> again Grandalash, even after one bad experience i ordered once and got empty one.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ve shared my secret with anyone who asks.</li>
            <li> i never experienced this before</li>
            <li> (looks like I had some broken blood vessels) and</li>
            <li> I discontinued use of Grande Lash approximately 2 weeks ago</li>
            <li> It took approximately 5 - 6 weeks to get these results.</li>
            <li> After 10 days of using it, I noticed my eyelash are grew approximately 1-2 cms</li>
            <li> too irritating for use around the lashline</li>
            <li> received the product promptly and everything seemed great...until I began using the product ordered from Grande Naturals and my lashes began to thin and fall out.  </li>
            <li> I was tired and got it in my eye</li>
            <li> and I was not happy with the way they looked.  </li>
            <li> (even worse than staring into the sun with no eye protection).</li>
            <li> I have NEVER experienced any burning or stinging.</li>
            <li> O gave them my secret.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted and buy this about every 2 months.  </li>
            <li> I have always had really short lashes and hate wearing mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to their length, darkness and volume.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately,  I don&#x27;t have thick brows.</li>
            <li> I have always had thin, broken lashes.</li>
            <li> My brows were thin and graying...</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, a couple of days ago one of my friends asked me if I had false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Everyone thinks I am wearing false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I had no desire to use false eyelashes</li>
            <li> My hair stylist (whom I thought had false eyelashes) uses this and turned me on to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been asked if I wear false lashes while wearing mascara.</li>
            <li> I had false lashes and pulled on them</li>
            <li> She also bought this product with a set of false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> My lashes look like they are false.</li>
            <li> I look like i have false lashes, no joke.</li>
            <li> I had Novalash false lashes for over a year.  </li>
            <li> i no longer need false lashes.  </li>
            <li> (I had to wear false eyelashes).</li>
            <li> With mascara on, even family members asked if I had false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Nothing too serious, but after using this you could not tell at all!</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> it considering the dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I applied every day, and after about 7 - 8 weeks, I have seen dramatic  results.</li>
            <li> No more fake eyelashes, yippee!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes touch the lenses too much on my old sunglasses, which is annoying, so I had to switch!</li>
            <li> Say bye-bye to false eye lashes or those expensive extensions.  </li>
            <li> A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Alsome!!!your lashes do grow very long and thick!!!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;very disappointing.  and very dishonest.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin around my eyes darker however, and that is creepy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just expensive.  </li>
            <li> Guess ill</li>
            <li> So sad</li>
            <li> TOO EXPENSIVE PRODUCT, OVER RATED, RESULTS NOT</li>
            <li> It is too expensive for what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> After my experience I realize this reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> Like a twisted lean leg of a spider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like a twisted lean leg of a spider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am still waiting for the ill side effects to go away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m worried that some have broken off too!</li>
            <li> : I was wrong.</li>
            <li> They do look fake.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this lash serum</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was devastated.  </li>
            <li> People ask me if I&#x27;m wearing fake or eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m unable to use but a handful of products on my skin.  </li>
            <li> My eyes were swollen for 4 days and unable to work .</li>
            <li> People think I have on fake lashes</li>
            <li> Ill post another review after I see results</li>
            <li> About 6 months ago I ran out and decided not to replace it as it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> This is not going to give you eyelashes like fake ones, but there is a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> My husband thought I put fake lashes on.</li>
            <li> The reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because unfortunately once you start using it you have to use it forever.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using GrandeLash for years, I have to admit I&#x27;m addicted to it!</li>
            <li> I received the wrong item.  </li>
            <li> After only 2 days of applying this awful product my eyelids felt like they were on fire for an excruciating week.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but read reviews and purchased.</li>
            <li> It is my guilty pleasure.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical -</li>
            <li> sounds silly</li>
            <li> It was so scary.</li>
            <li> and I am sad</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> All I&#x27;ve heard is my lashes look fake.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s was really scary.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately my eyes weren&#x27;t having it.</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> A friend asked if I was wearing false eyelashes!</li>
            <li> everyone thinks I have false eye lashes!  </li>
            <li> People think I am wearing false eyelashes!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows were very thin</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for 6 weeks now and can see a dramatic change!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and unhappy that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was hoping for dramatic results. :(</li>
            <li> When it would get in my eyes, it would burn a little, but nothing awful like soap in your eyes.</li>
            <li> They look weird, ugly, like a deform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still using olive oil</li>
            <li> They look weird, ugly, like a deform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still using olive oil</li>
            <li> redness and the itchiness was crazy for the 2-4days.</li>
            <li> This is a dangerous product that should be taken off the market!***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went through two fake products before I found Revitalash, and this was one of the fake, worthless products.  </li>
            <li> Everyone was asking whether they are mine or artificial.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I&#x27;ve been to afraid to try it again.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s eyelashes grew like crazy.  </li>
            <li> but wasn&#x27;t so crazy I had to clip them.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks I look like i have fake eyelashes compared to what they looked like before!  </li>
            <li> Yesterday, I applied as usual, but had a terrible side effect.</li>
            <li> Everyone thinks that my lashes are fake!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune, take tomine out for appointments or mangle my lashes trying to put fake ones on!</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> AS PROMISE, HORRIBLE SECONDARY EFFECTS.</li>
            <li> I hate fake reviews and dont understand why people would even write them.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve never looked so terrible because it takes the sparkle out of your eye!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical that this stuff would work</li>
            <li> the product makes my eyes serious swollen , supplier refuse to refund, too bad, very disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product really works.  I have been using it for two weeks and I can already tell a difference.</li>
            <li> Used for 3 months...lots of growth, HOWEVER!!!!...reddening of lids and under eyes, and yesterday woke up with HUGE black eye (obviously broken blood vessels, spreading over my entire lid- looks like I got slugged.) GOT THIS FROM AMAZON....maybe it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; on Amazon?</li>
            <li> Seems to be working.  Still waiting for final opinion.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely wonderful!  For the first time in my life I have eyelashes that actually look good.  I still use mascara to really show them up but I only need one coat.  But even without makeup I still &amp;#34;have&amp;#34; lashes :P&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this since my first review but just got a new order and the tube has the wording on it that Pam X. said in her review (June 15, 2016) is the &amp;#34;counterfeit&amp;#34; one.&lt;br /&gt;I did go to the Grandelash website and they show a tube with the wording that she says is the genuine stuff but they also show a tube with the wording that she says is counterfeit.  How do you know???  Snipping Tool photo attached</li>
            <li> Cause my vision to be blurry at times. I&#x27;ve not seen any improvement.  Will give it another couple of weeks though.</li>
            <li> I see some improvement to upper lashes, not so much on lower and nothing on brows. I was hoping that based on price I would have a better result.</li>
            <li> I was told that you should use it morning and evening if you are over 50 for some reason. I believe this speeds up the process and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This costs much less than Latisse but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  My friend had better luck.  So, you&#x27;re taking a chance with this product.</li>
            <li> She had some eyelash weave done and it lasted about 2 weeks. Once she started using this her lashes are amazing and super sexy!!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see fantastic results, but no problems with redness or any irritation.</li>
            <li> I like the product but sometimes it irritates my eyes.  My lashes are definitely longer though.</li>
            <li> It took awhile to start working but now I am seeing a difference. I will buy another tube very soon.</li>
            <li> This works like Latisse costs much less.  I highly recommend.  It is easy to apply and I noticed results within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this and only used it twice before it gave me very red, blood shot eyes. I stopped using the product, hoping the redness was caused by something else, but when I started using it again (only on my eyebrows) the redness returned. Redness lasted for weeks, even when usage stopped. Very disappointing. Will try prescription brand.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with Grandelash. I am an older woman and my eyelashes were thinning out and were getting shorter. After reading reviews here I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. After about two months I noticed my lashes were hitting my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I now use every other night for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has  anyone used Grandlash for  almost non existant eyebrows? Would appreciate hearing about it.  Thanks</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested this product instead of the more expensive Latisse. I got better results with this product. It is easier to apply with an eyeliner type tube and applicator. I use it twice a day and apply it to my lower lashes too. Last night someone asked me if I had false eyelashes on! The longer lashes make my eyes look more awake. I&#x27;ve been disappointed by so many anti aging products but not this one!</li>
            <li> This product brought back my long, full lashes!!  It happened so quickly.  I just love this product.  It is so easy to use and has the most amazing results in just 3 weeks!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after using another well know lash serum because it has such great reviews. Unfortunately, I did not experience anything great from using this product.  It gave me red itchy and puffy eyes the first week of use, but I continued using it expecting results.  The redness did go away after a week  so I continued use, however after almost two months my lashes have not grown at all and I have been using it religiously 2x a day.  I have thrown this out and have gone back to the lash serum I used before I have only been using it for a week and my lashes look amazing. I wish I could say the same for this product because I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li> This works to grow eyelashes, to be sure.  It makes the skin around my eyes darker however, and that is creepy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and don&#x27;t really notice any changes in eyelash length and volume. I try to be consistent by using it every night or every morning... I probably skipped a few days but never more than 2 days, so always 6/7 days out of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed is my eyelid area and under eye circles are getting darker? Not absolutely sure if it has to do with the Grand Lashe or not, but it&#x27;s quite noticeable and I have to put powder on my eyelids now. Before I never had to do that. Just wanted to see if anyone else experienced that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using it and waiting, will update again.</li>
            <li> Grande Lash is a miracle product that I have been using for a couple of years now.  I stopped using it once in favor of a cheaper brand and lived to regret it.  My lashes fell out and so I stopped using the inferior brand and started using GrandLash MD again.  Now my lashes are back to being lush and full!  Bravo Grande Lash MD for a superior product!!!!</li>
            <li> This product should be taken off the market. A single application as directed has caused severe injury to both of my eyes. Symptoms include burning, pain, light sensitivity, redness and $210 in doctor visits, prescriptions, and time off work.</li>
            <li> This product is great works really well......I have bought it a few time....it also darkens/fills in you eyebrows....love it</li>
            <li> I saved alittle money from not buying in my salon but this seemed not to be quite as strong. Took about a month longer to work.</li>
            <li> It has taken awhile for my lashes to grow, about 2-1/2-3 months, but they have just like with Latisse. The difference is I don&#x27;t have the brown color on my eyelids that Latisse leaves for most people. My lashes have also darkened where the new growth is. I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend. I used it for 30 days - posted the date on the container. I could NOT believe how amazing my eyelashes were after only 30 days. I&#x27;ve continued to use it ever since February. People started asking me - what have you done differently with your eyes? Strangers would say, \\&quot;Your eyes are amazing!\\&quot; I&#x27;ve shared my secret with anyone who asks. Often I don&#x27;t even need to wear mascara - they are long and dark enough for everyday wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I visited my eyebrow expert! She was blown away by the length of the top AND bottom lashes. I had to text and email the product information to her. That&#x27;s when I was finally motivated to submit a review. Wishing you much success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to it. My eyes got all red - couldn&#x27;t continue but my mom isn&#x27;t and she is loving the results.</li>
            <li> My mother was using this product and I could not believe how amazing her eyelashes looked!  She bought me my first tube and within 1 month, I could see a huge difference in the length and thickness of my lashes.  So much so that I slowed down and only use it once every 3 days.  I get compliments almost daily and have purchased 3 tubes for friends and family and am buying 2 more tubes today.  I wear contacts and have had no problem with irritation.  This product is much cheaper on Amazon, it normally retails for over $60.  I&#x27;m a skeptic but this product really works!</li>
            <li> Great product, pricing, shipping. Have used GrandeLASH MD  products over a year now. Thank you</li>
            <li> I buy this for a friend of mine, she loves it, enhanced her lashes to a new length.</li>
            <li> I would use it again,this one make my lash grow,but u have to use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Used on eyebrows. Did nothing!!!</li>
            <li> This product works in less than the time indicated on the instructions</li>
            <li> After going through chemo I had no lashes at all. Everything went into my eyes&lt;br /&gt;without them. Within two weeks of using Grand lash I had a good start, and I was so excited.  I would highly recommend this product. I still use it every night and my lashes are longer than ever before.</li>
            <li> It works great!  What I hate is that the price has gone way way way up since my first order.</li>
            <li> Incredible product! My lashes were short &amp; stubby from 14 months of lash extensions. They grew immediately- I&#x27;m talking the first week of use! Now, 2 months later, my lashes have never been so long in my life &amp; I&#x27;m 31! Will be purchasing again for sure.</li>
            <li> Results from LiLash worked so much better, but for the price, I may order another tube of GrandeLash. Wasn&#x27;t great...just ok.</li>
            <li> this was my first purchase of something Like this. It&#x27;s another costly. Actually VERY costly. BUT TESSA it DID truly work. So. I went and Bought 6 more FOR MUCH MUCH cheaper n they ALL WORKED PERFECTLY. ONE called select lash. Cost about $1.68 FOR 3 of them!!  Rapidlash Cost ME $70!!!&amp;#34; Aldo Loreal AND maybeline. BOTH extremely cheap. Almost FREE actually. I didn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d really working BUT Holt smoke&#x27;s.. my lashes I kid u NOT actually touch My eyebrows now!  I had to later OFF IT for another. Ha-ha. Honestly THO BOTH rapidlash $70 AND select lash 2 for $1.68 BOTH ARE Like lashes On CRACK! BOTH GREAT!  SO now depends On what ur comfortable spending.  Hope this help bcuz I never white reviews. Except when something really work&#x27;s is when I WILL write one!</li>
            <li> my eyebrows &amp; lashes are already filling in...jsut got it about 10 days ago...</li>
            <li> Great product...amazing results! It really does do what it says...I&#x27;ll never be without it! And Amazon is spot on, every time, with their delivery service!</li>
            <li> I admit I was skeptical at first.  I had some sad eyelashes prior to using this product.  And wouldn&#x27;t you know?  It definitely made my eyelashes longer.  Less so with the volume, but a noticeable improvement for sure.&lt;br /&gt;My husband calls this Rogaine for eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible lash extension experience.  After I lost a lot of my lashes I bought this product.  3 weeks later my eyelashes were back and longer than ever!  I love GrandeLASH MD.</li>
            <li> A girlfriend of mine bought this from a salon and started using it. She highly recommended it to me, so I bought some as well. In the past, I used Latisse and loved the results but got fed up with always having irritated eyelids. Because of that, I was somewhat hesitant to used Grandelash. I experienced very mild irritation in my eyes on maybe two occasions during the first week and that&#x27;s it. There was never any of the swelling or redness that I got with Latisse. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff religiously now for about 10 weeks and Oh. My. God. My lashes are amazing!!!! Having had short, straight, average lashes my whole life, I can truly appreciate what this product has done for me. I don&#x27;t always feel the need to put on mascara, as my lashes are now visible and curled without it. Best of all, when I do use a curler and mascara, people have asked if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes. I read that that was the case for a couple people in other reviews prior to using this stuff and was extremely skeptical. It&#x27;s actually true though. I&#x27;ve started recommending this to all my friends, and also just purchased the Grandelash mascara which is amazing as well. (Still love Benefit&#x27;s Roller Curl mascara though, I&#x27;ve been combining the too for great results.)</li>
            <li> Great product . does what it is suppose to do . very happy have told my Friends about it</li>
            <li> I starting using this product less than three weeks ago and I already have significantly longer lashes. No burning of or dark marks around the eyes. Great, great product. Will recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some impact if the size of my eyelashes, not overdone but there is a discrete effect</li>
            <li> Very happy with product</li>
            <li> It has enhanced my eyelashes and brows significantly.  My lashes have thickened, lengthened, and darkened and so have my brows.  I actually don&#x27;t need to apply makeup to my brows now.</li>
            <li> This works! Love it. My eyelashes are longer.</li>
            <li> It works!!&lt;br /&gt;I am 60, from an era of tweezing my eyebrows to the point there was only a very thin line.  Now that my hair is naturally thinning, due to age and decrease in hormones, I&#x27;ve had to resort to using an eyebrow pencil daily. Plus, although my eyelashes have always been long they are so sparse and thin that mascara always looks clumped.  Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, age 38, turned me on to Grande Lash. She began using it in June.  Best described as a naturalist - meaning she never wears a lot of makeup - I visited her in July and immediately noticed how long, dark and full her lashes were.  I thought she had a new mascara on!  Nope!  She had NO eye makeup on at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered and began using Grande Lash the middle of July.  For the first week or two I could not use it twice a day on my lashes.  Mainly because it seemed to irritate my eyes - making them feel a bit dry + red.  I did, however, continually use it twice a day on my brows.  By the third week I could tolerate twice a day on my lashes (I think I was probably using too much in the beginning.  &amp;#34;Less IS more&amp;#34; so follow directions!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was a place to post a picture.  My brows look dark and are filling in SO nicely + my eyelashes are much fuller!  I love this product and will continue to use it from now on!</li>
            <li> This stuff totally works!! And at first I loved it. But after a very short time, I had to stop using it all together because it was so irritating to my eyes, even when I tried to apply it lightly and infrequently. So bummed because it totally made my lashes grow!</li>
            <li> This is a great lash growing product - I&#x27;ve used it for about a year and get compliments on my eyelashes all the time!</li>
            <li> I have tried many from the drug stores, and found they all fell short. This product is absolutely the best product. Takes about 3 weeks and you will see fantastic results. My eyelashes are really long and darker too!&lt;br /&gt;Put it on like an eyeliner, morning and night , and watch them grow.</li>
            <li> i have used a couple of others lash enhancer products, (one good, the other not so good) but was taken by the positive feedback and low price.&lt;br /&gt;this one really irritated my eyes, leaving the red when i woke.  i never experienced this before so i thought perhaps it was my fault for putting too much on or being a sensitive time of the month, as regularly i don&#x27;t ever break out.  After a couple weeks of daily applying this stuff,  there was no changes,  so i stopped.  i tried to get a return but could not based upon a few days after the amazon &amp;#34;1 month warranty&amp;#34;, and then perhaps it would be it was opened or used.&lt;br /&gt;but the point is, the product didn&#x27;t do anything for my lashes, left me with red eyes and a red rash on the outside. warning. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a short time, and I&#x27;m already seeing my eyelashes longer and thicker. I&#x27;m not sure, but I think my eyebrows are a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Great product! Really works!</li>
            <li> Excellent product...it really does work!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Ordered my third MD Eyelash Enhancer recently.  After about a month of use my eyelashes were long so I now use it every other day for maintenance.  This product really worked for me.</li>
            <li> it doesnt work - not 1 lash in 3 months.</li>
            <li> Very good product . Not even three weeks of use and my lashes are fuller than before . Thanks , grande lash</li>
            <li> It really does work.  My lashes are noticably longer and are not &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34; as I have seen with other products.  I will be a faithful user.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I first heard about it from the Salon I go to- I was not willing to pay the $60+ they charged, so I thought I would try it out for less through Amazon. I was a bit skeptical, but it really works! My lashes are longer than they were. I was hoping to increase the fullness, which I don&#x27;t think it did, but they are longer. Was worth the money!</li>
            <li> No irritating side effects and works just as described- (would recommend using 2x per day if over 40 for desired results) this is my second tube and I&#x27;ll definitely be continuing!</li>
            <li> Loved it!!&lt;br /&gt;but when discontinued, eventually the effect is also lost</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I received an allergic reaction from the product and had to seek medical attention.  Another friend of mine had the same problem.</li>
            <li> This product is simply AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> This product really works. It&#x27;s a miracle. I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately three months and my lashes and eyebrows look spectacular. As a matter of fact, a couple of days ago one of my friends asked me if I had false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Within 3 weeks of using the product, my lashes were longer.  After 4 weeks, they were also fuller.</li>
            <li> the product makes my eyes serious swollen , supplier refuse to refund, too bad, very disappointed</li>
            <li> I had recently gotten single eyelash extensions, I loved them the first time and decided to get then again. The second time around didn&#x27;t go so smoothly. I ripped off half of my lashes maybe more. I was distraught until I read the reviews on this product and instantly ordered it. I use it morning and night and have seen excellent results. This stuff works! One downside would be the occasional irritation. This is a miracle product and I will continue to use it</li>
            <li> My lashes have been thin due to age and to top it off I added fake lashes which pulled out the little I had. This stuff does irritate your eyes. I found that my eyes were red every morning. Also it made the area under my eyes dark. BUT in 3 weeks my lashes grew significantly. I was pretty shocked that this worked so well. More length than volume but the volume is Better than before. 4 stars because  of the panda eyes. But works on lashes for sure! Can&#x27;t win them all I guess.</li>
            <li> Works great! My eyelashes are normally short and will not curl, thanks to this my eyelashes look great. You have to keep using it however or it will start to wear off. Although, you do not have to use it everyday, just continue to use it once a week or so.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! Mascara now optional!!!!</li>
            <li> ive tried the prescription strength and I swear the grandlash works better.</li>
            <li> Love my long lush lashes!</li>
            <li> My wife uses it and likes it</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes really growing  now ! It really worked on me. So happy with this product!! I am gonna keep use this,</li>
            <li> Used it twice a day for three weeks and my lashes grew longer and fuller. Good product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works if you follow the instructions, and the price is great. I highly recommend it.  It lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to purchase this product at a spa &amp; esthetics trade show in May.  Started using it the 2nd week of May, applying it every night to my brows, upper and lower lashes.  My brow and lashes are normally dark but fine.  By mid June there was a noticeable difference in my brows.  They were fuller and darker. Which is what prompted me to continue using it.  It wasn&#x27;t until July that there was a noticeable difference with my eyelashes.  Both upper and lower have more length.  However, I am not seeing much more volume or darkness with them.  It is now the beginning of August and my first tube is out. So basically, it took almost as long to see results as the product last.  Regardless, I am VERY happy with the results and will continue to use this product.  I&#x27;m hoping with continued use, the product continues to work.  I&#x27;ve tried Revitalash, which was much more expensive but stopped working after 6 mos or so, even with continued use and still did not achieve the results I&#x27;m getting with GrandLash.  L&#x27;Oreal Boosting serum, I&#x27;ve tried as well, twice, with little to no results.  When I purchased the GrandLash product, I was also given a sample of their mascara.  I&#x27;m actually impressed with the mascara as well.  It defines and adds a bit more length to the lashes without a lot of clumping and does not flake. It&#x27;s just expensive.  Maybe next paycheck but for now, I&#x27;m definitely ordering more of the GrandeLASH MD Enhancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/30/2015:  I actually stopped using this product after the 3rd purchase.  It was still working but my eyes started to show signs of irritation, redness and slight inflammation.  It also seemed that I was experiencing extra blurriness in the mornings.  Have not tried any other products since.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this product has worked for me so I decided to write one.  I started using this product in September because I was losing eyelashes due to stress and possibly getting older (ugh) and within about 4-6 weeks I noticed a difference and so did everyone else.  I have been asked several times if I have eyelash extensions!  Now that it is December, my eyelashes are thicker and longer than ever.  I had no side effects and now I only apply once every other day before I go to bed top and bottom lashes.  Because my skin is so sensitive, I only applied once a day every night and again I had no issues.  I just ordered another bottle even though I am not out of the original and another for my friend for Christmas.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> i hate my eyelashes so i got it and within months it worked so well it blew my mind. i love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works!  I noticed a co-worker with lush, long lashes and commented on them to her.  I am such a skeptic I would not have believed it if I had not noticed her lashes and tried it.  It caused a little discomfort and slight redness at first but my skin&lt;br /&gt;soon adapted to it and my lashes grew in like crazy.  I have to place my reading glasses further out along my nose or they are&lt;br /&gt;flutter against the lenses!  I use it a few times a week now as maintenance and have no problems with sensitivity.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> i am 28 years old and started using this product once in the morning and once at night for about 2 months and my lashes grew so long they were touching the lids of my eyes! i cut the usage down to once a day for another month, now  i use it once a week because my lashes are crazy long!!!!!! i love this product. this product takes time to see results though if you are older so be patient but it is worth the wait. i have very sensitive skin and eyes, and although this product does itch sometimes after long use, my eyes are fine, not red, not irritating, not changing color like other products on the market. i think anyone should def give this a try. I am know friends who have used this on there eyebrows and they grew in from nothing! the trick is you cant stop using it, because if you do your lashes or brows will return to what they were before. this is not permanant.</li>
            <li> I have been using GrandeLash MD for about a year now and it truly does work.  My eyelashes are longer and thicker and people ask me all the time \\&quot; do you use Latisse?\\&quot;. I happily tell them no, and tell them about GrandeLash MD.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s half the cost of Latisse, does not have the ingredient that may cause your iris to darken and a tube last about 3 months.  I should work for this company as I have probably sold over 50 tubes for them over the last year just by telling people what I use and where to get it.</li>
            <li> GrandeLASH MD definitely improved the length and dark color of my lashes after one month of use, but I was hoping for more dramatic results.  I did suffer some irritation at first, even receiving comments about how red my eyelids appeared to be.  But, with continued use - twice a day consistently - the irritation lessened.  I will continue to use the product in the hope my lashes will continue to improve.</li>
            <li> Only days and I see difference already. My eyelashes are longer and black love this product. I definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I honestly never post reviews, but this eyelash serum is beyond amazing! It can a little while to see improvement, but if you&#x27;re patient and consistently put it on your eyes at least once a day you will see improvement! For awhile I did it twice a day, and it worked even faster in my opinion. I just applied once in morning, and once at night. The first couple times you put it on, it will sting a little bit. But your skin will adjust. I am so happy with my eyelashes now, and how long they are! This serum is a great alternative to eyelash extensions, and they are real! My photos below are from March, April, and the last two are from May. Look how long they look! I would suggest this to all my friends and family! Try it out!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Have used for 60 days and the growth and thickening is obvious.  So, So, happy.</li>
            <li> Burn, baby, burn.  This stuff HURTS the eyes.  Rapidlash does not..  I recommend that.</li>
            <li> One of the few products I&#x27;ve ever written a review on but felt like i needed to because I LOVE this!! Have been using for about a year and so happy I started. My lashes are so long and look like they are eyelash extensions! This product has never irritated my eyes but it did for my friend so I know everyone is different! Will continue to buy</li>
            <li> Since I rely on product reviews so much before purchasing most items I thought it was only right to write a review myself.  This product works!  I first noticed my friends eyelashes and thought I&#x27;d give this a try myself.  I agree with the redness or irritation others have mentioned at first but it wasn&#x27;t anything that wasn&#x27;t tolerable and only lasted a couple of days.  I used morning and night and saw FAST results.  I&#x27;d say within 3 weeks I noticed and a few weeks after that the compliments from others started!  I continue to use morning and night and have even used this on my eyebrows with great results as well!  I have been told from complete strangers that my eyelashes are beautiful!  I&#x27;ve been asked if these are my real eyelashes!  Who doesn&#x27;t love a compliment....no matter how old you are (I&#x27;m 51 by the way)</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer, darker, thicker and fuller. I recommend it. It&#x27;s Worth the price and I received the product very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still too early to tell if this product works or not.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks, far short of the required 2 to 3 months to see any results.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will and quickly.  I have used it on my eyelashes and brows and have had amazing results!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have recommended this to a friend after she commented on my lashes and she LOVES it!  She said her lashes are 3mm longer after using it only a short period of time.</li>
            <li> Makes my eye itch. D so far see no visible difference. Going back to Latisse</li>
            <li> Eyelashes grew after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Takes patience but actually works!&lt;br /&gt;Some people might see results faster than others&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and see !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other eyelash enhancers and this one does work.  I have sparse lashes and always have had, but after using this for over a month my lashes are thicker and longer.  Granted all this is relative, I had short lashes before.  Nevertheless, they are much better now.  I used it twice a day at first and didn&#x27;t think it was working at all until after about 2 weeks.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This did work! Took some time but my lashes and brows grew longer. Did NOT get thicker tho but no complaint here BC longer is good for me</li>
            <li> i use it every day to keep my lashes at a desirable length.</li>
            <li> Ive bought this product before directly from the distriutor at a trade show in new york and loved the product. Made my lashes  longer, but after using it for a while i started getting gaps in my lashes . It seemed like they were breaking off, and my eye lides were really itchy. Then when i ordered it here, i never saw a differeance. My lashes didnt get any longer, but my eyelids did get itchy, and i got the breakage that left gaps again!  Guess ill just spend more money on mascaras instead.</li>
            <li> I have always used Latisse on my eyelashes and eyebrows prior to purchasing GrandLASH.  To my surprise, GrandeLASH works much quicker and my end results seem to be much better than while using Latisse.  Not to mention, GrandLASH is almost half the price of Latisse!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Went from nubs to long and beautiful lashes!</li>
            <li> I used the product once for the first time last night. I applied a light coat to my lashes. When I woke up this morning my eyes were bright red bloodshot, swollen and painful to the touch. I coudn&#x27;t even put my contacts in. It has been a couple hours and they are not getting better and are constantly watering. Luckily Amazon was kind enough to let me return even though I opened it.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I did exactly what it said to do and it did not work. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> I love it. Easy to use and it does work. I would recommend it to anyone who wants longer, fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> Amazeballs!  My lashes are crazy long!  I had to cut down to using it to two days a week because they were getting out of control!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  As I aged (I&#x27;m 62), my once long and thick eyelashes got shorter and sparse.  I also have dry eye, so mascara is irritating and I rarely use it.  After three months of nightly application of this product, my eyelashes seem incredibly long and thick.  I now have no need for mascara, since I also have my eyelashes dyed.  The product needs to be applied to the base of the lid right where the eyelashes meet the eyelids.  The thin applicator brush makes it easy to apply and with a little care you do not get it in your eyes.  It will sting if you do.</li>
            <li> This REALLY works!!  I initially bought this to put on my brows to help re-growth but started putting on my top lash line and my lashes are SO long and full.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many comments about how long my lashes are and was even asked if I got extensions.  This formula basically prolongs the shedding of your lashes (basically your lashes do not shed as new lashes come in) so it creates a longer and fuller look.  I did not experience any irritation using this product.  I would recommend not putting it TOO CLOSE to your lash line, maybe a tiny mm above it because product falls (gravity) and you wouldn&#x27;t want it to fall into your eyes or waterline.</li>
            <li> it does make my eyelids dark but only while i&#x27;m using the product. it really works.</li>
            <li> LOVEEE this product.. was scared to get this beauty product.. just because you never know.. but my top and bottom lashes have grown so much.. also using for my brows.. Shipping came quickly also..</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this product.  One tube is very expensive and it only lasted 2 weeks.  It was dry after two weeks and should have (I thought) lasted several months applying once a day.  I will look for a better product.  Two weeks is not enough time to determine if this product works.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. It took around 3 months, but it definitely has an impact. I have tried other products but this is the only one that does what it says. I use it on my brows as well and can see a real difference. Good for those of us over 50 with thinning brows.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you follow the instructions as the secret ingredient is what is used in glaucoma drops so it is important not to get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for nine months now with no issues.</li>
            <li> Using this product for about 3 weeks. I think lashes look a little longer. Need more time to see results</li>
            <li> I have done latisse and loved it, however I did not like how my eyelids turned purple/reddish color. I tried this out bc I heard it had less of the side effects. It did the same thing to my eyelids after two weeks of use :( I am disappointed and discontinuing use. So sad</li>
            <li> It took a while to notice a difference, six weeks approximately, but then I&#x27;m in love with the product! My little short lashes have never been so happy.&lt;br /&gt;and at 3 months better even!!</li>
            <li> in a relativly short period of time I have noticed much longer lashes that look amazing when I put on mascara.  Try this, you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> I have tried a few eyelash growth serums and this is the only one that works.....but it takes a week to start the growth and your eyelashes grow a little crazy but after two weeks they are full and longer and thicker than ever!!!! The only thing is last time I stopped using it right away my eyelashes started falling out so try to slowly ween yourself off of it.</li>
            <li> I would like to thank GrandLASH for coming up with a less irritating formula than Latisse &amp; Lilash. Both of which have caused my skin surrounding the eyes to be so irritated that I had to wear extra cover up to conceal the embarrassing redness. Every since I hit 13, I was known for my lashes. right around 27, they started falling out. Lilash worked well for a good year. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula, but I could no longer use it passed 30. Now I&#x27;m a whopping 37 and this is the only product that has brought my lashes back full force. I don&#x27;t even wear mascara anymore. Don&#x27;t need to. I just curl them and go. My clients love that I wear little to no make-up and so do I. Less work for a busy woman. So yes, I am recommending this product and definitely buying again.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase from CH Cycles. I LOVE grande lash and have used it for months, but just purchased a new bottle from CH Cycles and it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m wondering if they are selling old bottles that don&#x27;t have the same effect for your lashes. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.  It really works!!!  Have told all my friends how great I think it is.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> This product definitely worked for me, my lashes are much longer now, however, there is a little bit of irritation in that my eyelids look a little bit pink.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first.  I read the instructions and (as per the information) it did take a bit more time until I saw results (I am 54).  However.....my lashes are long and pretty!  I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It worked like a charm. Just be sure not to use it until you are going to bed because if you open your eyes with this stuff on your lashes, it will sting until you wash it out.</li>
            <li> I had great results with this product.  My eyelashes were so thick and long they hit my reading glasses. It did not irritate my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> Great Product!!  My lashes look amazing!  I highly recommend this product!  I have tried many brands of lash enhancers and this one a long with Li Lash are the two I feel work the best.</li>
            <li> This really works. I get compliments on my eyelashes all the time! Bummed that the price keeps going up!</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if my lashes will be as &amp;#34;grande&amp;#34; as they claim, but I have no complaints thus far!</li>
            <li> I love that it does what it says it does, but my eyes do get watery and sensitive.</li>
            <li> I researched various eyelash enhancers and this was rated high with a lot of reviewers which is why I chose this product.  Unfortunately, not many reviewers had issues with this product.  Many reviews did not mention side effects.  So I thought, huh, must be fine.  Nope.  The first day, I applied it on at night.  I had no problems.  The 2nd time I used it, I used it in the morning before going to work.  Around lunchtime, my eyes felt dry and irritated.  People noticed that my eyes were bloodshot and looked like I had been crying.  I thought this must be a fluke.  So I gave it another chance a week later.  I applied it on at night.  Woke up and well, same thing.  Puffy red and bloodshot eyes throughout the day.  It took all day for it to subside.  I was so excited to use this product only to have to return it.  Amazon of course let me return it with no problems.</li>
            <li> I had very short lashes after using extentions. Yes, I had to use this product for a couple months before I saw a difference but when I did, wow! Was I impressed. I&#x27;ll continue to use this forever. And I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th order if LashMD. It works great. You will notice a difference in about three weeks. I love this product. Everyone thinks I am wearing false eyelashes. Gotta get this product.</li>
            <li> I lost my eyelashes after giving birth to my daughter and was embarrashed. Within 6 weeks my eyelashes have tripled.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. TOO EXPENSIVE PRODUCT, OVER RATED, RESULTS NOT AS PROMISE, HORRIBLE SECONDARY EFFECTS. One star rate because they is not option of zero.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is my first time reviewing so badly a product in Amazon. But let&#x27;s be fair. This product doesn&#x27;t worth the money. It is too expensive for what it claims to do. Please read my full review (as detailed and accurate as possible) for more information about my bad experience with this product and you will understand . I know not all products works for everybody but this is ridiculous. I can&#x27;t believe some people claim it works and no secondary effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I learnt a lesson: Never heed other people reviews if they are not Amazon Verified Purchase. The reviews here are from other site. After my experience I realize this reviews are fake. Written probably by the same company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it claims: Long, fuller, thick lashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results:&lt;br /&gt;-First night:after application following instructions my eyes were itching and burning like crazy and I NEVER let it go inside my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;-Next day morning:almost had a heart attack when I saw my eyes in the mirror. They were red (looks like I had some broken blood vessels) and swollen.&lt;br /&gt;-The next 6 days:my eyes were like that (less swollen but still red). I waited. Why? Because the instruction states this is normal and after some time it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;-The 7 day:eyes not swollen. Light pinky mostly after applying product. Start noticing dark circles around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;-3 weeks: Itching and red eyes stop . My eyes continue itching and red but only after applying the product, next morning my eyes were fine. Dark circles NEVER improved. Looks like I didn&#x27;t sleep well. Some lashes start falling out.&lt;br /&gt;- 1 month: I notice that every time I wash my face MORE lashes were falling out. It happens like 3 per day. Some empty spaces can be notice between my eyelashes. I start using a bit olive oil and castor oil when not using the product (during day only, during night the serum). I was terrified to lose my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;-2 months of using it:(I used this product for 2 whole months never skipped a day. The product does NOT last more than 2 months). you will not see great improvement. NO fuller, NO thick. *About long: let me be clear in this. FEW really grow not the rest. In the outside corner of my right eye 1 lash grew larger then the other but very, extremely thin (like weak). I notice it when applying mascara. In the inside corner of the same eye 3 lashes grew longer a bit ticker than the first one. In my left eyes also in the outside corner like 3 grow longer as as the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEIRD FACT about this product it makes your lashes feels like hard or stiff.  Those few lashes that grew longer they look abnormal. They grew to the opposite direction, no natural form, extremely thin and not curly. Like a twisted lean leg of a spider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My own opinion: I WILL NOT recommend this product.While using the product I got dark circles but VERY dark. To the point that you have to use make up to cover it. I never had dark circles before and never use make up to cover imperfections around my eyes. I think that people will notice more your dark circles than you eyelashes if they  are long. Lashes start falling out. Only some of them grew longer but extremely thin not noticeable without mascara. They look weird, ugly, like a deform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still using olive oil (this time not mix with castor oil) for my lashes. Dark circles still there but less noticeable. Hope they disappear completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the seller: package came on time as promise. Lash serum comes in a box as advertise here. Inside it has a small paper with instructions.ct (during day only, during night the serum).

            <li> Works great ! My lashes got longer !!! All my friends ask me if i have  fake lashes,that&#x27;s how long they are, i got a lot of compliments! Highly recommend !!!</li>
            <li> It works. My lashes are a fuller and longer. It took a little while to get going but it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product three times already. I love it and it works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before bought this at a salon so this product does work and for the price too I was so amazed so I love it!</li>
            <li> Works, I really love it!</li>
            <li> Great product, I put it on every night as if I was putting on eyeliner.  It has been a very pleasant experience, my eyelashes look great and I have ordered more.  I would definitely recommend this.  No adverse reactions or any issues with it irritation or redness.  I just followed the directions.</li>
            <li> Grande Lash exceeded my expectations. It worked wonders! It made my eyelashes grow back when the other products I tried didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Please avoid this product. I developed blisters on both cornea of my eyes. Bluured vision and high sensitivity to light. I discontinued use of Grande Lash approximately 2 weeks ago and I am still waiting for the ill side effects to go away. When I contacted the makers, they informed me that it was probably counterfiet. No help at all. I had just had my yearly eye exam a day prior to use. Now this. Do not play with fire...</li>
            <li> Waiting for some results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for the &amp;#34;long lash&amp;#34; results, but it does irritate my eyes and makes them burn, so I use it every other night.</li>
            <li> With this product eyelashes grow super long and beautiful</li>
            <li> This is great, and really works. After a 6 months of chemo my lashes had all but disappeared as all my hair. I started using this immediately and the eyelashes returned in splendor. Wow what a positive force that I really needed.</li>
            <li> Works very well but caused my eyes to be really red and blood shot.  Try to avoid getting in your eyes as it burns.  Would recommend nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Really great and it works! I was actually scared to use this because I&#x27;m a no-brainer when it comes to this. Glad I risked it and now I&#x27;m enjoying prettier eyes.</li>
            <li> This product really works, I have people asking me all the time if my eyelashes are false or mine, when I assure them that they are my eyelashes, then they ask me what did I do to make them get so long. GrandeLash MD really does work.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!!  My eyelashes are longer than ever.  I had no problems with redness or irritation. Only complaint is it darkened my eyelid slightly.</li>
            <li> After 7-10 days, the product still irritated my eye lids (red, itchy and my eyes were red). This product didn&#x27;t work for me but has been working really well for my sister.</li>
            <li> most people said it started working in two weeks or so. I decided to try this because the price was reasonable and it&#x27;s got pretty good consumer review from other site. I took pictures to compare the difference in a month and there were no change. I was about to give up but I didn&#x27;t want to waste it so I continued using it.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it worked and it worked very well.  But the complete process took a good 4 months. I had thin, uneven, eyelashes with gaps. After using it for 3 months, I started noticing my lashes are slightly longer and now, after 4 months, its fuller and longer. i love it.</li>
            <li> Only been using for about 4 weeks.  Hope to find out that the results will begin to be evident soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got any coupons to offer?</li>
            <li> No comparison to others I&#x27;ve tried - my eyelashes are incredibly long.  When you start out, you have to apply this morning and night to mimic the dosage in latisse (probably for the first 6 weeks).  I now only apply once in the evening - great product.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  I have been using it for a year and have great beautiful lashes and I&#x27;m 56. I have lashes better than when I was a youngster.</li>
            <li> I have experienced slight burning but I am over 60 so I use it morning and night.  Great product...and I think I have used them all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 years old, and until I started using this, had short, stubby blond lashes.  Now they are amazingly long and thick.  They are darker than they used to be, but I do wear mascara during the day to emphasize.  The first few months I used this every night--now just 3 times a week.  I&#x27;ve reordered this many times.  It&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Do not notice anything happening with the use of this on my eyelashes compared to another product I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been playing around with different eyelash serums and this was the one that finally gave me the long and thick eyelashes I was working toward. I get asked on a regular basis if my eyelashes are fake, because with mascara they are giant. So far, I get a bit of redness on the eyelids but not discoloration or stinging.</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer and fuller.  I have used the product twice and notice the difference. I plan to continue to use it to keep them growing and getting fuller.</li>
            <li> This is nice in that it&#x27;s a clear liquid on a thin brush -- so it was easy to apply along my eyelash line. After about two weeks I could really notice a difference in the length of my lashes. I also bought a tube to use for my eyebrows (specifically for a spot where a lady took off a liiiiittle bit too much and made them uneven). It really helped the bald spot grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effects don&#x27;t last permanently, but if someone has a few weeks of prep time to grow your lashes, this is a nice alternative to fake lashes (especially if you have a good plumping mascara). Will be buying another tube in the near future to start growing out my lashes again for my wedding.</li>
            <li> -received it after more than a week of purchase&lt;br /&gt;- I noticed there were many complaints about how ur eyes go crazy red. The same happened to me&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m still going to continue to apply it twice a day&lt;br /&gt;On the first day of application, my eyes started feeling itchy n red. I looked like I had hay fever; a total reck. I realised it was bc i was kinda overapplying the product because more effective result. So I stopped applying it on my lower lashes to reduce the appearance of the redness around my eyes because I realli want this product to work. Don&#x27;t want to give up  yet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have or will the same reactions at the beginning, my advice is to not over apply the product.&lt;br /&gt;Wat I mean is, before you apply it on ur lash line, make sure that ur brush isn&#x27;t too soaked with the product or else when u apply it, ur going to have a more blotchy red appearance on ur eyes.&lt;br /&gt;So basically just brush off some of the product on the rim of the tube, just like how u would do with nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Another tip is to apply it very close to the lash line/root of ur lashes so it will reduce the blotchy appearance etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I bought this product I didn&#x27;t realli expect my eyes to go red like some others complained. But my eyes r fine back to normal. It&#x27;s only been a week&lt;br /&gt;The redness and the itchiness was crazy for the 2-4days. But after that it will start to go away.&lt;br /&gt;Just reflecting... I&#x27;m very sure that this itchy reaction will happen to many other customers who might be interested in buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;But wats more important is if my lashes grown,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on my first or two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to do an update on the growth of my eyelashes in the next couple of weeks&lt;br /&gt;Please mind my grammar</li>
            <li> Started it about a month ago. I truly have not noticed any difference. Probably should have just gone with Latisse but I understand it cause a change in eye color.</li>
            <li> It works great. fuller lashes and longer lashes after 3 weeks. I am on my third one. I Love It</li>
            <li> Only reason I did not give a full 5 stars, which could have to do with my eyes being sensitive, but my eyes get pretty red later on in the day and will dry out (possibly a little more with this) but works AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> Significantly thickened and lengthen my lashes. No real side effects and after you&#x27;ve achieved the the length and thickness, you don&#x27;t need to use daily.</li>
            <li> I was using NutraLash MD, which works wonderful but it dried my eyes, so I decided to change brand to give a rest to my eyes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grande Lash does not work, it does not make nothing to my lashes. I&#x27;ll go back to Nutra Lash MD</li>
            <li> I would have never imagined that this product would deliver exactly what it promises, but holy cow, my eyelashes have NEVER looked so lush. I would recommend applying this every night until the first tube runs out. By then, your lashes should be obviously longer and fuller and slightly darker. Then, you can just maintain the growth by only using it a few nights a week,,, definitely worth the cost. Using this product regularly, coupled with Dior lash primer and mascara (I love a few brands) and people regularly think I&#x27;m wearing falsies. NOPE. Just a GrandeLASH MD addict!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It worked better than Latisse at growing thicker, longer lashes, and is easier to use, as well as less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have received some improvement in length &amp; darkness, but do not notice my lashes being any fuller.  It took approximately 5 - 6 weeks to get these results.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product. Can&#x27;t get enough of it i&#x27;ve used it for a few years now and more than 10 of my friends/colleagues are now using it and love it as well. I have sensitive skin around my eyes so I get a very little bit of irritation when I start using it again if I&#x27;ve taken a break but that goes away in a week or so and it is just slight itching so it&#x27;s nothing major. Incredible product. I have long lashes to begin with it and it makes them even longer dramatically and thicker, plus more lashes overall.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product for 3 weeks and my lashes are looking amazing !!! Love this product !!</li>
            <li> Love this product, my lashes are longer and fuller!</li>
            <li> Excellent, I&#x27;m fully satisfied, just few weeks I&#x27;ve been using this product, I can see the difference. Thanks Grande Lash!</li>
            <li> Pros:  my lashes did grow long and beautiful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  red, itching irritated eyes and blurry vision&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to discontinue and will either go back to Neulash (more expensive) or try Lash Advance (recommended by my eye doctor)</li>
            <li> Burnt our eyes, would not use it ever again</li>
            <li> My eyebrows were starting to look sparse and I&#x27;m not an over plucker. Also,  occasionally, I&#x27;d lose a lot of eyelashes when removing my eye makeup. I looked into this product because I had a friend who had experienced the same issues and started using this product, figuring she&#x27;d give it a shot since it was less expensive than Latisse. After a few months her lashes were longer and thicker, eyebrows much thicker. It looked like she had been using Latisse, only no \\&quot;spidery\\&quot; length I see with some gals, nice and thick. She got her blonder lashes tinted and stopped applying mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product and noticed a difference after a month, especially with my eyebrows filling in and thickening. While I noticed my eyelashes weren&#x27;t falling out with the makeup removal, I didn&#x27;t think I was getting the amazing eyelash results my friend got during the same same time period. Seeing the results on the eyebrows I wondered...so I *read the directions.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first month I applied once per day just like my eyeliner and I wasn&#x27;t always fully removing my eye makeup. For month two, I applied twice a day right at the rootline of my eyelashes (less like eyeliner)...which I should have been doing during month one. I also took care to completely remove my mascara and eyeliner before applying. Big difference!! Month two brought more eyelashes, thicker eyelashes, longer eyelashes. Even my lower eyelashes are looking fuller, which only get some residual from my eyes being closed when I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now backing down to once per day, maintenance, since I&#x27;m getting a \\&quot;false lash\\&quot; look when I use mascara. (I&#x27;m a week into month three.) My friend uses once every day or every other day and is still happy and looking great after 10+ months using this product. I figure I&#x27;ll be able to back down to every other day during month four, if not sooner. Very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> anybody have an experience like me? I&#x27;ve been using this for 9 wks and I&#x27;m over 30 so twice a day religiously. Well, I have some really long lashes but I also have a lot of really short lashes in between they look like there shorter than my normal lashes! So its almost like spaces in between. Doesn&#x27;t look so great. I thought that my lashes should be all long by now. I&#x27;m worried that some have broken off too! Should I give it more time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I was wrong. This stuff is great! You just need to give it more time. Its been 3 months and all I could say is wow I have long lashes and a little fuller but. They do look fake. My friend gets extensions and she&#x27;s like you lashes look unbelievable now she just ordered some. My lashes are still blonde though. So they didn&#x27;t get darker but with mascara they really really stand out. Sometimes its a little too much. My bottom lashes are sooooo long too. I highly recommend. Although I did purchase mine once from a salon and the second bottle from the actual site. I haven&#x27; purchased this on amazon.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product at the suggestion of my waxer a year ago. I bought it from her at almost twice the price as here. It worked great. I saw noticeable growth and fullness in my lashes. I only used it at night before because my eyes are easily irritated and it did irritate my eyes if I used it everyday. So I used it only a few times a week. This time I&#x27;m seeing very little growth and fullness and I&#x27;m using it every night. I really think they change the formula from the version sold in pricey salons. That sucks.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders! Love it.</li>
            <li> While I did say that the product DOES cause irritation....it&#x27;s with the disclaimer that it&#x27;s only MINIMAL and only IF I MESS UP and don&#x27;t put it on properly.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything until about week 3...and that was only slightly.  At about week 5 or so, I DEFINITELY see longer lashes on the top, and the bottom lashes are starting to fill in where I had some gaps with hardly anything.  I am VERY HAPPY with the results and will continue to use.  I use the product 2x/day...once in the morning and once at night, because I am 50 and I read in the directions that if you are older, you will see faster results using it this way.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work.  Just don&#x27;t overdo it because it can darken your skin near your eyes.  I used it too much on the bottom lashes and the tiny facial hairs just under the eye grew and darkened as well.  This isn&#x27;t anything that can&#x27;t be handled and I am very happy overall.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed for 4 weeks and a few days on both lashes and brow. When it would get in my eyes, it would burn a little, but nothing awful like soap in your eyes. My skin in both areas became more sensitive to touch and got a little darker in color. Again, nothing horrible but it was noticeable. After a little over 4 weeks, there has been no change. None at all. I&#x27;d look elsewhere instead of buying this.</li>
            <li> I dont think the review questions apply to product. This is something you apply to your lash line to enhance growth of natural lashes. I have used other products that worked better and quicker, This burns my eyes. My lashes have thickened a little, but the results are not as good as the Le Lash product for me.</li>
            <li> It works, but I sometimes have to take a couple of days off because it makes my eyes water and can get a bit itchy.  If I take a couple days off, and start using every other day, I have no issues.  It definitely works, and my lashes are much longer!  I&#x27;m still on my first tube 4 months later.</li>
            <li> I had very little expectation of this product tbh. But after the first day I apply I become slightly excited about the future result. I have pretty long eyelashes. It&#x27;s that I don&#x27;t have thick eyebrows and dark eyelashes, so I wanted to give it a shot. The result after the first apply is quite impressive. My eyelashes look noticeably thicker. Eyebrows look slightly thicker. It might not work for some of you but you gotta try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--have to make an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really thickens my eyelashes and eyebrows after a week. For those who think this is not a helpful review, good luck growing your eyelashes. :)</li>
            <li> People think I am constantly wearing \\&quot;falsies\\&quot;. Nope! I have GrandeLash to thank. Every female needs this product - it will make your eyes look absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li> Let me say that this product does work. Yes your eyelashes will grown and become very strong. I rated it a 3 because like the reviews say, it causes your eyes to become red. I had to go to work with people constantly asking me what was wrong with my eyes. I did not like that and another issue is that it caused dark circles around my eyes. I don&#x27;t know if I was allergic to an ingredient but I couldn&#x27;t do it anymore. As soon as I stopped using the product the dark circles went away. I looked like a raccon by the face. That&#x27;s not cute. Everybody body is different some people did not have any side effects. Just try for yourself.</li>
            <li> i saw results after 2 weeks. i havent been using it that long but i am impressed.</li>
            <li> Great seller, perfect arrival.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I&#x27;ve used it for 4 months now and I believe it really has made my eyelashes grow longer.  I&#x27;ve bought more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> On my fourth week and still have not seen any difference!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love GrandeLASH; I have found that it has thickened my eye lashes as well as some lengthening.  I find that if I do not use it regularly, my eye lashes do thin out some, so I do find that using it both morning and night helps my lashes stay longer.  It is not a fix for lashes - much like a moisturizer is not a fix for facial imperfections.  I will continue using it as I love the results!</li>
            <li> This works so well it took me 2 month to see full result and everyone wanted to know if my eyelashes were fake</li>
            <li> If I could rate it 0 stars I would.  My eyes turned dark red if I got some in my eye the night before, and they would stay bright red all day, it was embarrassing.  I&#x27;ve used products like this with amazing results, thought I&#x27;d try this for a change but STEER clear,  now if you want blood red eyes for a Halloween costume, then this product is perfect.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this lash serum but so far I&#x27;ve been proven wrong. I&#x27;ve been using it about 7 weeks now and my lashes look longer definitely. I started seeing a change in the 3rd week but it wasn&#x27;t as fast I wanted it to be. I still think it&#x27;s a good product and works. Be patient and you&#x27;ll see results. It actually didn&#x27;t burn my eyes or irritate my skin at all as other reviewers experienced. Castor oil is also a good, natural option but won&#x27;t grow lashes quick enough...for those who want faster results this serum is good.</li>
            <li> Does the job better than any others I tried!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best eyelash conditioner I have used.  I have at least five others.  While this may give different results for different users, this made my lashes amazing and thick and long.  Like when I was a kid.  Another lash enhancer that I used last year actually made my lashes fall out, leaving an odd gap in the middle of my upper lashes on both eyes.  I switched to another brand and it made the lashes on either side of the bare patch long, it did nothing to grow the missing lashes back.  I was devastated, thinking I would have bald patches for the rest of my life.  I decided to try GrandeLASH. I didn&#x27;t see a difference until about week three.  By the second month I could hardly believe it.  My missing lashes were back and they were long and thick.  Thank you GrandeLASH!  I bought the 2ml tube and have been using it now for at least 3 or 4 months.  I use it nightly.  I simply cannot believe my lashes.  It&#x27;s not just the length (other serums deliver length), but it&#x27;s the fullness that is so amazing.  I have gotten compliments on my lashes.  I waited to write this review since other serums I have used stopped working after a few months.  This is still going strong!  Thank you</li>
            <li> I havd really scrawny eye-lashes, but within just a few short weeks I noticed a big difference.  For once a product that does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> Always satisfied with my Amazon purchases</li>
            <li> After I saw how my friends lashes reached her eyebrows, I asked her what she was doing. She directed me to this product and I&#x27;ve been using it for over two months. My eyes sometimes get red from it, and I thought I was only having minimal results, until about two weeks ago. People are now commenting on how long they are. I feel like I have a new toy to play with! I can&#x27;t even curl my lashes anymore, because then they&#x27;re just too much. I went into Ulta the other day, and even the salesgirl couldn&#x27;t get over my lashes. I have recommended it to tons of people and I&#x27;m super happy with the results. I can&#x27;t wait for them to get even longer so I can just be completely ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it mostly at night and frequently in the morning. My lashes are longer, curling on their own, and it seems like they are finally starting to darken. Since I have blonde lashes, I still wear a lot of mascara, but I love looking at them and feel like they give me an awake look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about buying it, seriously go for it.</li>
            <li> i would test on skin first but for me it works great no irritation and in 3 weeks my lashes are much longer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Neulash was Much better. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Might try again a for nothing but after six weeks should have had results</li>
            <li> Unlike other products that I&#x27;ve tried, this one actually improved both my lashes and brows.  As mine were quite skimpy, it took 2-3 months, with twice a day applications, to see real change.  But it was well worth it and I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> If you want long eyelashes, this is the product for you. It takes about 3-4 weeks to see a difference and you have to faithfully use it every night but the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> have been using this product once a day at nightime for about 3 weeks and have already seen good results!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months but was thrilled to discover it at a great cost savings on Amazon!  This has proven to be much more effective that Latisse or any other product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Keep the bargins coming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this product right after all my fake lashes and real lashes fell out. It starts working about two weeks, first your lash line might be irritated but skip a night then continue. I am so happy with this product. Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for three monthes and have not noticed any difference. I have very fin hair, so maybe that&#x27;s the problem.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I used Lilash before while it was still legally available in the US and that stuff was awesome. it took me a while to find something else that worked as well, when decided to give this a try. It is not as fast working as lilash, and my lashes aren&#x27;t AS long, but they&#x27;re still long and thick enough that i get compliments on them. I apply it only once a night as some times only ever other night and it seems to work for me. This alongside fiber lash mascara &#x3D; better than extensions and falsies.</li>
            <li> This product really works. I see results in just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully. I wanted to compare it to Revitalash but it did not work as fast nor last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said...Revitalash lasted a couple of months after I ran out of the product. I know your lash growth isn&#x27;t permanent but I was hoping to find a product that lasts longer than 6-8 weeks after use.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and expected great results. I followed instructions- once a day application and my lashes look no different. What a waste of money after putting up with red eyes for weeks!</li>
            <li> This product does, in fact, work; however, it is stated on the package to use within a three month period.  Although I only apply once at night, the product only lasts a couple of weeks at most.</li>
            <li> I have noticeable eyelashes for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for exactly 3 weeks and now see the results! I had serious doubts about it working but my friend said she had to stop using it because her lashes got too long. This stuff definitely works and I&#x27;m a believer! Worth the money and I will buy it again. Look at my before and after picture. They are longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!  Love this product!! TY</li>
            <li> I Love this product. I tried others with no results. This is the only one that gave me long eye lashes like it says it will do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely working!!  And I&#x27;m OLD ‼️</li>
            <li> I used to use Lilash which worked great, but Grandelash works even better and is a little cheaper. My eyelashes are longer and fuller than ever. If you have sparse or short lashes, give it a try. It takes about three to four weeks to see a real difference, but then WOW.</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that grew eyelashes!  I am allergic to other products. I get complements all the time about my eyes.  Grandlash MD is so easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t have side effects.  After 2 weeks, my lashes were really long.  I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t extend lashes at all</li>
            <li> This eyelash enhancer is incredible! Within 2 weeks I look like i have fake eyelashes compared to what they looked like before!  I&#x27;ve never used this type of product that worked so fast!</li>
            <li> On my fourth tube because it works!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is incrediable!</li>
            <li> I read the review in a magazine and decided to try it. I have used other enhancers before (Latisse, Revitalash) but none works quite the way that this product did. It not only lengthens but now I have thicker eyelashes which is a huge blessing for Asian eyes. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  I used it for two months and now my stylist is always having to trim my eyelashes !!  I use it once a week now!!  It works exactly like Latisse, but it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost of Latisse!!  I&#x27;ve tried another one that was a bit cheaper, but it didn&#x27;t do anything, so &amp;#34;Grande Lash&amp;#34; is a keeper!!!  :)</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.  Lashes got longer first and then darker after 8 weeks.  I can go without mascara now. I don&#x27;t use it every day either.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser use&#x27;s this and her lashes are so long. She has no side affects. However for me It does make my eyes lids itch, red, and sore.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product 2-3 times and it never stops working!</li>
            <li> About 2 months after completing 4 rounds of chemotherapy I lost every single eyelash!  Needless to say I was devastated.  It was hard enough loosing the hair on my head but loosing my eyelashes too.. dang! I had no desire to use false eyelashes so I put a lot of hope into GrandeLash MD.  It took maybe 3 weeks before I sprouted some growth but I could tell that they were coming in thick which was a very pleasant surprise.  They are almost now the length they were before I lost them so long story short.. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This works! I have been applying it twice a day now for almost a month and my lashes have gotten fuller and longer. After a week I noticed the fullness and then in about three weeks I noticed the length. I don&#x27;t even have to apply mascara!! I hope the length of my lashes get even longer but other than that, this product works!! I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I have used every lash growing enhancer that you can imagine to no avail until Grande Lash.  I was allergic to Latisse and all the other lash builders on the market did not produce an iota of growth or length until again I saw someone who was using Grande Lash and couldn&#x27;t believe her lashes.  I took a gamble and voila!  Grande Lash leads as  an award winning lash builder.  Thanks Grande Lash.</li>
            <li> Was opened when I received it gonna order again</li>
            <li> It works, it&#x27;s been a month, but I can see my lashes getting longer and darker, I would recommend this product, in fact , I bought one more.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 3 weeks ago and I have seen a remarkable difference in my lashes.  I love it and I would  recommend it to everyone.  My friend  just bought this same product and her salon and it was about $20.00 more.</li>
            <li> Only two days took7 for this product to shows results on my eyelashes!! And I&#x27;m not the only one noticing this, my children and husband were WHOA, look at those lashes!!!!.....I started using it twice a day for a week, then I started using once a week, just to make it last.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I&#x27;ll buy a couple more as a gift for one of my relatives and for me before I run out of this one. It didn&#x27;t caused me any irritation or any discoloration on my eyelids, and I have very sensitive skin. I was reluctant to buy this product because I read some reviews of people who had developed redness on the eyelids, but it didn&#x27;t happened to me. I also used on my eyebrows, because I over plucked one of my eyebrows so much that I have a bald spot on one, and last night, after 7-8 days of being using this product twice a day I&#x27;m seeing hair growing on the bald spot! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I have tried a few other brands (City lash, Olay, Rimmel, Loreal) and saw little to no difference in lashes.  I have naturally thin, straight lashes and Grandelash after about a month of use has increased the length and thickness dramatically.  I used to wear thick liner to help thicken the look of lashes but now I don&#x27;t even need it!  Love this stuff! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Amazing!!  Can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.  Took about 4 weeks to see results.  Applied once a day at bedtime.  Would give it 10 stars if that was part of rating system!</li>
            <li> I have been using Grandelash for about 1.5 months.  I used it 2x per day the first three weeks, and then switched to every night.  In the beginning I did experience a little redness in my eyes and lids.  My lashes are not darker, but they got really long after about 4 weeks of use.  I am really loving this product!</li>
            <li> This product is great! Much better then what I had expected. I&#x27;ve tried RapidLash in the past and several other products with little to no results but thought id give GrandeLash a try. The first few days it gave me a terrible headache and my eyes were very red but in the instructions it stated that it was normal so I kept using it. It&#x27;s been about 3 months now and I am in love with my new eyelashes and eyebrows! My eyelashes are much longer and fuller, they are also more curved now and darker! My eyebrows are much more thicker now, I was able to recreate the shape of them in a way and they are also much more darker. Also, im not sure if directly related to the product but my eyes are allot more green which is a great bonus.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I have tried all of the others, rivatalash, instal ash, allesse, all of them.  this is the best!</li>
            <li> After approximately 6 weeks you won&#x27;t believe how long your lashes are …..…..  Don&#x27;t forget to use every day …….Grandlash is very easy to use ……….</li>
            <li> I really like Grande lash. I bought this product a year ago at the hair show and I was amazed at how much my lashes grew. I even got lashes in the bottom where I never really had them.&lt;br /&gt;The drowback is that as soon as you stop using the product your lashes will fall, do you have to continue using it for maintenance.  The price is not so hight in comparison with Latisse and it does not have any side effects. Getting lash extensions is not only more expensive but it will also damage you own lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend using grande lash if you can afford to continue buying it for life.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am a woman of color. From previously using semi permanent lash extensions my lashes have suffered. GrandeLash not only lengthens my lashes; but also darkens them to add value. I have tried a lot of different products. GrandeLash by far is superior.</li>
            <li> My take on this Because it really works. I can see my eyelashes they have really grown thank grandelash great product I have passed it on to my daughters they will soon place an order</li>
            <li> Beware this did make my lashes a lil better but it made my skin around my eyes so dark on bottom an red on top of my lid I look so bad an I&#x27;m scared my skin won&#x27;t go back yo the way it should be so I would think twice about buying this one</li>
            <li> Over time a slightly longer and fuller lash developes! Initially they were  much fuller and longer, but has thinned out slightly! I love not having to wear  Mascara on a daily basis. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> My lashes were very weak and short due the all the eye lashes extensions in the past. I have been using this product now for about 3 weeks and I already seen seen some improvements, my lashes looks healthier and thicker . Is not as long as and fuller as I want it to be yet , but I believe I will get there in few more weeks . I bought this product because 2 of my friends used and had some amazing results.</li>
            <li> I love Grande lash! It really works. People ask me if I&#x27;m wearing fake or eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for only 3 days now and I have already seen a little bit of a difference! I am 1/4 Japanese and unfortunately got the Asian lashes. I got eyelash extensions all the time and never left the house if I don&#x27;t have a current set of extensions without falsies! This is literally a miracle. I&#x27;ve done everything from home remedies to drugstore serums to help my lashes grow. Nothing works and I thought I&#x27;d be stuck with falsies forever BUT GrandeLASH has me ready to toss out the falsies! I did not experience any burning (unless clumsy me literally got some in my eye...ow!(like soap in eyes but less painful actually)) I am also in the process of growing out my eyebrows (oh the struggle...grow, grow, grow!) and have used this for them as well, and they are already thickening quickly! My lashes are not yet the desired length, but at this rate I am confident it will get there...and soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, if you want longer lashes, this product is THE ONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post photos in a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product.  I had been using Librow and LOVED it, but tried switching to this due to my salon&#x27;s recommendation. Sadly maybe it is just my brows, but I didn&#x27;t see much difference at all. I will be going back to Librow for sure. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive, but if I&#x27;m even going to spend $30 on a product...I want to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Just made a month, waiting a bit longer to see real results. I can see some difference but its not fully there yet.</li>
            <li> I love my Grandlash! I get so many compliments!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re consistent, this stuff really works!!  I put it on at night and I notice a little irritation initially, but nothing I can&#x27;t deal with.  It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes red or last long.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works!  I have extremely sensitive skin and I&#x27;m unable to use but a handful of products on my skin.  I started using this product once a day and at first I did feel my eyelids itchy, but just where the liquid had been placed.  I never broke out, got puffy eyes, or red eyes.  I did that for a few days and decided to apply to lashes every other day.  This seems to have helped get my lids used to the product.  After about two weeks I began applying the liquid to my eyelash lids twice a day, once in the morning and once at bedtime.  My eyelashes have grown very long and new lashes have grown in too!  I highly recommend this product!  I definitely love this product.  Like I said earlier, I have extremely sensitive skin but I am able to use this product!  Love it!</li>
            <li> My eye lashes are growing . So far this product has been working for me. It will take some time and persistence , but eventually you will start seeing the results</li>
            <li> I used to go to a salon for lash extensions monthly.  For the price of one visit, GrandeLASH allows me to have 3 months of lash growth.  I also pair it with the mascara, which is also good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used lilash before and it was wonderful.  I was looking for something less expensive.  I used this product once and my eyes stayed red for a week.  I waited until the redness went away, then tried it again to make sure the product was making my eyes red.  It is definitely this product, my eyes are also itchy and irritated. I will NOT be using this again.</li>
            <li> This took about 3 months of nightly use before I saw results but it really works! Now I use it every few nights and I love my lashes!!</li>
            <li> Before I started using this product, my lashes were a mess from continuously wearing falsies and individual lashes. I had gaps and my lash line was very sparse and thin. I had also taken up the habit of pulling at my eyelashes while I did schoolwork which caused more to fall out. After doing some research on eyelash conditioners and growth serums, I finally came across Grandelash as a cheaper and well-rated alternative to Latisse, and a safer and more financially secure alternative of purchasing careprost with an online check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The biggest thing with this product is to be PATIENT. I am the type of person who gets discouraged after doing something for a few days and seeing no results. After ten days of my lashes looking the same, I was disappointed, but decided to at least finish the bottle. Then by day twenty,I looked in the mirror and suddenly realized how long and thick my lashes had become. I no longer had little gaps and my lashes were thicker and darker. Now it&#x27;s been about a month and a week since I started my first treatment and my lashes are only growing. I notice new pretty lashes every day that look gorgeous with even a tiny bit of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A bottle should last you about six weeks -- even if you apply twice a day. This product is definitely worth the buy, and the price is awesome when compared to other products on the market right now. The side effects I experienced were slightly unpleasant, but not to the point of stopping my use of it. I had slight redness (very, very hard to notice) around the skin by the corners of my eyes and where the serum was applied to. I also woke up a few times with bloodshot and itchy eyes -- however this side effect was temporary and after being awake for a few minutes the redness would completely subside. Overall, this product is definitely worth the buy. It will give you full and dark lashes before you even finish one bottle.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS. On my second bottle. Everyone asks me if my lashes are extensions!!</li>
            <li> This product REALLY WORKS!  I&#x27;ve used it since the middle of June and my eye lashes are so long that they touch the lenses of my sun glasses!  I found no drawbacks with this product at all.</li>
            <li> I am a hair salon owner and bought this product through the distributor not from amazon, but regardless the results were really more than I expected. I used it religiously for about 5 weeks at night and every morning I would look in the mirror hoping to see a change right around 5 weeks it was like a miracle , my lashes went from thin stubby and hardly visible to long and thick , to the point that they hit my sunglasses. I also must say about 3 weeks ago I misplaced the tube i was using and my lashes are still looking good none have fallen out and they still look long. I am definitely going to re order.</li>
            <li> I use this product to stretch the life of my Latisse.  I use it in between days and it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I saw results within the first week at two applications a day.</li>
            <li> Been using daily for 6 weeks, now. Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. There is slight stinging that is bothersome, but not painful and goes away. Yesterday, I applied as usual, but had a terrible side effect. I have burned skin above both eyelashes. Very noticeable and painful. Not sure what I could have done wrong compared to the other days. Face was clean and dry prior to application.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s grown my lashes immensely. Product lasts a long time too and you only apply once a day. Does take awhile before you actually see growth. Maybe even up to two months so be patient because then all of a sudden, boom!</li>
            <li> This is not a mascara or an eyeliner - it is an eyelash enhancer, therefore color question does not apply - it doesn&#x27;t have one. It causes your lashes to grow in longer, thicker and darker. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product (and the reasonable price compared to others similar products) and have purchased twice now. Will definitely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also you did not have an option for applying twice daily, which is what you do until desired results are achieved. After that you can do once daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so pleased with this product that I also plan on trying out their eyeliner also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using grandelash for 6 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.  It burns if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST LASH SERUM I&#x27;VE EVER USED!!! My lashes are incredible!! Every single day, everywhere I go, people are constantly asking me if my lashes are real because they are so beautiful! I&#x27;m now on week 8 of using GrandeLash MD, and my lashes have all evened out and filled in so beautifully! They are sooo much longer than the fake lashes that I used to wear! I honestly cannot say enough good things about this product! I have all of my friends and family using it as well because the are in awe of my amazing results! I will NEVER be without my GrandeLash MD!!</li>
            <li> Made a tremendous difference.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> After 10 days of using it, I noticed my eyelash are grew approximately 1-2 cms and they are thicker than before.</li>
            <li> Great product just have to be patient - I&#x27;ve noticed a change after the fourth week.  You will love the results!</li>
            <li> Great stuff,really works.</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience using this product . My eyes were swollen for 4 days and unable to work . I only put a minimal amount to my upper eye lid but this product wasn&#x27;t good .&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller and unfortunately I experienced a very bad customer service and so rude.&lt;br /&gt;If I so happened to have an allergy with this product which happens sometimes , the seller could have just answer me in a professional way for me to be satisfied with my concern .</li>
            <li> I have used it before, and love the resullts...will always use it! Thanks Barbara Rochester</li>
            <li> makes my brows seem to grow in thicker but not my lashes. too irritating for use around the lashline</li>
            <li> I used this just once and my eyelids are bright red and tender!  I am very disappointed and unhappy that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Always believe the bad reviews if there are way to many good reviews like on this product, because the bad reviews are the real reviews where people actually spent money on this product and found out it is not working. I hate fake reviews and dont understand why people would even write them. I, of course did not believe the bad reviews, I did not listen to my guts and bought one anyway, just to find out it is not doing anything. I have been using it for 1 month now. I have used it on both eyes first, and found out I am losing way to many eyelashes on my eyes. So I have stopped using it on both eyes, I was scared I will lose all my lashes. I have continued to use it on just one eye and used it on the corner of my right eye. And I see no changes at all. This thing did not do it for me. Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. My daughter and I both use it! Of course, it works faster and more effectively on younger people - under 30.</li>
            <li> My Aesthetician  recommended GrandeLASH MD and it works!</li>
            <li> The GrandeLASH MD really works, I am on my second tube in about 6 months and my lashes are so much longer, I have had friends ask me if I am wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> Can not see any difference waste of money.Perhaps I should have tried longer ,but I thought 6 weeks there should be some difference</li>
            <li> Thought this product would work for me as it has over 800 positive reviews, but sadly, after 4 months, my lashes are the same length. I haven&#x27;t noticed that their darker or thicker, as my main reason for using it, is for the length. In the past, I&#x27;ve used professional strengths that cost $100.00 and my lashes are so long after 2 months, that I have to use it sparingly. I thought I could save money by buying this lash enhancer, but guess my next stop is to the beauty store today.</li>
            <li> really does work! Great product for the price. Will purchase again.Sure beats trying to put on false lashes. Will tell other about it.</li>
            <li> My friend used this and her lashes are amazing.  I tried it for about a month and see no difference whatsoever.  I will try it a little longer since I have already bought it, but I can&#x27;t see any improvement yet.</li>
            <li> It took a while for me to start seeing results but after a month I started to see bottom lashes, which I never had before! People think I have on fake lashes but there actually mine! Just ordered my second tube and now I cant stop. I call it lash crack cant wait to see more results !</li>
            <li> For the first 2-3 weeks I thought I had bought a product that did not work.  However, after those first few weeks I suddenly noticed results - and what great results.  I had pulled out a large section of my eyelashes with a defective eyelash curler and the gap was obvious.  But after the first three weeks the lashes started to rapidly grow back at an amazing rate and after a month the gap is no longer noticeable.  I am excited about and very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> It has taken about 2 months for this product to provide the WOW factor ... but it is definitely doing that now. I had read that women over 50 should apply 2x a day, and I was doing that after the first few weeks. Definitely did find that to be irritating (I also have ocular rosacea and my eyes have a tendency to be red anyway) and have backed off now to just applying in the evenings and sometimes I even miss a night or two. Using on both my lashes and my eyebrows. Did require some patience and I almost gave up; however, both my lashes and brows have a lushness that they&#x27;ve never known before. THRILLED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited on 10/16/2013 to add: My lashes have continued to get even longer and thicker. Love the product but find it odd that my first tube lasted 2 months, and my second tube lasted only 2 weeks, despite using it less frequently than I was using the first tube initially. Hopefully, the issue with my second tube was a fluke. I have another tube and will be ordering another.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item 5 months ago and I noticed longer lashes within a month! I still use it, mind you I missed a few nights here and there and they recomend you use it every night before bed. I would definately recomend this to someone like me with short, straight lashes. This product is supposed to also &amp;#34;thicken&amp;#34; your lashes, Im not so sure about my lashes being any thicker but it lengthen them noticably!</li>
            <li> makes my lashes grow with more volume</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how long my eyelashes have gotten since I have been using this.  Not only re they longer but they are thicker and stronger!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s avery good product. I&#x27;ve recomended it to mi sisters (4) and friends. I&#x27;ve seen good results in my eyelashes just in a few months</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and I think that it took longer to work than a younger person, but after a good 3 months it actually made a difference.  Lashes longer, thicker and more healthy.  However, I did notice almost immediately after about 2-3 weeks I barely lost a lash anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Still using and down to a few times a week to keep it up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Before using this product my eyelashes were very short and hardly visible. Now my eyelashes are much longer, appear much darker and are definitely visible enough to make my eyes stand out.  Every night, I would dip the brush in only one time to spread across the top of both eyelids. In the beginning, after daily use for about a month, my lids became sensitive, a little red &amp; itchy, so I skipped a few days &amp; then resumed. For a few weeks I would use it 4 or 5 out of a 7-day week and then eventually went back to using it every night. Every now &amp; then, I&#x27;d skip a day or two a week and still my eyelashes stay long, dark and noticeable.</li>
            <li> Came quick and I can&#x27;t comment on the product I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and no results yet but I am older and it says 6 weeks for results. My friend uses it and it works great for her</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make your lashes super long like expensive prescription or hormone-infused products, so don&#x27;t expect it to. But it does make them stronger and less prone to breakage and fall-out, and it definitely enhances the results when used as supplement to those true growth-inducing products. If you&#x27;ve already had success with a growth formula and are no longer using it daily, use this daily or between &#x27;growth&#x27; doses to maintain the roots. That&#x27;s what makes this product worth the price...it&#x27;s the perfect foundation for healthy lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten great results with this.  I know others said &amp;#34;it&#x27;s not the real deal&amp;#34; but I am very happy with it.  I was a Latisse user for 2 years but swtiched (this is less expensive and it felt time for a change) and I&#x27;m impressed.  I also like that the brush applicator is part of the product, unlike Latisse where you must have the brushes with you as an extra item.  I travel a lot so I appreciate the ease of just throwing this in my make up bag.  It does sting a bit but just apply carefully and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I have used this produce since Christmas as I received it and the brow product from this company from a friend.  They both work with small little new hairs growing out within weeks right befor your eyes.  The lashes got very long as the months went by.  The brows got so full I needed waxing every 3 weeks.  I am happy tp say this worked for me, not a gimmick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more then 10 enhancers in the past few years. Grande lash seems to work fine. I have spare lashes that are different in length, after a month of using the product, my lashes length is even, they curl in one direction and appear much fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I like GrandeLash  for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes ( you can have brown/reddish eye liner in the beginning but it disappears after several days of using)&lt;br /&gt;2. It made my eyelashes longer and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;3 Affordable&lt;br /&gt;4 Good for eyebrows too.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!  What a great price!!! I order this all the time and have turned in lots of ladies to it!!!</li>
            <li> Worked great at first, lashes really got noticeably longer, but then after using for a year or more they went back to normal and the stuff really has no effect any more</li>
            <li> Been using for one month and not noticing any results. I will continue to use this until it&#x27;s gone.  I think it shows results after the months. This product does burn my eyes if I put too much on. I am hoping that it does work.</li>
            <li> This stuff has worked very well!  I&#x27;m 43 and recently noticed that certain small sections of my lashes were missing.  I apply this product every night before bed and have noticed a difference.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to make my lashes much fuller, but the length has definitely increased and with the right mascara, my lashes look great.  Will definitely purchase again soon!</li>
            <li> I am not a skeptic, but like most people (probably yourself included), I have purchased numerous products with their bold and blaring claims to do wonderful things for you only to eventually toss them (or the remainder of them) in the trash and chalk it up to another learned lesson and waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;NOT SO with this GrandeLASH! It actually works! I purchased it the first time in February 2013 and can&#x27;t remember how many days it took to actually notice, but alas, I DID notice! Yayyyy! I have eyelashes again! Well, My tube ran out, and I didn&#x27;t order more so now I am ordering another and ll try and keep track of how long before I notice longer lashes. The point of this review is...you can use it every OTHER day and still keep your good results, but, DON&#x27;T RUN OUT OF IT!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to those who need fuller, longer lashes and brows.</li>
            <li> I give this product a five star rating.  It is super simple to apply and the results are AHHHH-Mazing!  It thickens and lengthens your lashes in just a few short weeks. Say bye-bye to false eye lashes or those expensive extensions.  Also, I received this product in record time, fastest shipping ever for standard shipping, (which was free, I might add). The price was around $25.00 less then the exact same one sold at my hair salon.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING. I get comments everyday about my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Before I used the Grande lash my lashes were so short and thin. The lowers couldn&#x27;t even been seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use grande lash for the rest of my life. Even if my children have to come to the nursing home to apply it. Lol</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I saw a difference within a week or two but more towards my outer edge lashes. But still saw a hugely significant difference.</li>
            <li> WOW!..this does work…you need to use it 2X/daily to see the effects, then down to 1X/daily (at night) for maintenance, but you will see regrowth of both your eyelashes and eyebrows! Will order again.</li>
            <li> Dont use this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I used revitalash every night for 5 years, and it made my eyelashes super long and they stayed long as long as I used it. I decided to try this one cause it was less money. As soon as I stared using this i lost 3-4 eyelashes every morning when I washed my face. I used it for a few days, and when I stopped using it they stopped falling out a few days later...</li>
            <li> Only using about 3 weeks . Some notable difference</li>
            <li> I have been a user of GrandeLASH MD for 2 solid years, purchasing the product from the company direct at a higher price.  My lashes for two years have become thick and long and more than I could have hoped for.  When I saw the same product (so I thought) offered for half the price I jumped at the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product promptly and everything seemed great...until I began using the product ordered from Grande Naturals and my lashes began to thin and fall out.  How could this be if I had been using the &amp;#34;same product&amp;#34; from the manufacturer direct for two years and after two weeks of using the proclaimed same product from Grande Naturals my results changed dramatically in a negative way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When requesting a refund I was told that opened products can not be refunded.  This was a policy of amazon of all health and beauty products.  If I were to buy this product from GrandeLASH MD direct,  if my were results weren&#x27;t as proclaimed or positive in anyway they would except my return and issue a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this review as a buyers beware.  I did read all the reviews prior to ordering and all of them were positive so I thought I had really found a reliable source.  Well in my experience the product from this site DID NOT give me the same results and unfortunately I lost my beautiful lashes and was out $40.00.  I hope this review helps those of you considering ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I do not normally write reviews. The results of this product changed my mind. If you put this on daily it will work. Some say it takes a few weeks. I have found if you hang in there 3 or 4 months you will not be able to question the results. This stuff is amazing and will work for you. It does not change the color of anything. They only time I experienced and discomfort from this product it was my own fault. I was tired and got it in my eye or I put it on to heavily and its ran in my eye. Put it on lightly like eyeliner and you will have no trouble. This will work. I have recommended it to several friends and it has worked on everyone</li>
            <li> So far so good even though I won&#x27;t see results yet, the look of the package is nice, the appliction is easy, no irritation.  Ill post another review after I see results</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in the length and thickness of my lashes. It has given me a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> I thought this might HELP a little, but it is has REALLY improved my lashes.  They are THICKER and LONGER !  My bottom lashes are LONGER than they have ever been.  AMAZING !! I bought the mascara also and love it.  I am NOT really great about remembering to use it like I should, and it still has been GREAT !!!  I purchased in Feb and am already seeing results within 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Did not darken lashes...some length but I noticed also that the amount of lashes that  I was losing, was drastic! Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This product works great. Within 3 weeks you could see a considerable difference. I have had so many compliments on my lashes being so long and have recommended this product to all my friends. Every one is using it now.</li>
            <li> love this product use it with the mascara great combo....totally see my lashes thicker and longer will buy and use again</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse for years. About 6 months ago I ran out and decided not to replace it as it is so expensive. I my eyelashes returned to normal. I am of Native American decent and have been blessed with short straight lashes. Yuk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend recommended GrandLASH and I thought I would give it a try. I noticed a difference in days!!!! No joke.</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer and thicker.  The only drawback is once you start using this, you have to do maintenance with it couple times a week.</li>
            <li> I had a quick and bad reaction to this product - very red and sore eyelids after 4-5 days of the recommended use. People thought I was wearing red eyeshadow. Will assume an allergic reaction, but regardless, I had to throw it away and will see a dermatologist for a more medically approved version of this item.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 3 or 4 different eyelash enhancers; this is by far the best!! My eyelashes are darker and longer. I have blonde normally; I love not having to wear mascara. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This eyelash serum is amazing!! My lashes have never looked this good. My lashes are now super long n super sexy!!!! I only use this once a week and am loving the results. 😀</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me and made my eyelids itch terribly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at the recommendation of a well known make-up artist in my area. I have to say it really works. My formerly blonde lashes are now brown, a little thicker and longer. In addition, it also helped my spotty eyebrows. The color of my brows did not change, but they filled in quite a bit. I no longer have to draw them on. I still darken them a bit with brow liner because they are so light, but I am no longer drawing on my face. The tube lasts about six weeks, if used twice a day. I put it on before I go to bed under my night eye cream and again before I put on makeup in the morning. I tried using it only once a day once I got results, but it was not the same. This is not going to give you eyelashes like fake ones, but there is a noticeable difference. The one drawback of this enhancer is that you have to keep using it or your lashes will go back to when you started. The price on Amazon for this product is very reasonable with no shipping charge. (Saw it here in the Chicago area for $65, plus our 9.25% tax.)</li>
            <li> It caused brown coloring around my eyes. I already have some of that already since I&#x27;ve gotten a bit older, and it was really bad using this. It went away after I stopped taking it. I only got a few lashes from it anyway. None of these type of products have really worked for me, so that&#x27;s not to say it won&#x27;t work for someone else. It did seem to work a bit better for my brows.</li>
            <li> working exacting as the product said it would. love it!</li>
            <li> best product to ever hit the market is this grande lash md eyelash and eyebrow enhancer for lenth its a must get</li>
            <li> This is amazing...my lashes are finally growing &amp;amp; getting thicker. I apply it at night on my lash line &amp;amp; that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this so I had to see for myself. I absolutely loved it! I actually have a weird ocd disorder in which I pull out my eyebrows and eyelashes when I get stressed. Nothing too serious, but after using this you could not tell at all! It really worked on my eyelashes! Made them sooo much longer and a heck of a lot stronger. Saw results on my eyebrows too. Sometimes I felt the need to use several coats...this is not necessary at all. I am ordering more!</li>
            <li> This product is effective, in one week I could tell that my eyelashes were growing, after a month they look great, but I have notice that I don&#x27;t have more, maybe a little thicker. I am pleased!!!&lt;br /&gt;The service was great, it arrive on time. Thank You AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> This did not work for me, at all.  It irritated the rims of my eyes, made my eyes burn, and made my eyelids red, even though used as directed.  I figured I would try it on my eyebrows rather than throwing it away.  It even irritated the skin beneath my eyebrows!!  The skin felt irritated, turned pink and dry, then became scaly.  I am not THAT sensitive, so I can&#x27;t understand why there are not a LOT more reviews saying that this product is causing a lot of burning, redness and irritation.  Done with this!</li>
            <li> I was a little we worried about using any product. I have very sensitive skin.THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!!!  My neighbor just told me she never noticed how long eyelashes are! My husband thought I put fake lashes on. Used it for 3 weeks 1x a day and lashes are amazing. So happy that I&#x27;m recommending this product to all my friends!</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for 1 week which is too soon to tell how well it works.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars with pleasure:)&lt;br /&gt;my friend got GrandeLASH MD Eyelash and Eyebrow Enhancer for her birthday and after a month or so after she started using it I&#x27;ve noticed that her eyelashes got longer and fuller, so I&#x27;ve decided to give it a try myself. I have used it on my lashes and eyebrows. I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of compliments since I&#x27;ve tried the product that my lashes look long!!!&lt;br /&gt;would definitely recommend GrandeLASH MD Eyelash and Eyebrow Enhancer for all women. But ladies, please DO READ the instructions!!!!</li>
            <li> it actually works and is way cheaper than latice. this would be the second time i purchase this product very effective</li>
            <li> Really works!  Lasts a few months, then I buy another. I did experience some faint discoloration on my eyelids, but it&#x27;s not objectionable as it looks like a soft eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have very small eyelashes and now they are beautiful. It work excellent and I would recommend this to all my friends!</li>
            <li> It works-but was disappointed that my first one didn&#x27;t last 3 mos.</li>
            <li> Great product. Been using it for ages. Works great.</li>
            <li> So far so good...starting to notice longer lashes :)</li>
            <li> The best last growth product I have used! My lashes are long and full!! Love this product.</li>
            <li> I got a tube as a gift. I was super excited to try something that could possibly help fatten, lengthen my puny excuse for eyelashes. Within a few (3?) weeks I started noticing a little extra length to my lashes when curling them--ooooh aaahh...me felt pretty, the magic tube made this one a happy girl. But... during that time I also noticed some intense, unwanted side effects. Maybe I just have really sensitive skin or eyelids but I would find my eyes extremely red around the rims, and sometimes my eyes would be almost bloodshot with a sandpaper-dry feeling that lasted all day. No, I didn&#x27;t dab the stuff on my eyeball or the lower lash line. I tapered the daily use down to just once a week thinking maybe the daily use was too much for me. I still got the red rimmed, druggie up all night eyes on each use and sadly, finally, had to give up. Three stars &#x27;cause in that time my lashes did get longer and fuller but my eyes just couldn&#x27;t take the extra perks that came with it. Works fab for eyebrows though!</li>
            <li> Grande Lash definitely works! it takes a while but my lashes are now longer and darker. I love it! it worked even better on my 21 year old daughter, and faster results. We applied it day and night for the first months and now just every other night for maintenance.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a recommendation of a friend after noticing how long her eyelashes were. It did the same for me. For the first month I applied A LOT every night, to the top lash and bottom. I apply right at the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes did  look bloodshot after the application and have been slightly itchy.&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are much longer, although not any thicker. In fact, I think the cycle of the hair life seems to be shorter and I seem to lose more eyelashes, more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll now only apply every other day, and not very much. It&#x27;s been about 2 months doing it this way. The irritation is not bad and my lashes are still long. Losing less lashes now too.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It works just as it says it does! My lashes are longer and seem fuller than ever. I tried it after noticing mine were thinning and seemed short. My hair stylist (whom I thought had false eyelashes) uses this and turned me on to it. Now I have 4 friends using it!</li>
            <li> It works!  Thanks for my lovely lashes!  I can&#x27;t believe the difference. Make sure to apply close to the lash line.</li>
            <li> This product works very well and really creates longer more beautiful lashes.  I bought it for a friend of mine who was going through chemotherapy and lost all her eyelashes.  She has begun to use it and is seeing wonderful results.  Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! You have to be patient as it takes a few weeks to see any results, but my lashes look fake. I actually had to cut one because it got too long. The product size has lasted me over 2 months.  The instructions state that you have to keep using it to maintain the length and I plan on buying it. I never want to lose these lashes.</li>
            <li> OK, so I actually bought this product almost a year ago. Why write a review now you ask? Well, I wanted to track the length of my lashes with this product over a long period of time as opposed to just a few weeks.  So, with that being said, I love this product. My lashes have grown long and strong with this product. I&#x27;ll be honest, I only saw some improvement after the first month or so, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was just imagining things.  I&#x27;d ask my sisters and they didn&#x27;t see much of a change at first. Well, I continued using the product regardless. To me, my lashes looked longer and I was content.  About...5 months of use, I started getting compliments on my lashes left and right. I would get asked if they were fake lashes because they looked so long. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting longer lashes. I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s only for length, not really for volume, so if you already have long lashes, this will just make them longer, not thicker. However, a word of caution...when I first started using the product, my eyes were not used to the solution, and it would make my eyes red during the first few months I was using it. Now, they get red from time to time, but it&#x27;s nothing some cleareyes eye solution can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  I had long lashes most of my life but, as I aged, my lashes got skimpier and shorter.  Aging isn&#x27;t nice at it&#x27;s best but I refused to let it mess with my best feature, my eyes!  I tried this product because the reviews were good.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!  It has made my lashes longer and thicker than they were in my youth!  I&#x27;m extremely happy with it and highly recommend it.  (One tube lasts at least 4 months when used as directed!)</li>
            <li> Was hoping that it would make my lashes a bit darker.  BUT, the length is great!!!!</li>
            <li> This product works within 2 weeks. I have seen a great change and have recieved many compliments on my eyes. The only drawback is if you put it too close to your eyes, the sclera (or white of your eye) can turn red. It usually goes away within an hour of waking up for me if i put it on too close the night before. Not sure what long term effects this could cause but its an avoidable issue if you apply correctly.</li>
            <li> It didnt work on me, my eyelashes didnt grow</li>
            <li> Please note this review is for the SERUM.  I am currently using the serum, liner and mascara together. I started with the serum only for a month and liked the results, so I added the makeup as well to see what would happen.  As I am over 50, I had been using the serum twice a day; now I am using the serum at night and the makeup n the morning and the results are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History: I had eyelash extensions for about a year and really liked them - not having to wear mascara and looking good right out of bed in the morning, but did not like the hassle and expense of maintaining them.  When I stopped getting the extensions my lashes were left short and stubby so I decided to try serum to regrow them.  Did some research and based on reviews here and elsewhere I decided to try GrandeLash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using the serum night and morning and was really seeing good results, but when I re-ordered the serum I decided to use the mascara and liner as well. Once I added the liner and the mascara to the serum, the results really amped up.  My lashes are twice their length now and look as good as when I had the extensions.</li>
            <li> My Lashes are amazing!</li>
            <li> just a little irritation the first week .I noticed fuller lashes within the 3rd week. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. My lashes are longer, thicker, and don&#x27;t fall out near as often. I get compliments on them all the time.</li>
            <li> Good product , fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I saw a major difference very quickly!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and cheaper than latisse. It does take a couple month&#x27;s , but your lashes will get longer and fuller!!!</li>
            <li> This works for my lashes but not for my eyebrows. Both my lashes and my brows have become more sparse as I&#x27;ve aged, and that&#x27;s been a struggle for me. I was OK filling in my brows with powder or pencil, but my lashes were getting more and more difficult to work with. An esthetician friend recommended GrandeLash, so I ordered it. I&#x27;ve been using it according to the instructions, which is twice a day. Other reviewers have mentioned that it stings your eyes, and that is true, but only for the first few applications. You get used to it. I noticed a dramatic difference in my lashes after only two months, but no real difference with my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve got random brow hairs sprouting up around my brows (and then I have to pluck them), but no new growth in the sparse patches of my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as my lashes are concerned, this product made a HUGE difference. My previously-short lashes are so long now, it&#x27;s crazy. I didn&#x27;t get a lot of extra volume, but the length is great. My lashes even curl up now, which they&#x27;ve never done before. (Probably because they weren&#x27;t long enough to curl.) When I&#x27;m wearing mascara, my lashes touch my browbone. I will definitely keep this product in my daily routine for lash enhancement, but I am still looking for something that will re-grow the sparse areas of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ll start off by saying this really does make your eyelashes longer. Like insanely longer. Mine were touching the middle of my eyebrows they were so long. However, I had to stop using it because it was creating burn-like marks where I was applying it (right on my lash line). Like noticeable red burn mark. It almost looked like I was wearing red eyeshadow. It also stung my eyes and made the bloodshot, but I do think this went away after awhile. Also, a trail of small hairs started to grow from my eyes down my cheeks, they were actually noticeable too! I stopped using this more than a year ago and the red marks on my eyelids are still there! So I don&#x27;t know if having long eyelashes is worth the side effects.</li>
            <li> This product works as it says it does, if you keep using it your lashes do fill in, I found that not all the lashes grew you seem to have your shorter lashes and then some long ones, maybe it was the way it was applied but you would think that ALL the lashes would be fuller.</li>
            <li> Professionals have told me that this is the best lash product and is the only one that can be worn with lash extensions.  You may experience some sensitivity but I find if I skip a day or two, I can go back to using it.  It does work!!</li>
            <li> Every day I&#x27;m asked if my lashes are real. Takes about a month to see results but it is worth it. Best thing I purchased.</li>
            <li> MADE MY UPPER LASHES FALL OUT IN CERTAIN SPOTS WITH IN THE FIRST WEEK OF USING IT. I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This actually works!  It takes a little longer for older women like me (late 50&#x27;s), but it definitely works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and my eyelashes are thinning as I age. After receiving this product as a gift I decided to try it. As a skeptic, I didn&#x27;t bother taking a before picture of my eyes. The first couple times i used the product the skin around my eyes turned red and burned a little but with use that subsided. After 4 weeks of use i can say it is well worth the money and well worth the uncomfortable feeling in the beginning! I could be a poster child for Grande Lash MD, it is an amazing product that REALLY works!</li>
            <li> It takes about 8 weeks to work so be patient. But after 8 weeks you will have long full lashes.  Everyone thinks that my lashes are fake! The reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because unfortunately once you start using it you have to use it forever. If you stop using it for more than a 2 week period your lashes will start to fall out.  Your lashes will also start to shrink.&lt;br /&gt;Good news is after you get to your desired length you can use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I ordered GrandeLash MD. I have previously used Lilash and that worked as well-but left dark circles around my eyes on the skin.  GrandLash took about one month to work.  After about one month of using it, my lashes started to growth very nicely.  Not only did they grow longer, but they seemed to fill in more and looked thicker. I had no side effects at all from this product.  I now use it every two days and the lashes are looking great.  When I went on vacation, I had forgotten to bring it with me.  After not using it for ten days, there was no change at all.  Lashes still looked great!  I probably will try applying it every three days starting next month.  Pretty sure that will work for maintenance.  Very happy I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your eyes are makeup free before applying.  Seems to last a long time!</li>
            <li> Personally for me it didn&#x27;t work.. I used it for months and I did not see any improvement in my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I opted for using a more natural method, now I just put some vaseline in my eyelashes and eyebrows before going to bed, and avoided plucking them for a while - and they look much much better :)&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products similar to this one as well, and none have done what they say they do.. when it comes to your eyelashes is best to think of them as normal hair.. so the less chemicals you apply to them the better I think.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> This product is dangerous! ***I have noticed that a LOT of the positive reviews of this product are from people who have only left one review on Amazon and that one review is to talk this product up. This is a dangerous product that should be taken off the market!***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to reiterate the reviews from people that have had bad and/or allergic reactions to this product.  I use Laura Mercier, MAC, etc.... mainstream products that most of us can use - so I&#x27;m not toooooo overly sensitive but ONE night of using this (one little swipe across each eye lid NOT too close to the lash line) made my ENTIRE eyelid RED and made my eyes blood shot and I looked so &#x27;dead eyed&#x27; it is/was terrible! Honestly, I&#x27;ve never looked so terrible because it takes the sparkle out of your eye! I can&#x27;t wait to get a good nights sleep and see if I wake up looking &#x27;normal&#x27; - I can&#x27;t stand what this stuff did to me. It should be taken off the market!</li>
            <li> This lash enhancer works wonders.  I had to tell everyone I know where to get it because they couldn&#x27;t the length of my eyelashes.  This product is better than more expensive enhancers that I have tried and is the best so far.  It must be used consistently and you will see your lashes growing by 3-4 weeks, especially when mascara is applied.  The lashes are beautiful!! (And works a little on they eyebrows.  Not as much as lashes)</li>
            <li> I have been using GrandeLash MD for about 4 or 5 years now, and won&#x27;t ever stop! I am a nurse in a dermatology practice and I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how many compliments I get on my lashes from patients.  I have recommended this product to so many people and they all love it!  My daughter recently started using this product and she is a hairdresser and manager of a hair salon.  Her clients are all asking her what she is using for her lashes as well.&lt;br /&gt;I used the product twice a day for the first two week, then once a day until my lashes got so long I had to stop applying daily.  I apply it about three times a week to maintain the length.  One tube lasts me about 5 months!  I have a friend who had to trim her lashes because they got so long!  By the way, I have hazel color eyes, and have not had a problem with my eyes changing to a darker color.  Love it!</li>
            <li> too soon to tell if it&#x27;s going to work on my eyebrows, but I&#x27;m willing to stick it out</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Love this product. My lashes are longer than they&#x27;ve ever been...and fuller too. I will definitely continue purchasing it!</li>
            <li> Noticed some change but not like what I&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s unforutnate since I have bald spots on my eye lid. Some length and a little thickness but it just didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and noticed my lashes weren&#x27;t as long or thick as they used to be.A friend of mine told me she was using Grandelash MD and had gotten some great results. I started using Grandelash and am so impressed by how much longer my lashes are in just only a month. This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I was using Latisse for over two years and it worked fine. Latisse made my lashes a little longer but then my lashes stopped growing. I didn&#x27;t want to spend the big bucks to get Latisse again so I did some research on eyelash enhancers and found GrandeLASH MD and I have to say it works! My lashes are so long I&#x27;m going to have to trim them because they are touching my eyeglasses! I think it works better than Latisse! I love GrandeLASH MD so much I purchased two tubes and it still was cheaper than one Latisse. It did take six weeks for me to notice it working so be patience! I love love love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I have been using it for quite some time and get more compliments on my long lashes.</li>
            <li> very good product.  Definitely grows and darkens lashes!</li>
            <li> This stuff really does grow your lashes!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! I have bought it over and over again and cannot live without it! Completely changes my short, thin, blond lashes!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works...really!  I used City Lash previously and absolutely NO results.  So I was skeptical about trying another eyelash enhancer but GrandeLash absolutely works!</li>
            <li> The first one lasted for about 3 months.  I used it every day.  There was NO result.  The second one,  yes I ordered another, started working about a month after I bought it.  The growth is very slight.  I measured via two ways.  I took pictures, and I bought an eyelash curler.  When I first got the curler my eyelashes rested just below the top of the curler.  Now my lashes rest just above the top of the curler.  I can&#x27;t seem to grow them any longer, so... it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It took almost 6 weeks for it to start working but don&#x27;t give up. Once it starts working it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and haven&#x27;t seen any results.  I&#x27;ll keep trying and use it up but not much hope.  I was told I may see something after 2months but nothing yet.  Don&#x27;t think I would buy more at this price.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this at my hair salon, for a much higher price, and used as directed once a day, in the morning.  I was careful to apply it to the lash line, not too thick so to not have it ooze into my eyes. I&#x27;ve had no burning, redness or severe itching like I did with Latisse! Only used that one a few days, but threw it out.  Not worth the discomfort!  Reluctant to try again, but I did and I&#x27;m so happy! I am/was a natural blonde so my eyelashes are pale.  I used GrandeLASHfor about 4 weeks when I could honestly say I saw a major difference! I say honestly, because you are checking everyday for a change and I didn&#x27;t want to fool myself into thinking I saw one!! The upper lashes were longer, previously damaged by extensions. The lower lashes were growing even faster! My husband commented that seeing my beautiful eyes, looking sooo pretty without the &amp;#34;spider legs&amp;#34; as he called the extensions! was great! He loves the lashes knowing they are MINE!  I love the enhancer AND I love the complimenting mascara. My girlfriend told me my eyelashes &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34; the look of my eyes!  I will continue to use the enhancer everyday until the lashes are the length I&#x27;m happy with.  Common sense applies too....don&#x27;t apply the enhancer to any area on your eyes where lashes don&#x27;t normally grow!  Pay attention and take your time like you do with your eyeliner!  Wish I could take a picture of the before and after looks! The VAVOOM of the lashes is awesome! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how effective this eyelash growth serum is! I&#x27;m Asian with short straight lashes and never had such good looking long lashes before thanks to GrandeLASH! I highly recommend it too! The first few days of using it, my eyes were red and itchy but I shrugged it off thinking maybe it&#x27;ll go away. And it did! Apparently, when you first use it, your eyes aren&#x27;t used to the product. I bought this product for my mum as well and she had the same problem as well. Rest assured, it&#x27;s totally safe and harmless. You&#x27;ll be pleased with the results in 4-6 weeks! I notice a difference after just 1 week because that&#x27;s how short my lashes were. I&#x27;d wake up to longer more curled lashes! Love it!!</li>
            <li> ***Check out my before and after photo at 7  and 12 weeks in the product images***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 12 weeks later I definitely see results. The length is more subtle than I expected but my lashes are thicker. I prefer this to the long but spindly lashes I&#x27;ve seen with Latisse. Mascara definitely feels heavier on my eyes but that is not a bad problem to have :) I purchased the 2ml tube and there is still product left, although I can tell it is close to the end. I will continue using Grandelash MD in maintenance mode. Five stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product through an authorized seller at my local medical spa. I&#x27;ve been using it every evening and about 2-3 times a week in the mornings when I remember. The instructions recommend twice daily application for ages 30+, I am 33. I think I&#x27;ve followed the instructions fairly closely but the improvements have been minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think many testimonials and before/after photos lead you to believe that you&#x27;ll have amazingly long lashes in no time. But most do not have a timeframe for results and therefore aren&#x27;t very realistic in the expectations of what Grandelash MD will provide. This can discourage people when they don&#x27;t see results in a couple of weeks. I wish the product worked faster, but I am determined to finish the tube and see it through. I think that Grandelash MD will eventually work, but it will take longer or may not be as effective as Latisse. This may be a good thing if you&#x27;ve had irritation or side effects with the product to have a gentler alternative like Grandelash MD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a comparison, I started using Careprost (generic Latisse) on my eyebrows to fill in sparse areas and you can see in the photo that they&#x27;ve already started to fill in after 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update as I get closer to the 90 day mark with another before and after. Unless it wows me before I finish the tube, I think I will switch to Careprost for my lashes when I&#x27;m done with this tube. In any case, advice for using Grandelash MD, be patient :)In any case, advice for using Grandelash MD, be patient :)</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars for myself...it worked like nothing else! I saw results in a week. Much better than a prescription that I paid 2x as much for. But I bought this last one for my sister and the results are taking longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 4 weeks now but can already see that where I had a gap between my lashes from them falling out have been replaced. The rest of my lashes already seem fuller. I can&#x27;t wait to continue using it and watch them grow even more. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and had noticed that my lashes were thinning  out and my 42 year old daughter had used Grand Lash MD and and had thick long lashes, so I tried it and within 6 weeks I had longer thicker lashes that friends were complimenting and  wanted to know what the product was all about....So far 6 of my girlfriends are using the lash enhansor and liking the results.&lt;br /&gt;I wear contacts and do not have any problems.I just started my 2nd tube 3-4 times a week now that I have lush,thick and LONGER lashes...GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This is, by far, my #1 beauty product.  My husband actually asked if I was wearing false lashes.  Give yourself about 2 weeks and you will have lashes to rival the Kardashians&#x27;.  No need to pay thousands of dollars per year in lash extensions or to mess with falsies, this product will give you the same look without the hassle or expense.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Herd it worked, love it, doesent grow bald parts of eyebrows but deffinately grew, darkened, lengthined eyelashes n brow (that exists)!  My daughter n friends think i have false lashes on!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been quite 30 days. Therefore, I can say I see a big improvement in the growth of my lashes. Nevertheless, I plan to continue to use the product and see if my lashes will grow to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how anyone can give this a low rating... It&#x27;s like a miracle in a tube! My eyelashes are sooo crazy long! It&#x27;s awesome!!! I don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune, take tomine out for appointments or mangle my lashes trying to put fake ones on!</li>
            <li> Simply, it does what it says . Mainly, in length, some fullness, but not to the degree that length increases. Try it , you will like it... A lot!</li>
            <li> Was recommended over Latisse by a Dr.  Works amazingly well!  I highly recommend this product for anyone wanting to fill in eye lashes or eye brow area.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical to use miraculous products but this really works :) I started with the liquid to grow my lashes now I am using mascara from the same line and my lashes look like to die for :)</li>
            <li> Because it works! I&#x27;ve used it just over 2 months and have noticed longer, darker, lashes. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> this works fairly well</li>
            <li> This works great.  I can&#x27;t believe my lashes since I&#x27;ve been using this.  I can&#x27;t believe the price, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Excited my expectations.</li>
            <li> This product really does work. I&#x27;ve been asked if I wear false lashes while wearing mascara. I&#x27;ve been using this for 7 months. I saw results immediately; my lashes were drastically longer within two months. You do have to maintain the regime to keep the length. I started with applications morning and night, then dropped to once a day or every other day once I reached my desired results.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!!! My eyelashes looks like a cat miau</li>
            <li> I had such high expectations about this product. I had several friends who highly recommended it. When the product arrived, it was basically empty. I tipped it over and shook the tube and the tiniest bit of liquid came out. But there was not enough to coat the applicator brush. I spent over $50.00 on an empty gold tube. I will write the seller and see if this can be rectified. I look forward to actually reviewing the product</li>
            <li> Had bought this at a Salon for 75.00 and loved it, it really works if you don&#x27;t have a reaction from it. Was happy to find it on Amazon for less money.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using it for 3 plus month and the result is fantastic on the eyelashes and eyebrows, better than latisse for sure</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 months now and I can really see the difference longer fuller lashes, I will continue using product for maintenance good bye latissa.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely made my eyelashes grow longer. However it does take a few months so be patient. This is my second bottle of it.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting miracles. I expected something along the lines of either longer, fuller, or darker lashes. I used this product strictly as directed and got none of the above results. My lashes are still blonde and sparse. At the least I imagined that for nearly $40 I might get SOME results.... Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product. My eyelashes have grown incredibly long &amp; think &amp; even helped my eyebrow growth.&lt;br /&gt;This product really works!</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t use it everyday because I was lazy. Then I started using it every night before bedtime and in the morning when I woke up. I noticed my eyelashes started growing after 4 weeks of applying twice a day everyday. I Had to trim my lashes a bit as they were hitting my eyeglasses. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Affordable and results that are beyond words.  You actually look like you have false eyelashes when in fact they are your own!  Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Its been six weeks of application to lashes..sometimes forgetting a night or two!  No results yet!  A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have just begun using this product (@3 weeks).  I do see an improvement in lash length and slight improvement in darkness.  I am assuming that additional time will make a more noticeable difference.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Great results.</li>
            <li> After using eyelash extensions for a few months when I finally had them removed I was left with very short stubby lashes and a lot less volume. My beautician recommended using this product that I purchased at the salon. It does take a few months to see full results but after  using it for a little over 2 months my eyelashes are back to their initial fullness and much longer and curlier than ever before. First month I used it just at night but for most days now I use it in the am as well. I no longer feel I need to use an eyelash curler anymore either.</li>
            <li> Amazing! It totally works! This was my second purchase of this product and I will be placing another order when it runs out. Love it! It took about 2wks to see a change and by 4wks results were amazing! Completely recommended this magic tube!</li>
            <li> I love it. I get so many compliments on how long my lashes are. Only downside is my eyes get red every now and then.</li>
            <li> Used the product at night for 5 days straight. Eyes looked bloodshot and eyelids swollen . Once I stopped using it, 2 days later my eyes felt normal again.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this will work</li>
            <li> Really great product saw a difference in a week!</li>
            <li> It really works.  This is the second time I have ordered it! All my friends have noticed the difference.  A big surprise!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!!!  It took about 6 weeks of using it every other day to get the results I wanted.  I only use on the upper lashes and it lasted about 4 months before I needed another tube.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff - my friends thought I was wearing false eyelashes.  Takes about 4 weeks to see the change, but then it just keeps getting better. Love it!</li>
            <li> Does not work.  I might as well rub snake oil on the lids of my eyes.  Smh. #whatascam. #wantmymoneyback. #doubtillgetit</li>
            <li> very happy with this product.  it&#x27;s nice to have a product that lives up to its advertisement and does the job.</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful to find an alternative to Latisse.  I purchased GrandeLASH based on Amazon reviews and my experience very much differed from those with positive reviews.  This produce resulted in minimal growth - yes I followed instructions to the letter - and to top it off when I stopped my lashes actually broke off as if they were brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since returned to  Latisse and my lashes have recovered nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li> I loved Smart Lash so I thought I&#x27;d give Grande lash a try.  I can honestly see a difference in my lashes and eyebrows since I started using them.  Both products are great!  I had sparce lashes and brows since having chemo.  These products have really made a difference!</li>
            <li> I ordered Nutra Luxe Lash the last time, getting the box confusted with GrandeLash. I am glad I ordered the correct GrandLash this time. What a difference, I love it!</li>
            <li> Scam!  This is NOT the real Grande Lash!  I checked ingredients against my real tube and the first ingredient of this is Deonized Water!  I translate that to be WATERED DOWN!</li>
            <li> Product definitely gives some results, but it definitely irritates the eyes. I wake up in the morning with blood shot eyes &amp; does make them sensitive after some time. Putting eye drops helps with the irritatio, &amp; temporarily alleviates the redness, but it comes back after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind going through some discomfort, then I would definitely recommend this for people looking for help in the lash-growing department.</li>
            <li> Better than expected. My sister gave this to me as a gift and with all the positive feedback I&#x27;ve decided to continue ordering.</li>
            <li> my lashes do grow with this and they look great. I use it every night and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of different lash growing products and this is the only one that works. You can see results within weeks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three months now, and I can officially say it works and works well! My mom bought Latisse about the same time and I think GrandLASH works just as well! (Although I am quite a bit younger than her. That might make a difference.)&lt;br /&gt; I rarely wear mascara anymore. All I need is to curl my eyelashes and they look forever long! I want to get them tinted so I&#x27;ll never have to wear mascara again! In the photo, I&#x27;m wearing no makeup and haven&#x27;t curled my eyelashes. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I typically do not leave reviews, but I highly recommend users purchase directly from Grande. I inadvertenly purchased this product - merely enough solution for a single use and burned my eyes almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a great experience with the original product and will purchase directly through them.</li>
            <li> Love it works great!!</li>
            <li> This works really well and made my lashes very long.  The drawback is that it made my eyes red and irritated, so I had to stop using it.  Other people may have a different reaction, but I felt that it was unsafe for me to continue using it.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s terrific!!!!</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell it works great my eyelashes are longer but it would&#x27;ve been nice if I could&#x27;ve tried it for a longer period time. You see it is a liquid and turning it upside down does make it spill all over. For some reason, I guess cuz it looks like a Mascara, I thought it was thicker. And since it went all over my bed I could not recover it so I didn&#x27;t get to try it for at least a month anyways.....</li>
            <li> Not seeing any difference</li>
            <li> Although it takes a few weeks longer to see results, this product works just as well as Latisse, at a fraction of the cost.  I had used Latisse and saw results in about 5-6 weeks.  I ran out and stopped using it for 4 weeks or so and my lashes went back to normal.  Found GrandeLash on amazon and decided to give it a try.  It took a good 8 weeks to see results (applying just once a day), my lashes are now fuller and longer.  Just ordered my second bottle!</li>
            <li> My lashes aren&#x27;t as full as they used to be and when I&#x27;m stressed, whole sections of my lashes will fall out. A friend of mine is a distributor of Grande Lash and since she uses the product and I saw how long her lashes looked, I decided to give it a try. I noticed a difference after about three weeks.  My lashes started filling in and looked noticeably darker. After three months the results were amazing. I&#x27;m a woman in my forties and I have had teenage girls ask me if they&#x27;re real. Been using Grande Lash since July of 2013....I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It works! So happy! :)</li>
            <li> I definitely wanted to try this and I&#x27;m sure it would work for me if it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes--my left eye especially turned red in the inside corner. I waited a few days then tried the drops again. Same thing. Eye turns red and itches. If possible, I would like to return what is left and get a refund. Hopefully this can be done. Thank you. Diane</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now, and I can see a big difference! My lashes are a lot longer. It took a while to see a difference, but it does work. The tube has lasted longer than three months! I now only use it every other night. I have a friend that uses it, and I saw a difference in her lashes, and that is why I bought it. I&#x27;ve heard that it takes longer for this to work than with other products, but the cost can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> seeing improvement in one week</li>
            <li> This really works,  thank you for your very prompt shipment too</li>
            <li> This product really does work</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  Now so happy.  My eyebrows were very thin and I was not happy with the way they looked.  Tried Latisse before from my doctor and it may have helped a bit but not much and you have to have prescription or get from doctor and it is more expensive than this.  I have been using this product since December and I have noticed a difference in the last two weeks.  A real difference. I don&#x27;t even use everyday, I forget sometimes.  Eyebrows are much thicker and growing in around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really did not need thicker lashes but I use it on my lashes a few times a week and I do notice a difference there as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for going on four weeks, NO results yet.  I&#x27;m disappointed!</li>
            <li> Ouch!  This stuff burns like liquid fire!  I did not see any discernible difference in my lashes so I went back to my go to, Rapid Lash.</li>
            <li> i would saying i still waiting for the result, i can see the a little approved by another 2 or 3 weeks later.</li>
            <li> I suffered from an extreme skin allergy which made me loose my eyelashes and eyebrows completely. I&#x27;m a penny pincher so when I came across this product ( much less expensive than others I&#x27;ve seen ) I grabbed it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months and could tell it was working, I once again had complete upper and lower lash line. Today is the first day I&#x27;ve tried to use mascara and I couldn&#x27;t believe my mirror! I had totally missed the length they had grown to! Don&#x27;t think twice, get this now. I have left it at the side of my &amp;#34;T V chair&amp;#34; and I know I&#x27;ve used two or three times a day ( other days not at all )  I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I put my glasses on and could feel my lashes brush against my lens.</li>
            <li> My lashes look fuller. Not sure about longer but maybe it will grow as I use it longer. For the price, it&#x27;s much much more affordable than latisse and still does what it should!  Definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using GrandeLash for years, I have to admit I&#x27;m addicted to it! I have long and thick lashes. I will continue to use GrandeLash for the years to come.</li>
            <li> I never dreamed that I could have eyebrows and eyelashes that I would be able to see someday without lots of pencil and mascara...not to mention the  time it took to apply everything. Yuck! This stuff works great and I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> It works within weeks and is wonderful.  However, my last order on 8/19/14 ... the vial was empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a similar product that&#x27;s twice the amount of this product and didn&#x27;t give results like this. I get asked if they are my real lashes all the time. This is so worth the money. I used it every day until my short, thin lashes grew to my eyebrows (curled)- took about four weeks. now I use it once or twice a week for the last six weeks and they are still long and thick. hope everyone gets these results.</li>
            <li> I used this for about a week and I wasn&#x27;t impressed because it was to much maintenance and it burned my eyes alittle to much! I should of returened it but I will keep trying I guess!</li>
            <li> I have been using Grande Lash MD since September 2013 and my eyelashes have grown so much. My lashes were straight and short. Now I get compliments on them. They don&#x27;t look fake which is something I love. They look very natural. My eyebrows haven&#x27;t grown in but I think that&#x27;s because I use pencil or powder on them and sometimes I don&#x27;t thoroughly clean them off before applying it. I will continue to use it until my eyebrows grow in darker. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to buy it on Amazon they have the best prices when it comes to beauty.</li>
            <li> This product will work as long as you use it every day.  May take a bit longer than some of the other more expensive products, but will eventually get the same results. Try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65, of Northern European stock and have naturally stubby lashes.  I guess expected a miracle.  I&#x27;ve been using this product since the week before Christmas -- around a month .  I agree with the other users whose lids were left reddish and a  itchy.  No scaling, but it feels different.  Also, I&#x27;ve had darker under eye circles since, but that might be natural as there is precious little sunlight in overcast Indiana in the winter.  So far, no eyelash growth.  I didn&#x27;t buy the product from Amazon, but a spa and paid about $10 more.  It&#x27;s not worth the price so far.  Will review again at three months of use.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are growing, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! They do not get &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; as much as they get &amp;#34;length&amp;#34; (just FYI)</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m 50, my lashes are medium brown, blondish tips, and look great with mascara, but I wanted them to look decent without mascara and also wanted to restore the number of them. I had more when I was younger and, as my mother likes to remind me, I might still have the ones I lost had I taken better care of them by taking off my mascara before bed. I read a bunch of reviews and decided to go for it. I started using it at the beginning of January and had no problems with any stinging, so I started using it twice a day (not super religiously since I get lazy sometimes -- see previous note regarding neglect) and didn&#x27;t really notice anything but decided to give it time. Suddenly my boss asks me if I&#x27;m using a different mascara. Then I notice in the magnifying mirror (while inspecting my eyebrows, which, btw, are next in line for treatment) that my eyelashes are longer and totally growing upward and curved. Next thing -- this is all in the course of about a week -- they are so long I have to be careful putting on mascara because otherwise they can look slightly ridiculous. I am going to keep going to see if in addition to being super long and curved they also get darker and fuller. Right now (into my sixth week) it&#x27;s more like the existing ones have grown and been curled, so I&#x27;m going to see if it seems like any new ones are joining the party. I will keep you posted. P.S. Even my husband has noticed... and of course my mother has too, but no surprise there! :)</li>
            <li> It does work. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months, and my lashes look much better and longer. One thing to remember though, the lashes grow in different lengths at first Just keep using it, and the others will catch up. I bought this at my salon, and honestly, this is a great price on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ll be using it for a long time!</li>
            <li> I had tried Latisse a couple of years ago but, for the price, it just wasn&#x27;t in the cards to continue using it. Of course, when I stopped using it, my lashes returned to their normal (short, straight) length. It was amazing but, it wasn&#x27;t a priority in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GrandeLASH MD became all the rage here with the ladies in the office in the spring this year. After seeing their results, I decided to give it a try. But, since GrandeLASH MD was within my price range, especially for the 3 month supply, I took the leap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is amazing. I intentionally waited to do my review to give it time to work. I really didn&#x27;t need to wait this long because I saw a difference almost immediately - not in length, of course but, for the fact that my lashes started to \\&quot;curl\\&quot;. At least, they weren&#x27;t straight out and I had no need to use a lash curler! That, right there, was wonderful for me. But, the best was yet to come. My lashes HAVE grown! They&#x27;re far longer than they used to be, no curler needed and, when I do use mascara, they are SO noticeable. One coat and I&#x27;m done...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using GrandeLASH MD for as long as they make it!!! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Works hands down.  Never had a problem. Saw results in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now. It&#x27;s working but very slowly. I wish it would work a little better .  I guess I have to give it  a little more time</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer than they have ever been. I did not notice them getting much thicker but they are definitely longer. LOVE IT. Will continue to use this product forever if they keep it around. I used it for two months morning and night and now I only use it once a day to maintain the length. HAPPY GIRL!</li>
            <li> It works as long as you continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Took a few months to fully see all growth, but a big difference.  A friend asked if I was wearing false eyelashes! Can really notice with mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 and basically had no length at all on my lashes. I have used Grande Lash MD for a couple of months. One of my high school students told me today that I have pretty lashes. They are longer than when I was a teen. Hoo yah!</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly , I am very happy I got a lot of compliments how my lashes looks longer .</li>
            <li> This stuff made my lashes Longer AND fuller.  Bought Rapid Lash and thought that worked really good ( it did....for a while ), but this stuff is THE bomb!  My pale blonde almost non existent lashes are now long and lengthy.  Took about two months to see major results, but it is worth the time and effort.  My lids have a red cast, but figure that is a small price to pay for these long lashes.  I just put a primer on my lids to counter act the redness and apply my shadow as usual.  Will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different products including Latisse to enhance my skimpy lashes.  This is the first product that actually worked.  I&#x27;ve had two different aestheticians remark on my long lashes, and that&#x27;s saying something!</li>
            <li> Love the results.  Get compliments everyday.  Especially after having hardly no lashes left after 2 years of eyelash extensions😟</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  It completely enhances and elongates lashes.  When you first try it, use it daily until your lashes are LONG, then you only need to use it about every 3 days.  I will never stop using it!</li>
            <li> My lashes look awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks now and I can tell my lashes are getting thicker and longer.  I started wiping the wand off so that the amount applied is reduced due to my eyes getting irritated.  They would turn red and I felt like there was an increase in pressure in my eyes.  Since I&#x27;ve started reducing the amount of product applied it has helped to reduce those side effects dramatically.  Now I started using it twice a day with no issues.</li>
            <li> Half the price though which I like. Latisse is overpriced. Longer, fuller eyelashes make us girls look younger and it&#x27;s just a fun thing to do a couple of times a year (my habit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product at a good price! Will buy again in six months.</li>
            <li> I did use it in the morning and before bed. Then I transitioned into a couple of times during the week. My lashes are definitly longer (not fake lash long but enough to continue purchasing the product!) Does cause some skin irritation at application site that is easily covered with make up and does improve with time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 4 days so I don&#x27;t know if it works or not yet, but I do however want to give a fair warning to ANYONE thinking of purchasing this! On my second day of use my eyes turned completely blood-red. I mean demon vampire from hell red, not just slightly pink. I work in retail/customer service so I can&#x27;t exactly walk around looking like a stoned vampire. I brought maximum strength eye drops for red eye and it didn&#x27;t help much. Not only did I LOOK like a vampire after 2 days but  I felt like one also! My eyes became super sensitive to sunlight, regardless of whether I was actually looking at the sun or not. Just walking outside with my eyes cast downwards would cause a painful stinging sensation in my eyes the likes of which I&#x27;ve never felt before (even worse than staring into the sun with no eye protection). I honestly considered throwing it away because I was afraid I would go blind! The stinging just went away yesterday and my eyes are slowly returning to their normal white color. If you&#x27;re willing to suffer through some god awful side-effects this MIGHT be awesome, but just be warned there will probably be side effects...horrible, horrible side effects. I&#x27;m going to continue using this product and I will update with pictures if I see results.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Exactly as indicated.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  It took at least three months to do the trick, but right around there, a few lashes became noticeably longer and then they all got really long shortly thereafter.  Without mascara, I am not sure anyone would notice, but one coat and it really shows.  I did not purchase the grand lash mascara- just using whatever I have always used with fantastic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say I did try using it twice a day for the first few days (as the directions say some women experience faster growth with twice daily use) but the color around my eyes started to look different.  Went to one time daily and the odd coloring went away.  Seriously long lashes.  LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> Works very good in one month my lashes were so long my husband told me to stop using it, because they were long and dark. I decide to try Rapidlash but didnt do nothing at all. I am gonna bu it again Grandalash, even after one bad experience i ordered once and got empty one. But i wrote them and got my money back in 2 days.</li>
            <li> Earlier in the year I had Lasik surgery and lost a lot of eye lashes due to the sticky eye drops.  I could not wear make-up after the surgery and after some time passed, my husband asked me not to bother with make-up any more.  So I had an issue of sparse eye lashes.  I used a competitor product that was cheaper for about four months which helped to grow back baby lashes that I had lost.  But the results were disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased GrandeLash back in June of 2013.  I use this product daily every morning after washing my face.  I do not wear make-up, so the application is easy and quick.  I don&#x27;t use the creams around the eye liner area since it would prohibit the product from working.  After two months of use, my lashes were so cute. It&#x27;s amazing how longer, darker lashes can make one look younger.  I had longer lashes starting to peak out.  After three months, my lashes look like they did back when I wore mascara.  There is a pink line along where I apply the GrandeLash which at first concerned me.  It looks like there is a significant increase in blood supply to the area that accounts for the pinkish hue.  Now I have come to like it because it looks like I am wearing eye shadow. I personally love it.  I just ordered several more containers because others who have noticed the difference want to try it as well. However my daughter, a young adult will not use it due to the petroleum products in it.  I normally would not use a product with these ingredients as well; however, I&#x27;m so happy with the results, I disregarded the health concerns.  I know, shame on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted before and after pics on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End result, my goal was to not need make-up and I don&#x27;t (at last not for my eyes).  Now time to tackle the sun spots on the face.</li>
            <li> Definitely works, I saw results in about 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> You will see results after a few weeks of use... love this product!! It definitely works. Great price, fast shipping, would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> my lashes are longer than they have ever been! I still use mascara every day but the length is amazing!</li>
            <li> Applied the product every other day. Irritated my eyes with no signfigant improvements. Eye lash got just a tiny bit longer.</li>
            <li> Saw results within 3 weeks! I&#x27;m still using it and I&#x27;m excited about results so far. I will most certainly be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> My lashes were short and thin.  Now they are long and thick.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now, and my lashes are long and full. I started to notice a difference at about 5-6 weeks, and I used it every night just on my upper lashes.  I don&#x27;t even need to wear mascara!  Be patient though - keep it up every night for the first 3 months - you WILL see a difference, it just takes time.  Now I use it every other day and so far my lashes still look great.</li>
            <li> Thanks beautiful product N easy to apply</li>
            <li> I received the wrong item.  I ordered Grande for eyebrows. I received the GrandeLash for eyelash.  The item pictured here is what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Can I get a replacement.</li>
            <li> Worked great on first tube, then ran out. Reordered and it didn&#x27;t seem to last nearly 3 months and didn&#x27;t seem as effective. I switched brands to Revitalash</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> My sister used it and it was fantastic!  So I decided to try it! I&#x27;m still using it and I think it may take me a little while as my lashes were damaged from trying the individual ones! But I like it and will continue to use it! I also have seen a difference in my lashes! Su I recommend it to those who want long lush dark lashes!!</li>
            <li> It is a product very good&lt;br /&gt;I hope to buy again</li>
            <li> This eyelash enhancer really works. My wife uses.</li>
            <li> This really works great. I think it works better then Latisse and cost less and has more to use. I was at a baby shower and my cousin  thought  I had false lashes and pulled on them cause thought  I was lying.  I used every day and night untill I got the resuls. Then used every so often just for touch ups.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I started using this product consistently about 5 weeks ago and both my friends and I have noticed my eyelashes growing longer. I can also notice new eyelashes that are working there way up to the length of my regular eyelashes. I am so excited for when they catch up because they are already beautiful! Great product :)</li>
            <li> Love it.  I actually have eye lashed now</li>
            <li> I purchased my grand las on may 9, and it&#x27;s not working. My tube is orange and not gold like the one shown.</li>
            <li> Love this product and will continue to purchase it as it has helped give me long full eyelashes after losing some of my eyelashes after getting an eye lash extension - this product has restored my lashes and made them thicker and fuller - I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments without even using mascara.</li>
            <li> I rate it at number one.</li>
            <li> I used it in the past and had good results so I wanted to continue using it, but this time it did nothing. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I reddened eyes, burst blood vessels on the first day of use.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews for products, however, this product does as described and the results I have experienced have been absolutely amazing. I will continue to use this product because hands down it is the best product for lash growth.</li>
            <li> I love my new long lashes.  It takes a couple of months but it is worth it.  The only thing it doesn&#x27;t do is make them thicker. If they come up with that formula they will have a goldmine!</li>
            <li> it really works! but it!</li>
            <li> Would give it less if I could. The first order of this worked great. I was able to see results within 2 weeks. It did burn a little but cleared up after the first week of use. By the time I used the whole tube I saw great results! But the 2nd order was not the same as the first. It was watered down and barely kept my eyebrows and eyelashes full. I took a chance and ordered a third tube and after a month of using it, my eyebrows and eyelashes are back to how they were before I started my first tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly disappointed! I am reporting the seller and will only be ordering from the grande lash website. Don&#x27;t be fooled by all the 5 star reviews!! You get what you pay for! I rather spend $65 for a genuine product not a watered down product!</li>
            <li> It definitely does the job --- with sacrifices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, it does the job, after continuous use for about 1 month you&#x27;d definitely see the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does affect my eyesight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The itches on eyelid. That is probably eyelash growing, I did suffer from this at the beginning, it stopped as soon as my lash stops growing longer.</li>
            <li> It takes a while for lashes to grow.</li>
            <li> works great!  You have to perservere through the first 21 days but after that, you certainly notice a difference in the length and thickness.</li>
            <li> It does work. I am 37, i used twice daily and i could start to see some new long lashes after about a month. After 2 months  all&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are longer. Now i am using it once a day because i don&#x27;t want to look overdone. It irritates a bit the eyes.</li>
            <li> Works well eyelashes don&#x27;t fall out just keep growing !</li>
            <li> Works well. It took a little bit for me to notice growth, but now have thick long lashes.</li>
            <li> Great product. I used to use revitalash and this is as similar, great results and half the cost. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My lashes are much thicker snd longer after two months of use.</li>
            <li> I heard alot about this product and decided to try it.. I use once everyday at nite.. noticed on the 2 week the bottle was empty !!!!!!!!!!1.. I try to contact the seller but never respond back ,, ugh!!! I think i try it again but buy it on the gRandelash website</li>
            <li> Really pleased with this product. It was recommend to me by a makeup artist so I knew I had to try it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks every night before bed on my brows and upper and lower lash lines. My brows have always been uneven--with one being really sparse--and I have seen them even up quite a bit. Hoping with continued use they will totally even up. My eyelashes look CRAZY LONG!!! They are so healthy and full and with a curler and mascara I no longer need to wear falsies. My natural lashes are longer than falsies! Totally recommend this. A+ product.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this in June since so many of my lashes fell out after having my eyeliner tattooed on my upper lids.  My eyelashes were coming out in clumps as they were attached to the scabs that fell off on my upper lids! Since I did not have a lot to begin with I had to do something, so I gave it a try.  Well, I am here to say that I am pleasantly pleased and on my second bottle! My lashes are much longer then I ever had and I have more lashes than I ever had. As far as thickness and darkness I don&#x27;t notice that as much. They are a little darker.  All in all it is great!  The only issue that I had and still kinda have is itchyness on my upper lids and corners ever now and then.  I still have it even after using it for almost 4 months.  But if you don&#x27;t itch it it goes away. When I take my makeup off my lids are a little red and irritated so I just put on a good moisturizer after my bath then wait a few hours then put the GrandLashMD on right before going to bed.  For me it is worth the little discomfort!  Oh and one more thing, I have not seen an eyelash fall out since I&#x27;ve started using. Even if I pull on them, they are really strong now too!!</li>
            <li> If I could give this product 0 rating I definitely would.  I purchased this from my reputable salon where I get my eyelash extensions done. It is a high end salon and they do wonderful work. However they suggested using grande lash to keep my lashes from becoming brittle and damaged. I love my lash extensions and wanted to do everything to keep my lashes healthy. I did research on grande lash and some reviews were fabulous and others not. So I figured I give it a shot. I only used it twice. First night was fine. Second night I woke up to burning stinging eyes and my eyelash extensions where falling out in clumps along with my own eyelashes. I had just had a fill but waited 4 days to use Grande Lash and followed the exact instructions. After only 2 days of applying this awful product my eyelids felt like they were on fire for an excruciating week. Not only did my extensions fall out but my own lashes fell out as well. I now have such damaged lashes or lack of there of I can no longer get lash extensions! I have huge gaps from loss of lashes a and can barely use mascara. Fortunately I was smart enough to discontinue using this hazardous product after only 2 applications. This product should be taken off the market. I know everyone can be allergic to anything but what I experienced is unacceptable. Please be careful with this product. It is supposed to be natural ingredients that help moisturizer and help your natural lashes grow. Their website is misleading so read it carefully. Most of their great review are written from their own website. All I can say is Buyer BEWARE!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Works exactly like it says, but you do have to apply it twice a day. No skipping days! I receive compliments on my eyelashes all of the time.</li>
            <li> If you are consistent with the applications; your lashes will grow.  Mine took two months to come in.  Patience is key!</li>
            <li> Very little product. Seemed to have been opened. Get the latisse</li>
            <li> This product is the bomb. I had accidentally snapped off eyelashes on one upper lid.  I knew they&#x27;d grow back eventually, but how long would that take?  A friend recommended this product so I gave it a try.  It&#x27;s amazing.  My lashes grew to an unbelievable length and are quite lush.  And I&#x27;m an old, into my 60s.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the results.  I&#x27;m thrilled with this and will use it until the day I croak.</li>
            <li> Great! Really works!!!</li>
            <li> Want to add length and darkness to your lashes/brows?  Get this product and be patient.  I found it took close to 2 months before I saw results.&lt;br /&gt;It caused some minor redness on my eyelids at first but that didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Just when I thought I noticed lash growth, the tube ran dry- after only 3 weeks of directed use. I even tried to tap out more liquid, but nothing. I worked in the medical field; I know what 2 ml looks like. I seriously doubt that&#x27;s how much was in the tube.</li>
            <li> Works very well, after 2weeks I noticed my eyelashes were longer and after 4 weeks almost twice as longer and I have very thin blonde lashes they were never long and usually uneven length but now they are very long and even it&#x27;s unbelievable! I did not get any irritation in my eyes , I apply every night before bed. It really works. On my eyebrows though I don&#x27;t see as much difference yet.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! Within 2 months, I really noticed my lashes really growing long!!! It itched a little for about a week, but stopped, and it hasn&#x27;t changed my eye lense color at all.</li>
            <li> Best for me...tried others  but found GrandeLash MD  has worked well for my particular complexion and needs.  Plan to stay with this product  until a new formula improves it, always will to try.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  It takes usally 3 weeks to really see the difference, but your eyelashes really grow.  Almost to the point you have to trim them.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever written a review here so you know it has to be good!  I got this about 7-8 months ago.  Thanks to getting ill, my eyelashes started to fall out and the was a big gap on both of my eye lids.  I started using this about twice a day for 2-3 weeks and saw results.  Once my lashes came back I used it about every other day.  I have received so many compliments on my lashes, even a couple people who asked if they were real.  About a month ago a lady stopped me in the store and was pretty amazed and a little animated about how good they looked.  Placing another order now since it seems the price has dropped in about half!</li>
            <li> this product really works, all my friends noticed after about 6 weeks .My eyelashes are longer so now I only use it twice a week, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks, but I can already tell a difference in my lashes. They have become fuller and longer. The first couple of days when I started using it I had redness, swelling and itching, but that went away and I have no problems using it anymore.</li>
            <li> Used once and woke up with red burnt eyelids where I applied it! There must be something bad in this stuff. Latisse didn&#x27;t do this to me.</li>
            <li> It is cute design package, and I am now using. Even I don&#x27;t feel big change, but I feel it is working. Cant wait to see my lash in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This really does work,  after six weeks I have much longer lashes,  I don&#x27;t think they are thicker but I am giving new growth time to grow.</li>
            <li> I actually have pretty long lashes, but I am a blonde and my top lashes are a light brown and almost transluscent at the tip.  My bottom lashes are completely transparent.  With using this product, over time, my eyelashes became black, top and bottom and have grown to my eyebrows.  They are so long now, I can barely wear mascara!  The only complaint, when I first started wearing the product, it really irritated my eyes.  They were bloodshot for months and the skin around my eyes darkened.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so I am not sure why, but after I stopped using it everyday and did it every two to three days, my eyes settled down and it didn&#x27;t seem to affect the growth any.  I apply the product by closing my eyes snd just rubbing the brush along my lash line, so it gets both top and bottom at the same time.  All in all, an excellent product.  I have bought three bottles now.</li>
            <li> Vi resultados en 3 meses&lt;br /&gt;No me irrit&amp;oacute; los ojos&lt;br /&gt;Las pesta&amp;ntilde;as crecieron largas y Abundantes&lt;br /&gt;Lo recomiendo a todas</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking I was probably throwing away good money only to be disappointed by another product that didn&#x27;t deliver the results promised.  Wrong!  I am 64 years old and I noticed that the instructions say that those over 30 (and I&#x27;m more than twice that!) could benefit by using it twice a day.  So that was what I determined to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first my eyelids burned a little.  Again, the instructions say this will go away in three to five days.  For the first three days my eyelids were red and looked like I had on some eye shadow.  But that cleared up quickly and I had no problems after about four days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t wear makeup every day any more.  So after about five days I put on some mascara and was blown away.  Already the results were showing!  My eyelashes had become very skimpy and even with several coats of mascara they would hardly show.  I asked my husband if he could see any difference.  He can be brutally honest, so I trusted his opinion.  He said there was a definite difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week later we were going out for the evening so I put on my makeup.  Wow!  With one coat of mascara I could see my lashes looking fuller than ever.  Believe me, this stuff will be a permanent part of my beauty routine!  I&#x27;m a natural blond so my lashes are very light and have always been thin.  I&#x27;m so impressed with this product.  The first few days of sensitivity are long forgotten and the results are fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE AFTER ONE MONTH:  I love this product.  It&#x27;s now out of stock at Amazon, but I have put in an order so I don&#x27;t miss it when they get some in.  I now use it once a day and my lashes are so much thicker and longer.  Really amazing.  I still need to use mascara because my lashes are naturally blond and this hasn&#x27;t made a noticable difference in the darkness. I am amazed at the results using this product!</li>
            <li> I used this product last year and had great results. I am a bit of a product junkie so after my first tube of GrandeLash MD ran out I switched to a cheaper lash growth product on the market. Well...you get what you pay for. The new product did NOT work as well for me as the GrandeLash MD had. So here I am a year later and my lashes are back to average length again. I know when I start using GrandeLash MD my lashes will be back to looking long, thick and gorgeous! I am so excited! I never got SO many compliments on my eyes and my lashes as when I was using that product. So after using many different lash growth products on the market I can confidently say GrandeLash MD is the best (in my opinion). Also, I am an Esthetician/Makeup Artist and I recommend this product to all of my clients who are trying to achieve significant lash growth results without a prescription product. If you use it EVERY night the results will amaze you and everyone else!&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** May 15th 2013~&lt;br /&gt; GrandeLash MD has created another miraculous growth spurt for my Lashes! They are long, thick, full and silky again. The other day I didn&#x27;t feel like wearing mascara so I just used my eyelash curler on them. They look beautiful. I will never stray from this product again. It has proven to be the best of its kind on the market. It&#x27;s gentle on my eyes and on my pocket book. Worth every penny. This is one of my beauty MUST HAVES!</li>
            <li> I tried a different lash enhancer first however had a reaction from it.  This one was recommended, and although it did take a few weeks to see results, I am very happy with the length and fullness of my lashes, and with no reaction!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two and a half months and I&#x27;ve definitely seen improve improvement in both the length of my lashes and the volume. Does not irritate my eyes in any way and it soaks in quickly so I can use in twice a day even when I have to do my makeup in the morning. Would definitely recommend. Just remember results will take a little time but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This product has made my eyelashes grow longer and fuller. I wear it at night because it caused very mild irritation. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is my third time to order this product.  I was told by my oncologist that he would not prescribe Latisse because of the side effects.  I discussed this product with him and he felt this would be okay.  It works just like it says in the ads.  In fact, my sister uses Latisse, and a friend just told us both that we have the longest eyelashes she has ever seen.  We both told her what we use and she decided to try this product because of the cost and my doctor&#x27;s opinion.</li>
            <li> Love it! Have really noticed a difference in My  lashes, so have everyone else!</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and like it.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY IT. DOESN&#x27;T WORK.</li>
            <li> OK people, it takes about 1 year to get long thick lashes.  I replace the tube about every 3 1/2 to 4 months!!  I have been using it for 3 years and I love this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Patti</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my eyelashes but made hair grow tremendously underneath my eyes, right above my cheekbone (I don&#x27;t know how because I only applied on lash line) and it is very noticiable since I have dark hair</li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of this type of product and none of them worked.  BUT......this one is absolutely fantastic!!!!!  I had a 1/8 inch gap between the lashes on my upper lid and after using this product for a few weeks the lashes grew back and now are getting thicker and longer.  I can&#x27;t believe it!!!  Also, I had a section of my eyebrow where the hair had stopped growing.  After using this on my eyebrow it is now growing back and filling in.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  It really works!!!</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks or so I started seeing some thicker lashes.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it, so does her group of girlfriend!  This is my fifth time bought GrandeLash MD eyelash.  My girlfriend loved it very much, and she used it every single day.  I noticed her eyelashes are getting stronger, thicker and longer.  She has used multiple different mascara brand but this gave a best result.  She didn&#x27;t care about the price, but she wants high quality product.  She also bought this product with a set of false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00QDUX1UC False Eyelashes - 70 Pairs in 7 Different Styles Allows You to Select Your Look From Natural to Dramatic! + FREE Bonuses]]</li>
            <li> I have short lashes. I&#x27;m over 40 and won&#x27;t wear false eyelashes (mainly because I can never get them to fit properly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d try GrandeLash after reading some of the other reviews and I can say that I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. I wasn&#x27;t expecting my lashes to look like the ones on the packaging, I think those are unobtainable, but I did hope that I&#x27;d see some improvement and I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re hoping to create long, luscious lashes with this product, don&#x27;t count on it. For a non-prescription product, it works fairly well. You have to use it as instructed though. For the first week or two, I used it twice daily, then only at night. I&#x27;m sure if I had been more diligent and used it twice daily for a full month I would have seen better results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into my third month but I saw improvement in 2 weeks. Now my lashes are more than twice the length they have ever been. After using my curler and putting on mascara they look fabulous, I love this stuff. I am so impressed that it actually does what it claims. I highly recommend it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, I&#x27;ve already bought another tube to continue using after the initial 3 month period.</li>
            <li> Great Product my eyelashes are thicker. I will definitely repurchase! Came quickly, not a lot of waiting, which is nice. Not even done with it yet :-)</li>
            <li> A few months ago I decided to get lash extensions.  The girl that put them on told me that she was going to put me on a lash serum called &#x27;Grande Lash&#x27; to accompany my extensions.  When the lashes began to fall out I noticed a lot of my own lashes were coming out as well.  Instead of filling them in, I decided to see what my lashes would be like if I just didnt do anything let them fall out naturally.  At the end of it, my lashes were nearly gone and the ones that were left seemed shorter.  I ordered Grande Lash and within weeks I had full lashes again.  Actually, they are longer and a bit fuller than before I got lash extensions.  I already purchased my next tube so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work.  I used a whole tube of librow before this and it REALLY worked... but then I followed up  with this stuff to maintain growth.  Mine didn&#x27;t last a month tho.  I guess I need to apply more than typical?</li>
            <li> I bought this about 3 weeks ago and have been using it every night on my thin, light eyelashes.  My lashes are very fragile and tend to fall out so I will sometimes have little &amp;#34;bald spots&amp;#34; in my lashline.  The GrandeLash seems to have stopped that and I&#x27;ve noticed new growth. Also, when I put my mascara on, it works MUCH better than before and I get much longer lashes using just my regular daily mascara.  I don&#x27;t notice that without makeup that my lashes are any longer or darker, but it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks and I have problem lashes....maybe it&#x27;s just going to take longer.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my lashes within a month of using!</li>
            <li> I tried it the first tube worked!! I got 2 more the second tube I&#x27;m back to square one now I&#x27;m trying tub 3. Lesson order from there web site, I will next time. I sure wish integrate would come back!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I used it on my lashes and eyebrows! I saw a difference within a week!</li>
            <li> I had sideeffect on my eyes....My eyes were twitching....after I stopped using it...my eyes became normal. Please be careful!!!! Test use first!</li>
            <li> Irritated my eyes and got no benefit except now in only use them for my brows. Works better for them anyway</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! Have been using it 8 weeks now and my lashes look amazing!! My husband asked me if I was wearing fake lashes-in a good way;) -they look so good!!!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are longer and darker.  When I have no mascara on, you can still see my previously invisible lashes.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on this that it works but it did not for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for two months but I have not seen even a bit of a change in the length of my eyelashes. Plus, it makes my eyes itchy.</li>
            <li> Used it daily since it arrived. See no difference at all. Maybe it will work for someone else, but not this gal.</li>
            <li> I use GrandeLASH MD along with GrandeLash Mascara. My thinning lashes are now fuller and healthy. While this product is great by itself, the combination of the MD and the Mascara is a can&#x27;t miss.</li>
            <li> 8 weeks and nothing.  I used every day for 8 weeks and nothing happened for me.  For those who had eye redness,  I had that my first day... I realized that I used too much so the next day I used less and no redness occurred</li>
            <li> Very good product!  No problems.</li>
            <li> Great product easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The growth of my eyelashes has been excellent with this product but I am&lt;br /&gt;still out on its effect on eyebrows. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is a staple for me now. My lashes are longer and thicker than ever before. I never got results like this from any other product. My eyelids were slightly red and sensitive at the beginning, but once I got over that it has been great. Results were pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Three days and my eyes were red for a week. I would not recommend this to anyone who has allergies.</li>
            <li> I had lash extentions and after they came off my lashes were so short.  I started using this and my lashes are longer than before.  Love it and will order again... :-)</li>
            <li> did not work at all did not help make my hair grow at all even for using for three weeks everyday</li>
            <li> Using it for a few weeks. Haven&#x27;t seen any major results but it claims that you will in 6 weeks. I will continue the product and see. But I like that it glides on smoothly and is at night.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this. Had used before &amp; I got it $5 cheaper buying from here. Takes time for results but love the results.</li>
            <li> Grandelash MD works great, I used it every night and sometimes in the morning for about two months and noticed a HUGE difference. My lashes are longer, thicker, and darker! I had spots on my lash line where the lashes were sparser on one eye that are now all filled in. After the first two months, I have been using it about every second night just to make it last longer and my results have not diminished, I have been using it for a total of 4 months now and I LOVE it!!Even people I work with and family and friends have noticed how long and thick my lashes are! When I run out I will definitely be buying it again, and again!!</li>
            <li> I just may need more time after reading other reviews. We shall see what happens, Ill give it a bit more time.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works.</li>
            <li> I am supposed to see results in 4-6 weeks with daily use of this product. It has only been two weeks and I swear, my lashes are definitely longer and look thicker already! I love it!!! I can&#x27;t wait to order more tubes of this!</li>
            <li> It works, but causes darkening and slight irritation of the skin. People ask me if I&#x27;m okay because the skin around my eyes turned reddish/dark. it makes you look tired/ sick.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll try applying every other day to see if it lessens the darkening, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This product takes a few weeks to really see a difference but once you see it... YOU SEE IT!! My eyelashes have never been longer. I forget to apply a few nights a week and it still works great!</li>
            <li> I barely use it because I.get lazy or forget some nights. I use it about 3 or 4 times a week for the past month and my eyelashes are looking much longer. i ripped them out after getting mink lash extensions! Ive used about 4 different eye lash serums and Li Lash and this one worked the best. This one is just cheaper so i&#x27;ll stick with it. Rapid lash lasted like three weeks so im not sure if it works or not.</li>
            <li> Burned my eyes, left them red, burning, itching. Sent product back.</li>
            <li> This lash solution works wonderful to make your lashes longer.  I also use on my eyebrows.  I had only a few eyebrows and now they are full.  You have to keep using or your lashes go back like they were prior to using the product.</li>
            <li> My lashes look like they are false. Beautiful.</li>
            <li> This was a re-order.  I received my first product as a gift from my sister who was very happy with it.  It works great -- even after a couple of days my eye lashes seemed fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! After 2 months my lashes are SO long!! $</li>
            <li> Actually works. Compared to LaLash. Grew quickly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I have deep set eyes so I wanted to make my eyes pop with some long natural lashes.  I am 25 years old so I expected to see results earlier but it took me a good 2/2.5 months to see a difference and by 3 months my eyelashes were almost touching my eyebrows.  I was worried that my lashes were going to look &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34; but everything has been great and natural looking.  I just bought my 6 month supply!</li>
            <li> It worked great&amp;#34; but does not give enough ml&amp;#34;..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much  length yet. Hopeing soon.</li>
            <li> Love this prouduct! My lash are fuller and much longer.  Use it every night for the past 6 weeks and WOW it really works!</li>
            <li> Helps a lot but wish it could make lashes a little longer.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I am using it on my brows, &amp; they are filling in nicely.  They are slightly darker.  I am very pleased with the results. I have been using it 2x/day, but they say you only need to use it 1x/day.</li>
            <li> love this product! I had my doubts, but when my daughter recommended it, I knew it had to be good. I&#x27;ve been using it now for 5 months, and my lashes have grown to where I needed to take a &amp;#34;GrandeLash vacation&amp;#34; - I did about 3 weeks on, 1 week off, and now I do every other week. My daughter actually had to trim hers! Now she&#x27;s also on an every-other-week regimen, which is great because it stretches the product. I have also seen growth in my lower lashes, which I&#x27;ll explain in a sec. I apply at bedtime. The wand is a brush, much like a liquid eyeliner brush. I apply first to my right eye, and then, without re-dipping into the tube, I turn the brush to the opposite side and apply to the other eye. The next night, I start with the left eye, and so on. That way, both eyes get treated with only one dip into the tube. After 5 months, I&#x27;m still on the same tube! And, my lower lashes get the benefit because some of the fluid migrates to the lower lashes when I close my eyes and go to sleep. I have NEVER experienced any burning or stinging. (The person from the other review might have been applying too much. You don&#x27;t need much!) I didn&#x27;t notice any change (and I took photos!) for about 2-3 weeks. Then, when I stopped obsessing, I saw it - RESULTS! I think this was around week 4 or 5. I thought I was imagining it, but when I compared my lashes with the old photos, the change was obvious. Last week, when I saw my daughter, I had NO MASCARA on, and she was not surprised. &amp;#34;I told you it works,&amp;#34; she said. (By the way, she has tried several other products, and she likes this one best.)</li>
            <li> This is the best lash enhancer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works better than Latisse.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing to make my eye lashes grow, my eyelashes remaind the same with some lashes falling out, gimmick.</li>
            <li> I have seen results. Nothing drastic though. I have been using the product  once daily for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I have had people remark how long my lashes are.&lt;br /&gt;I love those remarks--puts a smile on my face&lt;br /&gt;Lyla Rogers</li>
            <li> This product absolutely works, it looks like I have fake eyelashes. I used it every night for over a month, I noticed a big difference by the second week. I&#x27;m in my third month and now only use it 2-3/week. My lashes hit my eyeglasses they are so long. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Wow!!! It really do work, I now have lashes that I can see. No more fake lashes for me, i can just apply mascara and have the same effect...</li>
            <li> Great product -- really works!!  So glad I was able to find it on the Internet.  Thank you.  I hope you keep this in stock.</li>
            <li> This stuff really make my lashes longer. Only complaint doesn&#x27;t make them fuller</li>
            <li> Love product! It Really does work,  My lashes look fake.  But need to give it time, about 6 weeks to see results.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen an results yet and have been using faithfully everyday</li>
            <li> Great, fast service. Best price on the web! Will definitely reorder from this seller.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash enhancer that works for me.  It also works very well on my eyebrows.  I have very blond hair, so this helps add some color to both eyelashes and eyebrows.  It takes about 6-8 weeks to really start seeing results, but then I can decrease my use to every other day.</li>
            <li> I have been using GrandeLash for about four weeks and am just starting to notice a difference. I am 56 and have very sparse eyelashes. My daughters 23 and 18 both use it and being younger it started to work for them at week 3. Your eyelashes will get longer first before they get thicker. You cannot control how they grow so sometimes you have a few longer strands. Both of my daughters love the product and you cannot believe the comments they both get. I am just starting to notice the increased length. Still hoping for the increased thickness. Great price, much cheaper than buying it at a Salon where it runs about $75.00 instead of the prices here on Amazon. They say if you quit using it, your lashes will go back to what they were like before. We (girls and I) use it at bedtime. I have heard that you can maintain the growth by using it every 2-4 days after you get the results you want.</li>
            <li> it really works in about 3 weeks after using grande lash i noticed a big difference. people are asking if they really are my eyelashes! love it and i tell them they are mine with help from grande lash!</li>
            <li> I gave five stars because it DOES WHAT IT ADVERTISES!! My eyelashes are so long and thick now I get asked at least once a week if. &amp;#34; they&#x27;re mine&amp;#34;! It takes about two- three weeks of nightly application to begin to NOTICIABLE results but after purchasing my second tube I was only applying it once a week and my lashes stayed consistently long and full. It is a MUST have in my makeup bag sling with mascara and lipgloss! HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT !!!!</li>
            <li> The packaging is great and amount of product is okay. I had red eye irritation for 2 days when I applied to my lower lashes. I waited 5 days for it to clear up and then reapplied to only my upper lashes and eyebrows and so far no new problems. Not much written on it by consumers so do your research before you make this purchase to see if your allergic to any of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this product again and again and again. FOREVER.  It really works. I love it.</li>
            <li> In November I met a woman who had amazing eyelashes and I had to ask her what she used.  I started using it early in December and by February my eyelashes looked better than extensions or false eyelashes.  They got dark enough and so full that I don&#x27;t need mascara (and they were pretty blond before).  They even feel thicker.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to lots of people.  It has been an amazing experience for me.  I&#x27;m now using it every other night.</li>
            <li> I love grande lash I discovered it through a spa I went to after seeing the manicurists eyelashes and how long they were.  I immediately bought one and within weeks it was working.  Of course I found it too pricey at this salon so I bought it from Amazon at a much affordable price.  I would recommend it for anyone looking grow long lashes.</li>
            <li> Irritated my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried other brands that work fine. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not really seeing any results from this and have been using it faithfully for both the brows and eyelashes. wil not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I ordered Grandelash last week of January and after 4 days i received it. :D yippee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before applying it, I took a picture of my lashes first. I applied it to my top and bottom lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first week, I noticed my eyelashes getting darker and fuller but the length is still the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd week, my lashes have grown a Little longer, BIG difference when i put the mascara on and I used the Maybelline rocket volume waterproof by the way cause it holds the curl better. My co workers have been noticing my eyelashes especially when they look at me from the side. I told them that im using this product and they checked amazon and bought it right away! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Feb 20, 2013, its going to be the 3rd week, took a picture of my lashes yesterday and compared it! Holycow! I was blown away! My lashes are longer!!it really works! JUST BE PATIENT! Im so happy that my $35 is not a waste!! The instruction states that the full results shows if you continue using it for a month. I never missed a day, so, Im excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im definitely going to repurchase Grandelash! love love love this product!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I&#x27;m 53 an had hardly any lashes to even put mascara on. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months and now have eyelashes I can put mascara on</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but read reviews and purchased. The first few days this made the skin around my eyes very red and itchy. I kept using as directed though and that improved. I noticed more lashes and an increase in length after just one week. After a full 4 weeks of only applying every evening, my lashes were longer and fuller than they had ever been, even when i was younger. (I&#x27;m 37) After 2 months of once daily use, my eyelashes are long enough to touch my upper eyelid when my eyes are open and I no longer have to use an eyelash curler to curl them. I look like i have false lashes, no joke. Although it does still cause some redness to the skin around my eyes, I feel that it&#x27;s worth it considering the dramatic results. I now only use every other night to maintain my results. Worth every penny and much less expensive than a prescription!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months now and it works great. I really had to stop using it as often because my eyelashes were hitting my sunglasses!!  I use it any time - not just at night and it still works great.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Recommended this by a friend who told me it was the secret to her incredibly long lashes and this stuff works! I dont even follow the protocol to a T either. I usually only remember to apply this once or twice a week,and I definitely see a difference. BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome!  It does exactly as advertised!  I have very blonde lashes, always short and sparse.  Within 3 or 4 weeks they were noticeably longer and more pronounced.  There was a little bit of irritation the first few days or maybe a week, but that is gone now.  I used it twice a day for a month, then once a day for the second month.  Now I use it 3 or 4 times each week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Grandelash mascara.  If my lashes weren&#x27;t so light colored I probably wouldn&#x27;t need to use mascara everyday!</li>
            <li> Item was delivered on time.very pleased with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this with high hopes! my hair stylist used this and her lashes looked amazing!!!!! I used this product for 30 days applying at bedtime to the root of my lashes.  The product made my eyes very red and bloodshot! and very sensitive! I was very careful to make sure none of the product got into my eyes but it still bothered them.  After a whole month my lashes actually look worse!!!!!!!! They have thinned out and have NOT grown at all!!!! All i can say is maybe i got a \\&quot;BUM\\&quot; bottle with a defect.  I am very sadden by this experience because now my lashes are even LESS noticeable and i wish i had NEVER used it!</li>
            <li> I should have taken a before and after picture, but anhow... When I was left with lousy lashes after walking around with lash extensions for half a year, I was very disappointed with the short, beat up, more sparse lashes that I was left with. My natural lashes are nice, but there is a reason I went for the lash extensions. The whole procedure for the lash extensions is so annoying that I wanted a result just like that, but using my own lashes. I needed help. STAT. So I bought this product. I have used GrandelashMD for a couple of months, and started beginning of June. I can definitely tell you that it increases the amount of lashes, the length, and even a little bit how thick the lashes are. I am happy enough to buy this product again, even though I have to say that I have no experience with other lash enhancers. Apply it carefully right on the lash line after cleansing the face at night. Just once a day. And see for yourself. : ) In the daytime I would walk around without mascara, and in the evening I would add some Lancome Hypnose mascara for some extra va-va-voom. I think this product is worth every penny. Compared to Latisse it is dirt cheap. Now that I ran out and have not been as religiously using it, I slowly noticed that the length gets shorter, and the fullness and thickness are starting to diminish. : ((  I need this product again. ASAP.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyelash and eyebrow enhancer about a month ago and absolutely happy with it!!! Within 3 weeks I noticed the result, I always had short eyelashes and now they are much longer and thicker!!! My eyebrows look much better!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to give up on this product yet but I was expecting to see  more of a difference. I can hardly see any improvement. Hopefully my opinion will improve as I continue to use up the supply I have</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was reasonably priced and after reading the reviews, it sounded similar to Latisse. I&#x27;ve been using it since June and my lashes have grown a LOT. I am inconsistent with my use yet I&#x27;ve seen big results with this. I will use it as long as its manufactured.</li>
            <li> I did not see very much growth there were a few more lashes then before but I exspected more, the length stayed the same.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical about this product, but I have purchased it more than once now and plan to never stop! My lashes were adequate before, but nothing special... They are now softer, longer and more full. I get complimented on them on a regular basis, something that never happened before I began using this product. After Using it for a several months I saw an old roommate, and the first thing she said to me was &amp;#34;did you get eyelash extensions?!&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are not instant, but they are noticeable with continued use. The only thing I dislike is that my lower lashes have grown from it spreading in my sleep, they aren&#x27;t crazy, but it&#x27;s a side note. The other thing I wish I could change (and I&#x27;m sure this is not very common) is that the corner lashes on the top are almost TOO curly, so now when I put on mascara I apply downward on the outer edge and I brush them out with a lash comb afterwards (also in a downward motion). These are still issues I&#x27;d prefer to going back to thinner lashes!!!</li>
            <li> It took about a month for me to see results, but WOW!!! Love, love, love my lashes!</li>
            <li> I definitely see growth in my lashes, my roommate even noticed it. It&#x27;s been about six weeks. They are not quite as long as when I used Latisse, but I&#x27;m really hoping that if I keep using it, I will see more growth.</li>
            <li> This made my lashes grow faster longer and thicker than Latisse. I have ordered three times. I also used it along my hairline successfully.</li>
            <li> Grandlash MD is the best product for my lashes I have found.  I have been using this product of over six months now. My lashes are longer, and thicker. I get complements all the time.  I went to Ultra to buy some powder and concealer when one of the make up artist&#x27;s asked if it was ok to put the product on.  She went nuts about my lashes, and wanted to put mascara on them.  Next thing I know I have several of the other women saying they wished they could have my lashes. O gave them my secret. I constantly get complement on the lashes. I used the product twice a day for three months per my hair dresser. Then I continued once a day. It really does work...just be consistant and use it for the full three months.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 months now. I apply it as close to my lash line as possible ( only upper) after I have washed my face every night. I have noticed longer eyelashes, but the con far outweigh the growth as it has caused discoloration on my eyelids -which unfortunately is more pronounced at the bottom. I have to apply eyeliner just to balance the effects of this. I don&#x27;t know if this happened to other people or maybe my skin is just sensitive but having loner lashes is not worth it, if you have discoloration on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> I bought this after purchasing Rapidlash, and it seems to work just as well.  The only drawback with this enhancer, is having to use it twice a day instead of once a day, as you do with Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted and buy this about every 2 months.  I&#x27;ll never use any of the fibre-jazz because this stuff has grown MY lashes like crazy!  In fact, I spent a week in the Trauma Dept this summer after a terrible accident and the nurses kept trying to &amp;#34;remove my lashes&amp;#34; and several asked me what brand and/ or glue I used because they didn&#x27;t think they could be MY lashes....but they are!  I wish I could get a referral fee or even a free tube for referring so many friends here to buy it.  Do it!  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Stuff really works!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper option to Latisse, which I&#x27;ve used before and loved (was just looking for a cheaper option.)  After just one night of using this stuff, my eyelids turned all red and itchy.  I tried it for 3 nights and it got so bad, I had to stop using it.  I will be going back to Latisse.  Maybe I just had an allergic reaction - really wish this had worked for me...</li>
            <li> I love it. Just it every day and in 3-4 weeks (twice a day) and you will notice longer and darker lashes. You pretty much have to use it forever. It is my guilty pleasure.</li>
            <li> I have used other products that have cost more and I guess the old saying \\&quot;You get what you pay for is true.\\&quot; This product has done nothing to help the growth of my lashes and made my eyes very sensitive. I have quit using it and ordered my old tried and true Revialash.</li>
            <li> After two month of using this product I can say that it works. I haven&#x27;t got any irritation but now I have long and curved lashes! It&#x27;s not cheap product but it is worth a try</li>
            <li> I really love this product;simply because it works. I started using it in February, then allergy season began. I started rubbing my eyes a lot. Then, I began to notice that I was getting dark circles under my eyes. At first I thought it was make up (since I started wearing mascara again). When I realized what was happening I made sure I took an antihistamine,I stopped rubbing my eyes,and I used a skin lightener under my eyes. But I never stopped using this product, my lashes looked too good to stop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I aslo noticed that the fine hair on my face around my eyes (which normally isn&#x27;t visable)grew as well.(I had to be really close to the mirror to see it.) But once I stopped rubbing my eyes and spreading the product, it went away as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the same bottle since February. I use it twice a day since that is recommended for people over forty. It&#x27;s May now. I keep shaking the tube to see how much is left. I still have plenty. I think they can be purchased in different amounts.</li>
            <li> This stuff is no joke!  I started using this in September, after I weaned my baby, and three months later my lashes are long and lush.  I used it every night for the first three months, and now I&#x27;m using it twice a week to maintain the results.  Make sure that your lashes are clean.  I take off my makeup with coconut oil, wash my face, and then use a Q-tip to make sure my lashline is clean before applying Grandelash.  I seriously can&#x27;t believe how much better my lashes look!  When I curl them I can really see how long they are.  A few coats of mascara, and I&#x27;m good.  You will LOVE this if you use it correctly, I promise!  And you don&#x27;t get spidery lashes like I&#x27;ve heard (and seen) you get from Latisse. Plus it&#x27;s a lot cheaper.  I&#x27;m guessing that this stuff is getting popular, it was about $15 less when I bought it back in July.  ;)</li>
            <li> I felt a slight sting when I first used it but it seems to be fine&lt;br /&gt; now.  Too soon to notice any big changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product couple times by now, and I absolutely love how my lashes grow when I use it. The downside is the fact that my eyelashes stop growing as soon as I stop using this product. And I also feel like they are going back to its normal length with time if you don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought the GrandeLASH two months ago. It really works! Me and my mom bought it because two of my aunts were using it at the moment and we saw the results. Now we both use it and we are really happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one thing do, one of my aunts stopped using the GrandeLASH and her eyelashes went back to their original size! So that was kind of a dissapointment. But well, I think if you want to maintained your eyelashes long and thick you&#x27;ll just have to keep buying the product and stay happy with how it works! I&#x27;m going to do that, definitly.</li>
            <li> I will order this product again.  My lashes are much longer and thicker.  It takes about six weeks to really see a big difference. Amazon makes ordering easy, and ships quickly. It can cause redness, but usually goes away in a few days.</li>
            <li> This is my purchase of this product.  The item did not quite last the three months that it indicated.  It lasted for about 2 3/4 months, which is one of the reasons that I gave it only 4 stars.  Also, the product took almost the full time to notice a difference.  At first, I got a little scared because I noticed that many of my eyelashes started to fall out where I never had that happen before.  But, then, I started to notice a change.  My right eyelashes started to curl up more (I guess because they were becoming longer) and then my left eyelashes started to do the same.  Now, I definitely have fuller eyelashes and they are definitely longer.  I don&#x27;t even need to wear mascara.  Although my eyelashes are longer, the tips are still bleached out (most likely from the sun) but with mascara they are even longer!  Please note that the part of the eyelid closest to my eye (where the liquid is placed every day) darkened a bit but that does not bother me.  It gives my eyelashes an even darker appearance and I generally wear eyeliner in that area anyway so it does not matter to me.  However, it could matter to someone else so it bears mentioning.  I am sure that Latisse would work better and faster but I did not want to take the chance of my eyecolor changing or having any of the side effects such as itchy or burning eyes.</li>
            <li> This product went on well, following direction, I applied it for 4 weeks, after shower in morning, then again at night, nothing, i mean nothing changed.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE PRODUCT FOR MY WIFE SHE IS VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT, SHE RECOMENDED FOR HER FRIENDS, THANKS, REGRDS</li>
            <li> I have used many eyelash serums over the years and this one definitely works!  I used Jan Marini when she first came out and then Revitalash and Lilash - all of which worked, all of which are no longer available.  I started using GrandeLASH-MD in November of last year and my lashes touch my eyelids now - it works!  The stinging and redness I hear people complaining about are common place for a truly effective lash product and typically goes away after 1-2 weeks, once your body acclimates to the ingredients.  If you give yourself time and have some stamina to work through any &#x27;stinging&#x27; you will be fine and have awesome results.  Stop being wimpy people.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  My eyelashes have grown so long I&#x27;ve had to trim them.  Friends and strangers have asked about why my lashes look so great!</li>
            <li> It seriously works, and makes my lashes outrageously long and healthy.  I do notice that it leaves my eyelids a bit red, but who cares when your eyelashes are creating tsunamis on the other side of the world?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 11 weeks now almost faithfully. I may have missed 2 applications. At first I thought I wasted my money but I&#x27;m finally starting to notice some growth. Not a whole lot but it is noticeable. I&#x27;ll update again after I finish the product. Still think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced for the results I&#x27;ve seen thus far.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 weeks morning and evening and as yet have not seen any difference in either length or thickness. Would i recommend this product? NO.</li>
            <li> I used this product for over 5 weeks.  My lashes MAY have grown a little but not like I was told it would.  It made my eyelids a bit sore and I got a couple of yellowheads in between my lashes. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have not seen anything yet and I have been using it since I got it!!!  :and I&#x27;m almost out of the product</li>
            <li> I get comments from strangers on how long my eyelashes are! Love the stuff.  You do have to keep up with maintenance.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product and her lashes were lush, darker and longer so I ordered it but so far all I see is my lashes ar longer and the bottom lash has no improvement. I shall keep on using this with the hopes it will be better.</li>
            <li> I started using grande lash as soon as I got it. But I had to stop using it in 2 days. My eyes became red and blurry. I&#x27;m not sure if its person based reaction or it is common with everybody who uses it.</li>
            <li> my friend had INCREDIBLE lashes all of a sudden &amp; when i asked about them, she sent me a tube for my birthday.  i was skeptical - so i applied it to only ONE eye.  i am AMAZED at the length attained (they hit my eye socket area now) and have now started applying to both eyes.  it took a bit over a month to start see results &amp; am seeing the same with the second &amp;#34;catch up&amp;#34; eye.  people who have seen both eyelashes with their very different lengths are astounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did question the company about their ingredients.  while parabens were not listed on the box, they were listed on the insert.  after a long conversation with them, i&#x27;m convinced that new shipments are paraben-free.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works 100%! recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I had Novalash false lashes for over a year.  I grew tired of the time and expense even though I loved the lashes.  I decided to try this product and was not disappointed.  My lashes were left damaged and basically stubs.  I started seeing results after a month but continued to see results after 3 months.  When I started I could barely get my lashes into an eyelash curler.  They are now just as long as my false lashes were.  My only wish is that they were thicker.  I used it every day twice a day and it lasted me 3 months.  I also purchased the mascara and used it daily.  Great products for the price.  I am a lifer with this stuff!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes, in a past life, were short, thin, and nearly invisible even with mascara. I tried individual lash extensions and found them too high maintenance, and I was always a bit fearful of latisse because of the risk of changing the color of your iris. Grandelash is the answer to my dreams. Your lashes GROW, to the point where someone close to me said &amp;#34;oh, you got extensions again?&amp;#34; Incredible stuff, and so much more cost effective and gratifying than the fake ones.</li>
            <li> This works.  After about 3 weeks, I noticed my glasses were getting blurry in the center.  My lashes were hitting it!  They actually look false with one coat of mascara.  Also, a few places in my brows have grown back in.  Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Saw results in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> After 3 months I can really see the results! My lashes are much longer! This is my first lash boosting product, so I can&#x27;t compare it with other ones.</li>
            <li> The best product.It does it work.Just need little time and patients.My lashes became longer like in 6 months,but everyone ask if they are artificial and a good thing they are staying long.I used this product maybe for two years right now,only 1-2 times per month,just keep up with my eeyelashes.</li>
            <li> I am interested in ordering this product.  However, I want to a list of the ingredients. Is anyone willing to put them on here via a review. Appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;I have allergies and need to know the exact contents before I order. Don&#x27;t want to end up with sore eyes. Many thanks. Amazon has a great price on this.</li>
            <li> Do not use this product! Its not worth the risk. Within the first week my eyes were red and itchy. I was leery but continued use; even though I saw no change in my lashes. If anything they were getting thinner. Three weeks into it, I feel like I have pink eye. My eyes itch like crazy; and are red/ bloodshot with huge dark bags under them. In the mornings, I wake up with major crust in my eyes. I Look as if I aged 5 years in 3 weeks. Now, after at least a week of not using the product, I am still experiencing symptoms as described above. Much of the time, I just want to scratch my eyes out. Do to all the itching, I&#x27;m sure my eyelashes are falling out even more. Kind of defeats the purpose right.&lt;br /&gt;So warnings to all, I do not recommend this Product. (Period)</li>
            <li> I have always had really short lashes and hate wearing mascara. So I heard about this and it is all natural so I decided to give it a try. And to my amazement my lashes are so much fuller and they are lengthening. I have been using Grande Lash MD 2x a day for the last 3 weeks. I will definitely be continuing the use of this product</li>
            <li> It really works and looks so natural.  I&#x27;m 67 and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  My last tube lasted 9months.  Now I have my daughter hooked on it, too.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good quality</li>
            <li> I really did not notice much improvement, but I may have skipped a night or two and maybe that made a difference,</li>
            <li> I love this product, it helps my lashes grow along with using this great mascara along side. https://www.youniqueproducts.com/RitaStanford14/party/1127597/view</li>
            <li> Hard to tell, irritated eyes. No noticeable difference. Stopped using.</li>
            <li> This actually works!  Two different make up artists thought I had eyelash extensions.  This is 1/3 the cost of Latisse and works just as well.  It&#x27;s also easier to use as you don&#x27;t have to put drops on a wand.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Think I&#x27;ll try the eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I bought both this and the mascara. I truly have noticed a difference. The mascara is ok but this product is what has made my lashes longer. It took about two weeks to notice. My lashes now hit my eyeglasses so I have to move them forward. Love the product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product in June of 2012, it is now July 18, 2012 and I am seeing complete results!! I had purchased some false eye lashes in May and the false eyelashes came out along with my real lashes. I found this product online and don&#x27;t regret making the purchase. Trust me, it really works!!!</li>
            <li> i have used Latisse and this product works just as well.</li>
            <li> Ladies don&#x27;t look for other eyelash enhancer...this is the real one!! After 3 weeks of use you notice those big lashes you always desire</li>
            <li> I know, I know...it&#x27;s not Latisse. But having said that, this is a terrific, cost-conscious alternative that works nearly as well, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and has given me some gorgeous lashes!  Works magic when partnered with the Grande Mascara, which I&#x27;ve been purchasing with it as a set.  Together they give me bombshell lashes that are so stellar I don&#x27;t need much in the way of eye makeup for day wear, and in the evening they are flat out glam when worn with a great cateye liner.  Give it a couple of weeks to show any significant growth, and try using it morning and evening for maximum effect.  It definitely works.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my eyelashes all the time. As the directions stated it took about 6 wks of once a day application to really see a difference but this is amazing stuff. After achieving the growth I backed off to every other day and eventually once a week. You do have to continue use to maintain results but it does not need to be every day. I have just ordered my second tube. It lasted me well over 6 months.</li>
            <li> Worked as promised on my lashes. They are full, long and dark. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for eyebrows, it made mine coarse and unruly.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  It take a few weeks to start seeing results but I have noticed my eyelashes are much longer and my brows are also fuller and darker.</li>
            <li> Great results.  Will order again !</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that really works. It took about 6 weeks to see results but, I would highly recommend this product. Never experienced any burning like other reviews.</li>
            <li> Amazing product but I needed something stronger so I decided to try Royal Lashes. It worked great for me, I got mine from RoyalCosmetics.net</li>
            <li> I Used this product as directed and I did not get any results. I am very unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> I am extremly pleased with Amazon!!  I am sooo delighted with this product. It arrived fast!! I have been using this for 2 months. It is very easy to apply with the brush. My lashes look longer and beautiful seems to be thicker I dont need to use m&amp;aacute;scara much! I use this on upper and lower lashes. It is clear color. I like the ingredients contained alot! this is important as I use alot of organic and plant based ingredients. Accidently, I put it close to my eye and dripped a little, it only irritated my eye momentarily. I dont wake up with red eyes like other reviews have said about the other products. I bought this over the others because the other reviews stated how the liquid irritated the eyes.</li>
            <li> i have used this product before and its amazing!!... love grandelash :) really works!.. but you have to put on every day, like everything in life you have to be continues.</li>
            <li> This is my second review of this product....why?....because I believe the second one I purchased (for less money) is a fake, a knockoff. My first review is below - I LOVED how long my eyelashes got. This second GrandeLASH MD product didn&#x27;t do a thing except make my eyes red and swollen. SO, buyer beware!  Can&#x27;t believe how long my lashes are now.  Even my fianc&amp;eacute; noticed!  Must confess to waking up with red eyes most mornings, but it always goes away quickly after simply splashing some water in my face. Love this product and will buy it again and again. Even used it to fill in my brows and it works great there too.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> Really works but give it time. Anywhere from 4-5 weeks to see results.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I bought it from my salon and it works but this price was the BEST from anyone!</li>
            <li> I had lash extensions added on and were in love however they are expensive to keep up with! Sooo.. I couldn&#x27;t wait for them to fall off and pulled them off myself. A big no no. I was left with stubs... I tried this and my lashes are not only LONG but lush. I recommend this to anyone and am repurchasing this amazing product. It works people!!</li>
            <li> Noticed a definite change in lash length about 6 weeks into use. Am at 8 weeks and am still waiting on lash thickness and hopefully darkening as I have light blonde eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using GrandeLASH MD for almost a month now and I already see results! My lashes are longer and starting to become more fuller. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I read about this in a few blogs and though skeptical I decided to try it.  I bought this to use on my eyebrows as they are thinning and getting lighter in color (I have very dark brown hair and light skin).  I use brow powder and stiff brush to fill in the thin spots and darken them all over, and they had gotten to the point where I was very self-conscious of them and wouldn&#x27;t ever go without them filled in.  It&#x27;s amazing how much younger you look with your brows filled in.  Well, it took a good 2 months, but now my brows are MUCH darker and the thin spots are somewhat filled in!!!  I actually have to wax my brows to tidy things up - I haven&#x27;t done that in years!!!  Now I only fill in my brows if I&#x27;m rocking a full-on made up look, and I have to be very light handed or they look way too heavy.  If I am going with light makeup or a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look, I don&#x27;t bother to fill them in because I don&#x27;t need to!  Dang - I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> was happy for the most part with results, would enjoy a bit more color or darkness</li>
            <li> Great product, but made my eyes itch. Really works!!!!!! Gave to a friend and her lashes got really thick. Wish it didn&#x27;t make my eyes itch.&lt;br /&gt;Ended up buying revitalash, but takes longer to work.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works, it was not as dramatic for me as some of the pictures but if you use it religiously your bound to see a little bit of length</li>
            <li> My mom gave me this product for Christmas and I ordered some more.  I do not want to be without it.  I have always had nice thick and long lashes, but as I got older they weren&#x27;t as impressive.  I cannot believe how well this works!  My mom and sister in law have also been using it with amazing results.  The only downside is that, even when curled, my lashes are so long they hit my glasses every time I blink.  I am going to have to get some new glasses now!</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using the product, I dont think that my lashes are longer, but...It says on the tube that it takes 2-3 months to see the results...so I&#x27;m waiting...I&#x27;ll get back to you in a couples of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> A co-worker uses this and her lashes are AMAZING!  I just started a little while ago and I can already see a difference.  I tried using this twice a day and it made my eyes look really red, like I hadn&#x27;t slept in a week, so I use it once a day before bed and keep eye drops handy.</li>
            <li> This product has enhanced my eyebrows so I hardly use any pencil now.  My eyelashes seem darker and fuller and I&#x27;m told that they&#x27;ll improve even more the longer I use the product.</li>
            <li> In just two weeks I noticed a slight improvement in the length of my lashes.  It is now just under two months of use and my upper lashes are nearly TWICE as long as they have ever been in my life!  The product also says it will darken your lashes and about 5 weeks into use I noticed that without any make up, my brown lashes are now BLACK.  It has even helped improve the look of my lower lashes.  I&#x27;m 51.  This isn&#x27;t some youthful delusion.  This clear liquid that I apply every night is simply magic!</li>
            <li> I must say I was a skeptic at first because of the price, but the pictures convinced me to give it a try.  I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have noticed longer lash length and also more hair growth in my eyebrows where it was getting a little sparse.  I have used Latisse in the past and I must say GrandeLASH works just as well, but the price is more than half.  Loooove it.</li>
            <li> everyone thinks I have false eye lashes!  After 3 weeks of applying every night I notices my lashes were longer and fuller.  Also put on eye brows and noticed how they were looking fuller.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> This product WORKS! Just use it 2 times a day and within 2 weeks you will see a difference. I used this on my eyebrows and now i don&#x27;t have to use brow pencil or powder.</li>
            <li> It took a full month to see any difference, but it did make my lashes longer and slightly fuller.</li>
            <li> fabulous product! I&#x27;m a young 65 years old.  I was on some very potent antibiotics after a surgery and my eyelashes all but disappeared.  My eyebrows had become sparse as well.  I&#x27;ve been off the antibiotics for 2 months now and have been using GrandeLASH MD daily since then.  I swear my eyelashes are close to 1/2&amp;#34; long now and my eyebrows are actually thicker now than they ever were and darker too.  I&#x27;m going to stop using it daily and maybe cut back to 3 days a week because they are beginning to look fake and are rubbing on the insides of my sunglasses.  I AM NOT KIDDING!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice before and it works much better than Latisse for me.  I first used this product through Nordstrom&#x27;s then through Drugstore.com at an incredible price, couldn&#x27;t find it this time there so I went to Amazon.  The price has gone up, the name keeps changing but the product is great.  I find it by the tube color.</li>
            <li> I had noticed my best friends lashes were really long one day, seeming overnight. She told me it was grande lash md and she had been using it for 2 months or so. The difference was significant but she told me you had to consistent using it then one day poof you notice your lashes are longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went and bought some and used it faithfully almost very day at night.  Now something weird happened at first, I did my upper and lower and for some reason only my lower lashes looked like they were rimmed in pink. No itching or Irritation but pink! So I gave myself a break then started up a couple days later only on the tops and was able to use without incident for about 8 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice a difference until this past week. But it was remarkable.  I am Asian and my lashes have never been very long but I want to say I&#x27;ve noticed at least 1/4 inch growth. It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave this product four stars because I noticed the price went way up.  When I bought this back in October it was only $38. It&#x27;s almost double tha now.  Because of this I&#x27;m going to try Rapidlash based on the reviews looks to work just as well and less than $30. I&#x27;ll post a review once I have a chance to try it.  It&#x27;s a shame they raised the cost so high because the product really works.</li>
            <li> and it indeed worked for me (of course results may vary per person).  My eyelashes began thinning and became lighter in color beginning in my late 30&#x27;s early 40&#x27;s.  I could not afford and/or did not want to take a prescription for longer/fuller lashes. So I decided to splurge on myself early for the holidays...I read several reviews on different products and chose GrandeLASH MD with a reduced advertised price via Amazon (so if it did not work I wouldn&#x27;t feel the loss of money so much if you know what I mean).  After two (2) weeks literally 2 WEEKS of every morning/night application on both upper/lower eyelids...a few lashes on each eye began to grow.  At first I thought I was imaging it...after one month it was very visible...now after two (2) months...they have grown around an 1/8 of an inch, fuller and darker...I&#x27;m so tickled by it.  Upon first though I have to say it was awkward to use because I don&#x27;t use makeup/mascara...I felt clumsy...now I can easily apply each application under 3 seconds per eye with one swoop. After washing my face I first apply my night cream and/or SPF day cream then apply it directly on my eyelids (not lashes).  Some redness occurred the first two (2) weeks along with slight itchiness (was not bothersome to me because thereafter it went away).  Each application I used one dip per eye as instructed...still feels like there&#x27;s another two (2) months left in bottle (goes a long way IF you follow the directions).  Most definitely will buy again and again...sounds silly but I do feel more feminine with a bit more lash;)  Hope it can work for you too!</li>
            <li> It works but have patience! Also, I got little sty pimples at my lash line later using the product so I stopped for a while. OUCH!</li>
            <li> Really works as the information states.  It is worth the money - got plenty of compliments on eyelashes.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It desnt work. I used 2 times a day everyday for a month and gave up. Took before and after pics and saw no difference...&lt;br /&gt;It sort of made my eyes itch a bit but not so bad</li>
            <li> Seriously! My eyelashes, which were pretty short and nonexistent, are now so long, I can&#x27;t wear my old sunglasses anymore! My eyelashes touch the lenses too much on my old sunglasses, which is annoying, so I had to switch! This stuff is so powerful, you need to be pretty careful of where it gets on your face, otherwise, the areas which you want to remain hairless (like the areas to the right and left of the ends of your lash line) might start to grow a little fuzz...</li>
            <li> This really is a wonderful product!  I had tried almost all the other eye enhancers &amp; nothing compares to Grande LASH MD.  Within three to five days I could really tell a huge difference.  Lashes were thicker &amp; longer.  Within two wks people were asking what I was doing.  Now they are perfect.  Will definitely buy again &amp; again.</li>
            <li> Had to return it as my eye lids swelled and throbbed. My eye balls became inflamed. I couldn&#x27;t see right for 4 days until the serum wore out of my system.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing I had an allergic reaction to it. It was so scary.</li>
            <li> Just started using.a friend recommended. Her eyelashes are gorgeous. She Highly recommended product. And I have been using it for one month.</li>
            <li> I FIND IT IS OK ABOUT THE SAME AS OTHER EYE LASH SERUMS ONLY A LITTLE BIT HIGHER IN PRICE ,BUT STILL ON 2ND WEEK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year... But this last one did not work as well.. My lashes didn&#x27;t get as long &amp; the product didn&#x27;t even last two months!!  Very disappointed😔</li>
            <li> My eyes after use of this product not getting it in my eyes, makes my eyes so sensitive to light that I have pain within the back of eyeball, evidently some seeps into eyes. I have given up on it, not worth the pain and redness of eye. I now use Smart Lash. no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Just be patient and persistent and it will work.  It was as though one morning I woke up and my eyelashes were so long!  Don&#x27;t waste money on more expensive products.  This one definitely works.  But you have to use it every day.</li>
            <li> this product really really works.  I had a bald spot in one eyebrow and they were both short at the ends from plucking.  I was going to get perminate makeup tatoo to fill in.  I tried it is well worth the money.  My eyebrows are full and long.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product since my daughter has had wonderful results with it. Her lashes are so long and full since using it. But it makes my eyes burn and get very dry and uncomfortable.  I plan to try it again after a little time passes. I sure would like to be able to use it.</li>
            <li> This by far works better than any other lash lengthening product I have ever used. I will continue to use it as long as they make it!!</li>
            <li> I had read so many great reviews on this product and I was sadly disappointed. I have been using the product for almost 2 months and have seen very minimal results. For the price, I was hoping for dramatic results. :(</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a change and feel it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I like this product!  I didn&#x27;t follow it on a daily basis due to very mild irritation..but very nice results!</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! I&#x27;ve been using GrandeLASH MD for 2 months now and have great results! I cannot believe how LONG my lashes have grown! Started seeing results in about 2-3 weeks. I tried extensions at a salon last year and honestly, this is a better look, much cheaper and I don&#x27;t have to book a 2 hour appt. This takes 10 seconds each night. Only drawback was getting used to the feel of it the first few weeks. Lids were a little red where I applied it and eyes felt a little dry the next day but I had read reviews and expected this. It was very minimal and doesn&#x27;t happen anymore. Totally recommend!!</li>
            <li> like the product but often the wand comes with very little product in it . The first few times of using it was good only to be disappointed in the amount the last two times.  Not sure what that is all about</li>
            <li> I received the product just fine. The third time I tried to use it the applicator broke inside the tube.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really use it now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this first at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.  The girls there all used it and they had incredible lashes!  I have been using it since July of last year and my lashes are longer for sure.  They aren&#x27;t quite what I expected, based on what I saw with the girls in the office that day, but then again, they said you have to apply it morning and night.  I am lucky to get it applied every night.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Totally works as long as you use it everyday</li>
            <li> Still waiting for my lashes to fill in but they are longer, I will try this products again.</li>
            <li> I thought I ruined my lashes for good. I had individuals. It shortened them and I  lost over half. I used this product and I noticed a difference in just 2 weeks of daily use. Will continue to buy this product. Looking forward to what else the grande products have to offer.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use Grande Lash MD.  I just returned from a 2 week boat cruise and did not use the product during that time and my eye lashes did not suffer.  Should I use it daily until I get the results I desire and then how often?</li>
            <li> This works just as well as Latisse and much much less!!!  I have ordered it 3 times already and will continue to order it.</li>
            <li> This product delivers what it promises! People think I am wearing false eyelashes! I have never been more satisfied .</li>
            <li> I.have used it for 4 weeks. It looks likenit thikens my eyelashes. I did not see length improvement  yet. I&#x27;ll  give it 4 weeks.more.</li>
            <li> Well, it really works. And I even tried on my hair. It works. I wish it came in bigger sizes so I can use for my hair as well.</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical this would work when I purchased it, but sure enough, within 6 weeks I could definitely see the difference.  Need I say that I will be back for more?!</li>
            <li> i received this item and began using it on July 27.  I used the product twice a day (for the first month).  as of today, August 3, the serum is gone.  So I cant actually say if it works or not..and I&#x27;m CERTAINLY not willing to spend $160.00 to find out in one month.&lt;br /&gt;very disappointing.  and very dishonest.</li>
            <li> Great for growing lashes!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.  It does not work.  I went through two fake products before I found Revitalash, and this was one of the fake, worthless products.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.  Just go buy Revitalash, as that stuff works very well.</li>
            <li> i originally bought this product from a salon per a friends recommendation. it worked great! i went on line and bought 3 more for my cousin, my daughter and sister. they were not having the results i did, so i bought another one on line. the one i bought at a salon showed results within 2 weeks, this one did not but i wasn&#x27;t deterred and was sure i would see results soon. my bottle is now empty and my lashes look worse than they ever have. 4 out of 4 with the same non-results. it was a complete waste of money and time. why would this &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; product bought at a salon work so much better than the 4 i bought on line?? it can&#x27;t be the real thing. it was like putting water on my lashes day and night for weeks and expecting something to happen.&lt;br /&gt;go to a reputable salon to buy this product, don&#x27;t waste your money on line. it may be cheaper, but it doesn&#x27;t work and is a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> So far it works, my lashes are fuller but only slightly longer. I do have a slight dark area around my eye but not so noticible as others have indicated.</li>
            <li> This product worked better that Latisse for me.  Got my lashes a bit longer and now use only 3-4 times per week to maintain.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  My eyelashes after the sixth week, just BAM, showed up. I&#x27;m addicted to their length, darkness and volume. I don&#x27;t even have to wear mascara anymore, and when I do my lashes are almost too long. Great product and price.  I use it every night before bed religiously with superb results. I&#x27;m still on my first tube, it&#x27;s lasted me 5 months so far.  I have sensitive skin and just had a little redness initially, but nothing of consequence.  Great price, well worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this liquid for several months and my lashes look like those from commercials! Everyone was asking whether they are mine or artificial. I stopped using it after 5 months and my own lashes still look healthy and long. My friend also used Grande lash and she suffered from allergy. Still I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> As a teen I had very long lashes and did so until I hit my 50s.  Each year they got thinner and shorter, now they are back!&lt;br /&gt;Love this product.</li>
            <li> I am 57 and started using this twice a day in February.  It took about 5 weeks to notice a difference.  The lashes were definitely longer and by 8 or 9 weeks they were long and thick including the lowere lashes.  I now use once every 2 or 3 days and am impressed with the results. It is easy to use and just takes a few seconds for a quick swipe alnong the lash line I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.  I would have to say it is the best mascara I have ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t flake and makes your lashes really &amp;#34;POP&amp;#34; which is exactly what I had hoped for and the fact that there is the lengthening serum in the mascara you are getting twice the thickening and lengthening per day!</li>
            <li> This product works better than expected. After 2 months of using it, I started to notice my lashes growing. No irritation or any problems at all, even when the product gets accidentally in contact with the eyes.</li>
            <li> Grande Lash MD really works! My lashes are longer and fuller! Definitely darkened lashes also. Great product! Will keep using!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works because after the first use I woke up with a horrible migraine. My eyes were pounding and red and felt like all the blood in my body was rushing to them. This stuff feels like viagra for your eyes. Maybe that&#x27;s how it works by stimulating the blood flow to your lashes roots. Anyhow, I&#x27;ve been to afraid to try it again.</li>
            <li> This works!!!  my lashes are long and full.  i no longer need false lashes.  i am sensitive to a lot of products but not this.  however, i bought for a friend and she was.  its 100% legitimate!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> I used to use Latisse but hated the separate brush and either got too little or too much on it. GrandeLASH MD is fantastic! Love the eyeliner applicator and the results are amazing. I&#x27;m very happy to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had nearly no lashes! Now long and beautiful and I don&#x27;t even use it every day! 😊👍 More than twice the price when I bought through my hair stylist! Buy Amazon!</li>
            <li> Have been using for a couple of weeks now have not seen any changes don&#x27;t think I would order this again</li>
            <li> This is a great lash enhancer. My lashes were sparse and actually nonexistent. I applied every day, and after about 7 - 8 weeks, I have seen dramatic  results. My lashes are longer and darker. With mascara they look awesome. I highly recommend this product. I know I need to continue using this to maintain my lashes, but I am happy to do so.</li>
            <li> I applied the product as indicated in the package but after the first use i have horrible bruised eyes, I definitely will not continue using this product at all. I don&#x27;t recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than I expected. I have only used it for about a week so it is too soon to see if it is working but it is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Works great for lashed. Seemed to work quickly too. I could tell after a week and a half.</li>
            <li> This really works, however you need to continue using it.  My eyelashes grew to unexpected lengths.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different ones.  This is the only one that REALLY works!</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks, but I do see results.  I have used LiLash and Smartlash; this out-performs both.&lt;br /&gt;03/30/16 update: I have used this for a year or so. It has always worked well until this last order. It&#x27;s been about a month and nothing: no new growth and my lashes are looking thinner. Assuming (hoping) this was just a bad batch. I may have to consider purchasing directly from the manufacturer or switching to something else completely next time. Sad.&lt;br /&gt;Update 03/2017: I have been purchasing from an authorised seller (also online, but not here) for a few months now and am once again seeing results - lashes are growing, not so much fuller, but longer and hold a curl well as long as I don&#x27;t use a really wet mascara formula.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s eyelashes grew like crazy.  It works as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 69, so I don&#x27;t expect instant lashes and brows.  However, using it two times daily, I am noticing a slight increase in lashes and, maybe, a tad more brows.  I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;m not just wishing they were there and thinking I&#x27;m seeing an increase!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using it July 3, 2014 and will have to use it for life so as not to lose them again.  I think I should be waiting for a few more months, then I&#x27;ll review it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, Amazon.com is the least expensive place to buy it.</li>
            <li> After two months my eyelashes have grown and are now thickening. I will only use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It takes about a month of consistent use to see any results. But once you do see the results it&#x27;s AMAZE!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! getting lashes like fans!</li>
            <li> Very hapoy with the product you can finally see my eyelashes again!  The product does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> My eyes were watery and bloodshot the next morning after initial use.  I had absolutely no side effects from Latisse.  I will pay a few dollars extra and continue with a product that works and isn&#x27;t irritating.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My lashes look full and lustrous since I&#x27;ve been using this product. No more fake eyelashes, yippee!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast! I&#x27;ve been using GrandeLash MD for about a year now &amp; it&#x27;s amazing! Takes about 1-2 weeks &amp; I notice a huge difference. Every time I stop using it I regret it!</li>
            <li> Amazing results... would definitely recommend this product. My cousin recommended Grand lash and honestly the best product I have gotten so far . Feeling marvelous thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!! My eyelashes are noticeably longer and thicker. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Burning sensation, followed by chronic eczema and extreme sensitivity to anything I put near my eyes. (including water filtered tap water).&lt;br /&gt;I even got a few pimples in my lash follicles. That&#x27;s not natural. My lashes fell out a lot too, on a daily basis. Eyes and skin around eyes temporarily turned a dark red. To say the least, I looked like a crack head zombie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But surprisingly one star because my lashes became longer and thicker, somehow. Not really worth all the burning, excruciating pain in my opinion. If you want to condition you lashes use castor oil, sweet almond oil, or olive oil.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 months now and I have seen improvements on my eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve seen a small improvement on my eyebrows, but not as quick as seen in my eyelashes.  Will continue to use it for a few more months.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference and it can definitely cause irritation the first few times you use it. After the first few times though, it wasn&#x27;t so bad. I compared this to another product that is way cheaper and the other product works better for me. I might have seen a little bit of growth.</li>
            <li> Had to discontinue use. Caused eye irritation and breakouts oddly enough.</li>
            <li> I had been using eyelash extenders for my thinning lashes and loved them, but when I moved to Florida, the price went up 5 fold!  So I had to find an alternative.  This was the first one I tried and it worked very well.  It&#x27;s not an overnight fix, but over time it does thicken and extend lashes.  Later I found another brand which didn&#x27;t do the job nearly as well, so I returned to GrandeLash.  A great value; highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it took 2 months of nightly use, but it really works. My lashes are crazy long. I think, though, when the bottle gets low, the product is not as effective, so I&#x27;m replacing. But it worked great for about 4 months. Definitely recommend and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I used this for 3 months and didn&#x27;t see any results.  I stopped using it because my right eye was dried out, teared up when I read or watch tv.  I stopped using it and after 3 weeks, my right eye is back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;This was a waste of my money and I am sad I did not see any results.</li>
            <li> Five years ago I ripped just about every single lash out (my first time using fake eyelashes). My (once) thick eyelashes have barely grown back and they were SO sparse. That is...until I discovered Grandelash MD. One of my friends who works at a high end salon sells Grandelash to her clients. She recommended I try it--and I&#x27;m not going to lie I was desperate for anything to grow my eyelashes back! Her salon sold it for over $100 (which is why you should obviously buy on Amazon for HALF the price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are instructed to use one dip for each eye (apply to the top lid and the bottom). I will say that the first couple weeks of using this product SEVERELY irritated my eyes. They were dry &amp; itchy--but nothing that a bottle of over the counter eye drops can&#x27;t fix. I was skeptical and saw no change the first few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However-then I hit the month mark and my eyelashes started to look thicker, fuller, and darker. I continued to use this religiously every night, and the irritation also began to subside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first started using this product in July--it is now October. After 4 months my eyelashes look INCREDIBLE. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even wear mascara and people have asked me if I have fake eyelashes on (never again!!!). I have also noticed that Grandelash has made my eyelashes thicker. I used to rub my eyes or wash my face and lose SO many lashes!! My lash loss is at an all time low. I even began to use this on my eyebrows and they turned darker (in a noticeable, yet subtle way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough good things about this product--it&#x27;s truly a lifesaver. I&#x27;m back to write a review and order my 3rd bottle of Grandelash. (2 bottles lasted me 4 months--however after 2 months I started to skip a few days here and there). I&#x27;d say a bottle should last you around a month and a half. Seriously- $50 is NOTHING for a product that truly works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the only downside is the initial use is pretty much guaranteed to irritate your eyes. I wear contacts regularly and switched to my glasses for a few weeks. It burns like hell if it gets in your contacts. Plus, wearing glasses hides the puffiness as well! But seriously--once you get past that stage this product RULES! I have turned my mother, sister, and friends onto this product and they all have seen fantastic results as well!!!ate your eyes.

            <li> I love this stuff....ridiculous transformation in just 4weeks so far. I&#x27;m buying the mascara for added results.</li>
            <li> I was going to wait after 10 weeks to be fair since that is what is claimed on the website. I&#x27;m only on week 6 and although I noticed some difference in my lashes, it&#x27;s not significant, which is why I was going to wait to week 10. As much as I wanted for better results and read about every review on various websites, nowhere did I see anyone report facial hair in unusual places - under the outer corners of the eyes. I&#x27;m not prone to tearing, plus I followed directions by applying the brush like an eye-liner without re-dipping in the morning and evening. A couple weeks ago, I noticed from a distance by looking at a mirror and saw a shadow underneath the corner of my eyes, I thought it was the lighting. Then last week I took a small compact 10X mirror and got a closer look. I was shocked that my facial hair was thicker and darker in this small 1\\&quot; diameter patch under each eye. I called my aesthetician who threaded the hairs. It hurt so bad and I&#x27;m used to threading. I decided to stop use as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Very&#x27; good product, I used Latisse for years and this product is very close to Latisse&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  I&#x27;m brown/caramel skin with dark features, early 30s. Unfortunately,  I don&#x27;t have thick brows. Lost most of my natural lashes from years of extensions.  Havent used as consistenly as directed in package. However, saw quick results on my brows (less than 3 weeks). Thicker, darker. Husband noticed and remarked without knowing i was using this product. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using Grand Lash for 2 years now and I love it.</li>
            <li> My sister used this for a few months and the next thing I know, her lashes were insanely long and darker than they used to be. I have been using it for almost 4 weeks now and the results are undeniable, I took a before pic and a 4 week pic, and my lashes are not only longer, but have come in fuller and more volumous as well! This stuff works and I&#x27;ll be buying it again and again for sure!</li>
            <li> Love it and it works.</li>
            <li> My lashes are sooooo long!  One of the best I have used!</li>
            <li> Great product! This is the second time buying it.  My lashes are much longer, darker and stronger! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I used to have naturally long eyelashes but lost all the length and many lashes due to my job (I had to wear false eyelashes). I have been using this product for a few months now and have never been happier with my lashes! They are long and beautiful! Although when I first began to use this product, I experienced some redness in my eyes, it went away and hasn&#x27;t bothered me since. I do have sensitive skin so I wonder if that had anything to do with it. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who really wants to see a difference in their lashes!!</li>
            <li> All I&#x27;ve heard is my lashes look fake.  Luv!</li>
            <li> This product is okay doesn&#x27;t work as well as Lilash, worth spending the extra money.</li>
            <li> I bought my first GrandeLASH from a high end salon and it worked wonderfully!  My eyelashes grew in better and they were longer.  With mascara on, even family members asked if I had false eyelashes.  I got the replacement online and I am suspecting it is not the real product.  If any gets in my eye, its stings - I never had that happen with the first one. And my inside eyelashes are starting to fade again.  If you stop using the product your lashes go back to the way they were which again makes my suspect this product is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> I used this daily for 3 weeks and my lashes have doubled in length. 1 tube has lasted me over 2 months. Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> It really works! The only downfall is my sensitive eyes can only handle this one or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Ive tried other similar non prescription products and non of them worked so i was hesitant to purchase this one but&lt;br /&gt;.......OMG!!!  This is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I had extensions for about 9 months and they ruined my lashes, i had spaces between lashes and they literally were stubs!!!!  I ordered this product out of desperation and within weeks my lashes were thicker, darker and fuller!!!!!  People thought i was wearing fake lashes, I used it twice a day in the morning and evening only on my top lashes but my bottom grew also - so much so that my bottom look like they should be my top lashes and my top lashes look like falsies with mascara.  Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Eyelashes appear to be growing</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well and is easy to use.  Eyelashes are longer and brows are filled in where sparse.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows had gotten so sparse and light, and that&#x27;s the main reason I got GrandeLASH, on the recommendation of my hair stylist. It did a great job on my eyebrows, and my lashes as well. It did take about 3 months for the maximum effect, but it was so worth it!  It also lasted a really long time, even with my using it daily.  I&#x27;ve just purchased my second tube, and I&#x27;ve been really, really pleased!</li>
            <li> i have not opened this pkg yet, still working on the last one.  It works, I have lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried others but this is better (for me)</li>
            <li> grandeLash MD worked very well in lengthening my lashes but didn&#x27;t make them fuller. easy to use and worked within a week</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference</li>
            <li> This product actually works!!</li>
            <li> I saw good ratings and I bought it. I want to say: THE RATINGS ARE DEFINITELY MISLEADING! My eyes became super red and I had to take sick days.</li>
            <li> my lashes look wonderful, they are so long and lush.</li>
            <li> I used the product 3 days in row, and I had a dull headache by the end of the day each day, and totally bloodshot eyes. It didn&#x27;t burn and I didn&#x27;t experience the issues until it was on for over 8 hours.  I am still using it on my eyebrows- but I don&#x27;t know if it is making a difference yet.</li>
            <li> I bought myself a tube and my mom a tube back in November, we got it just before thanksgiving and I could notice results that I loved at Christmas. My moms had the absolutely shortest lashes in existence and she got enough length by Christmas that she could really grab onto with her mascara wand and also see with no makeup. She wasnt as good about applying it each morning and night but I religiously did each day when I got up and right before bed only missing 2night in 3months. My lashes existed but werent very long and were completely straight. My lashes are so long now and curl somewhat and my eyebrows are full and I LOVE my results!! Neither of us got any eyelid darkening or anything. The only side effect we had was our eyes getting red the first 2or 3 days. She wants to be done and I now apply once a day just to maintain the results and I will continue to buy this product!! So happy I found it!</li>
            <li> I only had the product for a couple of weeks when the brush broke off inside the tube, rendering it useless. Can&#x27;t get the brush out of the tube. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> amazing,actually works, i basically never had lashes,well almost none,-the joy of being a caucasion,this works after 4 weeks, after using now for less than 3 months i dont wear mascara,lashes are really that long.downside,it made my eyelids rose colored,,well red basically, so have to wear white eyeshadow to cover up the red eyelids,im in my forties so it looks bad,but is a trade off for the lashes, maybe the red will fade away in time, after i stop using it everyday and go to using just a few times a week as directed,will see i guess?</li>
            <li> My lashes got so long I actually had to stop using this for a while!! I can&#x27;t believe the difference and I&#x27;m really not one to write reviews about this stuff!! HUGE amount of growth after about 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> This eyelash enhancer is amazing, eye lashes have grown back and are long and strong!</li>
            <li> I have tried a dozen other products, some worked , some didn&#x27;t. This product is the best. I have always had thin, broken lashes. this product keeps lashes from breaking and makes them longer, thicker and darker. Now, I often leave the house without mascara and you can still see lashes. In fact, I have to be careful to use minimal mascara or it looks overdone. I have even had to trim a few lashes because they are too long! love this product!! I also use on my eyebrow. I have always had a bare spot in one of my eyebrows, but the hair is now growing in. It took longer than eyelashes but it is filling in. However, be careful, it can burn eyes. It has also made my bottom lashes thicker and darker because they come into contact with upper lash line.</li>
            <li> Eyelid swollen. Eyelashs are falling down. I want to return this, if it&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li> On me this is the most amazing product I&#x27;ve ever used! I have pretty good lashes for some one 60 years old..but they have thinned and such since high school, 2 weeks after starting this I had longer and thicker lashes, 4 weeks it was almost ridiculous ... My eye lashes were touching ABOVE my eye brows!!!! Everyone though I had lash extensions... I seriously had to back off and use this no more than twice a week to keep from looking like Tammy Faye! Plus my eye brows have almost become non-existent started using this on brows, and now I have eyebrows again!  YAY. Different products work differently on people but for me this stuff is a Miracile</li>
            <li> This really worked. It made my lashes nice and long but it also made them a little thinner and they would start to fall off. That&#x27;s was really scary. Not sure if I would get it again</li>
            <li> Only have used 6 days but I think I am noticing a difference. Was delivered when said and was product I ordered. i would have given 5 stars but the time I have had too use it is too short to really see how it works.</li>
            <li> It works! Had several people comment on how long my eyelashes look! I will keep buying it and 1 tube last 3 months or longer!!</li>
            <li> Love this. Took a while to work but really makes a difference. A little redness at first but got used to it and it went</li>
            <li> This product really works.  You have to use it consistently.  I noticed a huge difference  around month 2 to 3.  Several people at work have started using  it and also seen positive results.</li>
            <li> I would not write a review, but this stuff really works. Longer and thicker lashes. I applied 2x a day! and now I just use it here and there. You will love it!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this product out for eyelash growth but unfortunately my eyes weren&#x27;t having it. This product caused major irritation to my eyes including severe redness and burning. I had to discontinue use even though I did push it and used it for days hoping my eyes would get use to it. That never happened.</li>
            <li> getting older and losing my eyebrows is not fun, i tried this product and now i have them back. thanks</li>
            <li> I love it and can certainly see the difference when I use it.</li>
            <li> I would give this a negative 5 stars if that were an option. I used it one night. The next morning I woke up with extremely bloodshot eyes and burned looking eye lids.  As the day progressed, the area from my brows to my cheekbone became red and irritated. My husband said it looked like my eyes were bleeding.  After 3 agonizing days, I went to the eye doctor, who said this stuff is full of acids! My lids were burned and I am now on an antibiotic for my eyes and have to use a cream around my eyes at night. I can&#x27;t wear make up and I&#x27;m not supposed to be using the computer but I had to write this as a WARNING.  Do not use GrandeLASH.</li>
            <li> It takes awhile but I really see a difference, it&#x27;s my second tube and even after the first purchase I noticed my lashes were longer and stronger!!</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted this to work, but all it is doing so far is irritating the crap out of my eyes. My eyelids are slightly swollen and my eyes seem to be redder than normal. I&#x27;ve only been using it a month and it says it takes 3 months so I&#x27;m going to stick it out and see if it gets better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so that was a month in and now it&#x27;s 3 months in and I still have product left in the tube so it&#x27;s lasting a while. I only apply it at night and skip a day here and there. I have to admit that the product does work. My lashes are noticeably longer. I can&#x27;t say they are darker because mine were black to begin with. I&#x27;m not sure about fullness either but I can say they are LONGER and I will keep using this product.  I&#x27;ll try and upload a before and after pic.</li>
            <li> being using this product for a while and my eyelash beatiful and have recommended this product to several of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;ty</li>
            <li> I have naturally puny and light coloured lashes. This product made them thicker, longer, darker and curved up. Now with mascara they look like falsies. There was a bit of irritation for the first two weeks but it stopped.</li>
            <li> Great product, it has really helped my eyelashes grow.  Don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!</li>
            <li> Made my eyes pink for two days.  My eyes also felt  like the product made my eyes sting,  I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I love having a problem with my lashes touching the lenses of my sunglasses. HA!!!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this from my salon for $75, so this is a great price. The first few applications did irritate my eyes, some burning and redness, but that went away after a couple uses. My lashes absolutely got longer and thicker. Now i don&#x27;t have to wear mascara for my lashes to be seen and when i do wear mascara people ask me if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes, that&#x27;s how good they look now. I&#x27;m buying my second tube now to use a couple of times a week for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Never had such red eyes or dark circles in my life! Never write reviews but if it saves just one lady the same trouble worth the effort! Complete waste of money and sure it must have been a fake! do not buy!</li>
            <li> the worst product. lashes fell out. DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I bought the product for my girlfriend. She&#x27;s on her second bottle now. At first she was starting to doubt herself because you really cant see much results. But after six weeks. Bam thats when all the lashes started to get longer. now her eyelashes are so long it hits her glasses. I would recommend this product to anyone who is committed to put it on every night. This is an awesome product for an awesome price.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes became very short. Like super stubby short and were barely past my eyelids. After applying this product once a day for 2-3 weeks my eyelashes noticeably grew. Excited to see how long they are in 2-3months.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t Latisse but a great substitute. I am allergic to Latisse and this is so much cheaper</li>
            <li> Yes! This product DEFINITELY works, as evidenced by people asking me almost daily if I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes. I&#x27;m now on my 2nd tube because I loved it so much! Takes about 6-8 weeks to see results but definitely worth the wait. I wouldn&#x27;t say that my lashes are any thicker, but definitely A LOT longer. I get compliments evey single time I go out!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this and used it for one night. I woke up the next day and my eyes were blood shot red! Visine didn&#x27;t even work. I had to leave work early because my eyes were burning and so sensitive. It&#x27;s not worth it...I used a different product a few years ago called Li Lash that worked very well and I had no problems. Amazon no longer carries it and it&#x27;s more expenisve on their main site which is why I was trying a new product.</li>
            <li> I was more than pleased with this product as I saw results within a few days of starting to use it.  My lashes were short and thinning and they have filled out and have become noticeably longer.  Am so glad I tried this before I purchased the prescription product for twice the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this product from a local distributor and it works great. I saw it cheaper here and ordered it. Very disappointed because it was DRY and barely any product to apply. It was like it was old or had been used (Geeze, I hope not). I was used to plenty of liquid to apply and it would last well over a month (I usually apply twice a day). Lesson learned you get what you pay for. I&#x27;m going back to my distributor. It&#x27;s worth paying $10 more.</li>
            <li> It has taken about 8 weeks before really seeing results.  I am way over 30 so that was what I expected.  I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Love! There is a noticeable difference just 3 weeks in.</li>
            <li> Although this account has my husband&#x27;s name on it, i am the one using it not him.  This works fantastic and i have used Revitalash before for a lot more money.  I had to cut back from using it every day and people were making comments on how long my lashes were.  I even recommended it to a friend and when i saw her months later i noticed a dramatic increase in the length and thickness of her lashes.  She loves this stuff as well. Buy this and you will not regret it!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! I am 62 and didn&#x27;t think this would work. I have very short and few eyelashes. My eyelashes thickened and grew incredibly in about a month of use. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Alsome!!!your lashes do grow very long and thick!!!!!  And price is great!!!</li>
            <li> Got it fast.  Have been using it for a&lt;br /&gt;Month and already see amazing results!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give up! After six weeks you&#x27;ll see the difference. Definitivament longer eyelashes and eyebrows more defined. I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse since 2012 and have found this product more effective in less time!</li>
            <li> It took about 3 months to see a difference, but well worth the wait. My brows were thin and graying...they are now thicker and darker with less gray.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great. I saw a difference in the growth of my eyelashes within a few weeks. Now they are so long they touch my glasses when I wear them. The only drawback is the product does irritate my eyes a little bit if I use it too frequently.</li>
            <li> Burned my eyes and made them really red. I&#x27;ve only been using it now for my eyebrows- and I have yet to see a real noticeable difference... but that may require more than a months time.</li>
            <li> I love this.  It thickend my eyebrows in 3 weeks and my lashes are longer and fuller!  I&#x27;m in love.  I will use it again if I need to and I will recommend it to others!  I had no adverse reactions.  I have blue eyes and they are still blue!</li>
            <li> This is a product that really works.  I mainly bought it for my eyebrows that had fallen out, and it really worked to fill them back in.  So, I went ahead and used it on my upper and lower lashes and had great results there as well.  It&#x27;s great to buy a product that actually does what it says its going to do.  This was also a much better price than what I paid at my local hair salon!  I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> I started using grandeLASH about 4 months ago. I use it every night before bedtime. It does not irritate, unlike other brands. I now have long brautiful lashes. I have re-ordered and i will never stop using it, love GrandeLASH !</li>
            <li> This really works. Mostly for length of lashes, but also increased density of eyebrows..</li>
            <li> Love it I&#x27;m already seeing results and I&#x27;m not even using it a month yet !</li>
            <li> Great, lashes were longer within 3 wks</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer than they have ever been! I started using it in April of this year and by the end of June, I could tell the difference. Great product!! I will continue to purchase!!</li>
            <li> works great on  me, no side effects.</li>
            <li> Decided this product was not for me after ordering spontaneously.  Returned.</li>
            <li> I question if the product that I received was the genuine product.  I used it for over a month with no results.  My friend was the one who recommended this to me and she said that she saw results after a month.  I&#x27;m wondering if I should&#x27;ve bought this product directly from their own website, as it states on the Grandelashmd.com website, that not all products sold online are authentic, and that there are counterfeit retailers selling this on Amazon, eBay and Groupon.  BEWARE!</li>
            <li> I noticed that as I&#x27;m getting a bit older, my lashes were fretting sparser and shorter. Even with mascara, I wasn&#x27;t getting the results I wanted. I started using this product, and it really delivers. As I&#x27;m in my 40s, I used twice a day as directed...it mentioned in the package insert that those of us who are a bit more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; night get better results that way. I noticed results after about 3 weeks, and I&#x27;ve been using this since august and my eyelashes are amazing. They brush against my glasses when I blink!  And they look amazing with mascara....long and thick but natural, not overdone or anything. I&#x27;m down to using once every other day as maintenance.  For once, a beauty product that delivers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is the real deal. First tube I bought worked wonderfully. Noticed huge difference in length after 12 weeks. Bought 2nd bottle and saw no difference. My eyelashes I spent so much time growing, naturally shedded and grew back the length they were before. Don&#x27;t be scammed. Don&#x27;t waste your money with this seller. I&#x27;ll only be buying this product from the manufacturer&#x27;s website from now on. It&#x27;s the only way to ensure your product isn&#x27;t counterfeit as I&#x27;m convinced the second tube I bought was.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have blonde, very thin, fine eyelashes, and lost some when I bought a new eyelash curler that pulled a portion of them out.  I have used this product for about 4 weeks.  I purchased this product thinking I was actually buying Nutraluxe Lash.  I thought this was a new and improved product, because the packaging was similar.  No so!  I used Nutraluxe Lash about a year ago and it seemed to work.  With this product, I don&#x27;t see any darkening of my lashes, nor are they any fuller. They might be a little longer where the old growth is, but this product is NOT WORTH $60!  I will buy the Nutraluxe Lash next time and stick with what I KNOW!!!!</li>
            <li> Boy does this stuff work. As I&#x27;ve aged my lashes have really thinned out. Get remarks from people all the time about how long my lashes are. Love this stuff</li>
            <li> Not seeing results. Have used it religiously for 2 months now....</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my lashes and eyebrows !!!!</li>
            <li> It took a solid 3-4 weeks of regular use to notice an improvement, but with regular use it actually does work quite well. I used LiLash in the past, which was more expensive, and definitely worked more quickly, but they both work very well in the end. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this. Also, my eyes are sensitive and this is the only lash enhancer I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t leave me with red, irritated eyes.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!  Patience pays.  It took about 3 months for me to notice growth.  Very pleased!  No side effects so far!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I have never been so happy with my lashes! This works so well and is worth every penny! I will be a lifelong user of this product</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for 6 weeks now and can see a dramatic change! I started noticing at 4 weeks a difference and my lashes are getting longer eveey day! Ive used rapid lash and feel this has given me better results.</li>
            <li> Makes lashes longer just not thicker. I&#x27;m happy with it anyway</li>
            <li> Used for 5 weeks, did not work, made my eyes red. If they a minus stars it would have been 5. I have gone back to using Latisse as this is the only one that works. It may be expensive but if you want longer thicker lashes it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical that this stuff would work but it really did.  It took a few weeks to notice but I was pleasantly surprised.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and eczema and at first the product stings my eyelids a little but it goes away relatively quickly.  After a month, my eyelashes were noticeably longer.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product...I love it.</li>
            <li> the tube was basically dry when I began using it!</li>
            <li> Love this...definitely see growth !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several eyelash enhancers and GrandeLASH not only delivers it&#x27;s cheaper than any of the others that actually work. I was a long time user of Lilash which I loved but at $150 a pop it was not cheap.  Because of the other review I took a chance and tried GrandeLASH MD for the first time almost 6months ago.  It works better than I remember Lilash working.  It actually thickened my lashed more and got a fantastic length but wasn&#x27;t so crazy I had to clip them. It also never caused me to have darkened eyelids (which never bothered me because I just used a light pink shadow anyways...but why not use something that doesn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my first tube from Amazon and then my next tube from GrandeLASH MD site.  I saw no difference so I just purchased my tube a few days ago from here on Amazon.  I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are talking about.  My tube is the GrandeLASH MD original.  If I find it different this time I&#x27;ll return it and let you all know.  (remember it does take about 2 1/2 months to see results but stick with it and you will be rewarded with amazing eyelashes)</li>
            <li> I started using this product on 2/28/13.  It is 4/11/13.  So, exactly 6 weeks of use.  I just ordered another tube of it....IT DOES WORK.  Given what I read, since I am 45, I apply it AM *AND* PM.  It definately has lenghtened my lashes.  I have some crazy long ones.....they are not consistently the same length, yet, but it is only week 6.  I just finished a lot of research and was going to switch to a less expensive option, but since I KNOW this one works, I decided to keep with this product.  As for side affects...I feel like my eyelids are a bit darker.....so I started wearing a light/cream eye shadow..... The longer lashes make it worthwhile.  I really wish I took a before picture so that I could show you the difference.  (FYI, I *HAD* an appointment for eye lash extensions and I cancelled it!  I feel very good about where my lashes are right now and look forward to the next few weeks!)</li>
            <li> Started using this February 1st and by today April 24th, I would say it doesn&#x27;t work and I&#x27;m giving up.  Purchased this instead of Revitalash because that&#x27;s more difficult to find.  So I went from using one product to another directly. As an aside, when I purchased the product it was also half the price it is now making it more economical than Revitalash.  All the growth that Revitalash established  is just about gone using this product.  I have turned to eBay to purchase Revitalash once again.</li>
            <li> Definitely does the job. Was skeptical  at first, but definitely works. And the results are def. noticable. You just have to be patient and follow the instructions</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product so badly! My friend used it and her lashes look gorgeous- long and full! I tried it for 2 nights and my eyes were so red and irritated. I want to keep using it, but it just hurts my eyes too much. So sad.</li>
            <li> I had noticeable results very quickly.I had lost a lot of lashes and I was looking to grow them back .This product worked well for me I was just happy to have lashes back.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for awhile and I love it!!</li>
            <li> This is not for me. It is not for my wife either.My sister-in-law loves this product and we periodically buy it to send to her in South America. I gave it a 5 because she loves it and has asked for it repeatedly.</li>
            <li> It has been just under a month, and I am beginning to see results.  My eyes are pretty sensitive, so I was afraid it would cause me irritation.  Happily, I can report, the morning newspaper makes my eyes water &amp; GrandeLASH does not!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and applied this twice a day. Its been 8 weeks and I still don&#x27;t see results...</li>
            <li> At 46 years old I&#x27;d never had long lashes. They were so short and sparse that I considered getting eye lash extensions for my wedding last fall. But my eyes were too sensitive for that and I ended up dealing with my tiny lashes. If ONLY I&#x27;d had this product a month before!&lt;br /&gt;Been using it most days at night (after make up is removed)for 2 months now and I could be a spokesperson for this product! My upper and lower lashes are long, full and fabulous!! This may not be for everyone (based on some of the reviews,) but I would definitely try it to see if it works on you. If it does you&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
