            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>H2Ocean spray is the absolute best product to use for after piercing!</li>
            <li>it surely helps to have good hygiene &amp; cleaning it three times a day is handy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>Really Needed It , Wonderful 😊</li>
            <li>It calms my infection really well and the best part is how convenient it is to use (compared to preparing warm sea salt soaks).</li>
            <li>I cleaned it twice a day with warm salt water solution with no improvement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest mixing your own sea salt and warm water solution.</li>
            <li>H2Ocean is the absolute best piercing aftercare product.</li>
            <li>its worth your money !!!</li>
            <li>However, a great product when you have to clean a piercing on-the-go.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and handy.</li>
            <li>I started using it the day after I recieved the new hole in my stomach &amp; ever since then it has been perfect.</li>
            <li>it comes in a good amount and is easy to use</li>
            <li>:) reccomend for sure guys!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a use for it! :)</li>
            <li>I can say that it has been 2 months and piercing has healed nicely:)</li>
            <li>Got to love how amazing this is.</li>
            <li>1 quick spray on the piercing and I am good to go.</li>
            <li>I definitely love this product</li>
            <li>Great buy and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>So glad I decided to use this.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>This is much better than the h2O bottle mouth wash I bought from the piercing shop after I got my tongue piercing 6 days ago..</li>
            <li>I got my belly button pierced at a not too reputable place</li>
            <li>I love thia.</li>
            <li>I had to get me some more of this stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff made my cartilage piercing feel so much better.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great deal.</li>
            <li>Better than anything else.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Hopefully my ears heal up okay.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this thing.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>this stuff is magical. :)</li>
            <li>Our piercer recommended this and we are so glad we listened.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely glad I found this.</li>
            <li>recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>Oh well :)</li>
            <li>Not even.. Love it</li>
            <li>It works wonders and I use it more than 6 times a day.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>But it made me feel better to have something beside just &#x27;Water and soup&#x27;</li>
            <li>I have many piercings and had always sworn by Dial soap until I caved and bought H2O.</li>
            <li>BUT IT DRIPS MORE THAN ACTUALLLY SPRAYS</li>
            <li>Used too many times?</li>
            <li>Love it which is why i bought some more for my industrial piercing</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>so I had taken to touching it</li>
            <li>a lot more often then I should have.  </li>
            <li>Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li>Like magic.</li>
            <li>As soon as I started using H2Ocean, my piercing felt a lot better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff works like magic</li>
            <li>&amp; I can already tell a difference in my belly button. :-)</li>
            <li>Purchasing the 4oz can is way more economical.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s done a pretty good job at keeping infection away almost 98% of the time.</li>
            <li>Got nose repierced and purchased the H20 and no nasty bump and the can is easy to put in your purse.</li>
            <li>I love this spray because it&#x27;s great for a quick, gentle, effective clean.</li>
            <li>so I used this to clean &amp; it works!</li>
            <li>You can clean your piercing wherever you are!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After so many years of dealing with piercing infections, I&#x27;m pretty good at knowing when an infection is about to start again and when that happens, I quickly spray this on my piercing to prevent it.</li>
            <li>it feels nice - maybe i&#x27;m just not using it right.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes it so easy to clean any of the crusty discharge off, and keep everything nice and clean.</li>
            <li>My belly piercing looks GORGEUS and has not been infected at all and looks too good to be a new piercing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to apply and dries in seconds.</li>
            <li>I still use for my nose every once in a while just to make sure it&#x27;s kept clean.</li>
            <li>I recieved this very quickly.</li>
            <li>I wanted to apply sea salt soaks to my infection since it is pretty effective</li>
            <li>after any piercing I have ever gotten each one has healed in a healthy and quick manner.</li>
            <li>it came with helpful instructions and it arrived quick :)</li>
            <li>This really works, I love it!</li>
            <li>all it really is, is salt water, so i guess you could try your luck at making your own salt water solution before spending your money on this.</li>
            <li>, ITS A FANTASTIC PRODUCT❤</li>
            <li>This product is also great for just regular ear piercings.</li>
            <li>The product is great but the price is big for the product.</li>
            <li>and I keep it around just in case, but it did such a great healing job</li>
            <li>I went to a cheap piercing place and for cleaning they gave me this.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and effective.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s help healing process go smoothly</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for sensitive fresh piercings.</li>
            <li>and i decided to order the H20 sea salt spray and this really work!!!</li>
            <li>If you have a piercing or an area you need to keep clean without harsh chemicals, this is WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li>so I quickly ordered more- this stuff is just magic &amp; it cleans out my piercings really well ~</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Now i have my nose repierced and am excited to try this on it.</li>
            <li>I liked this product alot, all you do is spray a little on your piercing and your good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic after care product, I had a mild lip piercing infection and it went away three days after I stared spray</li>
            <li>This stuff is awsome, it heals my piercings and keeps them clean.</li>
            <li>I spray it on my piercings 1-2 times a day and then just clean with a q-tip</li>
            <li>so i have it whenever I need to clean it a bit.</li>
            <li>I use this spray to clean my belly button piercing, my medusa (retired), and my ears.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the stuff they gave me just was not keeping my ear clean.</li>
            <li>H2ocean works well to clean and heal ur piercings.</li>
            <li>I used it to clean each of my piercings</li>
            <li>and I still use it to clean my jewelry</li>
            <li>I used the spray consistently for less than a week and it cleared up perfectly.</li>
            <li>My piercer told me I didn&#x27;t need to do anything special with it for cleaning.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a whole lot better than using anything else to clean</li>
            <li>Great, came before I expected it to.</li>
            <li>I just love this spray it really help my belly piercing.</li>
            <li>and you could bring it to school and do a quick spray before you go to class to keep piercing clean if you needed</li>
            <li>i love this product it really works</li>
            <li>I use this spray at least twice a day and my piercing is healing perfectly.</li>
            <li>I can get the full size cheaper from a piecer.</li>
            <li>just make sure you buy it in a larger bottle though, or you will run out QUICK!!</li>
            <li>my belly piercing was in great sharp.</li>
            <li>But other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with this product</li>
            <li>It also arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>and I am good all day long.</li>
            <li>I give this item 3 stars, because it shipped fast and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;H2Ocean is exceptionally easy to use and does its job very well.  </li>
            <li>It kept my piercing very clean and it didn&#x27;t get infected so far!</li>
            <li>I recently got my nipples done and this product works amazing</li>
            <li>I cant honestly tell you if this actually works or not.</li>
            <li>I can say assuredly that this product works wonders and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>This stuff is liquid gold and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Works better than the old saline solution &amp; Q-tip trick.</li>
            <li>WORTH IT TO AVOID INFECTIONS</li>
            <li>All around great product, keeps my piercings clean and reduces irritation and potential infection when they start acting up!</li>
            <li>Can super fast and works!</li>
            <li>i used it for my nose ring and it healed pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>But other than that i really loved it.</li>
            <li>so I bought this offline and it cleared right up.</li>
            <li>They were so right.</li>
            <li>It keeps it so clean and it has a cooling effect to it that feels very soothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for both my ear piercings and it really helps them feel clean.</li>
            <li>I added new piercings to each ear above my gauges and this is really good for cleaning.</li>
            <li>With enthusiasm, she suggested H2Ocean to use several times during the day (and Provon Medicated Lotion Soap, another great aftercare product, once daily while in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was actually really early and it works really well. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it right now to help keep my new rook piercing clean.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how important it is to keep your piercings clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier than making it yourself!</li>
            <li>Within the first couple months of my piercing, it got infected but this helped to heal it.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than enough for me.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy it again for more piercings.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described👌</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and it works miracles !</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Product really works!</li>
            <li>Be aware that this is not the full-size H2Ocean.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy more of this after my current can runs out.!</li>
            <li>had begun to ramp up toward a mild infection at the site of my new rook piercing.</li>
            <li>I use this to clean my 1 year old ear piercing.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It is vital to keep piercing hole clean.</li>
            <li>I was really regretting getting a piercing and thinking that I&#x27;d never be able to sleep on my left ear again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My order came super quick, it came the same day the estimated date they gave me.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to worry about touching a fresh piercing without scrubbing down your hands.</li>
            <li>This worked really great on my nose piercing, I used a ear gun to pierce my nose and have been getting the little bump next to the piercing all the time, once I started using this product I never got it again, I use it twice or three times a day, morning, midday and</li>

            <li>It shipped fairly fast.</li>
            <li>It doesnt really sting, but does.</li>
            <li>This is very convenient if you don&#x27;t want to use q-tips.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t use as much.</li>
            <li>H2ocean has really helped with the redness.</li>
            <li>But then again you don&#x27;t need to spray that much.</li>
            <li>My piercing is healing very well.</li>
            <li>I did spray some on a cotton ball and use it on my face for my acne, it didn&#x27;t seem to help it much</li>
            <li>This worked especially well on my belly button because my piercing was sensitive and I didn&#x27;t want to irritate it all the time with the disinfecting soap when I just wanted to clean quickly.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li>or maybe I used to much?</li>
            <li>Sprayed too much?</li>
            <li>it really helps when my ear is irritated or itchy</li>
            <li>It really helps....</li>
            <li>I went to another very well respected piercing place</li>
            <li>I can sleep on my ear now, and for that I&#x27;m very grateful.</li>
            <li>I will always have a bottle of this stuff handy with multiple kids with constant cuts and scraps !!!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for anyone with piercings, new or old :)</li>
            <li>I bought this after getting my upper cartilage pierced so that I could clean my ear when traveling etc.</li>
            <li>similar product, Simple Care Spray, (which you cannot buy here) is also great, I use that one more now, because it has neem oil in it (which is a anti fungal, anti microbial, anti everything bad pretty much oil) but it doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;Stay sterile\\&quot; design that the H2Ocean does, so I&#x27;m still a huge fan of H2Ocean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came earlier than I expected, and after 2 days of using it my piercing feels soo much better!</li>
            <li>Make sure you still move the ring up and down after you use it so the spray gets the bar as well.</li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone with a new piercing!</li>
            <li>Must have for new piercings!</li>
            <li>I think this is a must if yo have a new piercing!</li>
            <li>VERY SOOTHING ON MY NEW PIERCING.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I bought mine from a different seller on Amazon but its the same H2Ocean spray.</li>
            <li>I bought this after I had my navel pierced--the piercing would occasionally become irritated and sore and I need a quick cleaner.</li>
            <li>I neglected to double-check the oz, and arrived today as a super tiny almost travel size bottle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with piercings.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anybody that has piercing issues.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this before re-piercing and can honestly say if directions on the product can are followed, you will have none to minimum swelling and hardly any pain resulting from piercing.</li>
            <li>I love this product &amp; continue to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never had this much initial success with a piercing.  </li>
            <li>It last a long time and is so important to have!</li>
            <li>I clean my nose ring and belly button ring with this every single day.</li>
            <li>the new piercer suggested this and ended up talking me into buying it.</li>
            <li>and i use it all the time for my new piercings</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any new acne pop up either...</li>
            <li>YOU SHOULD NOT PUT ANYTHING ON A NEW PEIRCING EXCEPT SALT WATER.</li>
            <li>I just started using provon antimicrobial lotion soap twice a day too to avoid any more ugly situations, but honestly this does the job on</li>
            <li>I used to clean it with a tea tree solution but tea tree is very strong on the skin and left my skin very dry and a little darker where the infection used to be.</li>
            <li>but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that I ran out very fast.</li>
            <li>Was easy to use but did not clean area well.</li>
            <li>Definitely get it here because it is so much cheaper!</li>
            <li>It does on the other hand clean the Piercing</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone with a piercing; new or old.</li>
            <li>But what I can tell you, its really small (size as a mini hairspray can) &amp; it came super fast!</li>
            <li>And no mess!</li>
            <li>but you can make the same stuff for cheaper and more of it all you need is a little sea salt and water</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m completely healed.</li>
            <li>I completely could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>My nose piercing, which is 10 years old, gets infected once in a while.</li>
            <li>Completely healed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural as well.</li>
            <li>I asked my daughter, a young woman who has a lot of body piercings, what to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still astounded by how fast the incipient infection disappeared after I began to use H2Ocean several times each day, along with the once-daily Provon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been doing the trick and speeding up the healing process.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so grateful for this product because I can actually function normally with daily activities like getting dressed without having to worry so much about avoiding the new piercing soreness.  </li>
            <li>I just re-pierced my ears recently, the first time was when I was 12 and at the time, I only used alcohol and must have had an allergic reaction to the alcohol or earrings, who knows</li>
            <li>I just recently got an orbital piercing that is pretty traumatic to the cartilage on the upper ear</li>
            <li>That way I can spray it directly on the tongue piercing and no other part of my tongue gets tender.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has any piercings new or old.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>and I have just about all the major piercings there are</li>
            <li>Well my ears feel fine, unless I do something silly like smack myself really hard, and they seem to already be mostly healed!</li>
            <li>I used this on a new piercing and only got a few days worth out of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if its really helping my ears heal faster or if its even really helping them heal.</li>
            <li>At first I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t help much, but it seriously improved my piercing process.</li>
            <li>Sprayed it several times a day to heal it directly on the piercing front &amp; back, then sprayed a bit on a Q-Tip &amp; cleaned around the wound.  </li>
            <li>I pierced my helix and it formed a lump and within 2 weeks the lump went down after consistently applying it with a Q-tip 2-3 times daily.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my (future) septum piercing, but since my other piercing supplies hasn&#x27;t came, I don&#x27;t know really.</li>
            <li>Since I have to rinse after Everything I eat and after smoking I was constantly using it up to 10 times or more a day, which after a while started making the tip of my tongue a little raw and tender.</li>
            <li>I had a infection I used this for less thanks a week in</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> H2Ocean spray is the absolute best product to use for after piercing!</li>
            <li> it surely helps to have good hygiene &amp; cleaning it three times a day is handy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> Really Needed It , Wonderful 😊</li>
            <li> It calms my infection really well and the best part is how convenient it is to use (compared to preparing warm sea salt soaks).</li>
            <li> I cleaned it twice a day with warm salt water solution with no improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest mixing your own sea salt and warm water solution.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is the absolute best piercing aftercare product.</li>
            <li> its worth your money !!!</li>
            <li> However, a great product when you have to clean a piercing on-the-go.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and handy.</li>
            <li> I started using it the day after I recieved the new hole in my stomach &amp; ever since then it has been perfect.</li>
            <li> it comes in a good amount and is easy to use</li>
            <li> :) reccomend for sure guys!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a use for it! :)</li>
            <li> I can say that it has been 2 months and piercing has healed nicely:)</li>
            <li> Got to love how amazing this is.</li>
            <li> 1 quick spray on the piercing and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> I definitely love this product</li>
            <li> Great buy and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> So glad I decided to use this.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> This is much better than the h2O bottle mouth wash I bought from the piercing shop after I got my tongue piercing 6 days ago..</li>
            <li> I got my belly button pierced at a not too reputable place</li>
            <li> I love thia.</li>
            <li> I had to get me some more of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my cartilage piercing feel so much better.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great deal.</li>
            <li> Better than anything else.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Hopefully my ears heal up okay.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this thing.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> this stuff is magical. :)</li>
            <li> Our piercer recommended this and we are so glad we listened.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely glad I found this.</li>
            <li> recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> Oh well :)</li>
            <li> Not even.. Love it</li>
            <li> It works wonders and I use it more than 6 times a day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> But it made me feel better to have something beside just &#x27;Water and soup&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have many piercings and had always sworn by Dial soap until I caved and bought H2O.</li>
            <li> BUT IT DRIPS MORE THAN ACTUALLLY SPRAYS</li>
            <li> Used too many times?</li>
            <li> Love it which is why i bought some more for my industrial piercing</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> so I had taken to touching it</li>
            <li> a lot more often then I should have.  </li>
            <li> Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li> Like magic.</li>
            <li> As soon as I started using H2Ocean, my piercing felt a lot better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff works like magic</li>
            <li> &amp; I can already tell a difference in my belly button. :-)</li>
            <li> Purchasing the 4oz can is way more economical.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s done a pretty good job at keeping infection away almost 98% of the time.</li>
            <li> Got nose repierced and purchased the H20 and no nasty bump and the can is easy to put in your purse.</li>
            <li> I love this spray because it&#x27;s great for a quick, gentle, effective clean.</li>
            <li> so I used this to clean &amp; it works!</li>
            <li> You can clean your piercing wherever you are!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After so many years of dealing with piercing infections, I&#x27;m pretty good at knowing when an infection is about to start again and when that happens, I quickly spray this on my piercing to prevent it.</li>
            <li> it feels nice - maybe i&#x27;m just not using it right.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes it so easy to clean any of the crusty discharge off, and keep everything nice and clean.</li>
            <li> My belly piercing looks GORGEUS and has not been infected at all and looks too good to be a new piercing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to apply and dries in seconds.</li>
            <li> I still use for my nose every once in a while just to make sure it&#x27;s kept clean.</li>
            <li> I recieved this very quickly.</li>
            <li> I wanted to apply sea salt soaks to my infection since it is pretty effective</li>
            <li> after any piercing I have ever gotten each one has healed in a healthy and quick manner.</li>
            <li> it came with helpful instructions and it arrived quick :)</li>
            <li> This really works, I love it!</li>
            <li> all it really is, is salt water, so i guess you could try your luck at making your own salt water solution before spending your money on this.</li>
            <li> , ITS A FANTASTIC PRODUCT❤</li>
            <li> This product is also great for just regular ear piercings.</li>
            <li> The product is great but the price is big for the product.</li>
            <li> and I keep it around just in case, but it did such a great healing job</li>
            <li> I went to a cheap piercing place and for cleaning they gave me this.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and effective.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s help healing process go smoothly</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for sensitive fresh piercings.</li>
            <li> and i decided to order the H20 sea salt spray and this really work!!!</li>
            <li> If you have a piercing or an area you need to keep clean without harsh chemicals, this is WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li> so I quickly ordered more- this stuff is just magic &amp; it cleans out my piercings really well ~</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Now i have my nose repierced and am excited to try this on it.</li>
            <li> I liked this product alot, all you do is spray a little on your piercing and your good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic after care product, I had a mild lip piercing infection and it went away three days after I stared spray</li>
            <li> This stuff is awsome, it heals my piercings and keeps them clean.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my piercings 1-2 times a day and then just clean with a q-tip</li>
            <li> so i have it whenever I need to clean it a bit.</li>
            <li> I use this spray to clean my belly button piercing, my medusa (retired), and my ears.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the stuff they gave me just was not keeping my ear clean.</li>
            <li> H2ocean works well to clean and heal ur piercings.</li>
            <li> I used it to clean each of my piercings</li>
            <li> and I still use it to clean my jewelry</li>
            <li> I used the spray consistently for less than a week and it cleared up perfectly.</li>
            <li> My piercer told me I didn&#x27;t need to do anything special with it for cleaning.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a whole lot better than using anything else to clean</li>
            <li> Great, came before I expected it to.</li>
            <li> I just love this spray it really help my belly piercing.</li>
            <li> and you could bring it to school and do a quick spray before you go to class to keep piercing clean if you needed</li>
            <li> i love this product it really works</li>
            <li> I use this spray at least twice a day and my piercing is healing perfectly.</li>
            <li> I can get the full size cheaper from a piecer.</li>
            <li> just make sure you buy it in a larger bottle though, or you will run out QUICK!!</li>
            <li> my belly piercing was in great sharp.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with this product</li>
            <li> It also arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> and I am good all day long.</li>
            <li> I give this item 3 stars, because it shipped fast and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;H2Ocean is exceptionally easy to use and does its job very well.  </li>
            <li> It kept my piercing very clean and it didn&#x27;t get infected so far!</li>
            <li> I recently got my nipples done and this product works amazing</li>
            <li> I cant honestly tell you if this actually works or not.</li>
            <li> I can say assuredly that this product works wonders and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is liquid gold and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Works better than the old saline solution &amp; Q-tip trick.</li>
            <li> WORTH IT TO AVOID INFECTIONS</li>
            <li> All around great product, keeps my piercings clean and reduces irritation and potential infection when they start acting up!</li>
            <li> Can super fast and works!</li>
            <li> i used it for my nose ring and it healed pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> But other than that i really loved it.</li>
            <li> so I bought this offline and it cleared right up.</li>
            <li> They were so right.</li>
            <li> It keeps it so clean and it has a cooling effect to it that feels very soothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for both my ear piercings and it really helps them feel clean.</li>
            <li> I added new piercings to each ear above my gauges and this is really good for cleaning.</li>
            <li> With enthusiasm, she suggested H2Ocean to use several times during the day (and Provon Medicated Lotion Soap, another great aftercare product, once daily while in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was actually really early and it works really well. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it right now to help keep my new rook piercing clean.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how important it is to keep your piercings clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier than making it yourself!</li>
            <li> Within the first couple months of my piercing, it got infected but this helped to heal it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than enough for me.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy it again for more piercings.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described👌</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and it works miracles !</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Product really works!</li>
            <li> Be aware that this is not the full-size H2Ocean.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy more of this after my current can runs out.!</li>
            <li> had begun to ramp up toward a mild infection at the site of my new rook piercing.</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my 1 year old ear piercing.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It is vital to keep piercing hole clean.</li>
            <li> I was really regretting getting a piercing and thinking that I&#x27;d never be able to sleep on my left ear again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My order came super quick, it came the same day the estimated date they gave me.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to worry about touching a fresh piercing without scrubbing down your hands.</li>
            <li> This worked really great on my nose piercing, I used a ear gun to pierce my nose and have been getting the little bump next to the piercing all the time, once I started using this product I never got it again, I use it twice or three times a day, morning, midday and</li>
            <li> it really does help any piercing you have heal</li>
            <li> piercing.i really really recommend using this product</li>
            <li> and this really helped the process.</li>
            <li> I used it on my navel piercing and it really helped it heal.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This can be used on a new/old piercing, its so gentle, you use it 3 to 6 times a day...</li>
            <li> Also cleans very well.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier to use that mixing sea salt and water at home.</li>
            <li> It drips so much</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m really dissapoonted</li>
            <li> It sprays too fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my nose pierced for almost a year and this cleaner has really helped.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s really all I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It shipped fairly fast.</li>
            <li> It doesnt really sting, but does.</li>
            <li> This is very convenient if you don&#x27;t want to use q-tips.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t use as much.</li>
            <li> H2ocean has really helped with the redness.</li>
            <li> But then again you don&#x27;t need to spray that much.</li>
            <li> My piercing is healing very well.</li>
            <li> I did spray some on a cotton ball and use it on my face for my acne, it didn&#x27;t seem to help it much</li>
            <li> This worked especially well on my belly button because my piercing was sensitive and I didn&#x27;t want to irritate it all the time with the disinfecting soap when I just wanted to clean quickly.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> or maybe I used to much?</li>
            <li> Sprayed too much?</li>
            <li> it really helps when my ear is irritated or itchy</li>
            <li> It really helps....</li>
            <li> I went to another very well respected piercing place</li>
            <li> I can sleep on my ear now, and for that I&#x27;m very grateful.</li>
            <li> I will always have a bottle of this stuff handy with multiple kids with constant cuts and scraps !!!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for anyone with piercings, new or old :)</li>
            <li> I bought this after getting my upper cartilage pierced so that I could clean my ear when traveling etc.</li>
            <li> similar product, Simple Care Spray, (which you cannot buy here) is also great, I use that one more now, because it has neem oil in it (which is a anti fungal, anti microbial, anti everything bad pretty much oil) but it doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;Stay sterile\\&quot; design that the H2Ocean does, so I&#x27;m still a huge fan of H2Ocean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came earlier than I expected, and after 2 days of using it my piercing feels soo much better!</li>
            <li> Make sure you still move the ring up and down after you use it so the spray gets the bar as well.</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone with a new piercing!</li>
            <li> Must have for new piercings!</li>
            <li> I think this is a must if yo have a new piercing!</li>
            <li> VERY SOOTHING ON MY NEW PIERCING.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, I bought mine from a different seller on Amazon but its the same H2Ocean spray.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I had my navel pierced--the piercing would occasionally become irritated and sore and I need a quick cleaner.</li>
            <li> I neglected to double-check the oz, and arrived today as a super tiny almost travel size bottle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with piercings.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anybody that has piercing issues.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this before re-piercing and can honestly say if directions on the product can are followed, you will have none to minimum swelling and hardly any pain resulting from piercing.</li>
            <li> I love this product &amp; continue to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had this much initial success with a piercing.  </li>
            <li> It last a long time and is so important to have!</li>
            <li> I clean my nose ring and belly button ring with this every single day.</li>
            <li> the new piercer suggested this and ended up talking me into buying it.</li>
            <li> and i use it all the time for my new piercings</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any new acne pop up either...</li>
            <li> YOU SHOULD NOT PUT ANYTHING ON A NEW PEIRCING EXCEPT SALT WATER.</li>
            <li> I just started using provon antimicrobial lotion soap twice a day too to avoid any more ugly situations, but honestly this does the job on</li>
            <li> I used to clean it with a tea tree solution but tea tree is very strong on the skin and left my skin very dry and a little darker where the infection used to be.</li>
            <li> but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that I ran out very fast.</li>
            <li> Was easy to use but did not clean area well.</li>
            <li> Definitely get it here because it is so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> It does on the other hand clean the Piercing</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with a piercing; new or old.</li>
            <li> But what I can tell you, its really small (size as a mini hairspray can) &amp; it came super fast!</li>
            <li> And no mess!</li>
            <li> but you can make the same stuff for cheaper and more of it all you need is a little sea salt and water</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m completely healed.</li>
            <li> I completely could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> My nose piercing, which is 10 years old, gets infected once in a while.</li>
            <li> Completely healed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural as well.</li>
            <li> I asked my daughter, a young woman who has a lot of body piercings, what to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still astounded by how fast the incipient infection disappeared after I began to use H2Ocean several times each day, along with the once-daily Provon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been doing the trick and speeding up the healing process.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so grateful for this product because I can actually function normally with daily activities like getting dressed without having to worry so much about avoiding the new piercing soreness.  </li>
            <li> I just re-pierced my ears recently, the first time was when I was 12 and at the time, I only used alcohol and must have had an allergic reaction to the alcohol or earrings, who knows</li>
            <li> I just recently got an orbital piercing that is pretty traumatic to the cartilage on the upper ear</li>
            <li> That way I can spray it directly on the tongue piercing and no other part of my tongue gets tender.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has any piercings new or old.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> and I have just about all the major piercings there are</li>
            <li> Well my ears feel fine, unless I do something silly like smack myself really hard, and they seem to already be mostly healed!</li>
            <li> I used this on a new piercing and only got a few days worth out of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its really helping my ears heal faster or if its even really helping them heal.</li>
            <li> At first I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t help much, but it seriously improved my piercing process.</li>
            <li> Sprayed it several times a day to heal it directly on the piercing front &amp; back, then sprayed a bit on a Q-Tip &amp; cleaned around the wound.  </li>
            <li> I pierced my helix and it formed a lump and within 2 weeks the lump went down after consistently applying it with a Q-tip 2-3 times daily.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my (future) septum piercing, but since my other piercing supplies hasn&#x27;t came, I don&#x27;t know really.</li>
            <li> Since I have to rinse after Everything I eat and after smoking I was constantly using it up to 10 times or more a day, which after a while started making the tip of my tongue a little raw and tender.</li>
            <li> I had a infection I used this for less thanks a week in</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you have a fresh piercing, buy this product....</li>
            <li> I regret even spending so much money for a small quantity, that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I got my nose stretched back to an 18g a couple days ago and with using this product it has helped with the healing process and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> But It won&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> and this is the only product that I consistently use, trust, and would seriously recommend.</li>
            <li> I found it on amazon for much cheaper and although I was a bit worried it would be fake, it&#x27;s not, it works very well</li>
            <li> So far this has helped me a lot with my stretched ears, the only problem i had was that i had trouble with the can itself</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a bigger can</li>
            <li> Tea tree was helping a tiny bit but not really.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smaller than i expected</li>
            <li> when i received it, it was way smaller than i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> And really cuts down on the dried seepage.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical don&#x27;t be because I was and this stuff really does work and offers immediate relief.</li>
            <li> But I got a triple forward helix at least a couple months ago, and I was told that they take a very long time to heal completely and they hurt for a while!</li>
            <li> And i can use less of the spray so it will last longer than the bottle salt water solution did.</li>
            <li> Now, a month and a half later, it has virtually no pain and sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I suggest spraying it into a small container (such as a medicine cup) and using an eye dropper to squirt it on the specific area you need it.</li>
            <li> I would wake up in the morning and spray a little on them and do the same thing at night.</li>
            <li> Product works well to fight infection and for such a small size it has lasted me a long time two weeks of 2-3 times a day use and now once weekly.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be it shouldve been a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s really no indication if its working or not.</li>
            <li> Although I didnt pay attention to the size and spent 9.99 on a 1.5 oz.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on this stuff and my gross dried up bloodied keloid was gone in 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> You guys literally sold me an almost empty bottle.</li>
            <li> but it can be messy and requires a bit of time to prepare the solution (and I have to do several soaks a day to fight the infection).</li>
            <li> A few days before my order came in the area around my nose ring i got a month ago started to get red and started to create a bump but</li>
            <li> After two sprays the can was empty.</li>
            <li> and I have that healing itch that I hate and love at the same time.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well...</li>
            <li> Only problem is how small the bottle is for the price.</li>
            <li> Its small enough that I can throw it in my purse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty skeptical about stuff on the internet, but THIS STUFF WORKS.</li>
            <li> , when I take off my earring it usually gets red for a while</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small it actually was til I got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 3 years after I got a piercing on the back of my shoulder.</li>
            <li> (I shouldn&#x27;t have been touching it at all with dirty hands!)</li>
            <li> and I use it often, especially when I am too lazy to make a sea salt soak.</li>
            <li> Although it has way less solution than expected.</li>
            <li> people say that you can use \\&quot;wound wash\\&quot; (which is a saline spray that costs less then a dollar usually) and its the same</li>
            <li> perhaps i&#x27;m using it wrong, but i don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing much for my cartilage piercings.</li>
            <li> This stuff just made my piercings dry and made them feel like they actually were getting worse and not healing at all.</li>
            <li> I was bending down picking up stuff nd</li>
            <li> Also H2Ocean has Lysozomes inside, which eat the bad bacteria and clean the wound.  </li>
            <li> but that is not true.  </li>
            <li> I wish it sprayed a little less</li>
            <li> I normally used alcohol or salve but not only does this product explain why that&#x27;s a bad idea, it tells you why h20cean works to help heal.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe theres just too little that it comes with.</li>
            <li> (I was cheap and stupid</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with piercings healing</li>
            <li> Used this for a few days</li>
            <li> I am going to continue to use this everyday</li>
            <li> Waste of my time and money forsure</li>
            <li> i use it everyday 3-6 times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Just one spritz a few times a day keeps the redness away</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few days now</li>
            <li> It was really stiff and wouldn&#x27;t spray anything</li>
            <li> 1.5 OZ is a little small for the price, but it makes life easier.</li>
            <li> I used this product at least three times a day, and in less than a week, my infection has gone away and there is no pain.</li>
            <li> I started using it when I got my tragus pierced because the sea salt soaks were a little hard to squeeze into my schedule.</li>
            <li> Tastes awful, but definitely better for you.</li>
            <li> Bottle is small, seems like I overpayed for something so small</li>
            <li> too small for the price</li>
            <li> but it was actually small.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if mine was made wrong, but when I pulled the cap off there was only a small thing plastic thing.  </li>
            <li> May be because it&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> I was going to buy it from h2ocean&#x27;s website but saw it was like $12 dollars with $5 shipping which is way to expensive for a tiny bottle of salt water.</li>
            <li> Which hurt like hell, but with this stuff, no more pain....</li>
            <li> I had my nose pierced before, and had to remove it a year later due to a bad metal reaction.</li>
            <li> The don&#x27;t hurt, itch, or even hardly have any discharge at all.</li>
            <li> i got my belly button pierced and this product is so hard to find in stores in my area</li>
            <li> so get like the 4oz at least.</li>
            <li> It did get here one day late from what my estimated shipping date was</li>
            <li> Slowly</li>
            <li> That seemed a little weird to me, so I did some reading online and came across this product.</li>
            <li> Horribly late and very small!</li>
            <li> I popped it without knowing not to &amp; had to avoid the public for a few days because it looked horrible.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because I recently got my industrial pierced for my birthday, needless to say it&#x27;s a painful healing process.</li>
            <li> Was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> and I have been using this approximately 6 times a day</li>
            <li> I used this spray after my nose piercing was irritating me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this annoying ugly bump by my new nose piercing and nothing would make it go away, not even all the sea salt soaks.</li>
            <li> NEEDLESS TO SAY</li>
            <li> like my nose during cold season.</li>
            <li> ( A horrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> i had bad sores and it took care of them in 5-6 days</li>
            <li> I promote this product like crazy to all my friends who get piercings whether it&#x27;s nose, lip, ears, belly button, etc!</li>
            <li> Sigh :(</li>
            <li> (Yeah, I know it was stupid.)</li>
            <li> I just received 3 4oz cans in the mail today because I hate running out.</li>
            <li> I got my nose pierced and got the nasty bump and was advised by my piercer to remove it.</li>
            <li> I had a nasty bump on my belly piercing</li>
            <li> Terrible it made my ears swell up.</li>
            <li> it has insanely reduced the amount of puss the comes out</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have been using it since I got my helix pierced, and I have never had any pain or soreness! This is a great product and I won&#x27;t use anything else for my piercings!</li>
            <li> Great for piercing care!</li>
            <li> I definitely love this product it really does help any piercing you have heal and I have just about all the major piercings there are and this is the only product that I consistently use, trust, and would seriously recommend. Great buy and shipping was fast. Excellent Seller.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!! I got my nose pierced and got the nasty bump and was advised by my piercer to remove it. Got nose repierced and purchased the H20 and no nasty bump and the can is easy to put in your purse. I used several times a day by spraying on a q-tip and applying to the piecing. I can say that it has been 2 months and piercing has healed nicely:)</li>
            <li> This product works really good it&#x27;s a whole lot better than using anything else to clean piercing.i really really recommend using this product</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use for aftercare of my piercings! It&#x27;s so much easier than making it yourself! Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> This was a great product! It kept my piercing very clean and it didn&#x27;t get infected so far! So glad I decided to use this.</li>
            <li> Thank you! I love you products!</li>
            <li> use it for all of my piercings and always keep some on hand for if one gets a bit fincky. like my nose during cold season.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean spray is the absolute best product to use for after piercing! I just re-pierced my ears recently, the first time was when I was 12 and at the time, I only used alcohol and must have had an allergic reaction to the alcohol or earrings, who knows but I never wore earrings again. I purchased this before re-piercing and can honestly say if directions on the product can are followed, you will have none to minimum swelling and hardly any pain resulting from piercing.</li>
            <li> works amazing for navel piercings so glad I got it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the solution a few times and it feels like it&#x27;s helping with the healing process very well.</li>
            <li> I cant honestly tell you if this actually works or not. you spray it on and you don&#x27;t feel anything, not that you have to but there&#x27;s really no indication if its working or not. all it really is, is salt water, so i guess you could try your luck at making your own salt water solution before spending your money on this.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well...I recommend to anyone with a new piercing!</li>
            <li> If you have a piercing.. Use H2Ocean! I&#x27;ve always had trouble with piercings healing and this really helped the process. It&#x27;s also easy to apply and dries in seconds. A+ product.</li>
            <li> I regularly use this for everything in the house from cuts and scrapes, sore throats, canker sores, piercing care, and for healing stretches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people say that you can use \\&quot;wound wash\\&quot; (which is a saline spray that costs less then a dollar usually) and its the same but that is not true.  This is made with sea salt, which has dozens of micro-nutrients that your body needs but often does not get, that allow wounds to heal faster.  Also H2Ocean has Lysozomes inside, which eat the bad bacteria and clean the wound.  The sea water draws out lymph and wound secretions.  This stuff is great, I really love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A similar product, Simple Care Spray, (which you cannot buy here) is also great, I use that one more now, because it has neem oil in it (which is a anti fungal, anti microbial, anti everything bad pretty much oil) but it doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;Stay sterile\\&quot; design that the H2Ocean does, so I&#x27;m still a huge fan of H2Ocean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a great product!  you can get it for cheaper on [...] though, and those people are awesome.</li>
            <li> I TOTALLY RECOMMEND! I had my belly pierced twice &amp; they both rejected after I used sea salt and water for 6 months (each time). when I finally got the balls to go get it done again the new piercer suggested this and ended up talking me into buying it. I started using it the day after I recieved the new hole in my stomach &amp; ever since then it has been perfect. it has never gotten infected and has not rejected at all. it surely helps to have good hygiene &amp; cleaning it three times a day is handy. this can go with you whenever, whenever and it is handless. just spray and go. I love this product &amp; continue to use it everyday. NEEDLESS TO SAY, ITS A FANTASTIC PRODUCT❤️</li>
            <li> This stuff is like a miracle spray. Not just for piercings and tattoos etc....I aoeay this on cuts and sores etc and they heal in no time at all. I will always have a bottle of this stuff handy with multiple kids with constant cuts and scraps !!!</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a bigger can</li>
            <li> amazing product, works well</li>
            <li> Very good product! Piercing nose piercing healed perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love this spray for my piercings! Although I didnt pay attention to the size and spent 9.99 on a 1.5 oz. I can get the bigger one for that price. That was my error for not paying attention. Overall arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I used it on my navel piercing and it really helped it heal. I would recommend it to anyone with a piercing; new or old.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start using this until almost two weeks after I got my tonuge pierced, but when I changed my tongue and used this every day to help the remainder of my healing process it worked wonders. Tastes awful, but definitely better for you.</li>
            <li> Bottle is small, seems like I overpayed for something so small</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! This is much better than the h2O bottle mouth wash I bought from the piercing shop after I got my tongue piercing 6 days ago.. Since I have to rinse after Everything I eat and after smoking I was constantly using it up to 10 times or more a day, which after a while started making the tip of my tongue a little raw and tender. But I love this spray! That way I can spray it directly on the tongue piercing and no other part of my tongue gets tender. This is especially handy when I am at work. Once i get through eating on my break. 1 quick spray on the piercing and I am good to go. I wont have to keep running into the restroom to gargle and spit. And no mess! (Since carrying around the bottle all day it tended to drip) but I can just pop the cap on this and put it back in my purse. And i can use less of the spray so it will last longer than the bottle salt water solution did. Love Love Love this!!!! I will certainly buy more of this after my current can runs out.! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I bought it after I got my industrial pierced July 8th.  The product is amazing. It got rid of all swelling, pain, irritation, and sensitivity. Now, a month and a half later, it has virtually no pain and sensitivity.  I can say assuredly that this product works wonders and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I bought mine from a different seller on Amazon but its the same H2Ocean spray. I have my industrial pierced, I had it pierced about a year ago, this stuff worked wonders!!! My industrial never got infected! I still have my piercing today, and I love my piercing, and I have God and this stuff to thank for that!!! This can be used on a new/old piercing, its so gentle, you use it 3 to 6 times a day...</li>
            <li> too small for the price</li>
            <li> I bought this for my belly piercing. At first I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t help much, but it seriously improved my piercing process. I highly recommend it to anyone with piercings.</li>
            <li> Great, came before I expected it to.</li>
            <li> I just love this spray it really help my belly piercing.I had a infection I used this for less thanks a week in my belly piercing was in great sharp.I will recommend this product to any one with piercing. I will buy again</li>
            <li> Came in a week! Also cleans very well. Only problem is how small the bottle is for the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best spray to use when you first get a piercing. I got my belly button pierced at a not too reputable place but I bought this and used it religiously and it never got infected. I&#x27;ve had it for a year already and its perfect. I had lots of friends that got their&#x27;s done and it got infected but mine never did. So buy this if you plan on getting a piercing done. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I thought the bottle was going to be bigger but it was actually small.</li>
            <li> I love thia. I recently got my nose and mylip peirced.  This stuff works great and i will always keep some on hand</li>
            <li> I had to get me some more of this stuff. Its amazing. For my double belly ring and industrial! Got to love how amazing this is. all in a can</li>
            <li> This is a must have.  After about a month after my piercing I was having issues with a developing keloid which I thought was a pimple until I did research.  I popped it without knowing not to &amp; had to avoid the public for a few days because it looked horrible.  Tea tree was helping a tiny bit but not really.  I read reviews on this stuff and my gross dried up bloodied keloid was gone in 24 hours.  Sprayed it several times a day to heal it directly on the piercing front &amp; back, then sprayed a bit on a Q-Tip &amp; cleaned around the wound.  Used this for a few days &amp; I&#x27;m completely healed. I just started using provon antimicrobial lotion soap twice a day too to avoid any more ugly situations, but honestly this does the job on it&#x27;s own.  If you have a nose piercing you need this believe me, I didn&#x27;t expect to get a keloid or even know what one was, avoid the process all together by using this! You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I got my belly button pierced about a month ago. My piercer told me I didn&#x27;t need to do anything special with it for cleaning. That seemed a little weird to me, so I did some reading online and came across this product. I had been playing with my belly ring and moving it around and everything you shouldn&#x27;t do. It then of course became infected. I used this product at least three times a day, and in less than a week, my infection has gone away and there is no pain. I am going to continue to use this everyday and I cannot wait to see how well it works. It is truly amazing! I definitely recommend this product for anyone with piercings, new or old :)</li>
            <li> This is so much easier to use that mixing sea salt and water at home.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT for piercings... just make sure you buy it in a larger bottle though, or you will run out QUICK!!</li>
            <li> This stuff made my cartilage piercing feel so much better. I agree with the others that it does drip a lot when you spray it. I suggest spraying it into a small container (such as a medicine cup) and using an eye dropper to squirt it on the specific area you need it.</li>
            <li> I got my belly button done and have been using this product for awhile. It works great at controlling discomfort or infections... Must have for new piercings!</li>
            <li> You guys literally sold me an almost empty bottle. It drips so much &amp; I&#x27;m really dissapoonted, I feel like I waisted my money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if mine was made wrong, but when I pulled the cap off there was only a small thing plastic thing.  It was really stiff and wouldn&#x27;t spray anything but I can see there&#x27;s a hole on the very top.  I feel like I was not given a nozzle.</li>
            <li> Love this product! after any piercing I have ever gotten each one has healed in a healthy and quick manner. Great for treating cuts as well!</li>
            <li> It sprays too fast. I have a feeling I&#x27;m going to run out soon because of it /:</li>
            <li> Good product. Thanks for a great deal.</li>
            <li> Awesome , feels great ! Thank you</li>
            <li> Was broken when I received it. Waste of my time and money forsure</li>
            <li> My bottle did not work and wouldn&#x27;t even spray. I regret even spending so much money for a small quantity, that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I had a nasty bump on my belly piercing and i didnt want to take the belly ring out so i ordered this online and the bump went away and i haven&#x27;t had any problems since with my belly piercing. I highly recommend this for anybody that has piercing issues. its worth your money !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my nose pierced for almost a year and this cleaner has really helped. Within the first couple months of my piercing, it got infected but this helped to heal it. I still use for my nose every once in a while just to make sure it&#x27;s kept clean. This product is also great for just regular ear piercings. I added new piercings to each ear above my gauges and this is really good for cleaning. I love it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The best piercing spray/anything you can use to heal! My belly piercing looks GORGEUS and has not been infected at all and looks too good to be a new piercing! Looks like its already been healed!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I learned about it from YouTube and am really happy I bought it. I have a belly piercing and it looks like it&#x27;s getting infected so I bought this offline and it cleared right up. Make sure you still move the ring up and down after you use it so the spray gets the bar as well. And check the fl oz before you buy. The bottle is really tiny so get like the 4oz at least. Good luck.!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my (future) septum piercing, but since my other piercing supplies hasn&#x27;t came, I don&#x27;t know really. But what I can tell you, its really small (size as a mini hairspray can) &amp; it came super fast!</li>
            <li> Works great. Used it before</li>
            <li> Just what I needed! Works great.</li>
            <li> My order came super quick, it came the same day the estimated date they gave me. It&#x27;s a fantastic after care product, I had a mild lip piercing infection and it went away three days after I stared spray the H2ocean.</li>
            <li> Best!  Better than anything else.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I just recently got an orbital piercing that is pretty traumatic to the cartilage on the upper ear and I have been using this approximately 6 times a day and I&#x27;ve never had this much initial success with a piercing.  I normally used alcohol or salve but not only does this product explain why that&#x27;s a bad idea, it tells you why h20cean works to help heal.  The next day after I got my piercing and started using this on my ear I completely could tell a difference.  There wasn&#x27;t any tell tale throbbing in the ear that was a initial sign of infection and I&#x27;m so grateful for this product because I can actually function normally with daily activities like getting dressed without having to worry so much about avoiding the new piercing soreness.  If you&#x27;re skeptical don&#x27;t be because I was and this stuff really does work and offers immediate relief.</li>
            <li> Really Needed It , Wonderful 😊</li>
            <li> I loved this for my belly piercing! I would rate it 5 stars if the bottle was a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> This stuff just made my piercings dry and made them feel like they actually were getting worse and not healing at all. Also the spray ran out in about 1 1/2 weeks. I wouldnt recommend it.</li>
            <li> Terrible it made my ears swell up. I would not recommend anyone to buy this product. I bought some ear solution from Claires and had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than I expected, and after 2 days of using it my piercing feels soo much better!</li>
            <li> I give this item 3 stars, because it shipped fast and is easy to use. I&#x27;m not sure if its really helping my ears heal faster or if its even really helping them heal. It does on the other hand clean the Piercing okay and that&#x27;s really all I was looking for. Hopefully my ears heal up okay.</li>
            <li> My nose piercing, which is 10 years old, gets infected once in a while. I used to clean it with a tea tree solution but tea tree is very strong on the skin and left my skin very dry and a little darker where the infection used to be. I wanted to apply sea salt soaks to my infection since it is pretty effective but it can be messy and requires a bit of time to prepare the solution (and I have to do several soaks a day to fight the infection). I found this spray on amazon and I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now (on my second bottle now). It calms my infection really well and the best part is how convenient it is to use (compared to preparing warm sea salt soaks). I use it about 3 times a day when I have a piercing infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After so many years of dealing with piercing infections, I&#x27;m pretty good at knowing when an infection is about to start again and when that happens, I quickly spray this on my piercing to prevent it. It&#x27;s done a pretty good job at keeping infection away almost 98% of the time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awsome, it heals my piercings and keeps them clean.</li>
            <li> It did get here one day late from what my estimated shipping date was but one day isn&#x27;t anything ! So I pierced my bellybutton yesterday nd I sprayed this and I didn&#x27;t have any pain at all nd I was bending down picking up stuff nd no after pain so I&#x27;m loving this product !</li>
            <li> Just got it and it&#x27;s very good and makes my nose piercing feel better!</li>
            <li> Can super fast and works!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i wanted. I recieved this very quickly. and i use it all the time for my new piercings</li>
            <li> Gets rid of smells from piercings great! Non oily. Love it. I recommend definitely for nose or ear piercings. My boyfriend loves it</li>
            <li> This is a MUST HAVE product for anyone win piercing. Oral or facial this bottle can do anything. I spray it on my piercings 1-2 times a day and then just clean with a q-tip and I&#x27;m set for the day. Perfect for any piercing.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you have a fresh piercing, buy this product....&lt;br /&gt;I bought it after my sister told me about it. She is a walking pin cushion with over 20 piercings. Her piercer recommends this stuff and so does she. They were so right. I got 2nd and 3rd hole done in my ears 2 weeks ago, I ordered this stuff shortly after and used it for a week. My ears are almost totally healed. The don&#x27;t hurt, itch, or even hardly have any discharge at all. This stuff makes it so easy to clean any of the crusty discharge off, and keep everything nice and clean. I would wake up in the morning and spray a little on them and do the same thing at night. Now I just do it when I get up in the morning to get the crust off and I am good all day long. I ca rotate m rings no problem and I have that healing itch that I hate and love at the same time. Just buy this stuff and use it like it says to...it&#x27;s perfect....</li>
            <li> My piercing was taking a year to heal! But then I found this, and in combination with Dr. Piercing&#x27;s Aftercare swabs, my piercing healed within a couple of weeks. Completely healed.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and worked really well for me. Great for canker sores too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! I&#x27;ve had this annoying ugly bump by my new nose piercing and nothing would make it go away, not even all the sea salt soaks. Just a couple dabs of this in the last 2 days and the bump is gone!</li>
            <li> Great product, you get what you buy. Although it has way less solution than expected. However, a great product when you have to clean a piercing on-the-go.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even receive the aftercare spray, I just got a bottle of Poo-Pourri &amp;#62;:( A horrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great after piercing spray. I had my nose pierced before, and had to remove it a year later due to a bad metal reaction. Now i have my nose repierced and am excited to try this on it. Its small enough that I can throw it in my purse so i have it whenever I need to clean it a bit.</li>
            <li> It was leaking in the package but works wonders!</li>
            <li> I really love this thing. I used it befor back in&lt;br /&gt;2009. this time i wanted to buy it in amazon. when I order it I was told it was gona arrive on july 6, well...I received it on june 28,2012. it took 2 days to get to me, how awesome is that.</li>
            <li> Recommend this to everyone who has a piercing. Draws any impurities out. I bought this at the tattoo shop I did my piercing and when I ran out I bought a bottle here. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love this. It came in 3 days before it was suppose to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty skeptical about stuff on the internet, but THIS STUFF WORKS. I recently got my tragus pierced and H2Ocean does wonders for it. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Product works well to fight infection and for such a small size it has lasted me a long time two weeks of 2-3 times a day use and now once weekly.</li>
            <li> This worked really great on my nose piercing, I used a ear gun to pierce my nose and have been getting the little bump next to the piercing all the time, once I started using this product I never got it again, I use it twice or three times a day, morning, midday and just before i SLEEP, it&#x27;s really great and I will buy again</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smaller than i expected</li>
            <li> i got my belly button pierced and this product is so hard to find in stores in my area so i purchased it online. it came with helpful instructions and it arrived quick :)</li>
            <li> the item worked great for my piercing, but after 3 days, the item stopped working with my piercing. So my ear began to hurt and itch.</li>
            <li> I clean my nose ring and belly button ring with this every single day. It keeps it so clean and it has a cooling effect to it that feels very soothing. I would recommend this to anyone with a body piercing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used H2Ocean and will continue for the life of my dermal piercing. This stuff is liquid gold and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for both my ear piercings and it really helps them feel clean. I tried seasalt, and that didn&#x27;t cut it- this stuff is magical. :)</li>
            <li> Totally awesome product. Cleans everything on and around piercing.</li>
            <li> Our piercer recommended this and we are so glad we listened. This has sped up the healing process and even works on boils and skin sores. It&#x27;s all natural as well. If you have a piercing or an area you need to keep clean without harsh chemicals, this is WONDERFUL. Highly recommend. I recently pierced my nose and I&#x27;m going to keep a bottle of this around for continued cleaning.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely glad I found this. I use this to clean my 1 year old ear piercing.&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I take off my earring it usually gets red for a while but when I spray this&lt;br /&gt;to my ear it soothes it and the redness goes away very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> just had gotten my bellybutton done last month and i decided to order the H20 sea salt spray and this really work!!! i just received me 2nd can</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the spray for a couple days now but it works great. It shipped fairly fast. My only complaint would be it shouldve been a bigger bottle. I didn&#x27;t realize how small it actually was til I got it. But other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with this product</li>
            <li> It doesnt really sting, but does. It does only a bit, and is simple to use on my eyebrow! Its almost just like salt water and has mo scent! Just water!</li>
            <li> This is very convenient if you don&#x27;t want to use q-tips. I found it to be very nice just to spray and go. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product! I carry it around with me and apply it 4-6 x per day. Works better than the old saline solution &amp; Q-tip trick. Great for my triple forward helix that was infected and about to be taken out. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One disadvantage - I feel like a lot of spray comes out. I wish it sprayed a little less so I didn&#x27;t use as much. Oh well :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome. My priecing healed in a week! Not even.. Love it</li>
            <li> Since i recently got my naval pierced H2ocean has really helped with the redness.</li>
            <li> Got it on the estimate date! It works wonders and I use it more than 6 times a day. I recommend this product to anyone that has piercings because it works for everything.</li>
            <li> Came in good time and feels good on my piercings. I am yet to see the results of the product.</li>
            <li> The product is great but the price is big for the product. I used this on a new piercing and only got a few days worth out of it. I ended up purchasing an OTC numbing spray for wounds to help finish the healing process.</li>
            <li> Check the ounces before you buy it. Something i totally forgot to do and when i received it, it was way smaller than i expected it to be. But then again you don&#x27;t need to spray that much. It&#x27;s more than enough for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. My piercing is healing very well. I would definitely buy it again for more piercings.</li>
            <li> I did like this product however, out lasted like a week or so for my belly button piercing., if you&#x27;re planning to get H2ocean, I would get a much bigger bottle of it</li>
            <li> Exactly as described👌</li>
            <li> The thing is, I have never had my ears pierced so I cannot say if this worked or not... But I got a triple forward helix at least a couple months ago, and I was told that they take a very long time to heal completely and they hurt for a while! Well my ears feel fine, unless I do something silly like smack myself really hard, and they seem to already be mostly healed! I did spray some on a cotton ball and use it on my face for my acne, it didn&#x27;t seem to help it much Buuuuut I didn&#x27;t see any new acne pop up either... But it made me feel better to have something beside just &#x27;Water and soup&#x27; which is what my piercer told me to use.</li>
            <li> Did not help at all!! Was easy to use but did not clean area well.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and it works miracles !</li>
            <li> Just what I needed! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I got my nose stretched back to an 18g a couple days ago and with using this product it has helped with the healing process and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has any piercings new or old.</li>
            <li> I got this because my navel piercing refused to heal. I had it done 9 months ago and it was i was still getting a lot of puss coming out of it. I cleaned it twice a day with warm salt water solution with no improvement. The second I received this I sprayed it on and got instant relief from my navel itching. I highly recommend this product. i use it everyday 3-6 times throughout the day. it has insanely reduced the amount of puss the comes out and it has not felt itchy at all. I&#x27;ll defiantly be ordering more when i run out!!</li>
            <li> Thank you received this one time and its great!</li>
            <li> I use this spray to clean my belly button piercing, my medusa (retired), and my ears. I love this spray because it&#x27;s great for a quick, gentle, effective clean. This worked especially well on my belly button because my piercing was sensitive and I didn&#x27;t want to irritate it all the time with the disinfecting soap when I just wanted to clean quickly. It&#x27;s also great when you&#x27;re in a hurry because it&#x27;s a spray and you don&#x27;t have to worry about touching a fresh piercing without scrubbing down your hands. Also, since you don&#x27;t have to touch/rub your piercing it&#x27;s great for sensitive fresh piercings. All around great product, keeps my piercings clean and reduces irritation and potential infection when they start acting up!</li>
            <li> I have many piercings and had always sworn by Dial soap until I caved and bought H2O. It&#x27;s a great, easy-to-use product! I bought this after I had my navel pierced--the piercing would occasionally become irritated and sore and I need a quick cleaner. H2O is awesome because it is easily carried and can be used on-the-go! My piercing felt great after using--immediate relief! Seller sent the item promptly and it was received in proper packaging. Would buy from again!</li>
            <li> Ever since ive found this product on here i always order only H20ocean for my piercings and ears. its purified salt water so it works wonders on cleaning piercings and whatnot also has a somewhat soothing feeling to it when its applied. :) reccomend for sure guys!</li>
            <li> I have a total of seven piercings and I use this product every time and I have never got an infection. I also use this while I stretch my ears to make the healing process go by faster.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as an emergency because I had an infected piercing. I received the item in no time and I am very satisfied with my purchase! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 3 years after I got a piercing on the back of my shoulder. When I stopped using the spray is when it started to get red and sore. But once I applied it, within a day the soreness and redness went away. I promote this product like crazy to all my friends who get piercings whether it&#x27;s nose, lip, ears, belly button, etc! Just one spritz a few times a day keeps the redness away</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS WELL BUT IT DRIPS MORE THAN ACTUALLLY SPRAYS AND I USE IT FOR MY NIPPLES SO IT GETS EVERYWHERE</li>
            <li> I liked this product alot, all you do is spray a little on your piercing and your good and you could bring it to school and do a quick spray before you go to class to keep piercing clean if you needed, you can bring it anywhere and use it at anytime, it works great~ but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that I ran out very fast. May be because it&#x27;s so small or maybe I used to much? I don&#x27;t know. I ran out within 1-2 weeks of having it. I cleaned my piercing 3-6 times a day. Used too many times? Sprayed too much? Or maybe theres just too little that it comes with. But either way, the product was great and it came within 3 days of ordering. Recommended, but get the 4 oz package. ~~~</li>
            <li> A few days before my order came in the area around my nose ring i got a month ago started to get red and started to create a bump but 2 days after I used it, the bumped disappeared. This really works, I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it which is why i bought some more for my industrial piercing it really helps when my ear is irritated or itchy</li>
            <li> Horribly late and very small!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;m using it right now to help keep my new rook piercing clean. (A rook is a piercing that involves a lot of cartilage and one that&#x27;ll take three months to a year to heal fully.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had begun to ramp up toward a mild infection at the site of my new rook piercing. It&#x27;s located in a place that doesn&#x27;t allow me to see it so I had taken to touching it a lot more often then I should have.  (I shouldn&#x27;t have been touching it at all with dirty hands!) I asked my daughter, a young woman who has a lot of body piercings, what to do. With enthusiasm, she suggested H2Ocean to use several times during the day (and Provon Medicated Lotion Soap, another great aftercare product, once daily while in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This combo of products worked so well!  I&#x27;m still astounded by how fast the incipient infection disappeared after I began to use H2Ocean several times each day, along with the once-daily Provon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;H2Ocean is exceptionally easy to use and does its job very well.  Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li> its good but you can make the same stuff for cheaper and more of it all you need is a little sea salt and water</li>
            <li> I recently had gotten my belly button done as well as 6 dermals ( i think thats how you spell it) on my back. This product saved me! Its perfect and helped me heal so fast! I love love love this!!! I can&#x27;t stress enough how important it is to keep your piercings clean and this is what the tattoo store recommend to me. they also sold it in the shop. It last a long time and is so important to have! I think this is a must if yo have a new piercing!</li>
            <li> i love this product it really works</li>
            <li> I used this spray after my nose piercing was irritating me (I was cheap and stupid so I got it done with a gun, even though I knew to use a needle) &amp; it started forming a keloid. I used the spray consistently for less than a week and it cleared up perfectly. Like magic.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love H2Ocean! I started using it when I got my tragus pierced because the sea salt soaks were a little hard to squeeze into my schedule. As soon as I started using H2Ocean, my piercing felt a lot better. I use this spray at least twice a day and my piercing is healing perfectly.</li>
            <li> VERY SOOTHING ON MY NEW PIERCING.  YOU SHOULD NOT PUT ANYTHING ON A NEW PEIRCING EXCEPT SALT WATER. tHIS IS THE PERFECT BLEND...WORTH IT TO AVOID INFECTIONS</li>
            <li> the nosel broke couldn&#x27;t use product</li>
            <li> I got my cartilage pierced at Claire&#x27;s. (Yeah, I know it was stupid.) Anyway, the stuff they gave me just was not keeping my ear clean. It was constantly swelling and bleeding and all sorts of stuff. I was really regretting getting a piercing and thinking that I&#x27;d never be able to sleep on my left ear again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister-in-law recommended this stuff since she used it on her nose piercing. I am so glad I got it! Within two days of using it my ear was healed! I continued to use it for about a month and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with my piercing since then. It&#x27;s been over a year now and I keep it around just in case, but it did such a great healing job I may never need it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this after getting my upper cartilage pierced so that I could clean my ear when traveling etc. I was going to buy it from h2ocean&#x27;s website but saw it was like $12 dollars with $5 shipping which is way to expensive for a tiny bottle of salt water. I found it on amazon for much cheaper and although I was a bit worried it would be fake, it&#x27;s not, it works very well and I use it often, especially when I am too lazy to make a sea salt soak. Definitely get it here because it is so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> So far this has helped me a lot with my stretched ears, the only problem i had was that i had trouble with the can itself, i could not get the spray to come out. But other than that i really loved it.</li>
            <li> it comes in a good amount and is easy to use</li>
            <li> I ran out so I quickly ordered more- this stuff is just magic &amp; it cleans out my piercings really well ~</li>
            <li> I got two piercings done, and decided to use this as a precaution in case it might get infected. So far it&#x27;s been doing the trick and speeding up the healing process.</li>
            <li> Product really works!</li>
            <li> Be aware that this is not the full-size H2Ocean. I neglected to double-check the oz, and arrived today as a super tiny almost travel size bottle. I can get the full size cheaper from a piecer. Sigh :(</li>
            <li> H2ocean works well to clean and heal ur piercings. I just started stretching my ears so I used this to clean &amp; it works! Slowly but it works. It&#x27;s vary exapensive tho. When you could just buy regular sea salt for like 3ish dollars. But in the time being I just wanted to try it. Since its expspensive I&#x27;m going to just start buying sea salt,it&#x27;s cheaper than this and u get the same outcome.</li>
            <li> It really helps.... I recently got my nipples repierced... Which hurt like hell, but with this stuff, no more pain.... And really cuts down on the dried seepage.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. I went to a cheap piercing place and for cleaning they gave me this. I had several problems with my piercing that ended with me having to remove my nose ring all together. I went to another very well respected piercing place and they told me the h20 solution expires 14 DAYS after opening. I&#x27;d suggest mixing your own sea salt and warm water solution.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so happy i got this. i&#x27;m getting my cartilage pierced tomorrow and I&#x27;ve heard this is really good for it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I recently got my industrial pierced for my birthday, needless to say it&#x27;s a painful healing process. After I got this it took quite a bit of the pain away. I can sleep on my ear now, and for that I&#x27;m very grateful. It also arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> item is very good and heals all ears i had bad sores and it took care of them in 5-6 days</li>
            <li> It heals scraps too lol I perched my lips to get snake bits my gosh it hurt! lol I sprayed and it healed quick ! But It won&#x27;t last long... maybe it will who knows... oh well.. lol WHO CARES LOL!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff works great and it stops infections. i used it for my nose ring and it healed pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and effective. 1.5 OZ is a little small for the price, but it makes life easier.</li>
            <li> just keep in mind, this isn&#x27;t the nasal spray, but&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a use for it! :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff works like magic</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and handy. You can clean your piercing wherever you are! It is vital to keep piercing hole clean.</li>
            <li> I recently got my nipples done and this product works amazing it dirps alot but it&#x27;s help healing process go smoothly</li>
            <li> It was actually really early and it works really well. :)</li>
            <li> Very good product. Been using it for a few days now &amp; I can already tell a difference in my belly button. :-)</li>
            <li> perhaps i&#x27;m using it wrong, but i don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing much for my cartilage piercings. it feels nice - maybe i&#x27;m just not using it right.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is the absolute best piercing aftercare product. I used it to clean each of my piercings and I still use it to clean my jewelry, I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for how great the product works and 1/2 star for the size. I ran out of the 4oz size and purchased this size in a hurry without realizing it was not the 4oz size.  After two sprays the can was empty. Purchasing the 4oz can is way more economical.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works...I pierced my helix and it formed a lump and within 2 weeks the lump went down after consistently applying it with a Q-tip 2-3 times daily. I just received 3 4oz cans in the mail today because I hate running out.</li>
            <li> It works but as you look at it, online, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be an aerosol can. But it does as its suppose to... so 3/5</li>
    </ol>
