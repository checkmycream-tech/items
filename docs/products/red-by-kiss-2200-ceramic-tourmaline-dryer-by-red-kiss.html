            <li>Love it works</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>So I wish there was gripping around it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M IN LOVE</li>
            <li>I will wrap a towel around barrel for better grip.</li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Before I had this dryer it would take me about an hour or more.</li>
            <li>maybe okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed the weightless of this blower dryer.</li>
            <li>Love it, works much better without the handle.</li>
            <li>I love the way it handles and dries.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty good blowdryer.</li>
            <li>With this dryer, I&#x27;m done in about 30 minutes because it&#x27;s so easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to hold.</li>
            <li>The attachments come off easily while using.</li>
            <li>but those break so easily</li>
            <li>This is by far the best blow dryer I have used thus far.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the ease of using this with no handle in the way.</li>
            <li>great for blowouts, andprep for flat irons.</li>
            <li>The hot setting is HOT like Dominican Blowout HOT!!!!</li>
            <li>the temperature is hot enough to seal the cuticles if your hair for a great shine.</li>
            <li>were the cool setting</li>
            <li>I love this item so much</li>
            <li>Cool to touch and</li>
            <li>I love it, gets my hair so straight</li>
            <li>It is a good size and everything the only reason it doesn&#x27;t have 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair as good as the Yellow bird Dryer</li>
            <li>If it really blew my hair straight  like Yellow bird, it would be perfect!</li>
            <li>so quick..</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn your hand and it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has thick beautiful natural hair and this blow dryer makes it more manageable &amp; easy to work with</li>
            <li>Best item I&#x27;ve bought in years and only accidentally came about it by watching a video on YouTube by ulovemegz one day while researching how to blow dry</li>
            <li>Fast, Powerful and of course Easy to handle.</li>
            <li>The best blowdryer it makes my hair soft &amp; fluffy</li>
            <li>diffuser attachment would have been nice and the chord is too short</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I thought it might be.</li>
            <li>Could have turned to a big fire very easily.</li>
            <li>(well okay really) clumsy when it comes to blow drying my own hair.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair, and this is the first time in over a year that I&#x27;ve been able to wear it straight.</li>
            <li>so I was glad to come across such a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>This was the first blowdryer I have ever owned</li>
            <li>However I really like it!</li>
            <li>The handless dryer is a good concept but it needs to be the same quality as regular handle dryers.</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars b/c although the shaft doesn&#x27;t get hot, it&#x27;s warm &amp; not cool.</li>
            <li>I love it, used it dried my hair super fast.</li>
            <li>Much easier to handle</li>
            <li>So much easier with comb attachments.</li>
            <li>I am really unpleased with this</li>
            <li>Without a handle, the dryer is much is to manipulate and</li>
            <li>really fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast drying is a time saver.</li>
            <li>Low setting is warm enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist and I love this dryer, I only wish the cord was about 1 ft longer.</li>
            <li>It was easy to handle, cool to the touch and dried my hair</li>
            <li>It gets hot and does the job on my naturally kinky/curly hair.</li>
            <li>love it, got my very curly/afro textured hair dry and straight in short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Because of that defect, I don&#x27;t think this drier will last long, but I will buy another one when it breaks because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Very good, only negative is the cable is to short</li>
            <li>The product has also cracked along where the attachments go (probably happened after the first 4x the attachments flew off and I&#x27;m just now noticing the cracks) and at the back where the cool, low, high switch</li>
            <li>Trying to figure out how to send it back right now.</li>
            <li>The heating element still worked and made the item red hot, but no air.</li>
            <li>I used this dryer last night and it made my natural hair so straight!</li>
            <li>I am transitioning to natural hair.</li>
            <li>My natural hair looks just like Cosmo Kramer&#x27;s hair on Seinfeld.</li>
            <li>and I very rarely blow dried it because it took me all day to do it.  </li>
            <li>but I highly recommend using the low setting when drying hair with heat.</li>
            <li>This dryer was so easy to use, especially since I am not coordinated enough to hold a brush in one and and the dryer in the other.</li>
            <li>Buttons are a bit hard to adjust; do not slide easily.</li>
            <li>I can dry hair much faster with it&#x27;s ergonomic design.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and gets my hair dry within a half an hour.</li>
            <li>The attachments are the exact material that I was looking for and it looks like they&#x27;re gonna last a long time.</li>
            <li>I am a natural 4A and normally it takes forever for me to blow dry my hair after washing.</li>
            <li>It has a cold setting which is wonderful especially if you&#x27;re trying to use less heat in your hair.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I expected or enough force or air pressure</li>
            <li>It was hard to get it to stay on medium and the high is soooo hot, I can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li>was actually cool and not warm.</li>

            <li> It was hard to get it to stay on medium and the high is soooo hot, I can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> was actually cool and not warm.</li>
            <li> With the smallest comb attachment on this however I looked human without the extra heat of a flat iron because God knows I don&#x27;t have time to set.</li>
            <li> and they were broken clean</li>
            <li> Especially trying to dry the back of your head.</li>
            <li> I have not had this item long enough for&lt;br /&gt;it to go out already.</li>
            <li> Yes the comb attachments come off during the blow dry but its not a big deal,  just place a piece of card board between the attachment and the dryer.  </li>
            <li> I only use the shaft when I dry my hair anyway</li>
            <li> Finally my hands don&#x27;t hurt when I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to slide to get the right setting with wet hands.</li>
            <li> When I click the switch to the off position, sometimes the drier does not turn off and I have to keep sliding the buttons up an down to get it to finally turn off.  </li>
            <li> Make sure the nozzle is twisted down tight or it will pop off.  </li>
            <li> Using product &amp; then using it will make it harder to hold.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy but not as cumbersome as the traditional blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have African Curly hair and used the narrow toothed comb with ease.</li>
            <li> its  not what I expected takes some getting used to</li>
            <li> I have thick natural hair</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll either love it or hate it as many people have found it hard to adjust to the no handle,  The number one down side was that both combs that come in the box arrived broken.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have an injured wrist and the regular handled hair dryer was killing me when I dried my daughter&#x27;s long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I use the small comb attachment that comes with it and within minutes I have a flat, bouncy do that lasts!</li>
            <li> And other than not having a handle,  I see no difference between this and my previous driers.</li>
            <li> Being that I am natural with thick tight curls 4a-4b, it cuts the blow drying process time in half!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the detanling comb isn&#x27;t the sturdiest</li>
            <li> purchased this blow dryer less than a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slightly</li>
            <li> If you have long, kinky/curly hair, expect the comb to come flying off at least 10 times during your drying session.</li>
            <li> Also the fact that there is no cool shot button wouldnt work for me.</li>
            <li> I still use the broken combs as it was only two pieces on the end</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a waste of my money and almost started a fire!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this and when I recieved it the box was open and one of the attachment combs was broken.</li>
            <li> I have very thick relaxed hair that usually looks like a fizzy squirrel tail in my ponytail unless it&#x27;s either flat ironed or roller set.  </li>
            <li> The comb is made with flexible plastic polymer not the hard plastic combs that traditionally break off rendering the attachment useless.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks it over heated at the plug in and started a small fire !</li>
            <li> Not a good look for a chick.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I have pretty awful hair that has NEVER done what I wanted.</li>
            <li> and I was tired of burning my hand by holding the nozzle</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to return the item over two broken combs plus it was hair washing day</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> I am a stylist &amp; unfortunately this blow dryer was no good for me.</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t feel weird</li>
            <li> Worst dryer ever made!</li>

            <li> This product met all of my expectations. I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would feel about it being handless, even though that&#x27;s what attracted me to it. But it didn&#x27;t feel weird like I wondered about and it was very comfortable and convenient to use. I would recommend this for sure.</li>
            <li> LOVE this blow dryer.  I have thick natural hair and I very rarely blow dried it because it took me all day to do it.  With this dryer, I&#x27;m done in about 30 minutes because it&#x27;s so easy to maneuver.  The only issue here are the buttons to turn the dryer on and off.  When I click the switch to the off position, sometimes the drier does not turn off and I have to keep sliding the buttons up an down to get it to finally turn off.  Because of that defect, I don&#x27;t think this drier will last long, but I will buy another one when it breaks because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I want to give the order three stars but the actually product does deserve four. I have never used the handle on a blow dryer as I find it a nuisance and I was tired of burning my hand by holding the nozzle so I was glad to come across such a blow dryer. You&#x27;ll either love it or hate it as many people have found it hard to adjust to the no handle,  The number one down side was that both combs that come in the box arrived broken. I didn&#x27;t want to return the item over two broken combs plus it was hair washing day and I needed a blow dryer. I still use the broken combs as it was only two pieces on the end and they were broken clean so there is no pulling or tugging on my hair. I will say that the temperatures are truly what they say. This was the first blowdryer I have ever owned were the cool setting was actually cool and not warm. The low is low but I highly recommend using the low setting when drying hair with heat. The hot setting is HOT like Dominican Blowout HOT!!!! All in all it&#x27;s a pretty good blowdryer.</li>
            <li> Being that I am natural with thick tight curls 4a-4b, it cuts the blow drying process time in half! It takes some getting used to..I love this product!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot! A lot easier to use than the traditional hand held dryers! I can dry hair much faster with it&#x27;s ergonomic design.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to but I like it.  Yes the comb attachments come off during the blow dry but its not a big deal,  just place a piece of card board between the attachment and the dryer.  That should solve that problem.</li>
            <li> Love it works well I am I heard about it.  I just wish it work with the stand I brought.  Much easier to handle I love it</li>
            <li> This is by far the best blow dryer I have used thus far. My daughter has thick beautiful natural hair and this blow dryer makes it more manageable &amp; easy to work with</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars b/c although the shaft doesn&#x27;t get hot, it&#x27;s warm &amp; not cool. Using product &amp; then using it will make it harder to hold. So I wish there was gripping around it. However I really like it! I only use the shaft when I dry my hair anyway so it was about time they come out w/ this! Works well on hair, straightened it out w/o heat damage. So much easier with comb attachments. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> I Loved this Blow Dryer at 1st.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this blow dryer less than a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;I only used it about 4 times since I had it.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use it yesterday and it started smoking and almost&lt;br /&gt;caught on fire. I have not had this item long enough for&lt;br /&gt;it to go out already. I am really unpleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It was a waste of my money and almost started a fire!&lt;br /&gt;I am a stylist and I have had several blow dries and I have&lt;br /&gt;never had one like this before.&lt;br /&gt;It was Horriable!&lt;br /&gt;Check out my Youtube Video I done on it:&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Ea4QMiRQxTU</li>
            <li> The comb every once in a while falls off but it straightens the hair well.</li>
            <li> Great dryer....I&#x27;M IN LOVE</li>
            <li> best blow dryer i ever had. so quick.. i have 4c textured hair and it takes like30 mins to get through my mbl hair. great for blowouts, andprep for flat irons.</li>
            <li> Lots of power.  Low setting is warm enough.</li>
            <li> Amazing I love this hair blower</li>
            <li> I love this item so much I couldn&#x27;t wait to write a review. I used this dryer last night and it made my natural hair so straight!</li>
            <li> The product came on time. It was well packaged and products intact. I am transitioning to natural hair. This product straighten and dried may coarse hair fast. It was easy to hold. It does get slippery after I got product on it. I will wrap a towel around barrel for better grip.</li>
            <li> Two things I don&#x27;t like: 1-The switch. It&#x27;s hard to slide to get the right setting with wet hands. 2-The comb attachment. It never stays on! If you have long, kinky/curly hair, expect the comb to come flying off at least 10 times during your drying session.</li>
            <li> diffuser attachment would have been nice and the chord is too short</li>
            <li> A bit heavy but not as cumbersome as the traditional blow dryer.  Cool to touch and the temperature is hot enough to seal the cuticles if your hair for a great shine. I have African Curly hair and used the narrow toothed comb with ease. Make sure the nozzle is twisted down tight or it will pop off.  The comb is made with flexible plastic polymer not the hard plastic combs that traditionally break off rendering the attachment useless. Will never go back to the traditional handled .  Shortened my hair styling time from 90 min to 30 min. Hopefully the next model is lighter.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer. I will definitely order another one for backup. Finally my hands don&#x27;t hurt when I blow dry my hair. It&#x27;s easy to hold and gets my hair dry within a half an hour. Before I had this dryer it would take me about an hour or more.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I have pretty awful hair that has NEVER done what I wanted. My natural hair looks just like Cosmo Kramer&#x27;s hair on Seinfeld. Not a good look for a chick. Then I bought this handle-less hair dryer. It does take some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it-WOW! I use the small comb attachment that comes with it and within minutes I have a flat, bouncy do that lasts! In the Deep South! During humid summer days! I love this thing-and it has a 2 year warranty!</li>
            <li> I love it, gets my hair so straight</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer and I may send it back. It is not comfortable at all. Especially trying to dry the back of your head. It maybe okay if you have another person to do the job, but not you yourself. It was hard to get it to stay on medium and the high is soooo hot, I can&#x27;t stand it. Not happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist and I love this dryer, I only wish the cord was about 1 ft longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but I have to this time. This product is amazing</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have an injured wrist and the regular handled hair dryer was killing me when I dried my daughter&#x27;s long, thick hair.  Without a handle, the dryer is much is to manipulate and the styling combs help with drying her hair faster if I try in sections.  Buttons are a bit hard to adjust; do not slide easily.</li>
            <li> This is the bomb. I have very thick relaxed hair that usually looks like a fizzy squirrel tail in my ponytail unless it&#x27;s either flat ironed or roller set.  With the smallest comb attachment on this however I looked human without the extra heat of a flat iron because God knows I don&#x27;t have time to set. Best item I&#x27;ve bought in years and only accidentally came about it by watching a video on YouTube by ulovemegz one day while researching how to blow dry</li>
            <li> Worst dryer ever made! After a couple weeks it over heated at the plug in and started a small fire ! Could have turned to a big fire very easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this and when I recieved it the box was open and one of the attachment combs was broken. It has obviously been used and that was not made known in the add when I pirch it. Trying to figure out how to send it back right now.</li>
            <li> love it, got my very curly/afro textured hair dry and straight in short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I am sure this is a good product as I have seen many good reviews on this product, However my experience was not so good. Product blew within 5 minutes of using, causing sparks that also set my rug alight. I will NOT be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer!!!! It was easy to handle, cool to the touch and dried my hair really fast.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this dryer to any and everyone who would listen.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. The attachments come off easily while using. So imagine having semi course hair and the attachment flying across the room after one pass through my hair. It also doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I expected or enough force or air pressure I guess you would call it. The handless dryer is a good concept but it needs to be the same quality as regular handle dryers.</li>
            <li> its  not what I expected takes some getting used to</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I thought it might be. Used it two or three times already and the comb attachments continue to come off. The product has also cracked along where the attachments go (probably happened after the first 4x the attachments flew off and I&#x27;m just now noticing the cracks) and at the back where the cool, low, high switch is.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for I guess. And other than not having a handle,  I see no difference between this and my previous driers. It dries your hair so I&#x27;m being nice and giving 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;NATURAL GIRLS BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer!</li>
            <li> I have natural hair, and this is the first time in over a year that I&#x27;ve been able to wear it straight. This dryer was so easy to use, especially since I am not coordinated enough to hold a brush in one and and the dryer in the other. It was perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed the weightless of this blower dryer. Fast drying is a time saver.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter had researched this item from UK (where it is unavailable). She used it with a plug adapter, as she does several American items and it blew on the second usage. The heating element still worked and made the item red hot, but no air. I will be returning it now I am back in US.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the ease of using this with no handle in the way. It gets hot and does the job on my naturally kinky/curly hair. It comes with two combs and the regular dryer end. It is a good size and everything the only reason it doesn&#x27;t have 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair as good as the Yellow bird Dryer but those break so easily so I tried something different. If it really blew my hair straight  like Yellow bird, it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> Great product wife loves it</li>
            <li> I love it, used it dried my hair super fast.</li>
            <li> Love it, works much better without the handle.</li>
            <li> The best blowdryer it makes my hair soft &amp; fluffy</li>
            <li> Very good, only negative is the cable is to short</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slightly (well okay really) clumsy when it comes to blow drying my own hair. I am a natural 4A and normally it takes forever for me to blow dry my hair after washing. I always had difficulty maneuvering my grip on the dryer with a comb or brush or even my hand if doing the tension method. However all those problems are gone with this dryer. My only complaint is the detanling comb isn&#x27;t the sturdiest</li>
            <li> I am a stylist &amp; unfortunately this blow dryer was no good for me. The cord is too short, it wouldn&#x27;t reach from the outlet to my clients head. Also the fact that there is no cool shot button wouldnt work for me.</li>
            <li> Just incredible. Fast, Powerful and of course Easy to handle. The attachments are the exact material that I was looking for and it looks like they&#x27;re gonna last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it is handleless and I figured it would be easier to use than one with a handle.  I love the way it handles and dries.  It doesn&#x27;t burn your hand and it dries quickly.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use! Straightens and dries my hair great  Two years later and it&#x27;s still my favorite dryer!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer for the price.  It has a cold setting which is wonderful especially if you&#x27;re trying to use less heat in your hair.</li>
