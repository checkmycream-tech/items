            <li>Amazing effect on the skin and goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the good reviews it had and because I thought it would help with my acne, there was no improvement at all.</li>
            <li>I used to use this and the fruit fiesta peel and loved them both -  </li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t call it a \\&quot;peel\\&quot; , when I think of peel I think of a chem peel or laser peel, but this seems like a good product to unclog pores.</li>

            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>now those products smell really nice and have amazing ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;make</li>
            <li>Really does a great job!</li>
            <li>It gives a really nice glow to your skin.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, good enough to eat.  </li>
            <li>i have a very fair complexion along with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Tube version seems like a better idea.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell of this product &amp; would love to be able to use it</li>
            <li>quantity could be more for the price ...</li>
            <li>I would definitely repurchase both and am very happy with this regime.</li>
            <li>I love this company.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several of their products and they are absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>(I love fruity</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I really love the way this smells</li>
            <li>I love the pumpkin smell too.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products out of the Mychelle skincare line.  </li>
            <li>I love most all of her products</li>
            <li>Tropical Skin Smoother and more..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 with mostly \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li>I leave the peel on for 10 or more minutes</li>
            <li>(use one in the morning and one in the evening), it is even better.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>i love pumpkin, so</li>
            <li>Will purchase again for sure</li>
            <li>I love pumpkin anything.  </li>
            <li>I love it and would reorder again.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend both peels, as they are very effective for home peels without being so strong you could do damage.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>I still love the fruit enzyme wash, hyaluronic firming serum, and fabulous eye cream though.</li>
            <li>The incredible pumpkin peel (used alternatively with the fruit fiesta peel) has taken years off my appearance, reduced wrinkles, eliminated blackheads, and has pretty much eliminated acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li>i love the smell, it MAY be too strong for some, but given the results, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I break out easily and then it takes a while for my skin to heal.  </li>
            <li>sure to wash your face with soap to clean off the oils before applying this stuff</li>
            <li>When I heard this was a bit more mild (as well as pumpkin scented), I thought I would give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>The cranberry cleanser along with the pumpkin peel have really smoothed out my skin, giving it a healthy glow!  </li>
            <li>donated this to an olive-skinned friend &amp; she LOVES it--works great for her, but was a BIG mistake for me.  </li>
            <li>chemical free.</li>
            <li>And best of all you don&#x27;t have to worry about what&#x27;s in the product as they only use safe, natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Clears up my skin and it looks radiant and smooth after using.</li>
            <li>It goes on smelling great and leaves your skin smooth and yummy for a long time!</li>
            <li>This one tingles a lot less than the Fruit Fiesta, but does a great job at reducing pore size, fading sun spots and making my skin tone more even.</li>
            <li>I love this peel so much!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>It smells almost good enough to eat.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the smell is a really strong spicy smell kind of like chai tea.</li>
            <li>I do experience a little tingling when it is on my face but in a good, refreshing way.  </li>
            <li>but this one is one of my favorites along with Vitamin C Serum, Revitalizing Night Cream, Super Polypeptide cream,</li>
            <li>but it quickly subsides.</li>
            <li>I think it also mildly helps with breakouts.</li>
            <li>Mychelle products are gentle but much more effective than similarly- or higher-priced skincare lines.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, my clogged pores clear more quickly, and the color of my skin has improved.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still too soon to see if it&#x27;ll make much of a difference in my fine lines</li>
            <li>This stuff really works fabulously.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is natural and cruelty-free.</li>
            <li>I love that it uses natural ingredients</li>
            <li>be warned though-the smell of this stuff is quite powerful and it kinda lingers even after you wash it off.</li>
            <li>I have a combination skin, I use the peel 1-2 times per week and it leaves my skin very clean and smooth, it makes my skin lighter and brighter and pores smaller.</li>
            <li>The smell of this peel is like having a piece of pumpkin pie right in your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it 2-3 times a week, and it has generally made my skin softer and more \\&quot;glowy.\\</li>
            <li>my skin is not sensitive at all, so I scarcely feel any kind of tingle when I put the peel on.</li>
            <li>This product is 100% natural, smells really interesting (like pumpkins and vanilla), and my skin glows and looks so fresh and new after I wash it off!</li>
            <li>and its been very helpful for mild acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>I remember when I first used it there was a bit of stinging and redness, but that went away after the first use.</li>
            <li>I also alternate with the Fruit Fiesta Peel (which is more intense), and they really keep my skin looking fresh and flake-free.</li>
            <li>The Pumpkin Peel is a great place to start and will help traditional acne creams work better, if you&#x27;re not ready to make the switch to the entire Mychelle line.</li>
            <li>This is not thick it goes on easily in a thin layer and washes off nicely with warm water.  </li>
            <li>I use the Pumpkin Peel plus White Cranberry face wash, then the vitamin C serum, the Clear Skin serum, and the Pumpkin Renew Cream, with amazing results.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to using this product based on all the positive reviews, but it arrived yesterday having leaked all over, oozing out of the box.  </li>
            <li>As someone who is constantly trying to find a great natural product that actually works on my ever changing skin, this product has been a godsend.</li>
            <li>i tried this the first time and didn&#x27;t notice much difference (after 3 to 5 min recommended in the directions)  although it did sting.</li>
            <li>This is a nice peel but not worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>, I have sensitive skin that is easily irritated, so I&#x27;ve only been using this for 1-2 minutes, instead of the full three minutes.  </li>
            <li>I had previously used the fruit fiesta peel and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, but not crazy about the tube - it tends to separate and sometimes when you just want to squeeze out a small amount, you just get liquid, so you need to shake it first, but overall this line is top notch.</li>
            <li>and I love every single item I have tried.  </li>
            <li>well, I can see certain progress.</li>
            <li>In southern climates it&#x27;s more oily; I live in the PA now</li>
            <li>It most definitely helps remove dark spots and leaves the skin looking bright and much younger.</li>
            <li>however the peel itself glides on very evenly and smooth and you only have to use a dab</li>
            <li>peel to gently exfoliate the skin.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have an acne problem anymore thanks to MyChelle.</li>
            <li>It left my face smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li>It smells like pumpkin spice and really works.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it feel fabulous after using it, but combined with the fruit enzyme scrub</li>
            <li>but rather seems to really balance things out.</li>
            <li>It also works really well.</li>
            <li>However, my skin stayed clear and healthy with this peel in my regular, weekly routine.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think that it was  making much of a difference, but where it surprised me was when I noticed that my neck is much softer.  </li>
            <li>I had struggled with adult acne pretty much all through my 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>a blue-eyed, very fair-skinned person, one of the *lucky ones* who burns &amp; turns beet red after 15 minutes in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>I love the natural smell of this pumpkin peel and does exactly what it says, Your skin is extremely soft after the application and has a slight tingly feel on first application</li>
            <li>This did a fantastic job to unclog my pores and help acne dry out.  </li>
            <li>an older version cause</li>
            <li>I had a decent size trial</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t seem to provide the tingle, or deep clean that the fruit fiesta version offers.  </li>
            <li>I did not see immediate results when I only left the peel on for 5-10 minutes, but when I started leaving it on for 30 minutes 2-3 times a week, I noticed significant results!  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny, will definitely continue using this product!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not paying me, I&#x27;m just relieved to finally find something that works at all--which is not to mention that it&#x27;s natural and safe to use for my long-term, overall health.</li>
            <li>i have a few pieces of makeup from this company and love it.</li>
            <li>I had been eyeing this peel for awhile, but the more recent reviews of it and some other MyChelle products were a bit negative, stating that the newer formulations weren&#x27;t as effective as they used to be.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night and my skin was noticeably brighter after.  </li>
            <li>I give it 3 stars because it is a GREAT product for the right person but has the potential to burn the wrong one (me!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every day to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use frequently and doesnt seem to bother my sensative skin.</li>
            <li>I discovered MyChelle Products after trying tons of drugstore, \\&quot;designer\\&quot;, and natural skin care lines.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels so soft after applying this.</li>
            <li>Just a company created out of concern and determination to make a quality all natural product.</li>
            <li>Probably not suited for uber sensitive skin or for people who can&#x27;t do AHA etc..</li>
            <li>I use it two times a week, and it has helped keep my sensitive skin clear of blackheads and whiteheads without irritation.</li>
            <li>i like natural products.</li>
            <li>For acne sufferers, Mychelle offers clear results without over-drying your skin.</li>
            <li>I wanted to really like it, but it just didn&#x27;t seem that much better than my usual way of doing a natural peel (putting a paste of crushed pineapple and coconut milk on my face).</li>
            <li>, however, have mild acne, so those with dry skin might not have the same results.  </li>
            <li>&gt;  All in all, while a tad pricey, it is worth it for the results it gives and the peace of mind that comes from using a product without parabens and other</li>
            <li>After leaving it on for a few minutes and rinsing off, my face is smooth and soft, never dry.      </li>
            <li>Unfortunately the compliments only last 1-2 days post peel lol, but I think it illustrates how well the product works at brightening and evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s weird to say that you notice a change after the first time you use it, but it is so true!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a natural skin care line - I can&#x27;t recommend MyChelle enough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional pumpkin peels at a spa before and this product gives almost similar results.</li>
            <li>Bought both MyChelle Fruit Fiesta Peel and the pumpkin peel, so far I have tried each product alternately twice per week, since my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive, i left it on for about 10mins.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more dry and dull looking.</li>
            <li>and my skin is normal to dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it about two weeks, but i could notice the difference right away, smoother skin and less acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>This product stings a little, but it really works!  </li>
            <li>Maybe I will try it again down the road, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for now.</li>
            <li>Short of using a plain old pumpkin, this product really works.</li>
            <li>The Pumpkin Peel comes in a modest sized 1.2oz jar but as you just need the tiniest amount will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I used it at night and the next morning I noticed a marked improvement in the two breakout spots I had with no redness or dry skin flakes at all.</li>

            <li> I still love the fruit enzyme wash, hyaluronic firming serum, and fabulous eye cream though.</li>
            <li> The incredible pumpkin peel (used alternatively with the fruit fiesta peel) has taken years off my appearance, reduced wrinkles, eliminated blackheads, and has pretty much eliminated acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> i love the smell, it MAY be too strong for some, but given the results, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I break out easily and then it takes a while for my skin to heal.  </li>
            <li> sure to wash your face with soap to clean off the oils before applying this stuff</li>
            <li> When I heard this was a bit more mild (as well as pumpkin scented), I thought I would give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> The cranberry cleanser along with the pumpkin peel have really smoothed out my skin, giving it a healthy glow!  </li>
            <li> donated this to an olive-skinned friend &amp; she LOVES it--works great for her, but was a BIG mistake for me.  </li>
            <li> chemical free.</li>
            <li> And best of all you don&#x27;t have to worry about what&#x27;s in the product as they only use safe, natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Clears up my skin and it looks radiant and smooth after using.</li>
            <li> It goes on smelling great and leaves your skin smooth and yummy for a long time!</li>
            <li> This one tingles a lot less than the Fruit Fiesta, but does a great job at reducing pore size, fading sun spots and making my skin tone more even.</li>
            <li> I love this peel so much!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> It smells almost good enough to eat.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the smell is a really strong spicy smell kind of like chai tea.</li>
            <li> I do experience a little tingling when it is on my face but in a good, refreshing way.  </li>
            <li> but this one is one of my favorites along with Vitamin C Serum, Revitalizing Night Cream, Super Polypeptide cream,</li>
            <li> but it quickly subsides.</li>
            <li> I think it also mildly helps with breakouts.</li>
            <li> Mychelle products are gentle but much more effective than similarly- or higher-priced skincare lines.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, my clogged pores clear more quickly, and the color of my skin has improved.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still too soon to see if it&#x27;ll make much of a difference in my fine lines</li>
            <li> This stuff really works fabulously.  </li>
            <li> Love that it is natural and cruelty-free.</li>
            <li> I love that it uses natural ingredients</li>
            <li> be warned though-the smell of this stuff is quite powerful and it kinda lingers even after you wash it off.</li>
            <li> I have a combination skin, I use the peel 1-2 times per week and it leaves my skin very clean and smooth, it makes my skin lighter and brighter and pores smaller.</li>
            <li> The smell of this peel is like having a piece of pumpkin pie right in your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it 2-3 times a week, and it has generally made my skin softer and more \\&quot;glowy.\\</li>
            <li> my skin is not sensitive at all, so I scarcely feel any kind of tingle when I put the peel on.</li>
            <li> This product is 100% natural, smells really interesting (like pumpkins and vanilla), and my skin glows and looks so fresh and new after I wash it off!</li>
            <li> and its been very helpful for mild acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> I remember when I first used it there was a bit of stinging and redness, but that went away after the first use.</li>
            <li> I also alternate with the Fruit Fiesta Peel (which is more intense), and they really keep my skin looking fresh and flake-free.</li>
            <li> The Pumpkin Peel is a great place to start and will help traditional acne creams work better, if you&#x27;re not ready to make the switch to the entire Mychelle line.</li>
            <li> This is not thick it goes on easily in a thin layer and washes off nicely with warm water.  </li>
            <li> I use the Pumpkin Peel plus White Cranberry face wash, then the vitamin C serum, the Clear Skin serum, and the Pumpkin Renew Cream, with amazing results.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this product based on all the positive reviews, but it arrived yesterday having leaked all over, oozing out of the box.  </li>
            <li> As someone who is constantly trying to find a great natural product that actually works on my ever changing skin, this product has been a godsend.</li>
            <li> i tried this the first time and didn&#x27;t notice much difference (after 3 to 5 min recommended in the directions)  although it did sting.</li>
            <li> This is a nice peel but not worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> , I have sensitive skin that is easily irritated, so I&#x27;ve only been using this for 1-2 minutes, instead of the full three minutes.  </li>
            <li> I had previously used the fruit fiesta peel and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> Love the product, but not crazy about the tube - it tends to separate and sometimes when you just want to squeeze out a small amount, you just get liquid, so you need to shake it first, but overall this line is top notch.</li>
            <li> and I love every single item I have tried.  </li>
            <li> well, I can see certain progress.</li>
            <li> In southern climates it&#x27;s more oily; I live in the PA now</li>
            <li> It most definitely helps remove dark spots and leaves the skin looking bright and much younger.</li>
            <li> however the peel itself glides on very evenly and smooth and you only have to use a dab</li>
            <li> peel to gently exfoliate the skin.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have an acne problem anymore thanks to MyChelle.</li>
            <li> It left my face smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li> It smells like pumpkin spice and really works.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it feel fabulous after using it, but combined with the fruit enzyme scrub</li>
            <li> but rather seems to really balance things out.</li>
            <li> It also works really well.</li>
            <li> However, my skin stayed clear and healthy with this peel in my regular, weekly routine.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think that it was  making much of a difference, but where it surprised me was when I noticed that my neck is much softer.  </li>
            <li> I had struggled with adult acne pretty much all through my 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> a blue-eyed, very fair-skinned person, one of the *lucky ones* who burns &amp; turns beet red after 15 minutes in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> I love the natural smell of this pumpkin peel and does exactly what it says, Your skin is extremely soft after the application and has a slight tingly feel on first application</li>
            <li> This did a fantastic job to unclog my pores and help acne dry out.  </li>
            <li> an older version cause</li>
            <li> I had a decent size trial</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t seem to provide the tingle, or deep clean that the fruit fiesta version offers.  </li>
            <li> I did not see immediate results when I only left the peel on for 5-10 minutes, but when I started leaving it on for 30 minutes 2-3 times a week, I noticed significant results!  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny, will definitely continue using this product!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not paying me, I&#x27;m just relieved to finally find something that works at all--which is not to mention that it&#x27;s natural and safe to use for my long-term, overall health.</li>
            <li> i have a few pieces of makeup from this company and love it.</li>
            <li> I had been eyeing this peel for awhile, but the more recent reviews of it and some other MyChelle products were a bit negative, stating that the newer formulations weren&#x27;t as effective as they used to be.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night and my skin was noticeably brighter after.  </li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because it is a GREAT product for the right person but has the potential to burn the wrong one (me!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use frequently and doesnt seem to bother my sensative skin.</li>
            <li> I discovered MyChelle Products after trying tons of drugstore, \\&quot;designer\\&quot;, and natural skin care lines.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels so soft after applying this.</li>
            <li> Just a company created out of concern and determination to make a quality all natural product.</li>
            <li> Probably not suited for uber sensitive skin or for people who can&#x27;t do AHA etc..</li>
            <li> I use it two times a week, and it has helped keep my sensitive skin clear of blackheads and whiteheads without irritation.</li>
            <li> i like natural products.</li>
            <li> For acne sufferers, Mychelle offers clear results without over-drying your skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to really like it, but it just didn&#x27;t seem that much better than my usual way of doing a natural peel (putting a paste of crushed pineapple and coconut milk on my face).</li>
            <li> , however, have mild acne, so those with dry skin might not have the same results.  </li>
            <li> &gt;  All in all, while a tad pricey, it is worth it for the results it gives and the peace of mind that comes from using a product without parabens and other</li>
            <li> After leaving it on for a few minutes and rinsing off, my face is smooth and soft, never dry.      </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the compliments only last 1-2 days post peel lol, but I think it illustrates how well the product works at brightening and evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s weird to say that you notice a change after the first time you use it, but it is so true!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a natural skin care line - I can&#x27;t recommend MyChelle enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional pumpkin peels at a spa before and this product gives almost similar results.</li>
            <li> Bought both MyChelle Fruit Fiesta Peel and the pumpkin peel, so far I have tried each product alternately twice per week, since my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive, i left it on for about 10mins.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s more dry and dull looking.</li>
            <li> and my skin is normal to dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it about two weeks, but i could notice the difference right away, smoother skin and less acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product stings a little, but it really works!  </li>
            <li> Maybe I will try it again down the road, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for now.</li>
            <li> Short of using a plain old pumpkin, this product really works.</li>
            <li> The Pumpkin Peel comes in a modest sized 1.2oz jar but as you just need the tiniest amount will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I used it at night and the next morning I noticed a marked improvement in the two breakout spots I had with no redness or dry skin flakes at all.</li>
            <li> They obviously take skin care very seriously and make fine products.</li>
            <li> The container is very small--a little of this product goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently moved to an extremely dry, arid environment and my work schedule can be irregular and stressful, and I&#x27;ve been dealing with multiple acne breakouts/day.</li>
            <li> and it only has a minor tingle.</li>
            <li> Does tingle a little, not for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive before trying this peel, as I have very sensitive skin (redhead).</li>
            <li> Every single time I use this mask, the very next day</li>
            <li> Cleansing too rough or using other exfoliating products prior to using this at times left my skin sore and beet red.</li>
            <li> so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As the other reviewers have mentioned, this peel is terrific!</li>
            <li> My skin never feels irritated or overly dry from this product.  </li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily an hour after use or dry it out</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and smells like pumpkin.</li>
            <li> and it worked, took 95% of  dry skin off.</li>
            <li> After rinsing it off, my skin was slightly pinkish red and felt cleaner and glowed.</li>
            <li> so you might want to leave it on for a little less time if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it about 2-3x a week and always before a big day.&lt;br /&gt;Light pumpkin smell, and a little tingle.</li>
            <li> it was in a jar aka not very sanitary.</li>
            <li> Item is not that what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I noticed definite tingling within a few moments of applying it, but didn&#x27;t mind leaving it on for the recommended 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> its a curious liitle skin care product i just stumbled on and ordered on a whim.</li>
            <li> This peel was stronger than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it almost every other day.</li>
            <li> Think I&#x27;ll stick with the other.</li>
            <li> second time i really needed some results-the sides of my nose were peeling like crazy.</li>
            <li> It did sting a little (as expected).  </li>
            <li> BUT after just 2 applications, it created a pink chemical burn on my face that took about 6 weeks to finally sluff off (looked like a serious sunburn).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> results are that after a few weeks, rough patches will  be gone and your skin will be smoother.  </li>
            <li> It stings slightly</li>
            <li> Since using this product, I have significantly less breakouts.</li>
            <li> You can use dove products that work just as well for a lot less.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the product runs out after a month of a half!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t happen to have acne-prone skin, but I do get quite flaky, dry, and dull in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I use this when my skin looks dull and dry.</li>
            <li> This is an exfoliating enzyme peel so it will tingle a little.</li>
            <li> made my face a little softer</li>
            <li> as I learned the hard way, you need to carefully match the strength of the peel to your skin</li>
            <li> I use this once a week all year round on my face and hands.</li>
            <li> I like that they are not a huge cosmetic company with all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got</li>
            <li> NOt sure how to get in touch with the vendor. . ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can stomach another try though.&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> I usually forget I have it on</li>
            <li> That said, I usually don&#x27;t like pumpkin smells, but this one didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> it took a few weeks of diligent appliance, but the results are in!  </li>
            <li> i usually break out horrendously once a month, since I&#x27;ve been using this peel faithfully, i was taken by surprise when the monthly breakout did NOT occur.  </li>
            <li> its a very small jar.</li>
            <li> so my face and hands get a lot of exposure to the sun in summer and cold dry air in winter.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like clockwork, never been late once!  </li>
            <li> I am not very impressed with it.  </li>
            <li> At times, there was a discernible tingling sensation but it wasn&#x27;t irritating.  </li>
            <li> I am just shy of 40</li>
            <li> I literally have people come over to me and randomly comment on my skin - which NEVER happened to me before.  </li>
            <li> The product is just too pricy for me since it is very thin and liquidy to begin with.</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;m afraid it might clog my pores, though this is not part of the directions.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> The smell may be unpleasant for some, but tolerable for others like me.  </li>
            <li> That makes it very expensive to keep up</li>
            <li> but I know some people like my sister hate fruity smell...)</li>
            <li> I use it on my nose area where blackheads are worst.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this peel so much! It goes on smelling great and leaves your skin smooth and yummy for a long time!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of MyChelle products and this is one of my favorites.  It smells almost good enough to eat. Yummy!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews it had and because I thought it would help with my acne, there was no improvement at all.</li>
            <li> This peel is great!  Helps keep my hormonal acne flare-ups in check and has no harmful ingredients I need to worry about.  Also love the delicious pumpkin smell.</li>
            <li> smells amazing, works well. Great for oily/acne prone skin. Not sure if I got an older version cause it was in a jar aka not very sanitary. Tube version seems like a better idea. Would buy again. Does tingle a little, not for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I discovered MyChelle Products after trying tons of drugstore, \\&quot;designer\\&quot;, and natural skin care lines.  MyChelle blows everything I&#x27;ve ever tried out of the water.      I am just shy of 40 and my skin is normal to dry.  I&#x27;ve never had what I would characterize as \\&quot;problem\\&quot; skin but I have struggled at times with areas of dryness and enlarged pores.  Since I started using MyChelle a year ago, my skin just seems content.  No dryness.  A *big* reduction in lines and wrinkles.  Smaller pores.  And the biggest change is that I constantly have people telling me that my skin just GLOWS.  I literally have people come over to me and randomly comment on my skin - which NEVER happened to me before.  People have also started guessing that I&#x27;m a decade younger than I am - something else that never happened to me before using the MyChelle line.    The Pumpkin Peel comes in a modest sized 1.2oz jar but as you just need the tiniest amount will last a very long time.  The product smell is yummy - like spiced pumpkin pie.  I do experience a little tingling when it is on my face but in a good, refreshing way.  After leaving it on for a few minutes and rinsing off, my face is smooth and soft, never dry.      If you are looking for a natural skin care line - I can&#x27;t recommend MyChelle enough.  It has done wonders for my skin and I love every single item I have tried.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this wonderful, quality product!</li>
            <li> Skin feels great after use.  use it once per week. Smells wonderful, good enough to eat.  I combine this peel with the Fruit fiesta peel to gently exfoliate the skin.  Love that it is natural and cruelty-free.</li>
            <li> The cranberry cleanser along with the pumpkin peel have really smoothed out my skin, giving it a healthy glow!  I did not see immediate results when I only left the peel on for 5-10 minutes, but when I started leaving it on for 30 minutes 2-3 times a week, I noticed significant results!  My skin never feels irritated or overly dry from this product.  I do, however, have mild acne, so those with dry skin might not have the same results.  I also use the cleanser after the peel (as well as before) because I&#x27;m afraid it might clog my pores, though this is not part of the directions.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s weird to say that you notice a change after the first time you use it, but it is so true! I&#x27;ve been using this peel for years now, and it is always a product I can count on to renew my skin and make it look glowing. I&#x27;ve even used it as a spot treatment on zits that I feel popping up, and I swear they go away quicker--sometimes they don&#x27;t even break the surface. This product is amazing and totally worth the price. Plus, it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this product based on all the positive reviews, but it arrived yesterday having leaked all over, oozing out of the box.  NOt sure how to get in touch with the vendor. . ..</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this product &amp; would love to be able to use it BUT after just 2 applications, it created a pink chemical burn on my face that took about 6 weeks to finally sluff off (looked like a serious sunburn).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a blue-eyed, very fair-skinned person, one of the *lucky ones* who burns &amp; turns beet red after 15 minutes in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take your skin type into account before using ANY peel--as I learned the hard way, you need to carefully match the strength of the peel to your skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I donated this to an olive-skinned friend &amp; she LOVES it--works great for her, but was a BIG mistake for me.  I give it 3 stars because it is a GREAT product for the right person but has the potential to burn the wrong one (me!).</li>
            <li> Item is not that what I expected.  It was just like putting on a punmkin peel on with no results at all.  You might just as well put the can pumpkin on your face.</li>
            <li> WOW! what a peel this is! Skin feels so soft after applying this. Brighter as well. it tingles though but works greatly. chemical free. quantity could be more for the price ...</li>
            <li> I had been eyeing this peel for awhile, but the more recent reviews of it and some other MyChelle products were a bit negative, stating that the newer formulations weren&#x27;t as effective as they used to be.  I decided to try it anyways, and am glad I did!  At first, I didn&#x27;t think that it was  making much of a difference, but where it surprised me was when I noticed that my neck is much softer.  I&#x27;ve been using it 2-3 times a week, and it has generally made my skin softer and more \\&quot;glowy.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s still too soon to see if it&#x27;ll make much of a difference in my fine lines (I&#x27;m 40) since I&#x27;ve only been using it about three weeks, but I like what it&#x27;s doing so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have sensitive skin that is easily irritated, so I&#x27;ve only been using this for 1-2 minutes, instead of the full three minutes.  Even so, it&#x27;s making a difference. It also helps get rid of the flakes that Retin-A leaves me with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell of pumpkin, but this was overpowering.  It did sting a little (as expected).  The results after one application were not noticeable.  I&#x27;m not sure I can stomach another try though.&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  This jar is TINY.</li>
            <li> I purchased both this and the Fruit Fiesta Peel based on another review. I did what that reviewer said, and alternated between the two. Both peels are incredible. This one tingles a lot less than the Fruit Fiesta, but does a great job at reducing pore size, fading sun spots and making my skin tone more even. I would highly recommend both peels, as they are very effective for home peels without being so strong you could do damage. I would definitely repurchase both and am very happy with this regime.</li>
            <li> I love this company. They obviously take skin care very seriously and make fine products. I like that they are not a huge cosmetic company with all the bells and whistles. Just a company created out of concern and determination to make a quality all natural product.</li>
            <li> This is great!  I&#x27;ve been using it every day to keep my skin clear.  Really does a great job!</li>
            <li> I love MyChelle products!! I&#x27;ve used several of their products and they are absolutely wonderful. I had struggled with adult acne pretty much all through my 20&#x27;s but I don&#x27;t have an acne problem anymore thanks to MyChelle. I love the smell (I love fruity but I know some people like my sister hate fruity smell...) and the feel and everything. And best of all you don&#x27;t have to worry about what&#x27;s in the product as they only use safe, natural ingredients. I recommend to everyone to give MyChelle a try!</li>
            <li> This cream is as advertized, INCREDIBLE.  I use it on my nose area where blackheads are worst.  It pulls out the dirt bettert than anything I have used. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this smells and it only has a minor tingle. I had a decent size trial so I used it at lease five times. But I am not fully sold on it. I wanted to really like it, but it just didn&#x27;t seem that much better than my usual way of doing a natural peel (putting a paste of crushed pineapple and coconut milk on my face). Maybe I will try it again down the road, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for now.</li>
            <li> As the other reviewers have mentioned, this peel is terrific! I don&#x27;t happen to have acne-prone skin, but I do get quite flaky, dry, and dull in the winter months. I use this peel in the shower 2x/week, and it&#x27;s terrific. I also alternate with the Fruit Fiesta Peel (which is more intense), and they really keep my skin looking fresh and flake-free.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells pretty bad.</li>
            <li> This product stings a little, but it really works!  It left my face smooth and glowing.  I love the pumpkin smell too.</li>
            <li> I break out easily and then it takes a while for my skin to heal.  This stuff truly helps you skin to heal, even from a sunburn!  I loved a sample I got and had to buy it!  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products out of the Mychelle skincare line.  I love most all of her products but this one is one of my favorites along with Vitamin C Serum, Revitalizing Night Cream, Super Polypeptide cream, Tropical Skin Smoother and more..This is an exfoliating enzyme peel so it will tingle a little. Probably not suited for uber sensitive skin or for people who can&#x27;t do AHA etc.. It smells like pumpkin spice and really works.  I use this when my skin looks dull and dry. This is my favorite face peel/mask!</li>
            <li> Great product for exfoliating the skin without unnecesary ingredients and chemicals.  The smell may be unpleasant for some, but tolerable for others like me.  This is not thick it goes on easily in a thin layer and washes off nicely with warm water.  It stings slightly so you might want to leave it on for a little less time if you have sensitive skin.  I usually forget I have it on so I always go over the time suggested.&lt;br /&gt;The results are that after a few weeks, rough patches will  be gone and your skin will be smoother.  There are no immediate results exfoliation takes time but this will do the trick, and may even reduce you acne as it did for me.&lt;br /&gt;  I use this once a week all year round on my face and hands. Here in Japan we commute by bicycle so my face and hands get a lot of exposure to the sun in summer and cold dry air in winter.  It is now winter so I use this pumpkin peel to exfoliate my legs as well so they can absorb my moisturizer better.&lt;br /&gt;  All in all, while a tad pricey, it is worth it for the results it gives and the peace of mind that comes from using a product without parabens and other chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I am 40 with mixed oily and dry/wrinkled skin.  The incredible pumpkin peel (used alternatively with the fruit fiesta peel) has taken years off my appearance, reduced wrinkles, eliminated blackheads, and has pretty much eliminated acne breakouts.  It burns a bit (which means it&#x27;s working).  I use it 1-2 times per week and the fruit fiesta peel 1-2 times per week.    This product is 100% natural, smells really interesting (like pumpkins and vanilla), and my skin glows and looks so fresh and new after I wash it off!</li>
            <li> This peel is wonderful!  As someone who is constantly trying to find a great natural product that actually works on my ever changing skin, this product has been a godsend. I use it two times a week, and it has helped keep my sensitive skin clear of blackheads and whiteheads without irritation. A truly great product.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive before trying this peel, as I have very sensitive skin (redhead). I&#x27;m 27 with mostly \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin. In southern climates it&#x27;s more oily; I live in the PA now so it&#x27;s more dry and dull looking. If I have an acne breakout, it&#x27;s on my chin or lower cheeks. That said, I usually don&#x27;t like pumpkin smells, but this one didn&#x27;t bother me. The container is very small--a little of this product goes a long way! I noticed definite tingling within a few moments of applying it, but didn&#x27;t mind leaving it on for the recommended 5 minutes. After rinsing it off, my skin was slightly pinkish red and felt cleaner and glowed. I used it at night and the next morning I noticed a marked improvement in the two breakout spots I had with no redness or dry skin flakes at all. (Olay&#x27;s Daily Thermal Mini-Peel and Microdermabrasion Peel leave my skin red for a couple of days.) Worth every penny, will definitely continue using this product!</li>
            <li> this product has been the best thing to happen to me. I&#x27;ve only been using it about two weeks, but i could notice the difference right away, smoother skin and less acne breakouts. I&#x27;ve recently moved to an extremely dry, arid environment and my work schedule can be irregular and stressful, and I&#x27;ve been dealing with multiple acne breakouts/day. Since using this product, I have significantly less breakouts. my skin is not sensitive at all, so I scarcely feel any kind of tingle when I put the peel on. I leave the peel on for 10 or more minutes and I&#x27;ve been using it almost every other day.</li>
            <li> This is a nice peel but not worth the cost.  You can use dove products that work just as well for a lot less.  The benefits do not out weigh the cost.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It has done wonders for my acne prone skin.  Not only does it feel fabulous after using it, but combined with the fruit enzyme scrub (use one in the morning and one in the evening), it is even better.  My skin is smoother, my clogged pores clear more quickly, and the color of my skin has improved.</li>
            <li> Wish it was cheaper. Amazing effect on the skin and goes on beautifully. The product is just too pricy for me since it is very thin and liquidy to begin with. You could go through a bottle in three weeks if you used it twice a week.</li>
            <li> This was the first product I tried from the line, and it is great! I&#x27;ve since bought the apple brightening cleanser and mist, Perfect C Serum and the polypeptide cream. My skin looks healthy and feels great. This product smells wonderful and gives me the nicest glow. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional pumpkin peels at a spa before and this product gives almost similar results. It most definitely helps remove dark spots and leaves the skin looking bright and much younger. Amazing product. I love it!</li>
            <li> I used to use this and the fruit fiesta peel and loved them both -  but that was back when they came in jars. The formula has since changed and it now makes be break out. I know that any soy derived ingredient will make me break out so it&#x27;s possible they&#x27;ve added a soy derived ingredient. It&#x27;s sad I&#x27;ve had to stop using so many Mychelle products in recent years because of formula changes. I still love the fruit enzyme wash, hyaluronic firming serum, and fabulous eye cream though.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Clears up my skin and it looks radiant and smooth after using. I have an issue with products not working on my skin anymore after using for a while, but this has been working great. I use it about 2-3x a week and always before a big day.&lt;br /&gt;Light pumpkin smell, and a little tingle.</li>
            <li> I love the natural smell of this pumpkin peel and does exactly what it says, Your skin is extremely soft after the application and has a slight tingly feel on first application but it quickly subsides.</li>
            <li> Short of using a plain old pumpkin, this product really works. Every single time I use this mask, the very next day I get stopped somewhere with someone telling me how beautiful my skin looks (and I have problem skin). Unfortunately the compliments only last 1-2 days post peel lol, but I think it illustrates how well the product works at brightening and evening out my skin tone. I think it also mildly helps with breakouts.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works fabulously.  I used it for the first time last night and my skin was noticeably brighter after.  The only downside is that the smell is a really strong spicy smell kind of like chai tea.</li>
            <li> it took a few weeks of diligent appliance, but the results are in!  i usually break out horrendously once a month, since I&#x27;ve been using this peel faithfully, i was taken by surprise when the monthly breakout did NOT occur.  and it&#x27;s like clockwork, never been late once!  i love pumpkin, so i love the smell, it MAY be too strong for some, but given the results, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> went ahead and gave this product a 5.   its a curious liitle skin care product i just stumbled on and ordered on a whim. i like natural products. its a very small jar. however the peel itself glides on very evenly and smooth and you only have to use a dab so it goes a long way. it seems to do what is promised. and its been very helpful for mild acne breakouts. plus it smells like Thanksgiving. i have a very fair complexion along with sensitive skin. this doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily an hour after use or dry it out but rather seems to really balance things out.</li>
            <li> Bought both MyChelle Fruit Fiesta Peel and the pumpkin peel, so far I have tried each product alternately twice per week, since my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive, i left it on for about 10mins. Works well, I can see certain progress. The peel scent is yummy.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and I like it. It does what it suppose to do. Will purchase again for sure</li>
            <li> This peel was stronger than I expected it to be. Cleansing too rough or using other exfoliating products prior to using this at times left my skin sore and beet red. However, my skin stayed clear and healthy with this peel in my regular, weekly routine.</li>
            <li> This did a fantastic job to unclog my pores and help acne dry out.  It does look and smell like pureed pumpkin which I like. It also has a tiny amount of granules for surface exfoliation as well.  At times, there was a discernible tingling sensation but it wasn&#x27;t irritating.  My only complaint is that the product runs out after a month of a half!  That makes it very expensive to keep up so I don&#x27;t know if I will always have this on hand.  I did use it about 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I use it twice a week, and though it makes my face slightly red after use, the next day my face looks like it is glowing.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t call it a \\&quot;peel\\&quot; , when I think of peel I think of a chem peel or laser peel, but this seems like a good product to unclog pores. Gentle enough to use frequently and doesnt seem to bother my sensative skin. Helps to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I love that it uses natural ingredients but it was ineffective on my skin.. No skin tingling, no peeling, no brightening, nada. I heard that the company recently reformulated a lot of its products to use cheaper, ineffective ingredients so maybe this is one of those?</li>
            <li> I love pumpkin anything.  I had previously used the fruit fiesta peel and really liked it.  When I heard this was a bit more mild (as well as pumpkin scented), I thought I would give it a shot.  I am not very impressed with it.  It really doesn&#x27;t seem to provide the tingle, or deep clean that the fruit fiesta version offers.  Think I&#x27;ll stick with the other.</li>
            <li> Burnt the heck out of my skin... welts and all. Left on only 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but not crazy about the tube - it tends to separate and sometimes when you just want to squeeze out a small amount, you just get liquid, so you need to shake it first, but overall this line is top notch.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have a combination skin, I use the peel 1-2 times per week and it leaves my skin very clean and smooth, it makes my skin lighter and brighter and pores smaller. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and smells like pumpkin. The item was delivered timely and as described, I would repurchase again</li>
            <li> One weekend of getting back on these products has cleared up a severe breakout on my jawline, making the spots fade and flatten out. I use the Pumpkin Peel plus White Cranberry face wash, then the vitamin C serum, the Clear Skin serum, and the Pumpkin Renew Cream, with amazing results. Mychelle products are gentle but much more effective than similarly- or higher-priced skincare lines. For acne sufferers, Mychelle offers clear results without over-drying your skin. The Pumpkin Peel is a great place to start and will help traditional acne creams work better, if you&#x27;re not ready to make the switch to the entire Mychelle line. They&#x27;re not paying me, I&#x27;m just relieved to finally find something that works at all--which is not to mention that it&#x27;s natural and safe to use for my long-term, overall health.</li>
            <li> i tried this the first time and didn&#x27;t notice much difference (after 3 to 5 min recommended in the directions)  although it did sting. second time i really needed some results-the sides of my nose were peeling like crazy. so i put it on for 15-20 min and it worked, took 95% of  dry skin off. be warned though-the smell of this stuff is quite powerful and it kinda lingers even after you wash it off. i have a few pieces of makeup from this company and love it. now those products smell really nice and have amazing ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;make sure to wash your face with soap to clean off the oils before applying this stuff otherwise it wont work as well</li>
            <li> nothing to write home about. i won&#x27;t buy this again. made my face a little softer but i didn&#x27;t notice an improvement at all.</li>
            <li> The smell of this peel is like having a piece of pumpkin pie right in your face. It&#x27;s so good. It also works really well. I remember when I first used it there was a bit of stinging and redness, but that went away after the first use. It gives a really nice glow to your skin. I love it and would reorder again.</li>
            <li> would purchase again.</li>
