            <li> Ordered this for my daughter as she kept borrowing mine. She and I have both have had wonderful comments about how wonderful it smells, questions about what we&#x27;re wearing will order again</li>
            <li> Nice Parfum I love Gucci!</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived quickly and smells great!</li>
            <li> It almost smells the same but I can tell something isn&#x27;t quite right. The scent is not as strong or lasting.</li>
            <li> I truly thought I ordered &amp;#34;Gucci Premier.&amp;#34;  That was the phrase I entered in the search engine, anyway.  When my purchase came, it was Gucci by Gucci.  This may have been my mistake.  I don&#x27;t know.  But I did e-mail someone and asked what could be done, if anything, and I never received a reply.  Gucci by Gucci is a pretty fragrance, but it is not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> thought this was a good one and did online research for best perfumes and this was one of the top rated but i don&#x27;t like it.  it kind of smells like something for the elderly.  make sure you order parfume, not toilette spray, i think that&#x27;s what made the difference.</li>
            <li> this is the second time I got this perfume (eau de toilette spray) and I feel sexy wearing it on my skin!</li>
            <li> I am keeping this because I can not wear a strong scent at work and this will be the one I wear just for that. The scent itself it&#x27;s not overpowering but fades quickly. I owned the original before and I could still smell it when I shower and in my dirty laundry, this one didnt last pass lunch time.</li>
            <li> Excelent thank u Amazon‼️</li>
            <li> It was a present for my mom ... I was able to get it at a discounted rate and not break the bank.  It was exactly what she wanted and I was able to afford it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last at all. But it smells good. I would have to reapply it every two  hours to keep up with it the hole day. Maybe an eau de parfum would&#x27;ve done a better job.</li>
            <li> Truly love the Gucci line of perfumes!  Light, not overpowering.  Lasts all day!  Highly recommend this for anyone with a love of the finer things!</li>
            <li> A good perfume. Fast delivery.I love that smell. Problems with the order was not. I got a good impression of purchase.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I bought was great, I loved the scent, however the second bottle I purchased did not smell the same.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I bought it for a friend and he really liked the fragrance, overall my friend loves GUCCI, not whether it will have something that she is of Italian descent.</li>
            <li> love it!&lt;br /&gt;I been looking for this perfume and finally found it with a cheap price. It is authentic and worths every cents.&lt;br /&gt;I received the same I expected.</li>
