            <li>Very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it if you are trying to fill in sparse brows.</li>
            <li>I could not use it more than 5 nights so could not see its effect!</li>
            <li>These oil ingredients work for growing hair on their own and combined they  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li>but im excited to!!</li>
            <li>Looks like it will be very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This has by far been the best stuff.  </li>
            <li>When they did the hair was very fine.  </li>
            <li>more oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>:) I just have to keep the hair plucked under the dividing line where the arch is. :)</li>
            <li>lol!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product :)</li>
            <li>Rapidlash works much better.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it is more money, but it works.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found this.</li>
            <li>The solution did seem to settle after a bit, so be sure to shake well before each use.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I use 2 swipes of Rapid Brow during the day since I work at a senior home.</li>
            <li>I tried it for a couple of weeks to see if It could be shaken up better after I used some of it</li>
            <li>so make SURE</li>
            <li>Better to use this during the day if you can since you are not rubbing against a pillow or tossing and turning.</li>
            <li>I think it will have a better effect for brows and hair growth.</li>
            <li>something stiffer would work better.  </li>
            <li>but I can see more and more results as I continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>I make sure to use it every night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when it arrived at my front step!</li>
            <li>thought the good ingredients would be good for my skin and might be better than strange chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Also, i wouldnt go on a date or have a special night in with someone  after its application!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply...as if you were applying fingernail policy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>I use this twice a day on top with coconut oil on top of it and it really works like wonders!</li>
            <li>It is just fabulous</li>
            <li>lol.. they never grew back in.</li>
            <li>but they are still really light...</li>
            <li>I am using the product which I have heard good things about and have faith that it will work for me too however, since it has only been a week, I will need to give it more time to see results.  </li>
            <li>As to the success of the product, I haven&#x27;t seen much hair growth, but I will reserve that review until I give it a fair chance.....</li>
            <li>This stuff smells absolutely horrid!!!</li>
            <li>This product did fill in some sparse spots which is great though I had hoped for a little more.  </li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t see overnight results, it does contain the oils and nutrients vital for healthy brow growth, so I stayed pleased during continued use.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows, although full, were full of patches and the ends just weren&#x27;t&#x27; coming in with what I used before this product.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, in fact it is a cheap fix.</li>
            <li>I am really hoping that this will work, I would love fuller brows.</li>
            <li>; haven&#x27;t seen any growth yet but will be fair and wait until I use the entire bottle.</li>
            <li>I am not saying it was a big, beautiful bush of new growth!</li>
            <li>and once I stopped applying the new hair that had come out got very fine</li>
            <li>This definitely works great for lashes, I&#x27;m going to try the bigger bottle for sure tho</li>
            <li>It definitely keeps those with trich from touching your eyebrows!</li>
            <li>it also prevented my eyebrows from falling out and oily enough that i was able to let it work during this process because tweezing right after applying oil isnt easy</li>
            <li>am pleased so far with the product.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE</li>
            <li>I am noticing growth and hope to continue using it with success.  </li>
            <li>I bought this several weeks ago &amp; to be honest</li>
            <li>Very strong odor similar to cooking spices with garlic....</li>
            <li>saying i could clearly see three o six new hairs now at surface that never grew there on their own before</li>
            <li>I like the product very much</li>
            <li>Very fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had decent eyebrows and ever since over plucking in highschool, I&#x27;ve had certain bald spots on my eyebrows where hair would not grow!!</li>
            <li>I left it in my suitcase in my car for a day and the liquid separated into many layers.</li>
            <li>First, though I followed instructions to shake the contents, it never blended well.  </li>
            <li>I will most definitely continue to use this product with hope!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why I fell for this hype?!</li>
            <li>I even put castor oil on them first then the Serum over it.</li>
            <li>I tried to shake it vigorously to get the product mixed better</li>
            <li>It took about 2-3 weeks for any improvement, then all of a sudden brow grow like magic.  </li>
            <li>I still wasn&#x27;t able to get it mixed up very well.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really make your skin itch (unless maybe you have super sensitive skin) and it certainly doesn&#x27;t make hair grow all over your face if you fall asleep with it on</li>
            <li>Plus it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>It really does work if you use it consistantly.</li>
            <li>He was ready to try any thing.  </li>
            <li>After losing them completely do to medical reasons, I tried this and within a couple weeks they have filled in beyond my wildest dreams.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really get the results I wanted.</li>
            <li>I really need something that follows through and produce results.</li>
            <li>I have not seen that much improvement with my eyebrows and would not purchase this again.  </li>
            <li>really  wanted this to work</li>
            <li>and for three weeks, it has really has not shown any sign on eyebrows or temple.  </li>
            <li>and it was definitely reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It has helped me so much with my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I have very thing sparse brows</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a funky smell and is really shiny</li>
            <li>and I recommend it for anyone to try, especially if you like more natural products.</li>
            <li>the price is so outstanding &amp; reasonable &amp; the serum lasts a very long time!!...</li>
            <li>I have used many eye brow growth items, and this is the greasiest and very wet one I have ever used...</li>
            <li>I bought this in hopes it would quickly help my over plucked eyebrows grow back, it does say \\&quot;Rapid\\&quot; in the name!</li>
            <li>you have the top on TIGHTLY before shaking....</li>
            <li>Maybe this would have happened anyway after treatment, but I highly doubt it.  </li>
            <li>If you over tweezed in high school like everyone else, you NEED this product</li>
            <li>I tried to wear it at nite as directed, but it made my bedding, hair and everything stink to high heaven.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product about 3 weeks now every night but one, and though I&#x27;ve seen what looks like it may be a little growth, I can&#x27;t be sure.  </li>
            <li>but then you have to continuously use them or the new growth sheds.</li>
            <li>within a week, i was noticing new growth where i had applied the product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not seeing any new growth.  </li>
            <li>For some reason my right brow responded more than my left brow (which is worse than the right brow).  </li>
            <li>within a few weeks i saw a difference in the appearance of my brows, which were very sparse &amp; light to begin with....</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something natural and decent priced</li>
            <li>little bottle is clearly labeled with natural POTENT ingredients, all targeted to stimulate hair growth and strengthen the existing brow.  </li>
            <li>but i cant completely knock this product or its results either!</li>
            <li>For reference, at 13 I started plucking my eyebrows, then started getting them professionally waxed.  </li>
            <li>Surprised?</li>
            <li>The product lasts quite awhile and does improve brow growth naturally with oils, rather than with chemicals.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that was just developed just for the brows &amp; targets growth &amp; thickness...</li>
            <li>Her whole line is amazing.....and quality is second to none.</li>
            <li>As of now (about 3 days in) no results,but then again, it is waaaay too early to tell, rapid or not.</li>
            <li>I will update in several weeks if I remember to haha.</li>
            <li>So far no complaints.</li>
            <li>i decided to try this one because i could pronounce almost all of the ingredients (there&#x27;s one ingredient that i don&#x27;t recognize, which means it might not be naturally occuring in the world but a synthesized chemical)</li>
            <li>So my review is based on the fact that it is completely un-usable by me.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it is because i am 72 years old, but this is the age when we need help.</li>
            <li>while it looks very homemade and simple, it WORKS.</li>
            <li>was surprised when i received this because the packaging looks unprofessional.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows aren&#x27;t completely grown-out to the point that I will stop using the product or drawing in my eyebrows yet....</li>
            <li>That being said, if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and keep applying you will see the results.</li>
            <li>They are even getting full where I previously had almost none before losing them.  </li>
            <li>I went from literally no eyebrows to a decent amount in only one week!</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s true, but I found no improvement in making my brows a little fuller.</li>
            <li>:) I know different products work for different body chemistries, but my hair for my brows have never grown in this thick or fast</li>
            <li>Everytime i did, the very next day new hair was clearly growing in that area.</li>
            <li>This makes your eyebrows red, creates a white flaky type of rash and very itchy.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this really helps the brows grow exactly, although it seems to.</li>
            <li>It did itch a little bit (but subsided and now do not even notice) but not bad enough to stop using, and just thought of it as \\&quot;working.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June</li>
            <li>i won&#x27;t go back to my old brow accelerator, which contained a ton of fillers (water, alcohol, silicone, polyoxyethanol, fragrance.)  </li>
            <li>You can actually feel and see that new hairs are starting to come out.</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to get into eyes, don&#x27;t apply too much, just a tiny bit.</li>

            <li> First, though I followed instructions to shake the contents, it never blended well.  </li>
            <li> I will most definitely continue to use this product with hope!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why I fell for this hype?!</li>
            <li> I even put castor oil on them first then the Serum over it.</li>
            <li> I tried to shake it vigorously to get the product mixed better</li>
            <li> It took about 2-3 weeks for any improvement, then all of a sudden brow grow like magic.  </li>
            <li> I still wasn&#x27;t able to get it mixed up very well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really make your skin itch (unless maybe you have super sensitive skin) and it certainly doesn&#x27;t make hair grow all over your face if you fall asleep with it on</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> It really does work if you use it consistantly.</li>
            <li> He was ready to try any thing.  </li>
            <li> After losing them completely do to medical reasons, I tried this and within a couple weeks they have filled in beyond my wildest dreams.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really get the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> I really need something that follows through and produce results.</li>
            <li> I have not seen that much improvement with my eyebrows and would not purchase this again.  </li>
            <li> really  wanted this to work</li>
            <li> and for three weeks, it has really has not shown any sign on eyebrows or temple.  </li>
            <li> and it was definitely reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It has helped me so much with my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have very thing sparse brows</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a funky smell and is really shiny</li>
            <li> and I recommend it for anyone to try, especially if you like more natural products.</li>
            <li> the price is so outstanding &amp; reasonable &amp; the serum lasts a very long time!!...</li>
            <li> I have used many eye brow growth items, and this is the greasiest and very wet one I have ever used...</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes it would quickly help my over plucked eyebrows grow back, it does say \\&quot;Rapid\\&quot; in the name!</li>
            <li> you have the top on TIGHTLY before shaking....</li>
            <li> Maybe this would have happened anyway after treatment, but I highly doubt it.  </li>
            <li> If you over tweezed in high school like everyone else, you NEED this product</li>
            <li> I tried to wear it at nite as directed, but it made my bedding, hair and everything stink to high heaven.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about 3 weeks now every night but one, and though I&#x27;ve seen what looks like it may be a little growth, I can&#x27;t be sure.  </li>
            <li> but then you have to continuously use them or the new growth sheds.</li>
            <li> within a week, i was noticing new growth where i had applied the product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not seeing any new growth.  </li>
            <li> For some reason my right brow responded more than my left brow (which is worse than the right brow).  </li>
            <li> within a few weeks i saw a difference in the appearance of my brows, which were very sparse &amp; light to begin with....</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something natural and decent priced</li>
            <li> little bottle is clearly labeled with natural POTENT ingredients, all targeted to stimulate hair growth and strengthen the existing brow.  </li>
            <li> but i cant completely knock this product or its results either!</li>
            <li> For reference, at 13 I started plucking my eyebrows, then started getting them professionally waxed.  </li>
            <li> Surprised?</li>
            <li> The product lasts quite awhile and does improve brow growth naturally with oils, rather than with chemicals.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that was just developed just for the brows &amp; targets growth &amp; thickness...</li>
            <li> Her whole line is amazing.....and quality is second to none.</li>
            <li> As of now (about 3 days in) no results,but then again, it is waaaay too early to tell, rapid or not.</li>
            <li> I will update in several weeks if I remember to haha.</li>
            <li> So far no complaints.</li>
            <li> i decided to try this one because i could pronounce almost all of the ingredients (there&#x27;s one ingredient that i don&#x27;t recognize, which means it might not be naturally occuring in the world but a synthesized chemical)</li>
            <li> So my review is based on the fact that it is completely un-usable by me.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it is because i am 72 years old, but this is the age when we need help.</li>
            <li> while it looks very homemade and simple, it WORKS.</li>
            <li> was surprised when i received this because the packaging looks unprofessional.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows aren&#x27;t completely grown-out to the point that I will stop using the product or drawing in my eyebrows yet....</li>
            <li> That being said, if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and keep applying you will see the results.</li>
            <li> They are even getting full where I previously had almost none before losing them.  </li>
            <li> I went from literally no eyebrows to a decent amount in only one week!</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s true, but I found no improvement in making my brows a little fuller.</li>
            <li> :) I know different products work for different body chemistries, but my hair for my brows have never grown in this thick or fast</li>
            <li> Everytime i did, the very next day new hair was clearly growing in that area.</li>
            <li> This makes your eyebrows red, creates a white flaky type of rash and very itchy.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this really helps the brows grow exactly, although it seems to.</li>
            <li> It did itch a little bit (but subsided and now do not even notice) but not bad enough to stop using, and just thought of it as \\&quot;working.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June</li>
            <li> i won&#x27;t go back to my old brow accelerator, which contained a ton of fillers (water, alcohol, silicone, polyoxyethanol, fragrance.)  </li>
            <li> You can actually feel and see that new hairs are starting to come out.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get into eyes, don&#x27;t apply too much, just a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> Now it doesn&#x27;t happen over night but nonetheless the hair does grow back a little faster then it normally would.</li>
            <li> i purchased this little gem when my high priced brow growth serum disappeared from my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, long story short researched this product and it actually does work.</li>
            <li> Now having used this product, my eye brows are super thick!</li>
            <li> thinking there&#x27;s not much you can do about barely there eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The liquid is pretty thick when i put it on your brows and it made my skin have a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> Not so with this stuff, it enables new growth that doesn&#x27;t shed if you don&#x27;t use it everyday two days or whatever.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried castor oil, some Anastasia brow growth stuff, as well as several other serums I found here on Amazon for my over-plucked brows.  </li>
            <li> They still didn&#x27;t grow back &amp; for the past 3 years I&#x27;ve been trying different growth formulas to bring them back.  </li>
            <li> I only use the product every other night every two weeks.</li>
            <li> Based on the positive reviews on here, I&#x27;m looking forward to having very THICK brows... think Brooke Shields.</li>
            <li> Be warned that there is a slight tingling and burning sensation, but it wears off about the 3rd or so use</li>
            <li> I will be looking for something with less runny oils next time</li>
            <li> perhaps I did not use it enough, not sure if this item actually works or not.</li>
            <li> Yes it did help a little bit and some hair did grow back</li>
            <li> I am not sure which formula I bought is doing the work, I use one in the morning and the other at night, but the hairs are starting to grow back...</li>
            <li> This product was extremely itchy and it made my eyebrows flaky and dry.</li>
            <li> and, it&#x27;s mostly natural, so i don&#x27;t mind putting it on my delicate skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been having trouble growing them back.</li>
            <li> It has no box and its not really a registered product that you can buy in drugstores.</li>
            <li> so no real substantial and definitive improvement was registered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen new hairs start to grow back in both above and below my meager brows.  </li>
            <li> Some other brow treatments just make the hairs you have grow longer, others seem to work</li>
            <li> The bottle looked like a fake at first when I started using it, I saw a differencr after like a week.</li>
            <li> I have a scattered eyebrows due to overplucking.</li>
            <li> Tried other products but did not work.</li>
            <li> The mixture separated like oil and water, its gooey, it&#x27;s oily, it&#x27;s gross and it&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
            <li> can say after a little over a week, i actually have a few hairs growing out.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;The seller refunded my purchase and sent me 2 replacements because apparently they sent me a bad batch the first time.</li>
            <li> i was letting the oils soak in and just wiped if i felt it was running down a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your skin breaks out with oils, it may give you a little pimple  with this if you try to apply it or get it on your other parts of your face.</li>
            <li> since I have less brow hair at the end of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> and then I noticed less and less hair.  </li>
            <li> Rather than &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; the formula on like you may be tempted to, given the set up, I would advise putting the oil onto a Q-Tip and applying it that way, as to minimize mess and waste.</li>
            <li> I applied it a little lower than eyebrow line to see if it was in fact working.  </li>
            <li> and it smears a little.</li>
            <li> At the very least I want it to stop the loss of what I currently have.  </li>
            <li> Initially, what came from the bottle was irritating to my skin, made me itch.  </li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, I was getting calls from some of his friends asking me how they order it, too.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I did find the oils to be quite messy, though.</li>
            <li> I used it for several weeks and tried to continue, but my eyebrows where getting worse.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for everyone who has trouble growing in hair.</li>
            <li> I shall give it another few weeks though, since it may perhaps take longer with some people.  </li>
            <li> all in all, i would definitely recommend this to anyone with thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li> When I was younger the eyebrown style was arched and thin.</li>
            <li> I used everyday doe about two weeks</li>
            <li> i tried plain castor oil before this, and that did work a little.</li>
            <li> within 3 days I already saw small little hairs and now it&#x27;s been a few months</li>
            <li> I am a African American female with bad eyebrow length and shape!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there was an ingredient that I was allergic to, but I broke out in little bumps around my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> i knew that this was some kind of an experiment from a frustrated chemist and that it was mixed in their home kitchen, i wouldn&#x27;t have wasted $15 + $5 shipping for this crap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now a few times a week with very little results.</li>
            <li> and sometimes i get a little out of control with that!</li>
            <li> not sure I have been using it for a while but don&#x27;t see any change</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but always find what others write helpful.  </li>
            <li> And yes it does itch after applying but looked past that in hopes that it would work over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the ingredients doing its job or just a reaction I am having.</li>
            <li> I have no more eye brows than when i started 6 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> very messy product...</li>
            <li> I am not using this product due to over plucking, I&#x27;m using it because i am tired of filing in the tail that i never had.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way and ended up with oily droplets all over my bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad eyebrow job a couple months ago and was completely devastated.</li>
            <li> Seems to regrowing my brows slowly</li>
            <li> ( It&#x27;s oily, so you may have to wipe the slow drip oils off after applying and letting soak in for an hour.</li>
            <li> I suggest this product to anyone who is having trouble with there eyebrows!!</li>
            <li> Using it almost every night until its completion gave me results of no more patches or thin eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I seriously swear by this stuff,</li>
            <li> I guess there&#x27;s really no good batch.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t work for me and it plastered my eyebrows making them stiff as a board.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s in the cap when I remove it to use, or if the cap fits poorly.  </li>
            <li> For thin sparse brows it will take some time.  </li>
            <li> My brows are thin and I have been applying it as the directions say....</li>
            <li> That was ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Not good at all!!!</li>
            <li> they are faint but there.</li>
            <li> For those that it didn&#x27;t work, I am sorry.</li>
            <li> I made a mistake and had it sent to the wrong address, and they sent me another one-</li>
            <li> And the sad part is, I think it was working.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say it didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> Because unfortunately for me it gave me a sense of itchiness that quite bothered me</li>
            <li> By the age of 40, I had very thin brows that I couldn&#x27;t get to fill in.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed with products</li>
            <li> You would just use it like you would an eyeliner to hit the base of the lash line.</li>
            <li> This product smells really bad!</li>
            <li> I literally hate it...way overpriced for no results!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> not sure I have been using it for a while but don&#x27;t see any change</li>
            <li> I tried castor oil, some Anastasia brow growth stuff, as well as several other serums I found here on Amazon for my over-plucked brows.  This has by far been the best stuff.  I&#x27;ve seen new hairs start to grow back in both above and below my meager brows.  Some other brow treatments just make the hairs you have grow longer, others seem to work but then you have to continuously use them or the new growth sheds. Not so with this stuff, it enables new growth that doesn&#x27;t shed if you don&#x27;t use it everyday two days or whatever. This stuff also has an impressive ingredient list (no petroleum by products or parabens).  For reference, at 13 I started plucking my eyebrows, then started getting them professionally waxed.  At 24 I realized my brows were scrawny and almost non-existent, so I just stopped plucking &amp; waxing altogether.  They still didn&#x27;t grow back &amp; for the past 3 years I&#x27;ve been trying different growth formulas to bring them back.  This is the best I&#x27;ve found and I recommend it for anyone to try, especially if you like more natural products.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says.  You see results in about 1-2 weeks.  Be warned that there is a slight tingling and burning sensation, but it wears off about the 3rd or so use</li>
            <li> Surprised? Yes, nothing whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;They got my money. Don&#x27;t let them take your money lol.&lt;br /&gt;This should be a crime!!</li>
            <li> I left it in my suitcase in my car for a day and the liquid separated into many layers. Plus it doesn&#x27;t really work. Used it daily for over a month and nothing happened</li>
            <li> First, though I followed instructions to shake the contents, it never blended well.  Initially, what came from the bottle was irritating to my skin, made me itch.  Later, those irritants were gone and what was left was more oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle leaks the oily substance from the cap.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s in the cap when I remove it to use, or if the cap fits poorly.  I have to put a tissue under the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this works, I would have to use a magnifying glass to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the good ingredients would be good for my skin and might be better than strange chemicals.  Maybe that&#x27;s true, but I found no improvement in making my brows a little fuller.</li>
            <li> I had a bad eyebrow job a couple months ago and was completely devastated. Anyways, long story short researched this product and it actually does work. Now it doesn&#x27;t happen over night but nonetheless the hair does grow back a little faster then it normally would.</li>
            <li> Yes this stuff is amazing, despite the syrup smell it has lol. My eyebrows, although full, were full of patches and the ends just weren&#x27;t&#x27; coming in with what I used before this product. Now having used this product, my eye brows are super thick! :) I just have to keep the hair plucked under the dividing line where the arch is. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I only use the product every other night every two weeks. :) I know different products work for different body chemistries, but my hair for my brows have never grown in this thick or fast lol!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product :)</li>
            <li> I am not using this product due to over plucking, I&#x27;m using it because i am tired of filing in the tail that i never had.&lt;br /&gt;I can say after a little over a week, i actually have a few hairs growing out. I will most definitely continue to use this product with hope!&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased so far with the product.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE DO NOT DISCONTINUE&lt;br /&gt;[also, go check out this sellers l-ascorbic acid to make a vitamin c serum on their eBay page. greatly appreciate quality products))]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there was an ingredient that I was allergic to, but I broke out in little bumps around my eyebrows. I would suggest testing it to see if you have a reaction before covering your entire brow.</li>
            <li> Good product and good service.  I bought some for my mother and my two daughters.,  I like the product very much</li>
            <li> Used for 1 week. No improvement. Cannot wear when boyfriend is over since it inflames the skin beneath my eye.</li>
            <li> It really does work if you use it consistantly. The bottle looked like a fake at first when I started using it, I saw a differencr after like a week. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because it made my eye brows itchy the next day. But they looked fuller so I&#x27;ll deal with it.</li>
            <li> This product works!!!  My husband is prematurely gray and starting to lose his eyebrows.  I found this online.  He was ready to try any thing.  Within a few weeks, I was getting calls from some of his friends asking me how they order it, too.  They are now believers as well.  Worth the money, in fact it is a cheap fix.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of weeks.  I am noticing growth and hope to continue using it with success.  For thin sparse brows it will take some time.  I believe with continued use my brows will improve.</li>
            <li> This is junk.  I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but always find what others write helpful.  I got this because there had been reviews that said this worked.  Well, it does not!  It is junk.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Rapidlash works much better. Yeah, it is more money, but it works.  This may be cheaper, but it is junk.  I really don&#x27;t know why I fell for this hype?!</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes it would quickly help my over plucked eyebrows grow back, it does say \\&quot;Rapid\\&quot; in the name! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now a few times a week with very little results. Yes it did help a little bit and some hair did grow back but nothing like what I was expecting. And yes it does itch after applying but looked past that in hopes that it would work over time. I will use the entire bottle but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I used to over pluck my eye brows.  By the age of 40, I had very thin brows that I couldn&#x27;t get to fill in.  After losing them completely do to medical reasons, I tried this and within a couple weeks they have filled in beyond my wildest dreams.  They are even getting full where I previously had almost none before losing them.  Maybe this would have happened anyway after treatment, but I highly doubt it.  So glad I found this.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this product yet but I like the way it is bottled and packaged.Looks like it will be very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This made my brows itch which only meant that it was working! However I wasn&#x27;t using this religiously so I didn&#x27;t really get the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> I was so hoping this was going to work for me. The ingredients are good so I gave it two stars. But I did not see any results. I really need something that follows through and produce results. I guess I have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t work for me and it plastered my eyebrows making them stiff as a board.  It also made them itchy.  Everyone is different, but I didn&#x27;t like this.  I personally would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and worked well for my brows. While I didn&#x27;t see overnight results, it does contain the oils and nutrients vital for healthy brow growth, so I stayed pleased during continued use. I did find the oils to be quite messy, though. Just like the picture shows, the product is contained just like nail polish (with the same brush and everything). Rather than &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; the formula on like you may be tempted to, given the set up, I would advise putting the oil onto a Q-Tip and applying it that way, as to minimize mess and waste. The product lasts quite awhile and does improve brow growth naturally with oils, rather than with chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have not seen that much improvement with my eyebrows and would not purchase this again.  I am disappointed with products</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that was just developed just for the brows &amp; targets growth &amp; thickness...I have found it with Rapid Brow TM Growth formula!!...I just put it on at night before bed &amp; it works amazing results in no time!!...within a few weeks i saw a difference in the appearance of my brows, which were very sparse &amp; light to begin with....now they have filled in perfectly &amp; even darker in color to be noticed!!...the price is so outstanding &amp; reasonable &amp; the serum lasts a very long time!!...I am so happy I have found this formula &amp; I finally have eye brows I have always wanted!!...Thank you Model Supplies for this amazing product!!...Katherine</li>
            <li> I just received it. I&#x27;m excited! since I have less brow hair at the end of my eyebrows. It feels itchy so I have faith it&#x27;ll work on me. I will write a 2nd review soon in 1-2weeks about my results. Thank you.</li>
            <li> does nothing&lt;br /&gt;this is the biggest joke&lt;br /&gt;i dont know who is claiming that it helps them&lt;br /&gt;used for eyebrows and nothing</li>
            <li> This makes your eyebrows red, creates a white flaky type of rash and very itchy. Not good at all!!! I used it for several weeks and tried to continue, but my eyebrows where getting worse. I had to stop and no difference on my eyebrows. I didn&#x27;t see hair growing at all.</li>
            <li> Will be editing along the following coming weeks to edify fellow shoppers on how this product delivers. I was so excited when it arrived at my front step! Based on the positive reviews on here, I&#x27;m looking forward to having very THICK brows... think Brooke Shields. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Be Continued...</li>
            <li> Seems to regrowing my brows slowly</li>
            <li> I have used this for two months. I say almost no change. It is also to oily. You can&#x27;t use this unless you are alone at home. They even deleted my last review claiming that it was not about the seller. That was ridiculous!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY thing that has made my eyebrows grow!! I&#x27;ve tried billion dollar brows, Anastasia of Beverly Hills brow serum, castor oil, coconut oil, vitamin e oil, and every inexpensive drug store brand you can think of. I seriously swear by this stuff, within 3 days I already saw small little hairs and now it&#x27;s been a few months and I have almost full brows!!! If you over tweezed in high school like everyone else, you NEED this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week since I&#x27;ve started to use the formula and I am already seeing big results, my brows are thicker and fuller within just one week of applying it at night. It&#x27;s a miracle worker, absolutely love it &lt;3!</li>
            <li> It tingled every once in while. I felt like hair was growing.  I applied it a little lower than eyebrow line to see if it was in fact working.  Everytime i did, the very next day new hair was clearly growing in that area. I am not saying it was a big, beautiful bush of new growth! Im saying i could clearly see three o six new hairs now at surface that never grew there on their own before .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  These oil ingredients work for growing hair on their own and combined they  do work.  Obviously,  its oil based so before each application i used a q tip o metal beauty stick to stir the contents/ oils up.  Also, I used this on my personal spa nights when i wasnt expecting company and where i could apply it a couple hours before bed. ( It&#x27;s oily, so you may have to wipe the slow drip oils off after applying and letting soak in for an hour. Also, i wouldnt go on a date or have a special night in with someone  after its application! Again- private spa night.) it also prevented my eyebrows from falling out and oily enough that i was able to let it work during this process because tweezing right after applying oil isnt easy and sometimes i get a little out of control with that! So that was a good thing for me.  Using it almost every night until its completion gave me results of no more patches or thin eyebrows.  I am happy with results ! If your skin breaks out with oils, it may give you a little pimple  with this if you try to apply it or get it on your other parts of your face. Thats why i had a napkin for the hour or two i was letting the oils soak in and just wiped if i felt it was running down a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product worked. I will be looking for something with less runny oils next time but i cant completely knock this product or its results either!</li>
            <li> really  wanted this to work but after 4 weeks or so nothing. thinking there&#x27;s not much you can do about barely there eyebrows.</li>
            <li> You can actually feel and see that new hairs are starting to come out. I have a scattered eyebrows due to overplucking. Tried other products but did not work. I&#x27;m very very glad I found this online. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for months. I am amazed at the results!!!! Her whole line is amazing.....and quality is second to none.I would also like to add you can use your lashes. You would just use it like you would an eyeliner to hit the base of the lash line. You can&#x27;t beat this product!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this really helps the brows grow exactly, although it seems to. It definitely keeps those with trich from touching your eyebrows! It doesn&#x27;t really make your skin itch (unless maybe you have super sensitive skin) and it certainly doesn&#x27;t make hair grow all over your face if you fall asleep with it on and it smears a little.</li>
            <li> Been using it for quite sometime and seen no change</li>
            <li> One eyebrow was burned after 1 week using it nightly. I even put castor oil on them first then the Serum over it.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I overplucked my eyebrows for years and I have a skin picking disorder. I used to dig into my eyebrows using the tweezers. And because of all that they didn&#x27;t grow in. When they did the hair was very fine.  I stopped using my tweezers and used this twice a day. Just in one week my eyebrows are darker and thicker. I went from literally no eyebrows to a decent amount in only one week! It is just fabulous I recommend it for everyone who has trouble growing in hair.</li>
            <li> I received the product several days ago and have been following the instructions by \\&quot;polishing\\&quot; the product on my brows every night. My goodness does it itch! I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the ingredients doing its job or just a reaction I am having. My brows are not red nor irritated...just itchy. It wears off eventually. As of now (about 3 days in) no results,but then again, it is waaaay too early to tell, rapid or not. I will update in several weeks if I remember to haha.</li>
            <li> I had gone through the thinner brow stage and wanted my brows fuller again.  I definitely noticed a difference after a week, but I think consistency is key here.  I habitually applied it each night before bed and saw a noticeable difference in just one week.  Easy to apply...as if you were applying fingernail policy.  The solution did seem to settle after a bit, so be sure to shake well before each use.</li>
            <li> I bought this several weeks ago &amp; to be honest I have not seen any change. My brows are thin and I have been applying it as the directions say....still no growth. I am really hoping that this will work, I would love fuller brows. This does not itch at all-no reaction for me. This product didn&#x27;t work &amp; started to change colors-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about 3 weeks now every night but one, and though I&#x27;ve seen what looks like it may be a little growth, I can&#x27;t be sure.  I shall give it another few weeks though, since it may perhaps take longer with some people.  I gave it 3 stars to be fair as it may yet do the job.</li>
            <li> Rapid brow growth formula does not do what it says it will. This product is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am not sure which formula I bought is doing the work, I use one in the morning and the other at night, but the hairs are starting to grow back...they are faint but there. This has encouraged me to continue. For those that it didn&#x27;t work, I am sorry. I was also impressed with their delivery service. I made a mistake and had it sent to the wrong address, and they sent me another one-so now I have two bottles. So far no complaints.</li>
            <li> Sticky.  and for three weeks, it has really has not shown any sign on eyebrows or temple.  Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I started using this January 2013 and did see some growth, but not what I was hoping for.  At the very least I want it to stop the loss of what I currently have.  I will continue to use and am happy for those it has worked for.  My issue was not over-plucking as I stopped plucking about 6 years ago because they stopped growing and then I noticed less and less hair.  For some reason my right brow responded more than my left brow (which is worse than the right brow).  It did itch a little bit (but subsided and now do not even notice) but not bad enough to stop using, and just thought of it as \\&quot;working.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 2013:  This is my final assessment for this item, it did not work for me.  This is not to say that it won&#x27;t work for others as it does work for others posting their reviews.  My expectation was fuller brows and it did not happen.  Oh well . . .</li>
            <li> i got this for my thinning eyebrows. i tried plain castor oil before this, and that did work a little. however, it seemed to have done all it could do. i decided to try this one because i could pronounce almost all of the ingredients (there&#x27;s one ingredient that i don&#x27;t recognize, which means it might not be naturally occuring in the world but a synthesized chemical) and it was definitely reasonably priced. It&#x27;s been about 6 weeks and i am definitely getting hair growth. it&#x27;s maybe not &amp;#34;rapid&amp;#34;, depending on your timeframe, but it&#x27;s working. and, it&#x27;s mostly natural, so i don&#x27;t mind putting it on my delicate skin. all in all, i would definitely recommend this to anyone with thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This product was extremely itchy and it made my eyebrows flaky and dry. It almost appeared as if there were dandruff in my eyebrows. This product did not work whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks.  I decided to go with it based on the price and product reviews.  I will continue to measure the amount of eyebrow growth and follow up with my results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had decent eyebrows and ever since over plucking in highschool, I&#x27;ve had certain bald spots on my eyebrows where hair would not grow!! I wanted to try something natural and decent priced so I bought this. It itches like heck but it&#x27;s worth it!!! I believe that means its working. Use twice a day and within 2 months my eyebrows look like cara delevingne. Haven&#x27;t tried on lashes yet but im excited to!! Def buying this again!</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found this!  I unknowingly suffered with thyroid deficiency for years and my eyebrows were always short.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells absolutely horrid!!! I tried to wear it at nite as directed, but it made my bedding, hair and everything stink to high heaven. I had to quit using it for that reason. And the sad part is, I think it was working.  But I&#x27;ll never know, because I just can&#x27;t take the stink! So my review is based on the fact that it is completely un-usable by me.  I should just return it...</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use 2 swipes of Rapid Brow during the day since I work at a senior home. This product does leave a shine or greasy residue.  I am a African American female with bad eyebrow length and shape! I now see hair growing out of places I didnt see before. I am really happy with this product. It should last 6months. I will purchase again</li>
            <li> perhaps I did not use it enough, not sure if this item actually works or not. may be different on you.</li>
            <li> I am using the product which I have heard good things about and have faith that it will work for me too however, since it has only been a week, I will need to give it more time to see results.  Thank you</li>
            <li> using this product for over 4 weeks, NO results. It damages skin around the eyes...very messy product...I literally hate it...way overpriced for no results!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this product!! It has helped me so much with my eyebrows. I have very thing sparse brows and I&#x27;ve been having trouble growing them back. I literally tried everything you could possibly think of and nothing worked. I use this twice a day on top with coconut oil on top of it and it really works like wonders! I suggest this product to anyone who is having trouble with there eyebrows!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and within a couple days it started to work. Very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it if you are trying to fill in sparse brows.</li>
            <li> I have no more eye brows than when i started 6 weeks ago.  I have applied this product twice a day  Maybe it is because i am 72 years old, but this is the age when we need help.</li>
            <li> Just got this product today! Hopefully it works, so excited to try it!!! I&#x27;ll let you guys know if it actually works. 👌</li>
            <li> Sorry to say it didn&#x27;t work on me. When I was younger the eyebrown style was arched and thin. So I shaved some of my brows...big mistake! lol.. they never grew back in. Let this be a learning lesson for you gals...don&#x27;t shave your brows!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on many positive reviews. In the product directions description says to shake well before using. I could see some of the darker color liquids were settled to the bottom of the bottle after I shook it up.  I tried to shake it vigorously to get the product mixed better and then the  product ended up Spilling out of the bottle when I opened it.  I still wasn&#x27;t able to get it mixed up very well.  I tried it for a couple of weeks to see if It could be shaken up better after I used some of it and it still would not.  I don&#x27;t know if it would work without it being shaken up or not But I wanted to follow the directions for best results.  The liquid is pretty thick when i put it on your brows and it made my skin have a tingling sensation. I might give it another try and give it a month to see if it will work to actually make my eyebrows grow.</li>
            <li> I used everyday doe about two weeks and I didn&#x27;t notice any growth. It&#x27;s got a funky smell and is really shiny so I can only at night or when I&#x27;m not leaving the home.</li>
            <li> Problem here is the smell.  Very strong odor similar to cooking spices with garlic....if you can stomach that you might get some benefit.  It&#x27;s also quite oily/messy so make SURE you have the top on TIGHTLY before shaking....I learned that the hard way and ended up with oily droplets all over my bathroom mirror.  As to the success of the product, I haven&#x27;t seen much hair growth, but I will reserve that review until I give it a fair chance.....</li>
            <li> Did not notice any change.</li>
            <li> This product smells really bad! I could not use it more than 5 nights so could not see its effect!</li>
            <li> Rapid Brow does what is says it will do, but, if you use it at night hair will grow on your face as well.  Better to use this during the day if you can since you are not rubbing against a pillow or tossing and turning.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a while now. This definitely works great for lashes, I&#x27;m going to try the bigger bottle for sure tho I think it will have a better effect for brows and hair growth. Thank you, timing  was on schedule and well packaged.</li>
            <li> I lost some of my eyebrows as a result of a skin cancer treatment.  This product did fill in some sparse spots which is great though I had hoped for a little more.  I felt the brush applicator (like used for nail polish) was too flimsy for the oil mixture--something stiffer would work better.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of days now.  But I do like the fact that the ingredients are all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was delivered to within a couple of days.  Very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a couple of times and yes I&#x27;ve seen my eyebrows grow but they are still really light... Maybe I&#x27;m not using it enough though so that&#x27;s why I only give it 3 Stars</li>
            <li> Well, it does!  It took about 2-3 weeks for any improvement, then all of a sudden brow grow like magic.  Easy to use and it works!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff often. I over plucked my eyebrows growing up and it has helped my hairs grow in faster! Just be careful not to get into eyes, don&#x27;t apply too much, just a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> I have used many eye brow growth items, and this is the greasiest and very wet one I have ever used... I purchase something else and this is just sitting in my drawer...</li>
            <li> This is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for -- definitely going to give it a try!!!</li>
            <li> i purchased this little gem when my high priced brow growth serum disappeared from my bathroom.  within a week, i was noticing new growth where i had applied the product.  i won&#x27;t go back to my old brow accelerator, which contained a ton of fillers (water, alcohol, silicone, polyoxyethanol, fragrance.)  i&#x27;ve worked in beauty for years, and i&#x27;ve never seen anything quite like it!&lt;br /&gt;this little bottle is clearly labeled with natural POTENT ingredients, all targeted to stimulate hair growth and strengthen the existing brow.  while it looks very homemade and simple, it WORKS.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;The seller refunded my purchase and sent me 2 replacements because apparently they sent me a bad batch the first time. Turns out I still had to throw them away again because they still separated like oil and water when I received them. I guess there&#x27;s really no good batch. I am currently using the MAVALA double lash and it is WAY better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised when i received this because the packaging looks unprofessional. The label is printed out from a home printer. It has no box and its not really a registered product that you can buy in drugstores. It&#x27;s as if it was formulated in a home kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did nothing for me, I used it for a month or so on my brows and my lashes. The mixture separated like oil and water, its gooey, it&#x27;s oily, it&#x27;s gross and it&#x27;s a waste of money! (see photo I posted)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If i knew that this was some kind of an experiment from a frustrated chemist and that it was mixed in their home kitchen, i wouldn&#x27;t have wasted $15 + $5 shipping for this crap. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month and I&#x27;m not seeing any new growth.  I&#x27;ll keep using until it&#x27;s gone and then rerate if a change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and have definitely seen results. My eyebrows aren&#x27;t completely grown-out to the point that I will stop using the product or drawing in my eyebrows yet.... but I can see more and more results as I continue to use this product. I make sure to use it every night before I go to bed. For the price of this product I recommend anyone trying to grow back their eyebrow hair to use this!!! Great price!!! I do not have any complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> So, the truth about this serum is that yes it makes your eyebrows grow back so whoo-hoo!! Then why did I rate it 3 stars? Because unfortunately for me it gave me a sense of itchiness that quite bothered me and once I stopped applying the new hair that had come out got very fine so no real substantial and definitive improvement was registered. That being said, if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and keep applying you will see the results.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this &amp; recently started using it (abouta week into it); haven&#x27;t seen any growth yet but will be fair and wait until I use the entire bottle.</li>
