    <ol>
            <li>This is a great find!</li>
            <li>While it does not have the greatest smell in the world it does give you a dose of magnesium which is something that we need to thrive.</li>

            <li>great product, no perfumes or unneeded additives</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a great product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t take magnesium orally, so it was a great alternative.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with it, and will keep this in my repertoire.</li>
            <li>it is a great lotion</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Great as a lotion, but don&#x27;t expect it to take away joint pain or increase your levels of magnesium.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for improving health.  </li>
            <li>Great for muscle spasms.</li>
            <li>Great for aching feet.</li>
            <li>It also said the best way to effectively absorb Magnesium is trans-dermally (though the skin) not through vitamin supplements.  </li>
            <li>and a great deodorant&lt;br /&gt;magnesium</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Seems to work fairly well</li>
            <li>This product is just as good as the one without the &amp;#34;Ultra&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Take your business elsewhere and support good companies.</li>
            <li>My legs and arms feel so good .  </li>
            <li>I sleep good at night.</li>
            <li>so apparently it is good for weight lifters too.</li>
            <li>Excited about this lotion, works wonderful.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of lotion but for people who are, that would be the one (the reason for my four star rating) .Magnesium is best absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion!</li>
            <li>They love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion!</li>
            <li>Would love using this lotion if I could get it out of the bottle!</li>
            <li>and this is a great product for easy application.</li>
            <li>A good way to get more magnesium into your tissues, - immediately absorbable.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think the sale may have gone through EBAY</li>
            <li>I like it better than the oil, but still fairly tacky</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t always want to soak in epsom salts or take oral supplements, this is a good way to get a bit more of magnesium into the system.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from joint issues and this has been a good healthy alternative to taking a pill for relief.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Ancient Minerals Magnesium lotion has been the best by far!</li>
            <li>Lotion is easier to use but the  oil is much more effective.</li>
            <li>The magnesium in this lotion is easy to apply and within 15 minutes of application on any site, I get relief!</li>
            <li>but it feels great on skin and that I like very much....</li>
            <li>In general Magnesium is beyond impressive.</li>
            <li>Also, I was originally interested in magnesium lotion to increase our intake of magnesium; which is best absorbed through the skin.  </li>
            <li>Good price, quick ship, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant smelling lotion that does not irritate the skin, even with magnesium</li>
            <li>I love this because it is not as greasy as the oil form and works as well.</li>
            <li>This product came with labels and top intact.</li>
            <li>This stuff is better than arnica gel.  </li>
            <li>Nutrasal makes magnesium lotion with l arginine and it&#x27;s better than this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t support them with any more business.</li>
            <li>very nourishing  a great way to get magnesium.</li>
            <li>If I could give more stars, I would.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion ever.</li>
            <li>I think this is my tenth bottle - rub on for leg cramps and in 15 minutes you feel better and happier.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite formulation of this product line.</li>
            <li>Travels better too.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better for me.</li>
            <li>I love the lotion and also use the magnesium oil with the aloe vera in it.</li>
            <li>so I can work out better.</li>
            <li>I have read the magnesium books and love them all,.</li>
            <li>love it can&#x27;t do without it</li>
            <li>Would not purchse the LOTION again, LOVE THE OIL and would not be without it.</li>
            <li>( I find if I drink too many caffeinated beverages, whether teas or coffees etc.</li>
            <li>then my need for magnesium increases a lot more as well ).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m EXTREMELY pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This helpped me more than anything when I got a muscle spasm.  </li>
            <li>I also tried magnesium oil, but for some reason the lotion worked better to relieve the pain.  </li>
            <li>Overall very happy with it.</li>
            <li>although I love Ancient Minerals Magnesium lotion....</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, odor free, lotion and does not sting like the pure &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Great to use on areas that are sensitive to Magnesium spray.</li>
            <li>It is a great way to help magnesium deficiency which nearly everyone has.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and rubs in easily.  </li>
            <li>and I am easy, breezy, sleepy in 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>the OptiMSM in tandem with the magnesium salt was a huge part of it.  </li>
            <li>If you purchase Ancient Minerals from the manufacturer, the product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, and basically fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>The magnesium lotion is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I had a biceps tendenitis and I applied this lotion either before or after a hot shower for better absorption, twice a day.</li>
            <li>or I have to take off the cap and slam the bottle against the side of my (clean) sink so some of the lotion lands in the sink and</li>
            <li>Such a good way to get the magnesium you need.</li>
            <li>Super stuff recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li>It has helped me tremendously with all of my magnesium deficiency symptoms.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1 month now &amp; can definitely say that I&#x27;ve enjoyed slightly better sleeping</li>
            <li>This helps my husband&#x27;s back pain better than most pain lotions.</li>
            <li>When I found this product with the lotion in the ingredients I was quick to try it.</li>
            <li>taking in adequate levels causes diarrhea,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Quickly absorbs into skin and starts working within 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have tried about 10 different magnesium compounds (pills like chelate vs citrate etc) and absorbing through the skin is more effective.</li>
            <li>good for really dry skin if you have been in a cars works well!</li>
            <li>It does help calm and relax you.</li>
            <li>I do mag oil and drink mag calm but this lotion by Ancient Minerals is the bomb.  </li>
            <li>I also drink CALM.</li>
            <li>I do not know if it is absorbed into my system however.</li>
            <li>This is a more direct route to getting the magnesium into her system.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it a million times and it is worth the money for the relief it gives.</li>
            <li>supplier shipped promptly and product arrived exactly as described very satisfied overall</li>
            <li>I have strong cramps in legs and feet particularly at night.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and natural and very mild.</li>
            <li>I recently read an article about how important Magnesium is for our bodies and that so many ailments are really symptoms of Magnesium deficiency.  </li>
            <li>Good product, i mix with magnesium oil, lotion seems a little sticky at first but quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>So I decided to give this lotion a try and in the last 4-6 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change!  </li>
            <li>My husband was skeptical, but he&#x27;s used it on a knee that had a knee replacement 8 months ago, and he is impressed.</li>
            <li>but after 2 months of applying magnesium lotion every night at bedtime my skin is clear, smooth and glowing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pleased and will definitely order this again!</li>
            <li>Much much easier to use than an oil or gel!</li>
            <li>Overall I love this stuff and it helps with leg cramps.</li>
            <li>Suffer from FMS and this kills my pain enough to be able to fall asleep.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely lotion that I can apply anywhere on my body without itching, or residue left in my skin.</li>
            <li>l mostly use the lotion to rub my neck, back, &amp; shoulders before I work out</li>
            <li>I have just recently started using Magnesium oil, which I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>one is not shipped by Amazon, and the only difference is this bottle comes with MSM in it for $2 more.</li>
            <li>It is thought to be chronically low in most Americans</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and absorbs (with a little rubbing :)  </li>
            <li>No painful pustules; no crusty scabs; no redness; no butterfly rash and no hard,</li>
            <li>When I read that some people had positive results treating eczema and psoriasis with magnesium lotion, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Very smooth on my very dry face.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to help my dry feet.</li>
            <li>I love Ancient Minerals especially this new ultra formula.</li>
            <li>It really helps alleviate muscle tightness or pain, and it does have a calming affect as well.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and has no scent.</li>
            <li>After using this lotion my skin feels hydrated and very so</li>
            <li>So much of the magnesium we need is depleted if we take it as an oral supplement.</li>
            <li>really like the way it feels.</li>
            <li>this really WORKS.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Initially, I was looking for water based white (decolorized) iodine to treat my acne rosacea as antibiotics were no longer effective...</li>
            <li>As a Massage Therapist always looking for ways to bring my clients relief - use it personally and professionally and have found it to be most helpful  Between this and Arnicare</li>
            <li>It will burn for about 30 seconds to 1 minute if you put it on eczema-riddled skin, but it takes out the itch right away and leaves your hands soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s eliminated my heart flutters and palpitations, carpal tunnel, arthritis, leg and feet cramps and many other symptoms.  </li>
            <li>I can use my hand to grab a decent amount of product....</li>
            <li>the Con side: The main problem I have is with the packaging.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping I would have a little more time to rub it in (use as a pain rub-it doesn&#x27;t serve this purpose)...</li>
            <li>was expecting a lotion that would easily be absorbed like the progesterone cream that I use twice daily.  </li>
            <li>goes away whereas it would normally last,several minutes.</li>
            <li>It tingles on normal skin, helps you sleep</li>
            <li>When I first starting using it, it really made my skin tingle, but after using it every night for about a month the tingling stopped.</li>
            <li>nice and thick.</li>
            <li>It helps sore stiff muscles and makes me rest better at night...</li>
            <li>This product helps me live with my chronic pain.</li>
            <li>I still use it on a regular basis and enjoy it as a regular lotion.</li>
            <li>Have to take magnesium transdermaly due to many bowel surgeries and absorption issues as oral magnesium only exacerbates the issues.</li>
            <li>This lotion is also much too thick and the bottle much too narrow for optimum dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely no benefit from this product when I used it for relief from mild muscle cramping or soreness.</li>
            <li>When I first applied the lotion it stung a bit (but then so did the decolorized iodine that I had been using) and the breakout got worse (before it got better)</li>
            <li>It takes a little while later, but soon your skin will also start to look better.</li>
            <li>However, it does help some to reduce pain naturally for a time (at least for my family :).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far</li>
            <li>PLUS, the coconut oil and shea butter makes my skin so soft and the moisture stays with me, but isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>As a lotion, it goes on well and dries completely, leaving no oily residue.</li>
            <li>Putting this lotion on stops this as no other prescribed medications could!</li>
            <li>Still using this - you really have to rub it in but isn&#x27;t that bad - so far so good</li>
            <li>This is the bomb; it goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t cause excessive itching (if at all)</li>
            <li>but I also use it to calm down itchy eczema.</li>
            <li>The next handiest would be if the lid was large enough and flat enough it could be stored upside down easily.</li>
            <li>Really helps the dry skin on hands and feet.  </li>
            <li>I used it recently on my back after shoveling almost a foot of snow and completely took away the soreness!</li>
            <li>Long story short, after 2 months of using this product, my rosacea is much improved.</li>
            <li>If you search, you can find pure zechstein magnesium oil, gel, lotion and flakes from other companies like AllVia, Life-flo and Swanson.</li>
            <li>The lotion is so thick that it would drain from the original bottle into another bottle even after being left for hours.</li>

            <li> I think this is my tenth bottle - rub on for leg cramps and in 15 minutes you feel better and happier.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite formulation of this product line.</li>
            <li> Travels better too.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better for me.</li>
            <li> I love the lotion and also use the magnesium oil with the aloe vera in it.</li>
            <li> so I can work out better.</li>
            <li> I have read the magnesium books and love them all,.</li>
            <li> love it can&#x27;t do without it</li>
            <li> Would not purchse the LOTION again, LOVE THE OIL and would not be without it.</li>
            <li> ( I find if I drink too many caffeinated beverages, whether teas or coffees etc.</li>
            <li> then my need for magnesium increases a lot more as well ).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m EXTREMELY pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This helpped me more than anything when I got a muscle spasm.  </li>
            <li> I also tried magnesium oil, but for some reason the lotion worked better to relieve the pain.  </li>
            <li> Overall very happy with it.</li>
            <li> although I love Ancient Minerals Magnesium lotion....</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, odor free, lotion and does not sting like the pure &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Great to use on areas that are sensitive to Magnesium spray.</li>
            <li> It is a great way to help magnesium deficiency which nearly everyone has.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and rubs in easily.  </li>
            <li> and I am easy, breezy, sleepy in 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> the OptiMSM in tandem with the magnesium salt was a huge part of it.  </li>
            <li> If you purchase Ancient Minerals from the manufacturer, the product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, and basically fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> The magnesium lotion is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I had a biceps tendenitis and I applied this lotion either before or after a hot shower for better absorption, twice a day.</li>
            <li> or I have to take off the cap and slam the bottle against the side of my (clean) sink so some of the lotion lands in the sink and</li>
            <li> Such a good way to get the magnesium you need.</li>
            <li> Super stuff recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> It has helped me tremendously with all of my magnesium deficiency symptoms.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1 month now &amp; can definitely say that I&#x27;ve enjoyed slightly better sleeping</li>
            <li> This helps my husband&#x27;s back pain better than most pain lotions.</li>
            <li> When I found this product with the lotion in the ingredients I was quick to try it.</li>
            <li> taking in adequate levels causes diarrhea,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbs into skin and starts working within 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have tried about 10 different magnesium compounds (pills like chelate vs citrate etc) and absorbing through the skin is more effective.</li>
            <li> good for really dry skin if you have been in a cars works well!</li>
            <li> It does help calm and relax you.</li>
            <li> I do mag oil and drink mag calm but this lotion by Ancient Minerals is the bomb.  </li>
            <li> I also drink CALM.</li>
            <li> I do not know if it is absorbed into my system however.</li>
            <li> This is a more direct route to getting the magnesium into her system.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it a million times and it is worth the money for the relief it gives.</li>
            <li> supplier shipped promptly and product arrived exactly as described very satisfied overall</li>
            <li> I have strong cramps in legs and feet particularly at night.</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and natural and very mild.</li>
            <li> I recently read an article about how important Magnesium is for our bodies and that so many ailments are really symptoms of Magnesium deficiency.  </li>
            <li> Good product, i mix with magnesium oil, lotion seems a little sticky at first but quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> So I decided to give this lotion a try and in the last 4-6 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change!  </li>
            <li> My husband was skeptical, but he&#x27;s used it on a knee that had a knee replacement 8 months ago, and he is impressed.</li>
            <li> but after 2 months of applying magnesium lotion every night at bedtime my skin is clear, smooth and glowing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am pleased and will definitely order this again!</li>
            <li> Much much easier to use than an oil or gel!</li>
            <li> Overall I love this stuff and it helps with leg cramps.</li>
            <li> Suffer from FMS and this kills my pain enough to be able to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely lotion that I can apply anywhere on my body without itching, or residue left in my skin.</li>
            <li> l mostly use the lotion to rub my neck, back, &amp; shoulders before I work out</li>
            <li> I have just recently started using Magnesium oil, which I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> one is not shipped by Amazon, and the only difference is this bottle comes with MSM in it for $2 more.</li>
            <li> It is thought to be chronically low in most Americans</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and absorbs (with a little rubbing :)  </li>
            <li> No painful pustules; no crusty scabs; no redness; no butterfly rash and no hard,</li>
            <li> When I read that some people had positive results treating eczema and psoriasis with magnesium lotion, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Very smooth on my very dry face.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to help my dry feet.</li>
            <li> I love Ancient Minerals especially this new ultra formula.</li>
            <li> It really helps alleviate muscle tightness or pain, and it does have a calming affect as well.  </li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and has no scent.</li>
            <li> After using this lotion my skin feels hydrated and very so</li>
            <li> So much of the magnesium we need is depleted if we take it as an oral supplement.</li>
            <li> really like the way it feels.</li>
            <li> this really WORKS.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was looking for water based white (decolorized) iodine to treat my acne rosacea as antibiotics were no longer effective...</li>
            <li> As a Massage Therapist always looking for ways to bring my clients relief - use it personally and professionally and have found it to be most helpful  Between this and Arnicare</li>
            <li> It will burn for about 30 seconds to 1 minute if you put it on eczema-riddled skin, but it takes out the itch right away and leaves your hands soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s eliminated my heart flutters and palpitations, carpal tunnel, arthritis, leg and feet cramps and many other symptoms.  </li>
            <li> I can use my hand to grab a decent amount of product....</li>
            <li> the Con side: The main problem I have is with the packaging.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I would have a little more time to rub it in (use as a pain rub-it doesn&#x27;t serve this purpose)...</li>
            <li> was expecting a lotion that would easily be absorbed like the progesterone cream that I use twice daily.  </li>
            <li> goes away whereas it would normally last,several minutes.</li>
            <li> It tingles on normal skin, helps you sleep</li>
            <li> When I first starting using it, it really made my skin tingle, but after using it every night for about a month the tingling stopped.</li>
            <li> nice and thick.</li>
            <li> It helps sore stiff muscles and makes me rest better at night...</li>
            <li> This product helps me live with my chronic pain.</li>
            <li> I still use it on a regular basis and enjoy it as a regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Have to take magnesium transdermaly due to many bowel surgeries and absorption issues as oral magnesium only exacerbates the issues.</li>
            <li> This lotion is also much too thick and the bottle much too narrow for optimum dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely no benefit from this product when I used it for relief from mild muscle cramping or soreness.</li>
            <li> When I first applied the lotion it stung a bit (but then so did the decolorized iodine that I had been using) and the breakout got worse (before it got better)</li>
            <li> It takes a little while later, but soon your skin will also start to look better.</li>
            <li> However, it does help some to reduce pain naturally for a time (at least for my family :).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far</li>
            <li> PLUS, the coconut oil and shea butter makes my skin so soft and the moisture stays with me, but isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li> As a lotion, it goes on well and dries completely, leaving no oily residue.</li>
            <li> Putting this lotion on stops this as no other prescribed medications could!</li>
            <li> Still using this - you really have to rub it in but isn&#x27;t that bad - so far so good</li>
            <li> This is the bomb; it goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t cause excessive itching (if at all)</li>
            <li> but I also use it to calm down itchy eczema.</li>
            <li> The next handiest would be if the lid was large enough and flat enough it could be stored upside down easily.</li>
            <li> Really helps the dry skin on hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> I used it recently on my back after shoveling almost a foot of snow and completely took away the soreness!</li>
            <li> Long story short, after 2 months of using this product, my rosacea is much improved.</li>
            <li> If you search, you can find pure zechstein magnesium oil, gel, lotion and flakes from other companies like AllVia, Life-flo and Swanson.</li>
            <li> The lotion is so thick that it would drain from the original bottle into another bottle even after being left for hours.</li>
            <li> Too thick -difficult to get out of the bottle, then doesn&#x27;t seem to be very effective</li>
            <li> It is very thick and rich.  </li>
            <li> I dont know what difference MSM would really make, probably not much, but after being accustomed to true 2-day shipping... not impressed by the seller&#x27;s estimated delivery speed.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I have a kidney condition, and easily get terrible muscle cramping.</li>
            <li> This is thick and it dries with a light chalky residue so you may want to rub it in a hidden area like the tummy.</li>
            <li> A bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This lotion lasts a long time....</li>
            <li> The lotion is so thick you really need to work to get it to come out of the spout by squeezing the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I like it a lot, thick lotion, absorbs very well, no noticeable fragrance.</li>
            <li> I use it from my knees to my ankles at night and have to wash it off the next morning due to the tacky feeling it leaves on my skin; because of that I don&#x27;t look forward to using it each night.</li>
            <li> Gave this five stars because it  provides moisture to dry skin and helps with some of my muscle pain.</li>
            <li> so it takes a bit to dry fully.</li>
            <li> I finally resorted to storing it upside down -</li>
            <li> We have used it for tight muscles, kids &amp;#34;leg pain&amp;#34; prevention &amp; inflammation related pain.  </li>
            <li> so well not much is needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this on recommendation from a nurse at the senior center for my senior friend.  </li>
            <li> Harder to get out of the bottle at the last few drops.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this lotion that has the MSM does anything different, as I did not notice anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had temporary improvement in the past with different treatments and prescriptions.</li>
            <li> Have tried other forms of transdermal Magnesium.</li>
            <li> I have to set up a way for it to stay upright by jamming it in between other bottles.</li>
            <li> The other problem I have with the product is there are slivers of what I figure is shaved magnesium that haven&#x27;t homogenized with the lotion base.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> no significant improvement in sleep as hoped, but time will tell.</li>
            <li> I usually squirt a tsp or so in with the other lotion I use at night and it blends together terrifically.</li>
            <li> It does sting a little if you scrub your skin or have irritated skin.</li>
            <li> It also may hydrate skin a little.</li>
            <li> and when dried does not leave a funky salt residue.</li>
            <li> The bottle is too stiff to squeeze.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is so stiff</li>
            <li> If your an active person adding Magnesium at least once a day is a must</li>
            <li> My solution was to transfer the contents to a wide jar with a screw on lid, similar to those that cold cream comes in.</li>
            <li> : a little pricy, hard to get out of bottle, needs a pump.</li>
            <li> I thought I had terrible arthritis, but my hands are not hurting any more.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to squeeze it enough to force the lotion out the small opening in the lid.</li>
            <li> I cannot give a manufacturer high ratings if I&#x27;m frustrated using their product.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe, but results occur as soon as the lotion is used.</li>
            <li> Pros: no smell, thick cream.</li>
            <li> Cream is quite thick.  </li>
            <li> It is thick</li>
            <li> The product is too thick to pour out of the container.</li>
            <li> Totally ridiculous packaging.  </li>
            <li> Although it was less expensive than purchasing from the manufacturer or evenIntegrated Health, who cares when you are receiving an expired product?</li>
            <li> It has decreased my shoulder/neck pain and muscle tightness by at least 50%.  </li>
            <li> and I am tired in no time.</li>
            <li> if wrong let me know...</li>
            <li> Sorry just telling it like it is.  </li>
            <li> I use it day and night to keep my magnesium levels up to prevent these awful cramps from occurring in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> I find this process of using the product very frustrating</li>
            <li> This helps the skin dryness in my feet by using it after soaking my feet in cold water which relieves burning and painful episodes caused by peripheral neuropathy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to get product out of this bottle after it&#x27;s been used for awhile for two reasons.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to even get a drop out of the hole in the dispenser cap.</li>
            <li> I have given her two bottles for her painful arm and shoulder.</li>
            <li> Feels awful on my skin.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This helps the skin dryness in my feet by using it after soaking my feet in cold water which relieves burning and painful episodes caused by peripheral neuropathy.  The water drys the skin but this lotion helps to lubricate it..</li>
            <li> Still using this - you really have to rub it in but isn&#x27;t that bad - so far so good</li>
            <li> I love this because it is not as greasy as the oil form and works as well.</li>
            <li> the dosage is only 20 ml. that seems low? but it feels great on skin and that I like very much....if wrong let me know...and I will then change to great...</li>
            <li> This lotion seems to relieve sore muscles almost as well as the stinky salve I get in Santa Fe.</li>
            <li> great product, no perfumes or unneeded additives</li>
            <li> Really helps the dry skin on hands and feet.  If there is a problem with this product, it is the container the manufacturer put it in.  The lotion is so thick you really need to work to get it to come out of the spout by squeezing the bottle.  Totally ridiculous packaging.  My solution was to transfer the contents to a wide jar with a screw on lid, similar to those that cold cream comes in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my knees and neck with very good results, and sometimes I&#x27;ve used it on my clients (I&#x27;m a massage therapist) and I tell them about it often.  A good way to get more magnesium into your tissues, - immediately absorbable.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, thick lotion, absorbs very well, no noticeable fragrance. Seems to help when I use it on the bottom of my feet if I have leg restlessness - (I&#x27;m not diagnosed with RL syndrome), it also seems to help with sleeping. I use it at night, and it makes a difference with nail and skin problem on my feet.</li>
            <li> Pros: no smell, thick cream. Seems to work fairly well&lt;br /&gt;Cons: a little pricy, hard to get out of bottle, needs a pump. I had an extra pump screwed it onto the bottle, worked like a charm. I would recommend this feature.</li>
            <li> This product came with labels and top intact. Nice lotion.</li>
            <li> Super stuff recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> Not sure if this lotion that has the MSM does anything different, as I did not notice anything.</li>
            <li> Magnesium product is very good. Lotion is easier to use but the  oil is much more effective.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a great product. I can&#x27;t take magnesium orally, so it was a great alternative.</li>
            <li> If you purchase Ancient Minerals from the manufacturer, the product is fantastic.  It has helped me tremendously with all of my magnesium deficiency symptoms.  It&#x27;s eliminated my heart flutters and palpitations, carpal tunnel, arthritis, leg and feet cramps and many other symptoms.  Whenever I receive my purchases from Ancient Minerals or even Integrated Health, the bottle always has an an expiration date on the bottom.  The only reason I purchased this product through Amazon this time was because it popped up while I was shopping on the site (YES BIG BROTHER watching).  Anyway, the bottle I purchased through Amazon seller had NO EXPIRATION DATE on the bottom.  Who knows -- it might have been rubbed off.  Sorry just telling it like it is.  Honestly, I think the sale may have gone through EBAY so this review is NOT of the product in it&#x27;s unexpired state.  During the time I used that bottle, ALL of my symptoms came raging back.  Although it was less expensive than purchasing from the manufacturer or evenIntegrated Health, who cares when you are receiving an expired product?</li>
            <li> I like it better than the oil, but still fairly tacky</li>
            <li> I found out from a Christian doctor that some people will have intestinal issues when they take the magnesium pills; so he recommends taking our magnesium from an oil or lotion.  I wish I had known that four years ago.  I could have saved myself from a lot of issues.  The lotion goes on well.  It&#x27;s not greasy and rubs in easily.  I sleep just as well as with the pills, but I no longer have all the intestinal issues.  My daughter couldn&#x27;t use the oil as it burned her skin.  The lotion has never given me any problems.</li>
            <li> any one who has sleep problems should try it  i have been trying to get off sleep medication for two years i started  my flakes and lotion and one night i just went to sleep  the sleep pill still on my night stand</li>
            <li> Absolutely no benefit from this product when I used it for relief from mild muscle cramping or soreness.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe, but results occur as soon as the lotion is used. I used it on a tricky knee after yoga and the pain was gone.  My husband was skeptical, but he&#x27;s used it on a knee that had a knee replacement 8 months ago, and he is impressed. In general Magnesium is beyond impressive.</li>
            <li> Burns anywhere I put it like I&#x27;m rubbing salt on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is just as good as the one without the &amp;#34;Ultra&amp;#34;. It helps sore stiff muscles and makes me rest better at night...</li>
            <li> If your an active person adding Magnesium at least once a day is a must and this is a great product for easy application.</li>
            <li> Cream is quite thick.  Decide if you want a cream or a liquid.  It does work the same as the liquid.  Harder to get out of the bottle at the last few drops.</li>
            <li> This stuff is better than arnica gel.  It really helps alleviate muscle tightness or pain, and it does have a calming affect as well.  I rub it on my hands at night when I&#x27;m feeling stressed out.  I&#x27;m really happy with it, and will keep this in my repertoire.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this to help with cramping in her feet with very good results.  She will be repurchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This is a great find! Sore muscle? Just massage into skin over area and have relief in about 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li> Nutrasal makes magnesium lotion with l arginine and it&#x27;s better than this stuff. Ancient Minerals is the rudest company on the planet and I wouldn&#x27;t support them with any more business. If you search, you can find pure zechstein magnesium oil, gel, lotion and flakes from other companies like AllVia, Life-flo and Swanson. Take your business elsewhere and support good companies.</li>
            <li> Good price, quick ship, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant smelling lotion that does not irritate the skin, even with magnesium content.&lt;br /&gt;So far no significant improvement in sleep as hoped, but time will tell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! While it does not have the greatest smell in the world it does give you a dose of magnesium which is something that we need to thrive. I use this at night before I go to bed along with another magnesium supplement and I am tired in no time. It does help calm and relax you.</li>
            <li> Wife Loves this. Helps to keep all her oils in one place.</li>
            <li> Since we don&#x27;t get enough of the stuff and I don&#x27;t always want to soak in epsom salts or take oral supplements, this is a good way to get a bit more of magnesium into the system.  Smooth, and basically fragrance free.  I usually squirt a tsp or so in with the other lotion I use at night and it blends together terrifically. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for over a year, and prefer getting magnesium trans-dermally. It is very moisturizing and has no scent. A bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> helps relieve shoulder and neck pain after rotator cuff surgery. This product provides enough relief to get off muscle relaxers</li>
            <li> With Fibromyalgia, I have burning and stinging in my legs. Putting this lotion on stops this as no other prescribed medications could!</li>
            <li> I use the oil too, but that often leaves a residue on my skin. This lotion does not do so and actually hydrates in addition to helping give the daily magnesium allowance. I use it on my children as well.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was looking for water based white (decolorized) iodine to treat my acne rosacea as antibiotics were no longer effective...When I read that some people had positive results treating eczema and psoriasis with magnesium lotion, I decided to give it a try. Long story short, after 2 months of using this product, my rosacea is much improved. No painful pustules; no crusty scabs; no redness; no butterfly rash and no hard, sub-dermal bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I can&#x27;t say that it was terrific in the beginning...When I first applied the lotion it stung a bit (but then so did the decolorized iodine that I had been using) and the breakout got worse (before it got better) but after 2 months of applying magnesium lotion every night at bedtime my skin is clear, smooth and glowing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had temporary improvement in the past with different treatments and prescriptions. I will update review if my rosacea symptoms return but until then, I will continue to use and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have started applying this to my legs to treat RLS.  Although I wouldn&#x27;t say it is a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; or  the only treatment...it is a great lotion and I have felt it helps!  I also take magnesium supplements but was convinced I needed to also use this lotion as well as Epsom salts baths.  I am pleased and will definitely order this again!</li>
            <li> Too thick -difficult to get out of the bottle, then doesn&#x27;t seem to be very effective</li>
            <li> nice and thick. very nourishing  a great way to get magnesium. good for really dry skin if you have been in a cars works well!</li>
            <li> I do mag oil and drink mag calm but this lotion by Ancient Minerals is the bomb.  My legs and arms feel so good .  Helps my feet a lot.  The bottoms drink it up.  Getting softer by each use.  I suffer from joint issues and this has been a good healthy alternative to taking a pill for relief.  Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This lotion lasts a long time....as it goes n so well not much is needed. So the bottle lasts! I havent had my levels checked only because i didn&#x27;t use this every day, but know it does replenish the magnesium!</li>
            <li> I use it from my knees to my ankles at night and have to wash it off the next morning due to the tacky feeling it leaves on my skin; because of that I don&#x27;t look forward to using it each night. I purchased it in lotion form hoping to avoid problems like that.  This lotion is also much too thick and the bottle much too narrow for optimum dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a lotion that would easily be absorbed like the progesterone cream that I use twice daily.  The latter absorbs so well that I have to keep track of where I last applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no sensation of stinging on my skin as some report but I&#x27;ve been supplementing magnesium orally for years.  Perhaps that makes the difference.</li>
            <li> I gave this to a friend with psoriasis. He says it helps</li>
            <li> Gave this five stars because it  provides moisture to dry skin and helps with some of my muscle pain. The scent is fresh and natural and very mild. After using this lotion my skin feels hydrated and very so ft. If I could give more stars, I would. Planning on using this product again.</li>
            <li> This stays on and soaks in. Very smooth on my very dry face. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I had stage 4 throat cancer and had to have radiation &amp; Chemo. The radiation caused me to have severe neck cramps. As soon as I felt one coming on I spread on the lotion &amp; the cramp goes away whereas it would normally last,several minutes. Truly an acient miracle.</li>
            <li> Such a good way to get the magnesium you need. So much of the magnesium we need is depleted if we take it as an oral supplement. This lotion provides a different way . Skin is our largest organ so it makes sense to use the lotion.</li>
            <li> Great as a lotion, but don&#x27;t expect it to take away joint pain or increase your levels of magnesium. Tried two bottles of it to give it the benefit of the doubt. Would probably not reorder.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for improving health.  I used it when I was experiencing some muscle spasms - Great results!  I will definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1 month now &amp; can definitely say that I&#x27;ve enjoyed slightly better sleeping patterns.&lt;br /&gt;I like it&#x27;s ease of use &amp; that it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think some of my night time joint pain has been relieved somewhat by the lotion because I fall asleep faster now then without it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep using it &amp; re-assess once I&#x27;m done with this bottle. I&#x27;ll leave an update at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michelle</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of lotion but for people who are, that would be the one (the reason for my four star rating) .Magnesium is best absorbed through the skin. I had a biceps tendenitis and I applied this lotion either before or after a hot shower for better absorption, twice a day. I coupled this treatment with magnesium salt (or Epsom salt) at my bath time...and my arm was restored within a month.</li>
            <li> Much much easier to use than an oil or gel!</li>
            <li> The BEST way to absorb magnesium I found. I have tried about 10 different magnesium compounds (pills like chelate vs citrate etc) and absorbing through the skin is more effective.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion ever. It tingles on normal skin, helps you sleep but I also use it to calm down itchy eczema. It will burn for about 30 seconds to 1 minute if you put it on eczema-riddled skin, but it takes out the itch right away and leaves your hands soft. It takes a little while later, but soon your skin will also start to look better.</li>
            <li> I think this is my tenth bottle - rub on for leg cramps and in 15 minutes you feel better and happier. This is my favorite formulation of this product line. I also drink CALM. This may not absorb totally, just wipe leg with a washcloth before bed.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Instead of taking a pill for pain, I immediately rush to use this on the pain site and there is almost instantaneous relief.</li>
            <li> Great for muscle spasms. Great to use on areas that are sensitive to Magnesium spray. No burning sensation. Travels better too. the spray bottle will leak but the lotion doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!! It helps relax me at night. I take a shower and put this lotion on afterwards and I am easy, breezy, sleepy in 30 to 45 minutes. This has helped keep my Eczema at bay, as well. It does sting a little if you scrub your skin or have irritated skin. Overall I love this stuff and it helps with leg cramps. I should send this to Lebron James!!! I&#x27;m just saying.</li>
            <li> I use this with my massage clients.  They love it!  It has a lot of glide and zero odor.  Clients have reported that when using it at home, it helps reduce muscle aches within an hour.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the oil. It seems to work better for me. I use it on my chest to relieve anxiety, and on sore muscles from exercise</li>
            <li> Great for aching feet. I rub the magnesium lotion on my feet at night. It soothes and relaxes your feet and assists with a restful sleep! Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> The magnesium lotion is fabulous.  It relaxes my muscles, controlling severe spasms. It also helps with sleep.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Suffer from FMS and this kills my pain enough to be able to fall asleep. Can&#x27;t do without it!</li>
            <li> Does not leave me feeling greasy...really like the way it feels.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Have to take magnesium transdermaly due to many bowel surgeries and absorption issues as oral magnesium only exacerbates the issues. This definitely helps with cramping! Have mag lotion is a must for me now!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin.</li>
            <li> I adore this lotion.  It is very thick and rich.  I do not know if it is absorbed into my system however.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t sleep without it, you won&#x27;t believe the results!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely lotion that I can apply anywhere on my body without itching, or residue left in my skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this every day, my Fibromyalgia doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I love Ancient Minerals especially this new ultra formula. I love the lotion and also use the magnesium oil with the aloe vera in it. l mostly use the lotion to rub my neck, back, &amp; shoulders before I work out so I can work out better. I do use the oil on occasion, perhaps at night. I sleep good at night. My sister loves this lotion. I have given her two bottles for her painful arm and shoulder. She loves it. My body craves this stuff. Thanks for this wonderful product. I have read the magnesium books and love them all,.</li>
            <li> This helps my husband&#x27;s back pain better than most pain lotions.</li>
            <li> love it can&#x27;t do without it</li>
            <li> I bought this on recommendation from a nurse at the senior center for my senior friend.  Her magnesium levels were low even with taking oral supplements.  This is a more direct route to getting the magnesium into her system.  It is working well for her.  I also saw it advertised in Muscle and Fitness so apparently it is good for weight lifters too.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! It works for aches! Non greasy too! It is thick so it takes a bit to dry fully.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, odor free, lotion and does not sting like the pure &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;.  It gives nearly instant relief to sore neck and shoulder muscles.  It is a great way to help magnesium deficiency which nearly everyone has.  It also may hydrate skin a little.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every night for six months.  It has decreased my shoulder/neck pain and muscle tightness by at least 50%.  I also apply it to any sore muscles from working out. I cannot be with out it. When I first starting using it, it really made my skin tingle, but after using it every night for about a month the tingling stopped.</li>
            <li> Would love using this lotion if I could get it out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> I just started using this magnesium lotion.  I already use magnesium oil spray and I can tell the difference whenever I use it on my aches and pains on my legs.  I would recommend this</li>
            <li> Keeps my legs from cramping!  I have used the Ancient Mineral OIL for several years but did NOT like the LOTION at all.  Feels awful on my skin. Would not purchse the LOTION again, LOVE THE OIL and would not be without it.</li>
            <li> Have tried other forms of transdermal Magnesium. This is the bomb; it goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t cause excessive itching (if at all) and when dried does not leave a funky salt residue. I used it recently on my back after shoveling almost a foot of snow and completely took away the soreness!</li>
            <li> Love this product, I have a kidney condition, and easily get terrible muscle cramping. The magnesium in this lotion is easy to apply and within 15 minutes of application on any site, I get relief! I use it day and night to keep my magnesium levels up to prevent these awful cramps from occurring in the middle of the night. ( I find if I drink too many caffeinated beverages, whether teas or coffees etc. then my need for magnesium increases a lot more as well ).</li>
            <li> I have just recently started using Magnesium oil, which I was pleased with the results. When I found this product with the lotion in the ingredients I was quick to try it. Very happy with my choice! Bought some for a friend.</li>
            <li> I recently read an article about how important Magnesium is for our bodies and that so many ailments are really symptoms of Magnesium deficiency.  It also said the best way to effectively absorb Magnesium is trans-dermally (though the skin) not through vitamin supplements.  So I decided to give this lotion a try and in the last 4-6 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change!  I thought I had terrible arthritis, but my hands are not hurting any more.  I always had a stiff/sore neck....not anymore.  My achy hip and knee joints are gone too!  PLUS, the coconut oil and shea butter makes my skin so soft and the moisture stays with me, but isn&#x27;t greasy.  I&#x27;m telling everybody who is complaining about an ache or a pain to give this stuff a try.  I&#x27;m EXTREMELY pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I added this to my cart and even with 2-day Prime Shipping, this was going to take 6 days to arrive so I cancelled it and instead bought the regular bottle of their Ancient Minerals magnesium lotion (without MSM). I&#x27;ll have it in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is not shipped by Amazon, and the only difference is this bottle comes with MSM in it for $2 more. I dont know what difference MSM would really make, probably not much, but after being accustomed to true 2-day shipping... not impressed by the seller&#x27;s estimated delivery speed.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and absorbs (with a little rubbing :)  I was hoping I would have a little more time to rub it in (use as a pain rub-it doesn&#x27;t serve this purpose)...However, it does help some to reduce pain naturally for a time (at least for my family :).  We have used it for tight muscles, kids &amp;#34;leg pain&amp;#34; prevention &amp; inflammation related pain.  Also, I was originally interested in magnesium lotion to increase our intake of magnesium; which is best absorbed through the skin.  It is thought to be chronically low in most Americans (I have just about every symptom of low levels).</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to help my dry feet. Ancient Minerals Magnesium lotion has been the best by far!</li>
            <li> and a great deodorant&lt;br /&gt;magnesium taking in adequate levels causes diarrhea,&lt;br /&gt;but not if taken through the skin, it helps injuries to heal</li>
            <li> I take this with my daily iodine. Just rub a teaspoon a day into skin. This is thick and it dries with a light chalky residue so you may want to rub it in a hidden area like the tummy.</li>
            <li> As a Massage Therapist always looking for ways to bring my clients relief - use it personally and professionally and have found it to be most helpful  Between this and Arnicare I am SET!</li>
            <li> This helpped me more than anything when I got a muscle spasm.  I also tried magnesium oil, but for some reason the lotion worked better to relieve the pain.  I still use it on a regular basis and enjoy it as a regular lotion.</li>
            <li> It seems to help my problem</li>
            <li> Excited about this lotion, works wonderful.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from sore muscles from exercise or a chronic condition... this really WORKS.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 year now on my lower back and shoulders. It helps to relieve the pain and stiffness.  This product helps me live with my chronic pain. I apply night and morning. Quickly absorbs into skin and starts working within 15 minutes.  It works on my mom&#x27;s arthritis hands.  I&#x27;ve recommended it a million times and it is worth the money for the relief it gives.</li>
            <li> I like this magnesium lotion. I did apply to my legs and I had minimum pain so it did work. I  will buy again and I did buy. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Good product, i mix with magnesium oil, lotion seems a little sticky at first but quickly absorbed into the skin. Overall very happy with it. supplier shipped promptly and product arrived exactly as described very satisfied overall</li>
            <li> Great stuff! As a lotion, it goes on well and dries completely, leaving no oily residue. The transdermal magnesium is great for sore muscles and sleep!</li>
            <li> Great for leg cramps!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s why this 5 star product only got 3 stars from me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the dispenser should have a pump.  It&#x27;s impossible to get product out of this bottle after it&#x27;s been used for awhile for two reasons.  The bottle is too stiff to squeeze.  The product is too thick to pour out of the container. I wind up having to bash the bottom of the bottle to get it to flow towards&lt;br /&gt;the opening....or I have to take off the cap and slam the bottle against the side of my (clean) sink so some of the lotion lands in the sink and&lt;br /&gt;then I can use my hand to grab a decent amount of product....so I can apply it to my skin.  I find this process of using the product very frustrating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....this to be oxymoron packaging....although I love Ancient Minerals Magnesium lotion....It helps me sleep well and helps with muscular aches and pains...&lt;br /&gt;BUT I cannot give a manufacturer high ratings if I&#x27;m frustrated using their product.</li>
            <li> This my third order and I use it almost every day.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I do like the product overall.&lt;br /&gt;On the Con side: The main problem I have is with the packaging. It&#x27;s almost impossible to even get a drop out of the hole in the dispenser cap. The bottle is so stiff it&#x27;s difficult to squeeze it enough to force the lotion out the small opening in the lid. I tried transferring some to another bottle for my husband to use as he just gave up. The lotion is so thick that it would drain from the original bottle into another bottle even after being left for hours. I finally resorted to storing it upside down - I have to set up a way for it to stay upright by jamming it in between other bottles. Then I just remove the lid and shake some out. It still required some shaking to get some of it to come out. The handiest solution would be if the lotion was in a pump dispenser. The next handiest would be if the lid was large enough and flat enough it could be stored upside down easily. The other problem I have with the product is there are slivers of what I figure is shaved magnesium that haven&#x27;t homogenized with the lotion base.&lt;br /&gt;On the pro side: I was taking a magnesium supplement twice daily but had to give it up because of effects on my intestional track. I have strong cramps in legs and feet particularly at night. By putting this lotion on my legs and feet before going to bed, I no longer am awakened with leg and feet cramps.</li>
            <li> Moving.  Been sitting around all winter and am in my 50&#x27;s.  That spells problems.... but this lotion is awesome!!!  Just rubbed it into sore hips and leg muscles and - back in business....the OptiMSM in tandem with the magnesium salt was a huge part of it.  Great product.  Thank you!!!</li>
