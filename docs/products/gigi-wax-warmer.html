            <li>Heats wax fairly quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>than that it&#x27;s been a good warmer.</li>
            <li>Being an esthetician i&#x27;ve had my fair share with wax warmers.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>I hope it lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, i have been using it for 5-6 months now and its works the way it should work.</li>
            <li>Got it in a good amount of time.</li>

            <li>I love this wax warmer!</li>
            <li>I love my GiGi wax warmer!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>What more could you get out of it?!</li>
            <li>I love this wax pot!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Best product for wax warming ,i liked it very much..</li>
            <li>Very cheap and good product.</li>
            <li>very nice easy to use.</li>
            <li>This wax warmer is amazing.</li>
            <li>Before I was using the kind you heat in the microwave &amp;</li>
            <li>Heat the wax and keeps it warm.</li>
            <li>Remember to use the wax collar to keep it tidy.</li>
            <li>it takes 30 min to warm up your wax...</li>
            <li>and it stays perfect the whole time I&#x27;m waxing.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it now</li>
            <li>Does a nice job melting wax.</li>
            <li>It works!Overall a good buy but make sure to use the cream wax with it.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about it is that you can control the heat.  </li>
            <li>Good luck :)</li>
            <li>Honestly if I owned a shop I would suggest this warmer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you want to achieve the perfect wax consistency.</li>
            <li>My Beloved&#x27; says it works great for what she wants it for.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>but it really is very, very easy.</li>
            <li>Price was great but on the lowest heat setting wax still is VERY hot.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say whether this is a good product or not, they charged me for it, confirmed that it was shipping, but never sent it out.</li>
            <li>Great product - once you find the right heat setting for you.  </li>
            <li>It makes DIY eyebrow waxing so easy and convenient!</li>
            <li>It comes with a cardboard ring around to avoid any dripping falling on to the warmer, which is good because your machine is always clean.</li>
            <li>I love my warmer, it&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li>The temperature control is a great feature I love the fact I can control how hot my wax is without the need of burning myself.</li>
            <li>excly like in picture, fast shipping, good quality, good price, I am happy with this product, very practic, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Better then what I was excepted</li>
            <li>and hopefully you will be too!! :)</li>
            <li>If you want to purchase this item, make sure that it&#x27;s model 0225 (for use in the US).</li>
            <li>I swear I&#x27;ll never shave my legs again; I like the results from waxing so, so much better (and I&#x27;ll admit it, it appeals to my love of all things gadgety to use something that&#x27;s not a razor).  </li>
            <li>I could dock it stars for maybe not having the most exacting temperature control, or for not having a lid that&#x27;s fastened to the warmer, or</li>
            <li>Safe to handle, see my review of the GiGi wax.</li>
            <li>nothing more is needed.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>top cover should really be more of a lock feature...</li>
            <li>, low/medium keeps it nice and smooth</li>
            <li>I use this with the cerepil blue wax and it is perfect.</li>
            <li>It sure gives me peace of mind.</li>
            <li>, what more can you ask of it?</li>
            <li>Way better than having to go to a salon or s</li>
            <li>Love the adjustable temperatures.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Heats up in about 25 min and when on low is the perfect temperature.</li>
            <li>Glad I got this.</li>
            <li>This is still one of my top products that I have ordered from amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love.  </li>
            <li>You will love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this warmer.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love that there is an affordable, manageable wax warmer that realistically can be used in a salon or at home.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>so make sure lower the temp before applying to someone.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d have been better off getting a roller or even just buying the strips</li>
            <li>This keeps it the perfect temperature the entire time.</li>
            <li>This can also double as a candle warmer :D</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li>Lid sits on top</li>
            <li>I am searching for one with a lid though and one where the lid fits into place better</li>
            <li>more words required for this review to meet amazon standards.</li>
            <li>my wifes is smooth all over now yummy !</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>I bought this product for an in-home spa party and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>If you buy muslin by the roll be sure to pick up a pair of zig zag scissors</li>
            <li>The warmer is great, and was deliver really fast .</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased this one.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for only $24 including s&amp;h</li>
            <li>So totally satisfied</li>
            <li>Despite any of its flaws, I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>However, for regular waxing this is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>It does take more than an hour to melt the wax.</li>
            <li>the price, you cannot get a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast Shipment !!!!  </li>
            <li>The collars keep it clean and nice.</li>
            <li>This purchase was a great investment and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I save so much money doing certain waxing by myself and this warmer is so handy!!!!</li>
            <li>n have fun torturing yourself!!</li>
            <li>so I definitely love how easy and cheaper it is easier to use vs. going to the salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li>Works great - the unit takes about 20 minutes to completely heat up the wax</li>
            <li>I use baby powder before waxing, and any old fabric (cut up sheets...) works great.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s great,</li>
            <li>I use the sensitive cream wax and it works great for me.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store.</li>
            <li>Warms quickly (30 minutes max) and easy to use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adorable, convenient, and gets my wax melted in it&#x27;s original container in no time</li>
            <li>The GIGI system is extremely easy to use--just plug it in and place the can of wax inside.</li>
            <li>Easy to use once someone gets the hang of it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;you can easily use this at your home for wax warming</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to store.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, you can adjust the temperature</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing at home for about 10 years, but this is my first time buying my own warmer</li>
            <li>It does the job fine, but after trying \\&quot;do it yourself waxing\\&quot; my daughter &amp; I have decided to let the professionals keep doing it.  </li>
            <li>The GiGi wax warmer work just fine.</li>
            <li>it works fine...</li>
            <li>Well, it heats up wax just fine</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Heats up well and fine.</li>
            <li>I recieved this wax warmer and it took about a half an hour to fully heat up my 13 oz jar of wax, and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I am a beginner and it works perfectly fine for me</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly as well!</li>
            <li>Came in quickly and had no problems :)</li>
            <li>This is a great product, its simple to use and compact.   </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and hair-free.  </li>
            <li>I recommend buying the cardboard collars; they will keep the unit free of wax as you use it.</li>
            <li>It has been a few months and it is still working PERFECT!</li>
            <li>We enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>Basically any can this size will fit.</li>
            <li>But I enjoy it</li>
            <li>I am disabled and have made my own salon and this wax warmer works great.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best wax warmers I have used it heats the wax pretty quick and is easy to adjust to lower temperature settings if the wax feels to hot.</li>
            <li>Can turn it on &amp; do it when you are ready!!!</li>
            <li>thank you so much for this!!!  </li>
            <li>The plastic exterior is a bit cheap, but getting it on sale makes it worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>I loved it very much , it saves my so much money every month .</li>
            <li>This warmer comes with a clean collar which is very useful during the waxing process.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use my wax warmer</li>
            <li>I love it so much I am sharing!  </li>
            <li>newer or first time at-home waxers, or anyone thinking about trying it, feel free to leave questions!</li>
            <li>It has a significant footprint</li>
            <li>It heats up even faster than was originally described.</li>
            <li>Worth it if your brave enough to wax yourself, or have a friend do it!</li>
            <li>only thing I would have liked this warmer to have is a better lid.</li>
            <li>I had a smaller one and liked it much better.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ll be keeping mine nice and white. :)</li>
            <li>; I do recommend using the was collars, it will stay clean longer.</li>
            <li>Have not used it yes, still lookn around to see what hard wax has the greatest reviews...when I do use I may update.</li>
            <li>I love how this warmer looks and how fast it warms up.</li>
            <li>ACTUAL PRODUCT IS GOOD</li>
            <li>Self waxing is easy and pretty painless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the wax warm and ready as long as I need it.</li>
            <li>If I want more frills, I&#x27;ll spend more money, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that as far as sheer value there isn&#x27;t a better warmer on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>waxing is over quick</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively quick at heating up the wax.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended. :-)</li>
            <li>temp levels are pretty accurate, the lower the wax gets the hotter</li>
            <li>I used to have to figure out ways to keep my wax warm longer and had to make several trips to the microwave from the bathroom and it made waxing a whole ordeal and just added more time to an already lengthly process.  </li>
            <li>AND you are good for a long time.</li>
            <li>It was shipped really quick and packed in better than new.</li>
            <li>Super inexpensive and worth it if you have the patience and precision.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great heater, easy storage, comes with one cardboard ring to prevent a mess.</li>
            <li>She tested it out on me and it was exactly what she wanted!</li>
            <li>Gets really hot!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, perfect size (not too big, not too small), and clean.</li>
            <li>Get the muslin roll and a pair of scissors, get some baby oil, or any oil to remove the wax, get aloe Vera gel and put on waxed area to calm the skin.</li>
            <li>but I dont mind because it is worth it.</li>
            <li>have used once and seems to be okay so far.</li>
            <li>I would love if it actually closed instead of just sat on top.</li>
            <li>I have to wave it in the air to cool first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big deal because it warms the wax effectively without one.</li>
            <li>Love this product as I go through microwavable wax far too often and</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I have my own wax pot now for future waxing needs and truly recommend this product to people who are ready and capable to wax at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>So easy to use highly recommend.</li>
            <li>These look better than any other one I&#x27;ve seen, heats evenly for the most part, stir</li>
            <li>Heats up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Other than this, it is a good product and the lid</li>
            <li>Turn the unit \\&quot;on\\&quot; by pulling the lever to the right.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to turn it off and on to try to maintain the right temperature.</li>
            <li>It takes about 30 minutes to liquefy the wax and while you wait, you can get all your waxing and clean up tools ready.  </li>
            <li>SMART!</li>
            <li>Works great, only takes about 12 minutes to heat up a lot of wax for waxing facial or body hair.  </li>
            <li>depending on how much time i have i warm the wax on medium and then lower it to the low setting.</li>
            <li>I have some eye brows that grow very, very fast</li>
            <li>I have to put this on about 3 hours before I even use it to get hot.</li>
            <li>Then it is still not that hot.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t leave it on hi heat while waxing was to hot for me</li>
            <li>This is much easier!</li>
            <li>My first one got damaged in a move, and I bought another one as soon I could find it.</li>
            <li>I use the lid like a plate protecting any drips from falling to the floor when I wax my partner&#x27;s back. :)</li>
            <li>The first one lasted me 5 years.</li>
            <li>It does get really hot</li>
            <li>This is my first wax warmer</li>
            <li>I am glad of my purchase, a couple years later till using it.</li>
            <li>Even at the max setting, the wax doesn&#x27;t get too hot to apply.  </li>
            <li>Anything over &amp;#34;Low&amp;#34; is too hot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first wax warmer</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about this warmer at first since I don&#x27;t care for the GiGi wax.</li>
            <li>Paid for itself with first use.  </li>
            <li>pretty fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wax my legs often and it was nice to use something other than the microwave.</li>
            <li>Makes sure it is 100% flat when you are storing it.</li>
            <li>and it is so much more convenient since it was sometimes hard fitting an appointment into my schedule.</li>
            <li>so you will need that low setting after awhile, keeps relatively clean and I does not disappoint!</li>
            <li>Heats wax up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>, it heats the wax very fast, I use it for soft and hard wax and it&#x27;s great at keeping the wax at a consistent temperature.</li>
            <li>Love this thing I Received one with a normal US plug not European</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I just invested in a nice quality dual warmer, less trouble and better heat controls!</li>
            <li>certainly does not affect its performance in anyway.</li>
            <li>The plastic lid just sits on top of the warmer loosely and can fall off with the slightest of movements.</li>
            <li>It has the control low and high which is important for keeping the wax at the right temperature.</li>
            <li>You do have to wait a little while for it to warm up (like it says in the instructions)</li>
            <li>Put it on High heat first</li>
            <li>This works amazingly for equal or smaller sizes.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone who wants to wax.</li>
            <li>I had all my supplies set up and ready to go.</li>
            <li>This has saved me so much money</li>
            <li>just put it on for warming up the wax and ready to use.</li>
            <li>It heats up to whatever temp and it really doesn&#x27;t function at 3 levels as it claims.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>In about 30-40 minutes, the wax gets melted very well and evenly.</li>
            <li>A lid which fit properly would have helped in storing the warmer with the wax in it, without having to remove the pot after use and store the warmer and pot separately.</li>
            <li>Is very convenient to have at home which is why I bought.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wants to wax.</li>
            <li>i think it can fit bigger 14oz cans too.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to whoever wants to purchase it, I took cosmetology and this is the warmer we used in college.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>It heated up my wax so fast.</li>
            <li>Very upset.</li>
            <li>Warms very quickly; adjustable temp makes for efficient waxing and takes up a small footprint in my tiny NYC apt.</li>
            <li>Very useful and definitely cheaper than going to a salon.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s small,  easy to use and warms all types of wax pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>But other wax warmers I&#x27;ve seen don&#x27;t even have a top, and it really doesn&#x27;t impact the usability in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any</li>
            <li>But overall I think it&#x27;s a great buy and lasts a long time w regular use and care.</li>
            <li>I originally thought i&#x27;d just use a candle warmer, but i like how on this you can change the temperatures for different waxes and what not.</li>
            <li>To hot for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised.</li>
            <li>I wanted a wax warmer since I went to my first professional wax session.</li>
            <li>to use, easy to store and performs as expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Literally the only thing I wish was different is the top.</li>
            <li>It heats up solid wax efficiently and quickly.</li>
            <li>No complaints only thing to know is that no matter what setting you put it on the wax will be very hot</li>
            <li>It takes high heat to get he wax to the right consistency, but then you have to turn it down and let the wax cool a bit before applying to skin.  </li>
            <li>temperature doesn&#x27;t get a high as I would like</li>
            <li>The instructions say to reduce the heat after the wax has melted, but I found I had to keep it on high or else</li>
            <li>the was even on high.</li>
            <li>I turn it to high as I turn it on and place the wax pot in it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with Amazon&#x27;s final solution to my problem but am surprised that Amazon still has not updated the web page to indicate that this particular model is intended for use in European countries and that a transformer is needed for use in the US.</li>
            <li>With nothing to compare it to, I really like this so far.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot so with a full tin of blue wax, I set it below the low setting and let it heat through for a bout 30-45 minutes</li>
            <li>, I thought I&#x27;d save money with this kind, but you&#x27;ll have to buy the pots of wax for at least $10 each anyway.  </li>
            <li>I love this product as it is simple to use and lasts for the long hall.  </li>
            <li>No seriously I love how convinience this is for me now easy to use, and affordable!</li>
            <li>Not only is waxing easy, the results last for weeks.  </li>
            <li>Not now, this little machine will definitely come in handy.</li>
            <li>I gave only 4 stars just because it takes little longer time to warm up the wax.</li>
            <li>With any new wax (depending on what type) it can take anywhere from 15 min to 30 to heat up.</li>
            <li>I am still new to DIY waxing, but it takes way longer than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, less weight, gives required hotness.</li>
            <li>It can take 20-30 minutes to heat up a full can, but is much shorter as the amount of wax in the can goes down.</li>
            <li>Easy to store, as the quantity of wax will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first box of wax (I only use it for the bikini area)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty basic setup...</li>
            <li>It warms wax well enough but it seems ridiculously hot even after letting it rest the recommended time.</li>
            <li>The second time  the cord got  hot and melted with in  a matter of 8 mins.  </li>
            <li>I put it on low and the wax is scalding hot...</li>
            <li>This one is simple to use, and you can put the setting exactly where you want it.</li>
            <li>anything over low is too hot for my skin.</li>
            <li>Put the wax in the warmer, put a clean colar on it, turn it on medium to get to heated, then on low and go run some errands or just put it on low and run your errands.</li>
            <li>I use this for waxing at the salon, It is very long lasting and heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>Not the usual use of the melter, but the waxes used are similar, and something as large as a crock pot is kind of big for the amount of wax you need for an accordion.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re me, not even the collars save you from making a huge mess.  </li>
            <li>A little scary using this for the first time, but sure glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hard, to get the backs of your legs with this kind (though I&#x27;m sure experience and practice will make it easier), so strips might be easier for about the same cost as a pot of wax, though they&#x27;ll cover less than a pot would.</li>
            <li>I told her a friend purchase the exact same wax warmer with a regular plug which proves that such a unit exists.</li>
            <li>No mess, no fuss, just plug it in, and wax away!</li>
            <li>This person listened to my story, put me on hold, then came back and told me to return the whole unit at THEIR</li>
            <li>Before, I was spending money every 4 weeks going to a professional to get my bikini line done.</li>
            <li>So far, I like this warmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it won&#x27;t die fast like the last one I bought.</li>
            <li>This does just as well as a professional at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I used to have to run back and forth to the kitchen to microwave wax but now with this warmer, it&#x27;s so much</li>
            <li>turn on the warmer when I remember to wax and by the time I actually have time to do it, the wax is melted and ready.</li>
            <li>Not messy at all.</li>
            <li>(green light is on) and keep it there till I finish waxing.</li>
            <li>Arrived to my house early.</li>
            <li>I only replaced it because we spilt so much wax on it that is was sticky to hold.</li>
            <li>Come back and you&#x27;re ready to wax.</li>
            <li>ive used it once so far</li>
            <li>Also, much cheaper on Amazon.com than local beauty product distributors!  </li>
            <li>One con is that once it thoroughly melts, it takes a while to cool down even if you turn the wax warmer completely off.</li>
            <li>Pretty simple and basic design but</li>
            <li>Has a Low, Medium, and High temperature.</li>
            <li>Would recommend always using on the high setting and buy extra sleeves to keep the wax from getting everywhere.</li>
            <li>I have a cheap 4 foot extension cord that I picked up at walmart so that I can pull this little guy close to a window while using since my house has poor lighting and too many trees to get sunlight in.</li>
            <li>It is compact and unbelievably light and can be stored away under the wash basin or in any small cabinet in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>did not get as hot as I expected.</li>
            <li>Ok, this is not a huge wax warmer, but it is big enough for home use.</li>
            <li>Only 3 settings, so not hard to use.</li>
            <li>I really think that you can easily avoid an unpleasant or traumatic waxing experience by having the right tools.</li>
            <li>This is so easy and since I can do it at home I find myself doing them at least once a week.</li>
            <li>nothing major.</li>
            <li>The temperature stayed consistent and the body was not hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>This was not expected.</li>
            <li>This warms really well, it does take about half an hour or so to heat wax completely.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s a bit difficult to tell if the light is on green or not, but it does its job and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>A bit of a tight fit for some other brands.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little worried that I was going to ruin my brows</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to start waxing at home instead of having it professionally done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would suggest using a wax collar to protect the warmer as it can get pretty messy if not protected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll start getting liquidy then if you push the remaining hard wax sitting on the top down under the already melted wax, the rest of the non melted wax will heat up faster.</li>
            <li>Its kind of annoying at first...</li>
            <li>I can set it to high for 20 minutes, go do other chores and then set it to low</li>
            <li>Crank it on high and let the wax melt then turn the setting down until your done using it.</li>
            <li>You can heat up your wax on high, and then turn it down to a warmer temperature while using it.</li>
            <li>I do not notice a big difference from this versus the compact one and due to my limited space I much rather have the compact version.</li>

            <li> and it works good</li>
            <li> Mark with a sharpee pen your ideal temperature slide setting as I&#x27;m sure it varies for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> My GF loved it.</li>
            <li> We loved it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good warmer for the Gigi waxes.</li>
            <li> Good warmer for the price</li>
            <li> Heats wax fairly quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> than that it&#x27;s been a good warmer.</li>
            <li> Being an esthetician i&#x27;ve had my fair share with wax warmers.</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, i have been using it for 5-6 months now and its works the way it should work.</li>
            <li> Got it in a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with how it performs.  </li>
            <li> Its very cute looking,  </li>
            <li> im very pleased with it</li>
            <li> Have been very pleased with the unit.  </li>
            <li> This is a very cute wax warmer - does the trick.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m more than happy with it</li>
            <li> The best thing is that it can fit many wax  containers.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> this is 10 times better!</li>
            <li> Love this thing!</li>
            <li> I now wax my underarms and legs too which is so much better than shaving!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this wax warmer!</li>
            <li> I love my GiGi wax warmer!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> What more could you get out of it?!</li>
            <li> I love this wax pot!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Best product for wax warming ,i liked it very much..</li>
            <li> Very cheap and good product.</li>
            <li> very nice easy to use.</li>
            <li> This wax warmer is amazing.</li>
            <li> Before I was using the kind you heat in the microwave &amp;</li>
            <li> Heat the wax and keeps it warm.</li>
            <li> Remember to use the wax collar to keep it tidy.</li>
            <li> it takes 30 min to warm up your wax...</li>
            <li> and it stays perfect the whole time I&#x27;m waxing.  </li>
            <li> and I liked it now</li>
            <li> Does a nice job melting wax.</li>
            <li> It works!Overall a good buy but make sure to use the cream wax with it.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about it is that you can control the heat.  </li>
            <li> Good luck :)</li>
            <li> Honestly if I owned a shop I would suggest this warmer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you want to achieve the perfect wax consistency.</li>
            <li> My Beloved&#x27; says it works great for what she wants it for.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> but it really is very, very easy.</li>
            <li> Price was great but on the lowest heat setting wax still is VERY hot.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say whether this is a good product or not, they charged me for it, confirmed that it was shipping, but never sent it out.</li>
            <li> Great product - once you find the right heat setting for you.  </li>
            <li> It makes DIY eyebrow waxing so easy and convenient!</li>
            <li> It comes with a cardboard ring around to avoid any dripping falling on to the warmer, which is good because your machine is always clean.</li>
            <li> I love my warmer, it&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li> The temperature control is a great feature I love the fact I can control how hot my wax is without the need of burning myself.</li>
            <li> excly like in picture, fast shipping, good quality, good price, I am happy with this product, very practic, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Better then what I was excepted</li>
            <li> and hopefully you will be too!! :)</li>
            <li> If you want to purchase this item, make sure that it&#x27;s model 0225 (for use in the US).</li>
            <li> I swear I&#x27;ll never shave my legs again; I like the results from waxing so, so much better (and I&#x27;ll admit it, it appeals to my love of all things gadgety to use something that&#x27;s not a razor).  </li>
            <li> I could dock it stars for maybe not having the most exacting temperature control, or for not having a lid that&#x27;s fastened to the warmer, or</li>
            <li> Safe to handle, see my review of the GiGi wax.</li>
            <li> nothing more is needed.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> top cover should really be more of a lock feature...</li>
            <li> , low/medium keeps it nice and smooth</li>
            <li> I use this with the cerepil blue wax and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> It sure gives me peace of mind.</li>
            <li> , what more can you ask of it?</li>
            <li> Way better than having to go to a salon or s</li>
            <li> Love the adjustable temperatures.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Heats up in about 25 min and when on low is the perfect temperature.</li>
            <li> Glad I got this.</li>
            <li> This is still one of my top products that I have ordered from amazon.  </li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love.  </li>
            <li> You will love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this warmer.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love that there is an affordable, manageable wax warmer that realistically can be used in a salon or at home.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> so make sure lower the temp before applying to someone.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d have been better off getting a roller or even just buying the strips</li>
            <li> This keeps it the perfect temperature the entire time.</li>
            <li> This can also double as a candle warmer :D</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> Lid sits on top</li>
            <li> I am searching for one with a lid though and one where the lid fits into place better</li>
            <li> more words required for this review to meet amazon standards.</li>
            <li> my wifes is smooth all over now yummy !</li>
            <li> and i love it</li>
            <li> I bought this product for an in-home spa party and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> If you buy muslin by the roll be sure to pick up a pair of zig zag scissors</li>
            <li> The warmer is great, and was deliver really fast .</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this one.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for only $24 including s&amp;h</li>
            <li> So totally satisfied</li>
            <li> Despite any of its flaws, I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> However, for regular waxing this is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> It does take more than an hour to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> the price, you cannot get a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment !!!!  </li>
            <li> The collars keep it clean and nice.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a great investment and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I save so much money doing certain waxing by myself and this warmer is so handy!!!!</li>
            <li> n have fun torturing yourself!!</li>
            <li> so I definitely love how easy and cheaper it is easier to use vs. going to the salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li> Works great - the unit takes about 20 minutes to completely heat up the wax</li>
            <li> I use baby powder before waxing, and any old fabric (cut up sheets...) works great.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s great,</li>
            <li> I use the sensitive cream wax and it works great for me.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store.</li>
            <li> Warms quickly (30 minutes max) and easy to use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adorable, convenient, and gets my wax melted in it&#x27;s original container in no time</li>
            <li> The GIGI system is extremely easy to use--just plug it in and place the can of wax inside.</li>
            <li> Easy to use once someone gets the hang of it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you can easily use this at your home for wax warming</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to store.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, you can adjust the temperature</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing at home for about 10 years, but this is my first time buying my own warmer</li>
            <li> It does the job fine, but after trying \\&quot;do it yourself waxing\\&quot; my daughter &amp; I have decided to let the professionals keep doing it.  </li>
            <li> The GiGi wax warmer work just fine.</li>
            <li> it works fine...</li>
            <li> Well, it heats up wax just fine</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Heats up well and fine.</li>
            <li> I recieved this wax warmer and it took about a half an hour to fully heat up my 13 oz jar of wax, and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner and it works perfectly fine for me</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly as well!</li>
            <li> Came in quickly and had no problems :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product, its simple to use and compact.   </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and hair-free.  </li>
            <li> I recommend buying the cardboard collars; they will keep the unit free of wax as you use it.</li>
            <li> It has been a few months and it is still working PERFECT!</li>
            <li> We enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> Basically any can this size will fit.</li>
            <li> But I enjoy it</li>
            <li> I am disabled and have made my own salon and this wax warmer works great.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best wax warmers I have used it heats the wax pretty quick and is easy to adjust to lower temperature settings if the wax feels to hot.</li>
            <li> Can turn it on &amp; do it when you are ready!!!</li>
            <li> thank you so much for this!!!  </li>
            <li> The plastic exterior is a bit cheap, but getting it on sale makes it worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I loved it very much , it saves my so much money every month .</li>
            <li> This warmer comes with a clean collar which is very useful during the waxing process.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use my wax warmer</li>
            <li> I love it so much I am sharing!  </li>
            <li> newer or first time at-home waxers, or anyone thinking about trying it, feel free to leave questions!</li>
            <li> It has a significant footprint</li>
            <li> It heats up even faster than was originally described.</li>
            <li> Worth it if your brave enough to wax yourself, or have a friend do it!</li>
            <li> only thing I would have liked this warmer to have is a better lid.</li>
            <li> I had a smaller one and liked it much better.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ll be keeping mine nice and white. :)</li>
            <li> ; I do recommend using the was collars, it will stay clean longer.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yes, still lookn around to see what hard wax has the greatest reviews...when I do use I may update.</li>
            <li> I love how this warmer looks and how fast it warms up.</li>
            <li> ACTUAL PRODUCT IS GOOD</li>
            <li> Self waxing is easy and pretty painless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have the wax warm and ready as long as I need it.</li>
            <li> If I want more frills, I&#x27;ll spend more money, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that as far as sheer value there isn&#x27;t a better warmer on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> waxing is over quick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively quick at heating up the wax.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. :-)</li>
            <li> temp levels are pretty accurate, the lower the wax gets the hotter</li>
            <li> I used to have to figure out ways to keep my wax warm longer and had to make several trips to the microwave from the bathroom and it made waxing a whole ordeal and just added more time to an already lengthly process.  </li>
            <li> AND you are good for a long time.</li>
            <li> It was shipped really quick and packed in better than new.</li>
            <li> Super inexpensive and worth it if you have the patience and precision.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great heater, easy storage, comes with one cardboard ring to prevent a mess.</li>
            <li> She tested it out on me and it was exactly what she wanted!</li>
            <li> Gets really hot!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, perfect size (not too big, not too small), and clean.</li>
            <li> Get the muslin roll and a pair of scissors, get some baby oil, or any oil to remove the wax, get aloe Vera gel and put on waxed area to calm the skin.</li>
            <li> but I dont mind because it is worth it.</li>
            <li> have used once and seems to be okay so far.</li>
            <li> I would love if it actually closed instead of just sat on top.</li>
            <li> I have to wave it in the air to cool first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal because it warms the wax effectively without one.</li>
            <li> Love this product as I go through microwavable wax far too often and</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I have my own wax pot now for future waxing needs and truly recommend this product to people who are ready and capable to wax at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> So easy to use highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These look better than any other one I&#x27;ve seen, heats evenly for the most part, stir</li>
            <li> Heats up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Other than this, it is a good product and the lid</li>
            <li> Turn the unit \\&quot;on\\&quot; by pulling the lever to the right.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to turn it off and on to try to maintain the right temperature.</li>
            <li> It takes about 30 minutes to liquefy the wax and while you wait, you can get all your waxing and clean up tools ready.  </li>
            <li> SMART!</li>
            <li> Works great, only takes about 12 minutes to heat up a lot of wax for waxing facial or body hair.  </li>
            <li> depending on how much time i have i warm the wax on medium and then lower it to the low setting.</li>
            <li> I have some eye brows that grow very, very fast</li>
            <li> I have to put this on about 3 hours before I even use it to get hot.</li>
            <li> Then it is still not that hot.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t leave it on hi heat while waxing was to hot for me</li>
            <li> This is much easier!</li>
            <li> My first one got damaged in a move, and I bought another one as soon I could find it.</li>
            <li> I use the lid like a plate protecting any drips from falling to the floor when I wax my partner&#x27;s back. :)</li>
            <li> The first one lasted me 5 years.</li>
            <li> It does get really hot</li>
            <li> This is my first wax warmer</li>
            <li> I am glad of my purchase, a couple years later till using it.</li>
            <li> Even at the max setting, the wax doesn&#x27;t get too hot to apply.  </li>
            <li> Anything over &amp;#34;Low&amp;#34; is too hot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first wax warmer</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about this warmer at first since I don&#x27;t care for the GiGi wax.</li>
            <li> Paid for itself with first use.  </li>
            <li> pretty fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wax my legs often and it was nice to use something other than the microwave.</li>
            <li> Makes sure it is 100% flat when you are storing it.</li>
            <li> and it is so much more convenient since it was sometimes hard fitting an appointment into my schedule.</li>
            <li> so you will need that low setting after awhile, keeps relatively clean and I does not disappoint!</li>
            <li> Heats wax up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> , it heats the wax very fast, I use it for soft and hard wax and it&#x27;s great at keeping the wax at a consistent temperature.</li>
            <li> Love this thing I Received one with a normal US plug not European</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I just invested in a nice quality dual warmer, less trouble and better heat controls!</li>
            <li> certainly does not affect its performance in anyway.</li>
            <li> The plastic lid just sits on top of the warmer loosely and can fall off with the slightest of movements.</li>
            <li> It has the control low and high which is important for keeping the wax at the right temperature.</li>
            <li> You do have to wait a little while for it to warm up (like it says in the instructions)</li>
            <li> Put it on High heat first</li>
            <li> This works amazingly for equal or smaller sizes.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone who wants to wax.</li>
            <li> I had all my supplies set up and ready to go.</li>
            <li> This has saved me so much money</li>
            <li> just put it on for warming up the wax and ready to use.</li>
            <li> It heats up to whatever temp and it really doesn&#x27;t function at 3 levels as it claims.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> In about 30-40 minutes, the wax gets melted very well and evenly.</li>
            <li> A lid which fit properly would have helped in storing the warmer with the wax in it, without having to remove the pot after use and store the warmer and pot separately.</li>
            <li> Is very convenient to have at home which is why I bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wants to wax.</li>
            <li> i think it can fit bigger 14oz cans too.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to whoever wants to purchase it, I took cosmetology and this is the warmer we used in college.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> It heated up my wax so fast.</li>
            <li> Very upset.</li>
            <li> Warms very quickly; adjustable temp makes for efficient waxing and takes up a small footprint in my tiny NYC apt.</li>
            <li> Very useful and definitely cheaper than going to a salon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small,  easy to use and warms all types of wax pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> But other wax warmers I&#x27;ve seen don&#x27;t even have a top, and it really doesn&#x27;t impact the usability in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any</li>
            <li> But overall I think it&#x27;s a great buy and lasts a long time w regular use and care.</li>
            <li> I originally thought i&#x27;d just use a candle warmer, but i like how on this you can change the temperatures for different waxes and what not.</li>
            <li> To hot for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised.</li>
            <li> I wanted a wax warmer since I went to my first professional wax session.</li>
            <li> to use, easy to store and performs as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Literally the only thing I wish was different is the top.</li>
            <li> It heats up solid wax efficiently and quickly.</li>
            <li> No complaints only thing to know is that no matter what setting you put it on the wax will be very hot</li>
            <li> It takes high heat to get he wax to the right consistency, but then you have to turn it down and let the wax cool a bit before applying to skin.  </li>
            <li> temperature doesn&#x27;t get a high as I would like</li>
            <li> The instructions say to reduce the heat after the wax has melted, but I found I had to keep it on high or else</li>
            <li> the was even on high.</li>
            <li> I turn it to high as I turn it on and place the wax pot in it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with Amazon&#x27;s final solution to my problem but am surprised that Amazon still has not updated the web page to indicate that this particular model is intended for use in European countries and that a transformer is needed for use in the US.</li>
            <li> With nothing to compare it to, I really like this so far.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot so with a full tin of blue wax, I set it below the low setting and let it heat through for a bout 30-45 minutes</li>
            <li> , I thought I&#x27;d save money with this kind, but you&#x27;ll have to buy the pots of wax for at least $10 each anyway.  </li>
            <li> I love this product as it is simple to use and lasts for the long hall.  </li>
            <li> No seriously I love how convinience this is for me now easy to use, and affordable!</li>
            <li> Not only is waxing easy, the results last for weeks.  </li>
            <li> Not now, this little machine will definitely come in handy.</li>
            <li> I gave only 4 stars just because it takes little longer time to warm up the wax.</li>
            <li> With any new wax (depending on what type) it can take anywhere from 15 min to 30 to heat up.</li>
            <li> I am still new to DIY waxing, but it takes way longer than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, less weight, gives required hotness.</li>
            <li> It can take 20-30 minutes to heat up a full can, but is much shorter as the amount of wax in the can goes down.</li>
            <li> Easy to store, as the quantity of wax will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first box of wax (I only use it for the bikini area)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty basic setup...</li>
            <li> It warms wax well enough but it seems ridiculously hot even after letting it rest the recommended time.</li>
            <li> The second time  the cord got  hot and melted with in  a matter of 8 mins.  </li>
            <li> I put it on low and the wax is scalding hot...</li>
            <li> This one is simple to use, and you can put the setting exactly where you want it.</li>
            <li> anything over low is too hot for my skin.</li>
            <li> Put the wax in the warmer, put a clean colar on it, turn it on medium to get to heated, then on low and go run some errands or just put it on low and run your errands.</li>
            <li> I use this for waxing at the salon, It is very long lasting and heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> Not the usual use of the melter, but the waxes used are similar, and something as large as a crock pot is kind of big for the amount of wax you need for an accordion.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re me, not even the collars save you from making a huge mess.  </li>
            <li> A little scary using this for the first time, but sure glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard, to get the backs of your legs with this kind (though I&#x27;m sure experience and practice will make it easier), so strips might be easier for about the same cost as a pot of wax, though they&#x27;ll cover less than a pot would.</li>
            <li> I told her a friend purchase the exact same wax warmer with a regular plug which proves that such a unit exists.</li>
            <li> No mess, no fuss, just plug it in, and wax away!</li>
            <li> This person listened to my story, put me on hold, then came back and told me to return the whole unit at THEIR</li>
            <li> Before, I was spending money every 4 weeks going to a professional to get my bikini line done.</li>
            <li> So far, I like this warmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it won&#x27;t die fast like the last one I bought.</li>
            <li> This does just as well as a professional at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I used to have to run back and forth to the kitchen to microwave wax but now with this warmer, it&#x27;s so much</li>
            <li> turn on the warmer when I remember to wax and by the time I actually have time to do it, the wax is melted and ready.</li>
            <li> Not messy at all.</li>
            <li> (green light is on) and keep it there till I finish waxing.</li>
            <li> Arrived to my house early.</li>
            <li> I only replaced it because we spilt so much wax on it that is was sticky to hold.</li>
            <li> Come back and you&#x27;re ready to wax.</li>
            <li> ive used it once so far</li>
            <li> Also, much cheaper on Amazon.com than local beauty product distributors!  </li>
            <li> One con is that once it thoroughly melts, it takes a while to cool down even if you turn the wax warmer completely off.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple and basic design but</li>
            <li> Has a Low, Medium, and High temperature.</li>
            <li> Would recommend always using on the high setting and buy extra sleeves to keep the wax from getting everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have a cheap 4 foot extension cord that I picked up at walmart so that I can pull this little guy close to a window while using since my house has poor lighting and too many trees to get sunlight in.</li>
            <li> It is compact and unbelievably light and can be stored away under the wash basin or in any small cabinet in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> did not get as hot as I expected.</li>
            <li> Ok, this is not a huge wax warmer, but it is big enough for home use.</li>
            <li> Only 3 settings, so not hard to use.</li>
            <li> I really think that you can easily avoid an unpleasant or traumatic waxing experience by having the right tools.</li>
            <li> This is so easy and since I can do it at home I find myself doing them at least once a week.</li>
            <li> nothing major.</li>
            <li> The temperature stayed consistent and the body was not hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> This was not expected.</li>
            <li> This warms really well, it does take about half an hour or so to heat wax completely.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s a bit difficult to tell if the light is on green or not, but it does its job and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> A bit of a tight fit for some other brands.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little worried that I was going to ruin my brows</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to start waxing at home instead of having it professionally done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would suggest using a wax collar to protect the warmer as it can get pretty messy if not protected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll start getting liquidy then if you push the remaining hard wax sitting on the top down under the already melted wax, the rest of the non melted wax will heat up faster.</li>
            <li> Its kind of annoying at first...</li>
            <li> I can set it to high for 20 minutes, go do other chores and then set it to low</li>
            <li> Crank it on high and let the wax melt then turn the setting down until your done using it.</li>
            <li> You can heat up your wax on high, and then turn it down to a warmer temperature while using it.</li>
            <li> I do not notice a big difference from this versus the compact one and due to my limited space I much rather have the compact version.</li>
            <li> used it the first night with hard wax, didn&#x27;t take too long to heat up</li>
            <li> It does the job ok, but I hate to get it out as it is so messy to clean up.  </li>
            <li> It was a lot bigger physically than I expected.</li>
            <li> Especially since I paid significantly less than what the same warmer sells for at my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Its light and not that expensive.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheap and does the job, just like the expensive ones do.</li>
            <li> how long it takes to heat up.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have the lid off for a long period of time you have to play around with the heat settings, but</li>
            <li> Turn it on and it heats up stiff wax within 25 minutes to a soft liquidy goodness.</li>
            <li> : this product came with one wax collar - highly suggested ordering a few to spare, especially if you&#x27;re a messy waxer.</li>
            <li> the wax was not hot enough to spread evenly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re doing anything other than facial waxing</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for bathrooms with limited counter space.</li>
            <li> Previously, I had the basic Gigi warmer that didn&#x27;t have temperature options.</li>
            <li> careful when you use it, though.  </li>
            <li> which the switch was a bit harder to slide because everytime you bump it</li>
            <li> There is really minimal skill needed.</li>
            <li> Just be careful about leaving it on its side.</li>
            <li> I used product a few times only within 5 months.</li>
            <li> Be careful if storing the wax in the pot.</li>
            <li> I have spent in a while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the LOWEST setting is still too high for my hard wax!</li>
            <li> I also like the fact it is a &amp;#34;money saver.&amp;#34; After having to use Prednisone with some health matters and quickly growing some unnecessary hair, I was forced to go to Beauty Shop and have the hair removal process.</li>
            <li> Even the cold wax spills out of it and makes a HUGE mess.</li>
            <li> just turn it on and go do other stuff while waiting...</li>
            <li> and I can move on to other things.  </li>
            <li> It is cheaper here compared to other stores.</li>
            <li> Many customers who purchase will be annoyed or angry at the misrepresentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> not warm enough.</li>
            <li> you either turn the heat up or down.</li>
            <li> It does the job in half the time of microwave wax.</li>
            <li> Way less than salon.</li>
            <li> With the warmer, my waxing time has been cut in half.</li>
            <li> about a half hour-45 min</li>
            <li> Never tip it on its side or you will have a gooey mess on your hands.</li>
            <li> I bought one of those cheapo little warmers that look like</li>
            <li> This little number has already paid for itself.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s a waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to turn it on and off every few minutes to keep the temperature regulated.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and ruined the wax I bought as well.</li>
            <li> I watched a few tutorials online then tried myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now</li>
            <li> the wax is messy although</li>
            <li> The heating functions are not accurate.  </li>
            <li> one star for the cover being so flimsy and one star for the fact that heat settings are not accurate.  </li>
            <li> I was very tired of the expense of professional waxing.</li>
            <li> Incidentally, transformers are expensive and pointless to purchase to use with a simple $27 wax warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small but not too small that you can&#x27;t grab and move around.</li>
            <li> I only gave this 4 stars and that is not because there is anything wrong with it.</li>
            <li> It can get very messy without one.</li>
            <li> and I was sick and tired of paying so much money!</li>
            <li> A tub of hard wax lasted about a year doing face and underarms.</li>
            <li> I will probably end up buying another for my hard wax and maybe save this one for strip wax.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to those who use hard wax.</li>
            <li> I am having a hard time adjusting to it.</li>
            <li> and I found myself at the salon at least once a month</li>
            <li> but seriously.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously she was an incompetent fool</li>
            <li> and I am not good with change.</li>
            <li> very hard to use.</li>
            <li> but I recommend this to anyone tired of paying to get their eyebrows waxed.</li>
            <li> But alas the Cirepil brand that I do use doesn&#x27;t offer a warmer.</li>
            <li> I am not happy and want a replacement.</li>
            <li> Absolutely ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Not fun! :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give one star to the wax and two to the Warmer .The wax is so difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I hoped that some of the reviews were wrong...</li>
            <li> Everything worked and for the price, you couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> THE CONTAINER WAS DENTED AND THE LIQUID HAS OOZED OUT OF THE CONTAINER LID WHICH WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT AND</li>
            <li> that was bad choice  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used my mom&#x27;s warmer, microwavable wax and cold wax- HATED cold wax).</li>
            <li> :((</li>
            <li> but in all honesty this warmer is crap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife like this product. very good product</li>
            <li> Product as described.  Good experience</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give one star to the wax and two to the Warmer .The wax is so difficult to remove.I didn&#x27;t like it at all and i won&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.I used it only once and now it&#x27;s a waste.</li>
            <li> Better then what I was excepted</li>
            <li> Cheaper than stores. That&#x27;s why I brought this warmer. I wanted it when I saw it in the store but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price. When I saw this warmer here on amazon, I jumped at the chance. I was scared that maybe it was smaller or didn&#x27;t work as well. However, It works great for heating wax. It has the control low and high which is important for keeping the wax at the right temperature. I recommend this product for anyone who wants to wax.</li>
            <li> I love it! Before I was using the kind you heat in the microwave &amp; this is 10 times better! Can turn it on &amp; do it when you are ready!!!</li>
            <li> temp levels are pretty accurate, the lower the wax gets the hotter it gets quicker so you will need that low setting after awhile, keeps relatively clean and I does not disappoint!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, its simple to use and compact.   I&#x27;ve noticed wiht some reviews that people arent happy wiht how long it takes to heat up. With any new wax (depending on what type) it can take anywhere from 15 min to 30 to heat up. Its kind of annoying at first...but heat time gets shorter and shorter as you use it. Just start up the warmer and find somethign to do while it heats. Also leave the brown cover on, that seems to speed things up.   I&#x27;m happy wiht the product and hopefully you will be too!! :)</li>
            <li> I will never shave my legs again. Not only is waxing easy, the results last for weeks.  My skin is smooth and hair-free.  The GIGI system is extremely easy to use--just plug it in and place the can of wax inside. Turn the unit \\&quot;on\\&quot; by pulling the lever to the right. In a few minutes, the wax is ready to use.  I recommend buying the cardboard collars; they will keep the unit free of wax as you use it.</li>
            <li> did not get as hot as I expected.</li>
            <li> Best thing I ever invested in!</li>
            <li> temperature doesn&#x27;t get a high as I would like</li>
            <li> I will never buy another GiGi from a store again!  I got 3 wax systems here for almost the price of ONE!  an asset to my businesss and I cannot say enough about price!! thank you so much for this!!!  A++++++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for the last 3 months or so now. Together with the Gigi wax, does a great job in helping me save money. For the price of a bikini wax you get all you need to get started AND you are good for a long time. I&#x27;m still on my first box of wax (I only use it for the bikini area)</li>
            <li> Remember to use the collars!! It can get very messy without one. The instructions say to reduce the heat after the wax has melted, but I found I had to keep it on high or else the wax was not hot enough to spread evenly.</li>
            <li> I had all my supplies set up and ready to go. I unpacked the wax warmer and when I tried to plug it in, discovered that it had a European plug! I could not use it without a transformer. A simple converter would not work because the unit runs on 200-220 volts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I called up Amazon customer service and got a representative who told me that I could return the unit but at my expense. She told me that I received the unit as represented on the web site and since I didn&#x27;t want to keep it, then shipping is my responsibility. I said that I didn&#x27;t want a unit with a plug that I couldn&#x27;t use. She then told me to go buy a converter that costs about a dollar. There was nothing on the website that indicated that I would need a transformer or converter. Incidentally, transformers are expensive and pointless to purchase to use with a simple $27 wax warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She insisted that return shipping be my responsibility because I&#x27;m the one who didn&#x27;t want to go buy a converter. I told her a friend purchase the exact same wax warmer with a regular plug which proves that such a unit exists. So she told me to call up the manufacturer and ask them why there are different plugs. She also claimed that U.S. homes run on 220 volts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously she was an incompetent fool so I hung up and called again and got a different representative. This person listened to my story, put me on hold, then came back and told me to return the whole unit at THEIR expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with Amazon&#x27;s final solution to my problem but am surprised that Amazon still has not updated the web page to indicate that this particular model is intended for use in European countries and that a transformer is needed for use in the US. Many customers who purchase will be annoyed or angry at the misrepresentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to reorder from a different vendor and is still awaiting delivery. If you want to purchase this item, make sure that it&#x27;s model 0225 (for use in the US).</li>
            <li> This warmer does just what it says it will do. Turn it on and it heats up stiff wax within 25 minutes to a soft liquidy goodness. I just wish this had come with extra collars for the wax cans.</li>
            <li> It does the job fine, but after trying \\&quot;do it yourself waxing\\&quot; my daughter &amp; I have decided to let the professionals keep doing it.  Not the warmer&#x27;s fault though!!!</li>
            <li> In the beginning it was working then after 20 min it&#x27;s stopped. I think the voltage in my country is 220V and this work with 110V.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use my wax warmer but when I was about to plug it in, I saw that it was a European plug!  There was nothing written in the description of the item that indicated this.  I don&#x27;t understand why Amazon would even try to sell something like this to American customers.  I know I can buy a converter, but it would have helped knowing this when purchasing my product.</li>
            <li> I have to put this on about 3 hours before I even use it to get hot. Then it is still not that hot.</li>
            <li> The GiGi wax warmer work just fine. Heat the wax and keeps it warm. The GiGi wax warmer is a good product.</li>
            <li> This wax warmer works perfectly. its alot cheaper on here than at Sallys Beauty Supply. This purchase was a great investment and I highly recommend it. Arrived quickly as well!</li>
            <li> After using this twice I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to start waxing at home instead of having it professionally done. What a money and time saver!!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment !!!!  This is by far one of the best wax warmers I have used it heats the wax pretty quick and is easy to adjust to lower temperature settings if the wax feels to hot.</li>
            <li> It does the job in half the time of microwave wax. I didn&#x27;t care for the dome lid. Remember to use the wax collar to keep it tidy.</li>
            <li> it takes 30 min to warm up your wax... but then you can keep it warm while waxing!  it works fine... just turn it on and go do other stuff while waiting...</li>
            <li> I am using this with an 18oz wax can (Parissa) and it definitely does the job. It can take 20-30 minutes to heat up a full can, but is much shorter as the amount of wax in the can goes down. It&#x27;s a pretty basic setup... but I have used 3-4 times, and no complaints!</li>
            <li> Is this the frilliest, fanciest wax warmer on the market?  No.  But it does the job it&#x27;s intended for, it does it WELL, and the value is not to be beaten.  I swear I&#x27;ll never shave my legs again; I like the results from waxing so, so much better (and I&#x27;ll admit it, it appeals to my love of all things gadgety to use something that&#x27;s not a razor).  I could dock it stars for maybe not having the most exacting temperature control, or for not having a lid that&#x27;s fastened to the warmer, or whatever...but seriously.  It was twenty bucks and it works like a champ.  If I want more frills, I&#x27;ll spend more money, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that as far as sheer value there isn&#x27;t a better warmer on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when you use it, though.  If you&#x27;re me, not even the collars save you from making a huge mess.  But I sacrificed a towel to the cause so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> It warms wax well enough but it seems ridiculously hot even after letting it rest the recommended time. To hot for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I will never ever go to a salon again to get waxed. Super inexpensive and worth it if you have the patience and precision. Comes with a sleeve just in case you spill, but I thought it was just packaging and threw it away. SMART! lol. Warms quickly (30 minutes max) and easy to use! Worth it if your brave enough to wax yourself, or have a friend do it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this produce for several months now and I&#x27;m very pleased with how it performs.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I used to have to figure out ways to keep my wax warm longer and had to make several trips to the microwave from the bathroom and it made waxing a whole ordeal and just added more time to an already lengthly process.  Then I switched to GiGi espresso wax and this wax warmer and now, besides pulling my hair out, I don&#x27;t cringe at the thought of waxing.  I can set it to high for 20 minutes, go do other chores and then set it to low and it stays perfect the whole time I&#x27;m waxing.  And it doesn&#x27;t take forever, waxing is over quick and I can move on to other things.  Love this thing!</li>
            <li> The product was what I was looking for.  Will buy another one when I need another one.  Like shopping on line.</li>
            <li> Excellent works perfectly. Safe to handle, see my review of the GiGi wax. Easy to store, as the quantity of wax will last a long time.</li>
            <li> this is what I used in school and I liked it now I have it and it works good I like it!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this. Before, I was spending money every 4 weeks going to a professional to get my bikini line done. This has saved me so much money and it is so much more convenient since it was sometimes hard fitting an appointment into my schedule. I now wax my underarms and legs too which is so much better than shaving! You do have to wait a little while for it to warm up (like it says in the instructions) but I dont mind because it is worth it.</li>
            <li> So far, I like this warmer. Does a great job. I&#x27;m hoping it won&#x27;t die fast like the last one I bought. I bought one of those cheapo little warmers that look like a coffee mug warmer and I will NEVER do that again, although I followed that advice from one of these reviews . LOL&lt;br /&gt;Update... It has been a few months and it is still working PERFECT! I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> it is a great buy!! you need to buy it if you used to wax yourself. it is no need to pay outside. just do it.</li>
            <li> At home, private....and I scream if I want to lol! No seriously I love how convinience this is for me now easy to use, and affordable! Great stuff to have always handy!</li>
            <li> I got this warmer for my wife. It was a lot bigger physically than I expected. It works awesome. Crank it on high and let the wax melt then turn the setting down until your done using it. Pretty simple and basic design but nothing more is needed. She loves it and is very happy</li>
            <li> Works great - the unit takes about 20 minutes to completely heat up the wax but I recommend this to anyone tired of paying to get their eyebrows waxed.</li>
            <li> 1st time worked great. The second time  the cord got  hot and melted with in  a matter of 8 mins.  Don&#x27;t know of this one was defective  But now  trash</li>
            <li> A little scary using this for the first time, but sure glad I bought it. Easy to use once someone gets the hang of it. I also like the fact it is a &amp;#34;money saver.&amp;#34; After having to use Prednisone with some health matters and quickly growing some unnecessary hair, I was forced to go to Beauty Shop and have the hair removal process. Not now, this little machine will definitely come in handy. Glad I purchased it. And, as always, when I need something, I go to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I loved it very much , it saves my so much money every month . Very easy to use just put it on for warming up the wax and ready to use. I gave only 4 stars just because it takes little longer time to warm up the wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this warmer for over 10 yrs and just recently had to replace it.  It does the job.  However here are the cons:  top cover should really be more of a lock feature... Its just like a plate that moves around if u bump it.  The heating functions are not accurate.  It heats up to whatever temp and it really doesn&#x27;t function at 3 levels as it claims.  Its very cute looking,  but since I&#x27;ve been waxing myself since about 16 I&#x27;ve learned that practical is best with wax warmers.  A square or rectangular design is safer to handle when u have to store it as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:  it&#x27;s small,  easy to use and warms all types of wax pretty quickly.  Its light and not that expensive.  It does the job if u are waxing at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took one star for the cover being so flimsy and one star for the fact that heat settings are not accurate.  But overall I think it&#x27;s a great buy and lasts a long time w regular use and care.</li>
            <li> This wax warmer works perfectly. It is cheaper here compared to other stores. And having one at home for personal use instead of going to salon it basically paid for itself.</li>
            <li> Love this thing I Received one with a normal US plug not European I ordered from amazon prime received it within 2 days used it the first night with hard wax, didn&#x27;t take too long to heat up but I wouldn&#x27;t leave it on hi heat while waxing was to hot for me, low/medium keeps it nice and smooth im very pleased with it</li>
            <li> I was very tired of the expense of professional waxing. This does just as well as a professional at a fraction of the price. I use baby powder before waxing, and any old fabric (cut up sheets...) works great.</li>
            <li> Best product for wax warming ,i liked it very much.. I just say wowww&lt;br /&gt;you can easily use this at your home for wax warming</li>
            <li> Great product - once you find the right heat setting for you.  It takes high heat to get he wax to the right consistency, but then you have to turn it down and let the wax cool a bit before applying to skin.  Mark with a sharpee pen your ideal temperature slide setting as I&#x27;m sure it varies for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, easy to store and performs as expected.</li>
            <li> My GF loved it. Perfect for what she needed. Does job well. No mess, no fuss, just plug it in, and wax away!</li>
            <li> this one is a gift.  I love it so much I am sharing!  simple, it works and that&#x27;s what I need.</li>
            <li> I use this with the cerepil blue wax and it is perfect. It gets really hot so with a full tin of blue wax, I set it below the low setting and let it heat through for a bout 30-45 minutes and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> It keeps the wax at the perfect temperature, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting burned.  It sure gives me peace of mind.</li>
            <li> Well, it heats up wax just fine, what more can you ask of it? Five stars because it works without a problem</li>
            <li> I love my warmer, it&#x27;s very easy to use and it&#x27;s easy to store. Way better than having to go to a salon or s</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. We loved it.</li>
            <li> great warmer, great price. I originally thought i&#x27;d just use a candle warmer, but i like how on this you can change the temperatures for different waxes and what not. Does take a bit to heat up, but so does everything.</li>
            <li> Love the adjustable temperatures. Previously, I had the basic Gigi warmer that didn&#x27;t have temperature options. I&#x27;d have to turn it on and off every few minutes to keep the temperature regulated. This is much easier! Love it.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Put it on High heat first and once the wax is melting lower it to the desire heat. it&#x27;s small but not too small that you can&#x27;t grab and move around.</li>
            <li> Does the job it has to do!! Lol just watch the heat setting n have fun torturing yourself!! It has good results!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good warmer for the Gigi waxes. A bit of a tight fit for some other brands. It&#x27;s relatively quick at heating up the wax. Sometimes it&#x27;s a bit difficult to tell if the light is on green or not, but it does its job and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> My Beloved&#x27; says it works great for what she wants it for.</li>
            <li> Works great. Came in quickly and had no problems :)</li>
            <li> This wax warmer is one of the best one out there but it takes time to melt the was even on high. I have learn just to keep it on the med setting until I&#x27;m done with my clients and it works great</li>
            <li> Easy to use, perfect size (not too big, not too small), and clean. The cover allows you to use and reuse the wax without sanitary issues being a problem.</li>
            <li> This wax warmer is amazing. Heats up in about 25 min and when on low is the perfect temperature. Glad I got this. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> So, accordions have their reeds held on the reed blocks with wax, which needs to be melted for application. Not the usual use of the melter, but the waxes used are similar, and something as large as a crock pot is kind of big for the amount of wax you need for an accordion. This type of wax melter/warmer is ideal, in case anyone else ever wonders.</li>
            <li> Works great, only takes about 12 minutes to heat up a lot of wax for waxing facial or body hair.  One of the best warmers I have found.</li>
            <li> I order for my wife she is very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I am disabled and have made my own salon and this wax warmer works great. We enjoy the product. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is still one of my top products that I have ordered from amazon.  I love it!  I like that it is so affordable yet really gets the job done.  It heats up every wax I have put in it.  I am thinking about getting another one incase they stop making/selling these.  Love, Love, Love.  Get it!  You will love it.  I let mine heat for a while before using.  I have a cheap 4 foot extension cord that I picked up at walmart so that I can pull this little guy close to a window while using since my house has poor lighting and too many trees to get sunlight in.</li>
            <li> Good warmer for the price, it&#x27;s cheap and does the job, just like the expensive ones do. Can be used for waxing, paraffin treatments for hands, and paraffin/mask treatments for facials, or simple at home use. Basically any can this size will fit.</li>
            <li> I save so much money doing certain waxing by myself and this warmer is so handy!!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using microwave wax for some time, but the wax warmer allows me to not go back and forth heating it up. So easy to use highly recommend.</li>
            <li> heats up in about 25 minutes.  have used once and seems to be okay so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my best friend. She tested it out on me and it was exactly what she wanted!</li>
            <li> I do not notice a big difference from this versus the compact one and due to my limited space I much rather have the compact version.</li>
            <li> This warmer is amazing! The temperature control is a great feature I love the fact I can control how hot my wax is without the need of burning myself. The best thing is that it can fit many wax  containers.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine having to run back and forth from the microwave to heat wax.  I am still new to DIY waxing, but it takes way longer than I thought it would.  It&#x27;s nice to have the wax warm and ready as long as I need it.</li>
            <li> I love this warmer.  My first one got damaged in a move, and I bought another one as soon I could find it.</li>
            <li> very hard to use. not warm enough. i have to put my wax in the microwave before putting wax in this product. :((</li>
            <li> that was bad choice  i ouldnt control it had to throw it away</li>
            <li> Love this. It&#x27;s adorable, convenient, and gets my wax melted in it&#x27;s original container in no time</li>
            <li> I used to have to run back and forth to the kitchen to microwave wax but now with this warmer, it&#x27;s so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;I turn on the warmer when I remember to wax and by the time I actually have time to do it, the wax is melted and ready. I use the lid like a plate protecting any drips from falling to the floor when I wax my partner&#x27;s back. :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Way less than salon. Suggest you get extra applicators. A tub of hard wax lasted about a year doing face and underarms.</li>
            <li> No problem works great</li>
            <li> Works great! Will save a lot waxing at home!</li>
            <li> With nothing to compare it to, I really like this so far. I wax my legs often and it was nice to use something other than the microwave.</li>
            <li> I love that there is an affordable, manageable wax warmer that realistically can be used in a salon or at home. I&#x27;ve been waxing at home for about 10 years, but this is my first time buying my own warmer (I&#x27;ve used my mom&#x27;s warmer, microwavable wax and cold wax- HATED cold wax). So far it&#x27;s great, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally the only thing I wish was different is the top. I would love if it actually closed instead of just sat on top. But other wax warmers I&#x27;ve seen don&#x27;t even have a top, and it really doesn&#x27;t impact the usability in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any newer or first time at-home waxers, or anyone thinking about trying it, feel free to leave questions!</li>
            <li> Fabulous! I too started using the microwave wax. With the warmer, my waxing time has been cut in half. I love it!! You will too!</li>
            <li> Works well. This is my second GiGi wax warmer. The first one lasted me 5 years.</li>
            <li> arrived on time, item as promised</li>
            <li> Price was great but on the lowest heat setting wax still is VERY hot. I have to wave it in the air to cool first.</li>
            <li> This warmer&#x27;s heat level cannot be controlled! I hoped that some of the reviews were wrong... but in all honesty this warmer is crap. I put it on low and the wax is scalding hot... Absolutely ridiculous! Waste of money and ruined the wax I bought as well. I just invested in a nice quality dual warmer, less trouble and better heat controls!</li>
            <li> Does a nice job melting wax. Wish it had a bigger collar to catch the drips.</li>
            <li> Have been very pleased with the unit.  It does get really hot so make sure lower the temp before applying to someone.&lt;br /&gt;But great unit.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store. Only 3 settings, so not hard to use.</li>
            <li> No complaints here. It heats up solid wax efficiently and quickly. This is my first wax warmer and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a very cute wax warmer - does the trick. In the instructions it mentions a warming collar which doesn&#x27;t appear to be included. It&#x27;s not a big deal because it warms the wax effectively without one. It has a significant footprint so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for bathrooms with limited counter space.</li>
            <li> I love this wax warmer! If you&#x27;re doing anything other than facial waxing and you&#x27;ll have the lid off for a long period of time you have to play around with the heat settings, but nothing major. I purchased this with a roll of muslin, Honee wax, and the collars so you don&#x27;t drip wax into the warmer. While the Honee wax didn&#x27;t do well on my coarse leg hair, the warmer did its job and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase! Especially since I paid significantly less than what the same warmer sells for at my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Works very well. this item works as described.</li>
            <li> I use this for waxing at the salon, It is very long lasting and heats up super fast. Best warmer on the market IMO</li>
            <li> very nice easy to use. which the switch was a bit harder to slide because everytime you bump it you either turn the heat up or down. I would unplug it when not in use...just not turn it to off in case it gets bumped.</li>
            <li> I love how this warmer looks and how fast it warms up. Very impressive for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the LOWEST setting is still too high for my hard wax! I was pretty surprised. I ended up having to turn it off and on to try to maintain the right temperature. Not fun! :( I will probably end up buying another for my hard wax and maybe save this one for strip wax.</li>
            <li> It works well, does what it should, but after trying to do my legs I think I&#x27;d have been better off getting a roller or even just buying the strips, I thought I&#x27;d save money with this kind, but you&#x27;ll have to buy the pots of wax for at least $10 each anyway.  It&#x27;s very hard, to get the backs of your legs with this kind (though I&#x27;m sure experience and practice will make it easier), so strips might be easier for about the same cost as a pot of wax, though they&#x27;ll cover less than a pot would.</li>
            <li> Use to pay $15 to be eyebrow waxed and now I can do ALL of it myself.</li>
            <li> It works!Overall a good buy but make sure to use the cream wax with it. The honey Wax does not work so well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great heater, easy storage, comes with one cardboard ring to prevent a mess. Overall recommend.</li>
            <li> I wanted a wax warmer since I went to my first professional wax session. I thought they were so awesome and it beats having to reheat the wax in the microwave over and over again.</li>
            <li> Love this product as I go through microwavable wax far too often and re-microwaving helps you to lose steam during the waxing process. This keeps it the perfect temperature the entire time. The plastic exterior is a bit cheap, but getting it on sale makes it worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> This wax warmer is just what my esthetician uses at the salon. After spending $30 a month or so for waxing for years, I decided I would try it myself. I watched a few tutorials online then tried myself. I loved it!!! Self waxing is easy and pretty painless. The wax warmer is great. I used it with the all purpose honee for my face and it worked perfect! Wax melted in 20-30 min. Not messy at all.</li>
            <li> This item did meet all expectations. It was shipped really quick and packed in better than new. Everything worked and for the price, you couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Does its job! This can also double as a candle warmer :D</li>
            <li> The Gigi wax warmer is perfect for at home use. It is compact and unbelievably light and can be stored away under the wash basin or in any small cabinet in the bathroom. The best part about this is that it doesn&#x27;t cause any clutter like I was worried about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has multiple heat settings which ensure that you never burn yourself while waxing. I turn it to high as I turn it on and place the wax pot in it. In about 30-40 minutes, the wax gets melted very well and evenly. I then turn it to medium in between the red and green lights once the wax is ready for use (green light is on) and keep it there till I finish waxing. I am very satisfied with this warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest using a wax collar to protect the warmer as it can get pretty messy if not protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would have liked this warmer to have is a better lid. The plastic lid just sits on top of the warmer loosely and can fall off with the slightest of movements. A lid which fit properly would have helped in storing the warmer with the wax in it, without having to remove the pot after use and store the warmer and pot separately. Other than this, it is a good product and the lid certainly does not affect its performance in anyway.</li>
            <li> I have some eye brows that grow very, very fast and I found myself at the salon at least once a month and I was sick and tired of paying so much money! This is so easy and since I can do it at home I find myself doing them at least once a week. At first I was a little worried that I was going to ruin my brows but it really is very, very easy. There is really minimal skill needed. You could always have a friend or family member do it for you if you are worried about doing it yourself. I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now and it&#x27;s still running great. Just be careful about leaving it on its side. Even the cold wax spills out of it and makes a HUGE mess. Makes sure it is 100% flat when you are storing it.</li>
            <li> Does its job. My wife used it for almost six months now. No issues. Recommended for home use. It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Big, hulking unit.  I had a smaller one and liked it much better.  I use it only for facial waxing so I guess if you are waxing larger areas it might work for you.</li>
            <li> I got this warmer and the wax kit to do at home waxing to save money from going to get waxed at a salon. I am glad of my purchase, a couple years later till using it. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works wonderfully. Very useful and definitely cheaper than going to a salon. Wish the wax was included but still a great deal.</li>
            <li> It was great. Arrived to my house early. No complaints only thing to know is that no matter what setting you put it on the wax will be very hot</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you want to achieve the perfect wax consistency. I use it to melt my GiGi All Purpose Honee wax. It takes about 30 minutes to liquefy the wax and while you wait, you can get all your waxing and clean up tools ready.  Even at the max setting, the wax doesn&#x27;t get too hot to apply.  I am a newbie at waxing and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product.  I really think that you can easily avoid an unpleasant or traumatic waxing experience by having the right tools.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and good product.</li>
            <li> This warmer has pros and cons&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;  Heats wax fairly quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No handle on lid&lt;br /&gt;  Lid sits on top it doesn&#x27;t click into place-so when I pull the warmer out and put it way the lid gets knocked off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s been a good warmer. I am searching for one with a lid though and one where the lid fits into place better</li>
            <li> I needed something affordable and simple to get the job done, this has been perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(five more words required for this review to meet amazon standards. end)</li>
            <li> Being an esthetician i&#x27;ve had my fair share with wax warmers. This one is simple to use, and you can put the setting exactly where you want it. Heats wax up pretty fast. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it!</li>
            <li> my wifes is smooth all over now yummy !</li>
            <li> if you turn it on to its highest heat setting and wait about 30 minutes it&#x27;ll start getting liquidy then if you push the remaining hard wax sitting on the top down under the already melted wax, the rest of the non melted wax will heat up faster. One con is that once it thoroughly melts, it takes a while to cool down even if you turn the wax warmer completely off. But I enjoy it, it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the warmer.  The nice thing about it is that you can control the heat.  You can heat up your wax on high, and then turn it down to a warmer temperature while using it.</li>
            <li> Would not buy from anyone else.  This works amazingly for equal or smaller sizes.  It heats up even faster than was originally described.</li>
            <li> Its good and perfectly does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> Have not used it yes, still lookn around to see what hard wax has the greatest reviews...when I do use I may update.</li>
            <li> Never had one of these before.  It does the job ok, but I hate to get it out as it is so messy to clean up.  Is very convenient to have at home which is why I bought.</li>
            <li> This unit is my second unit.  I love this product as it is simple to use and lasts for the long hall.  I only replaced it because we spilt so much wax on it that is was sticky to hold.</li>
            <li> I read a bunch of reviews saying that it &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t heat up.&amp;#34; Mine works great! Just follow the instructions, and the wax won&#x27;t burn. It&#x27;s a great deal for the money, and I would suggest it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I actually bought mine from Sally Beauty Supply before I knew anything about amazon. It works great. Has a Low, Medium, and High temperature. I&#x27;ve been waxing myself for month. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wants to wax. Put the wax in the warmer, put a clean colar on it, turn it on medium to get to heated, then on low and go run some errands or just put it on low and run your errands. Come back and you&#x27;re ready to wax. Get the muslin roll and a pair of scissors, get some baby oil, or any oil to remove the wax, get aloe Vera gel and put on waxed area to calm the skin. Good luck</li>
            <li> THE CONTAINER WAS DENTED AND THE LIQUID HAS OOZED OUT OF THE CONTAINER LID WHICH WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT AND A MESS&lt;br /&gt;THE ACTUAL PRODUCT IS GOOD</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say whether this is a good product or not, they charged me for it, confirmed that it was shipping, but never sent it out. Then, keep on charging my bank account as if they never got payment, it&#x27;s been eight times now, and they are still trying. Had to put a hold on my account, file a fraudulent use claim, and a police report, who knows if I&#x27;ll ever get my money back, Amazon needs to just burn and go out of business all together!! I&#x27;ll be writing reviews on solo shopping sites that list them so people will actually read this, I know they won&#x27;t post it!!!</li>
            <li> Anything over &amp;#34;Low&amp;#34; is too hot. depending on how much time i have i warm the wax on medium and then lower it to the low setting. anything over low is too hot for my skin. besides that it is great and i love it</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It keeps the wax at the temp you want. The collars keep it clean and nice.</li>
            <li> Does its job. Works great for me! I&#x27;ve had it about a year now and no issues. Takes awhile to heat wax but I just pre-heat it about a half hour-45 min before I know I will be using it.</li>
            <li> Item arrived within shipping time frame. But when I opened the box, it looked as if the item had been used before. I bought the waxer Sept 2012 and its still working well to this day. It&#x27;s my first wax warmer so I definitely love how easy and cheaper it is easier to use vs. going to the salon to get waxed. I took 2 stars off because it definitely looks like it was used before it arrived.</li>
            <li> My sister had one, but hers was gross and sticky from all the wax. She never cleaned it though, but I have my very own! It&#x27;s simple, and easy to use. &amp; I&#x27;ll be keeping mine nice and white. :)</li>
            <li> my gigi all [urpose 8oz can fitted perfect. i think it can fit bigger 14oz cans too. the wax is messy although</li>
            <li> this wax warmer is great ive used it once so far and i like the results. It heats the wax up in a great amount of time.</li>
            <li> The delivered product seems used one. It has wax over it and it was delivered without lid. This was not expected. I am going to return it.</li>
            <li> I love my GiGi wax warmer! It makes DIY eyebrow waxing so easy and convenient! Check it out ladies.. Highly recommended. :-)</li>
            <li> I bought this product for an in-home spa party and absolutely love it. I used the GiGi All Purpose Honee wax and set the heat to medium to melt the wax. The temperature stayed consistent and the body was not hot to the touch. I&#x27;m glad I have my own wax pot now for future waxing needs and truly recommend this product to people who are ready and capable to wax at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: this product came with one wax collar - highly suggested ordering a few to spare, especially if you&#x27;re a messy waxer.</li>
            <li> Great product, my har wax from others brand not Gigi&#x27;s fits in this warmer, really good product! 100% recommended. Good!!</li>
            <li> I have had multiple of these and I can tell you it definitely gets the job done. These look better than any other one I&#x27;ve seen, heats evenly for the most part, stir and you&#x27;ll be fine. If you buy muslin by the roll be sure to pick up a pair of zig zag scissors I promise you, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, less weight, gives required hotness.</li>
            <li> In time and works well.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about this warmer at first since I don&#x27;t care for the GiGi wax. But alas the Cirepil brand that I do use doesn&#x27;t offer a warmer. LOL. This one fits the cans perfectly! Warms very quickly; adjustable temp makes for efficient waxing and takes up a small footprint in my tiny NYC apt. Awesome value and still going strong after my winter to summer waxing extravaganza!</li>
            <li> Works well. Heats up pretty quickly. I would recommend it to those who use hard wax. I hope it lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li> This warms really well, it does take about half an hour or so to heat wax completely. I recommend this product to whoever wants to purchase it, I took cosmetology and this is the warmer we used in college. I would recommend using the gigi all purpose honee wax and also the gigi cloth wax strips.  Good luck :)</li>
            <li> The warmer is great, and was deliver really fast . Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Awesome buy and the best product for waxing at home</li>
            <li> It heated up my wax so fast. Love it. Glad I purchased this one.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Paid for itself with first use.  Later realized, it&#x27;s the same one my salon uses.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This little number has already paid for itself. Works great!</li>
            <li> I used product a few times only within 5 months. I bought it only to do touch ups so i wasn&#x27;t planning on using it all the time. It wont turn on anymore. I am not happy and want a replacement. Very upset.</li>
            <li> Gets really hot!  Don&#x27;t turn it up above Medium, or you&#x27;ll burn yourself!</li>
            <li> Heats up well and fine. Perfect size for only $24 including s&amp;h Im happy i purchased it separately instead of with a kit.</li>
            <li> I only gave this 4 stars and that is not because there is anything wrong with it. I am having a hard time adjusting to it. I had the same waxing machine  before for 15 years and I am not good with change.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, i have been using it for 5-6 months now and its works the way it should work. So totally satisfied</li>
            <li> I wish that this wax pot wasn&#x27;t so bulky because I have it for home use. Despite any of its flaws, I love it. It is the best at home waxing solution that I&#x27;ve ever had. I use the sensitive cream wax and it works great for me. Be careful if storing the wax in the pot. Never tip it on its side or you will have a gooey mess on your hands.</li>
            <li> It works awesome, saves space, and is affordable. This is a great find. Got it in a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> excly like in picture, fast shipping, good quality, good price, I am happy with this product, very practic, easy to use. Love it</li>
            <li> I recieved this wax warmer and it took about a half an hour to fully heat up my 13 oz jar of wax, and it worked perfectly. This warmer comes with a clean collar which is very useful during the waxing process. Also it came with an instruction manual, everything worked great. Best 21 dollars I have spent in a while.</li>
            <li> Does its job of warming the wax! Have used it thrice till now and have had no problems yet! What more could you get out of it?!</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5-star rating is because I still prefer the no-heating-needed strips made by Sally Hansen.  However, for regular waxing this is an excellent product.  I only pull it out every 6-8 weeks as the hair on my legs has thinned out over years of using this method of hair removal.  If instructions are followed, this works as intended and does a great job.  Also, much cheaper on Amazon.com than local beauty product distributors!  Remember to use a collar and GiGi wax and applicator.</li>
            <li> at 1/3 the cost of wholesale beauty suppliers i am hooked on getting GiGi Wax warmers here only!  great quality!!</li>
            <li> It works amazing!! I love this wax pot! Defiantly would recommend anyone too buy! I am a beginner and it works perfectly fine for me</li>
            <li> It does take more than an hour to melt the wax. It does work well. Just remember to reduce the heat to make the wax easier to manage. I love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect warmer for beginners. Honestly if I owned a shop I would suggest this warmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this device in Nov 2012 and I&#x27;m more than happy with it, it heats the wax very fast, I use it for soft and hard wax and it&#x27;s great at keeping the wax at a consistent temperature. It comes with a cardboard ring around to avoid any dripping falling on to the warmer, which is good because your machine is always clean.</li>
            <li> Ok, this is not a huge wax warmer, but it is big enough for home use. It is easy to use, you can adjust the temperature and it melts the was pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you cannot get a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; I do recommend using the was collars, it will stay clean longer.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Would recommend always using on the high setting and buy extra sleeves to keep the wax from getting everywhere.</li>
