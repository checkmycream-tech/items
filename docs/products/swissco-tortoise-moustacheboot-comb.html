            <li>Nice comb good weight not the kind</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sexy leg!</li>
            <li>I keep losing these and buying more!</li>
            <li>Also handy for use as a travel comb.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice comb.</li>
            <li>Ordered this comb because it looked nice online.</li>
            <li>Do not use this comb when anyone else is around, you will be laughed at for sure.</li>
            <li>Nicely finished moustache comb.</li>
            <li>(Let&#x27;s be honest:</li>
            <li>It is well made and seems nice quality, but you won&#x27;t trim too close because of the dimensions.</li>
            <li>The leg/boot design looks great but doesn&#x27;t make for the most comfortable grip.</li>
            <li>This comb is a great buy and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I never cared for the waxes (and I did try), but I found Argan Oil to do well even with my wiry hairs in terms of control plus a nice sheen, as well as just being generally healthy for skin and hair.</li>
            <li>easy to hold and nice teeth</li>
            <li>This comb is very stylish and who doesn&#x27;t love feeling a smooth leg?</li>
            <li>Nothing beats combing your mustache than doing it with a sexy leg comb.</li>
            <li>I defy you to find a more desirable beard comb.</li>
            <li>The look of the product is great and it functions good enough, but again, finer is preferred.</li>
            <li>Buy this thing and love it.</li>
            <li>who doesn&#x27;t love the ladies shoe on the end?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a comb shaped like a sexy leg.</li>
            <li>Practical and hilarious.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good quality product with a fun design.</li>
            <li>Craftsmanship is top notch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially good for managing a stache and a short beard.</li>
            <li>you can carry more a stay at home comb.</li>
            <li>I love this comb, I keep it in my pocket and when my hair gets out of place or going up my noise bingo</li>
            <li>What can be more luxurious than that?  </li>
            <li>It appropriately caresses your mustache and beard with the utmost care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it would be better for me.</li>
            <li>The teeth are nice and smooth, and don&#x27;t poke your skin.</li>
            <li>Washed it just to be sure but all in all its a brush and serves its purpose well.</li>
            <li>Your beard or moustache will be smooth and styled like never before!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the bit of style exhibited in making the handle kind of sexy with the girls leg and all.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very nice comb!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know when Nurse Pratchett had the time to pose for this, but her leg&#x27;s shape make a pretty good beard comb.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I like the funny shape and good handle length.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a bit finer comb but am glad the handle is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect size to fit in his back pocket.</li>
            <li>This item is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I also like the extended handle as it is a bit more comfortable in the hand</li>
            <li>the original gets worn out from use.  :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush and was so excited for it to arrive for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>I also use it easily in my beard.</li>
            <li>It easily fits in my front pocket.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li>Has held up in my pocket for about a year now, the gold paint wore off but the comb itself is going strong.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and super stylish :)&lt;</li>
            <li>pretty nice comb.</li>
            <li>Several cheap ones broke in my pocket and even pulled some hairs out of my face but the Swissco Tortoise Moustache/Boot Comb always performed beautifully.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and stylish comb!</li>
            <li>The teeth are smooth, so they don&#x27;t bite or scrap.</li>
            <li>He seems to enjoy it as a mustache comb</li>
            <li>Great style and materials, but quite a bit smaller than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>Not such a great feel.</li>
            <li>Again, it has a smooth glide,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too funny not to love...</li>
            <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t want a special item like this?</li>
            <li>Even looks like a sweet boot.</li>
            <li>The quality of this hand made item is top notch:sturdy, smoothe, and straight.</li>
            <li>I rocked a handlebar mustache for a good year (and it&#x27;s coming back!)</li>
            <li>A cool gift idea, and talking piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(which is nice because I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>It glides right through hairs very very slickly, smoothly, and sweetly.</li>
            <li>The size makes it a bit less practical for a substantial beard, but great for lighter beards and mustaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swissco also thinks this comb may be interacting with your scalp (smoothly).</li>
            <li>Very well made, strong and slips in my pocket without getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>The fine toothed comb definitely straightens the shortest of hairs and makes a first time beard wearer like myself feel much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>It works great on his little mustache.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also useful for combing eyelashes.</li>
            <li>If you women are looking for a way to induce your ape man in your life to tackle those tangles and bird nests, you will do well with this fun, woman&#x27;s leg shaped comb.  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good, dedicated comb for their manly facial locks.</li>
            <li>It has a bigger handle than the Kent, so it&#x27;s a bit more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Wear of golden shoe&lt;br</li>
            <li>a Gal Leg comb-you&#x27;d probabbly sell a lot more combs to old cowboys...</li>
            <li>No sharp edges &amp; very smooth plastic.</li>
            <li>About the right length / teeth / etc.</li>
            <li>Combs right thru the hair, no pulls, addresses tangles (if any) and adore that face that it&#x27;s handmade...not in Switzerland like</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>This little baby is THE beard comb to own!</li>
            <li>Good little comb</li>
            <li>And it works pretty well too.</li>
            <li>This is my first comb</li>
            <li>The look of a leg makes it pretty snazzy.</li>
            <li>comb is so worth the price, really.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I was extremely surprised at how smooth the teeth were when I first ran it through my &#x27;stache.  </li>
            <li>I like the extra length of this comb compared to the Kent mustache combs, but I think the Kent is slightly better.</li>
            <li>It is perfectly smooth (unlike your average comb), and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased and will look to Swissco, first,  for any of my facial hair needs.</li>
            <li>realize that we are only talking about a comb here, but the truth is, when you run a comb with sharp, pointy teeth through your whiskers, it isn&#x27;t necessarily the greatest feeling.  </li>
            <li>For normal people this is the right size.</li>
            <li>It is strong and durable, and is able to put up with my thick and knotty beard.</li>
            <li>handy little comb.</li>
            <li>This is a nice sturdy little comb that fits in your pocket if needed.  </li>
            <li>works very well and has a extra smooth feel to it when brushing your moustache, however some hairs still curl.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I must have combed my &#x27;stache for 5 minutes straight after opening this package.  </li>
            <li>It meets my needs very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The quality of the comb is beyond doubt thanks to the 12 step process, the pumics shining and the handmade construction.  </li>
            <li>I for one will be recommending this for any and all Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz drinkers with or without moustaches.</li>
            <li>Satisfacio my needs and my life still had it very well</li>
            <li>The teeth are rather reasonably spaced</li>
            <li>so you can use it to really disperse any mustache wax you may be using.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me, however.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There really isn&#x27;t anything to dislike about this product other than I wish it came with a better sleeve to store it</li>
            <li>Really sharp looking and works even better .</li>
            <li>This is a nice quality small comb for your mustache.</li>
            <li>After combing for a couple days my beard has gone from, scraggly and rough to comb, to well kept and easily manageable.</li>
            <li>The only issue is that the gold paint on the shoe does wear off quickly.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my husbands unruley beard mainly because of the leg shape at the end.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this as a &#x27;love it&#x27; item is because I realized I already had a comb that could serve the same purpose as this.</li>
            <li>It has a good, hefty feel to it that feels quite thick as far as combs go.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The only drawback to this nice little comb was that over time the golden writing and the boot itself got rubbed out so much that in the end it was only tortoise.</li>
            <li>and went through several different combs of differing length and teeth density and this one was by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>slides right through that facial hair like butter without tugging.</li>
            <li>This is the first actual moustache comb I have bought/used aside from the chintzy plastic thing you get with Clubman wax</li>
            <li>Maybe it was because it was the exact same one he mentioned, but</li>
            <li>The shape of the handle (the leg) isn&#x27;t exactly ergonomic (aggravates my arthritis with extended use), although it is more so than the tiny Kent combs (e.g. http://www.amazon.com/Kent-Hand-Beard-Moustache-81T/dp/B004K3J6H6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1416426818&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;beard+comb), which I hardly ever ran through my beard without losing my grip and it flying through the air.</li>
            <li>Also the brush is very durable and will grow on you, nothing is classier then pulling out this fine lady to comb your delicate mustache.</li>
            <li>Every man needs to comb his mustache, especially if he can grow a real one.  </li>
            <li>I have a 6 month old untrimmed conglomerate of bristly beard hair on my face.</li>
            <li>When you let your mustache grow out long, you need something to keep it combed to the sides, out of your mouth, and cups of hot coffee.</li>
            <li>I have an old pair of spurs that are called &amp;#34;gal legs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Has a long enough handle to keep a hold of, and strong enough to make through my beard even after getting completely matted.</li>
            <li>I mean a sexy woman&#x27;s leg, hand made in Switzerland?</li>
            <li>This comb is sooooooooooo small, actually, tiny is a better word.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, small and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This is a fun little moustache comb.</li>
            <li>This particular one I had to have not only for the reputation Swissco has but for the sheer style of a lady&#x27;s leg.  </li>
            <li>Kind of uncomfortable and</li>
            <li>This comb may fit your needs, but it is a bit too thick to meet mine.  </li>
            <li>And man, I seriously say when I first ran this comb across my face, I sighed in pure pleasure.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it was a very sturdy comb</li>
            <li>I shopped a dozen or so facial hair grooming combs here on Amazon, and although this Swissco was on the upper end of the price scale, I decided in the end to get it based on the general glowing reviews compared to others.  </li>

            <li> This comb is a great buy and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I never cared for the waxes (and I did try), but I found Argan Oil to do well even with my wiry hairs in terms of control plus a nice sheen, as well as just being generally healthy for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> easy to hold and nice teeth</li>
            <li> This comb is very stylish and who doesn&#x27;t love feeling a smooth leg?</li>
            <li> Nothing beats combing your mustache than doing it with a sexy leg comb.</li>
            <li> I defy you to find a more desirable beard comb.</li>
            <li> The look of the product is great and it functions good enough, but again, finer is preferred.</li>
            <li> Buy this thing and love it.</li>
            <li> who doesn&#x27;t love the ladies shoe on the end?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comb shaped like a sexy leg.</li>
            <li> Practical and hilarious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quality product with a fun design.</li>
            <li> Craftsmanship is top notch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially good for managing a stache and a short beard.</li>
            <li> you can carry more a stay at home comb.</li>
            <li> I love this comb, I keep it in my pocket and when my hair gets out of place or going up my noise bingo</li>
            <li> What can be more luxurious than that?  </li>
            <li> It appropriately caresses your mustache and beard with the utmost care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it would be better for me.</li>
            <li> The teeth are nice and smooth, and don&#x27;t poke your skin.</li>
            <li> Washed it just to be sure but all in all its a brush and serves its purpose well.</li>
            <li> Your beard or moustache will be smooth and styled like never before!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the bit of style exhibited in making the handle kind of sexy with the girls leg and all.</li>
            <li> Overall, a very nice comb!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know when Nurse Pratchett had the time to pose for this, but her leg&#x27;s shape make a pretty good beard comb.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I like the funny shape and good handle length.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a bit finer comb but am glad the handle is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect size to fit in his back pocket.</li>
            <li> This item is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I also like the extended handle as it is a bit more comfortable in the hand</li>
            <li> the original gets worn out from use.  :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush and was so excited for it to arrive for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I also use it easily in my beard.</li>
            <li> It easily fits in my front pocket.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li> Has held up in my pocket for about a year now, the gold paint wore off but the comb itself is going strong.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and super stylish :)&lt;</li>
            <li> pretty nice comb.</li>
            <li> Several cheap ones broke in my pocket and even pulled some hairs out of my face but the Swissco Tortoise Moustache/Boot Comb always performed beautifully.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and stylish comb!</li>
            <li> The teeth are smooth, so they don&#x27;t bite or scrap.</li>
            <li> He seems to enjoy it as a mustache comb</li>
            <li> Great style and materials, but quite a bit smaller than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> Not such a great feel.</li>
            <li> Again, it has a smooth glide,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too funny not to love...</li>
            <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t want a special item like this?</li>
            <li> Even looks like a sweet boot.</li>
            <li> The quality of this hand made item is top notch:sturdy, smoothe, and straight.</li>
            <li> I rocked a handlebar mustache for a good year (and it&#x27;s coming back!)</li>
            <li> A cool gift idea, and talking piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (which is nice because I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> It glides right through hairs very very slickly, smoothly, and sweetly.</li>
            <li> The size makes it a bit less practical for a substantial beard, but great for lighter beards and mustaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swissco also thinks this comb may be interacting with your scalp (smoothly).</li>
            <li> Very well made, strong and slips in my pocket without getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> The fine toothed comb definitely straightens the shortest of hairs and makes a first time beard wearer like myself feel much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It works great on his little mustache.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also useful for combing eyelashes.</li>
            <li> If you women are looking for a way to induce your ape man in your life to tackle those tangles and bird nests, you will do well with this fun, woman&#x27;s leg shaped comb.  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good, dedicated comb for their manly facial locks.</li>
            <li> It has a bigger handle than the Kent, so it&#x27;s a bit more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Wear of golden shoe&lt;br</li>
            <li> a Gal Leg comb-you&#x27;d probabbly sell a lot more combs to old cowboys...</li>
            <li> No sharp edges &amp; very smooth plastic.</li>
            <li> About the right length / teeth / etc.</li>
            <li> Combs right thru the hair, no pulls, addresses tangles (if any) and adore that face that it&#x27;s handmade...not in Switzerland like</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> This little baby is THE beard comb to own!</li>
            <li> Good little comb</li>
            <li> And it works pretty well too.</li>
            <li> This is my first comb</li>
            <li> The look of a leg makes it pretty snazzy.</li>
            <li> comb is so worth the price, really.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised at how smooth the teeth were when I first ran it through my &#x27;stache.  </li>
            <li> I like the extra length of this comb compared to the Kent mustache combs, but I think the Kent is slightly better.</li>
            <li> It is perfectly smooth (unlike your average comb), and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased and will look to Swissco, first,  for any of my facial hair needs.</li>
            <li> realize that we are only talking about a comb here, but the truth is, when you run a comb with sharp, pointy teeth through your whiskers, it isn&#x27;t necessarily the greatest feeling.  </li>
            <li> For normal people this is the right size.</li>
            <li> It is strong and durable, and is able to put up with my thick and knotty beard.</li>
            <li> handy little comb.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sturdy little comb that fits in your pocket if needed.  </li>
            <li> works very well and has a extra smooth feel to it when brushing your moustache, however some hairs still curl.</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I must have combed my &#x27;stache for 5 minutes straight after opening this package.  </li>
            <li> It meets my needs very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The quality of the comb is beyond doubt thanks to the 12 step process, the pumics shining and the handmade construction.  </li>
            <li> I for one will be recommending this for any and all Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz drinkers with or without moustaches.</li>
            <li> Satisfacio my needs and my life still had it very well</li>
            <li> The teeth are rather reasonably spaced</li>
            <li> so you can use it to really disperse any mustache wax you may be using.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me, however.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There really isn&#x27;t anything to dislike about this product other than I wish it came with a better sleeve to store it</li>
            <li> Really sharp looking and works even better .</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality small comb for your mustache.</li>
            <li> After combing for a couple days my beard has gone from, scraggly and rough to comb, to well kept and easily manageable.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that the gold paint on the shoe does wear off quickly.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husbands unruley beard mainly because of the leg shape at the end.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this as a &#x27;love it&#x27; item is because I realized I already had a comb that could serve the same purpose as this.</li>
            <li> It has a good, hefty feel to it that feels quite thick as far as combs go.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The only drawback to this nice little comb was that over time the golden writing and the boot itself got rubbed out so much that in the end it was only tortoise.</li>
            <li> and went through several different combs of differing length and teeth density and this one was by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> slides right through that facial hair like butter without tugging.</li>
            <li> This is the first actual moustache comb I have bought/used aside from the chintzy plastic thing you get with Clubman wax</li>
            <li> Maybe it was because it was the exact same one he mentioned, but</li>
            <li> The shape of the handle (the leg) isn&#x27;t exactly ergonomic (aggravates my arthritis with extended use), although it is more so than the tiny Kent combs (e.g. http://www.amazon.com/Kent-Hand-Beard-Moustache-81T/dp/B004K3J6H6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1416426818&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;beard+comb), which I hardly ever ran through my beard without losing my grip and it flying through the air.</li>
            <li> Also the brush is very durable and will grow on you, nothing is classier then pulling out this fine lady to comb your delicate mustache.</li>
            <li> Every man needs to comb his mustache, especially if he can grow a real one.  </li>
            <li> I have a 6 month old untrimmed conglomerate of bristly beard hair on my face.</li>
            <li> When you let your mustache grow out long, you need something to keep it combed to the sides, out of your mouth, and cups of hot coffee.</li>
            <li> I have an old pair of spurs that are called &amp;#34;gal legs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Has a long enough handle to keep a hold of, and strong enough to make through my beard even after getting completely matted.</li>
            <li> I mean a sexy woman&#x27;s leg, hand made in Switzerland?</li>
            <li> This comb is sooooooooooo small, actually, tiny is a better word.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, small and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is a fun little moustache comb.</li>
            <li> This particular one I had to have not only for the reputation Swissco has but for the sheer style of a lady&#x27;s leg.  </li>
            <li> Kind of uncomfortable and</li>
            <li> This comb may fit your needs, but it is a bit too thick to meet mine.  </li>
            <li> And man, I seriously say when I first ran this comb across my face, I sighed in pure pleasure.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it was a very sturdy comb</li>
            <li> I shopped a dozen or so facial hair grooming combs here on Amazon, and although this Swissco was on the upper end of the price scale, I decided in the end to get it based on the general glowing reviews compared to others.  </li>
            <li> I mean, hell I&#x27;m brushing mine right now.</li>
            <li> Using this comb now just brings about painful tugging from tangles and such and it doesn&#x27;t fit really.</li>
            <li> Once it came I noticed that the gold paint on the letter was chipping and the brush itself seemed a little scuffed so for it being new</li>
            <li> Comb was smaller then I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the golden \\&quot;boot\\&quot; is quickly wearing from the base.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 was due to the unfinished details.</li>
            <li> But at least I have a good conversation piece when I take this bad boy out in public.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to be thrown in my back pocket</li>
            <li> plus my mustache would feel lonely without it...</li>
            <li> The comb starts out at about .4 inches wide and tapers off to about .25-.275 by the end.</li>
            <li> My girlie hated it, but the bros LOVED it.</li>
            <li> comb lives up to the other reviews</li>
            <li> Wax does not clog in this comb due to the material.  </li>
            <li> My other combs do both of those things.</li>
            <li> I keep one at home and the other with me in my pocket.</li>
            <li> The only down side I can even come up with is the gold graphics on the side have been coming off, slowly, over the passed week; due to me putting it in my pocket and pulling it out so often.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is thick and wiry and this comb does well when it comes to shaping my mustache.</li>
            <li> I use it to comb out my beard after I scrub down with Bluebeard&#x27;s beard wash.</li>
            <li> comb is very sharp looking.</li>
            <li> Small enough to keep in your pocket, but not so small you can&#x27;t handle it.  </li>
            <li> some previous reviews have thought.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend could care less about the paint and uses his all the time</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I prefer the Swissco Tortoise Mustache/Beard Comb (Pack of 2) for less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the gold on the shoe has already worn off after less than a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had moustache/beard combs in the past, usually being tiny little things with really sharp teeth, making grooming a rather unpleasant task, one I found myself doing less and less due to the lack of a decent comb.  </li>
            <li> Teeth seem strong &amp; base body is substantial.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never had a hand-cut comb, you&#x27;re missing out.</li>
            <li> It beats a plain &#x27;stache comb any day.</li>
            <li> It helps me tame my moustache.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little small for a beard</li>
            <li> I really like the style of this bad boy</li>
            <li> I read in one review that the guy complained it was too small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain, but moulded plastic combs just don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> The quality shines through as their are no sharp teeth and no combing is unpleasant</li>
            <li> /&gt;Why have a boring old comb when you can use the &amp;#34;leg-lamp&amp;#34; facial hair equivalent?</li>
            <li> I was to say the least a bit apprehensive about this purchase, but my beard guru Jack Passion said it&#x27;s what I need, so I ordered one.</li>
            <li> It is in no way uncomfortable to hold as the angles seem to be well thought out.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve outgrown this as a beard comb.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this boot comb</li>
            <li> I found that weird.</li>
            <li> so it can&#x27;t be all that bad...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very good.  easy to hold and nice teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sexy leg! Like leg lamp, but way smaller! People get a kick out of this when I pull it out of my pocket. And it works pretty well too.</li>
            <li> This is a cute brush, great for concentrating on roots. Just remember that this is tiny.</li>
            <li> excellent quality, unique looks.</li>
            <li> Great price and quality</li>
            <li> Nothing beats combing your mustache than doing it with a sexy leg comb. This comb is not just a novelty item, the quality of this product make it a great value as well.</li>
            <li> handy little comb. I use it to comb out my beard after I scrub down with Bluebeard&#x27;s beard wash. Also handy for use as a travel comb. And it sort of reminds me of the leg lamp from that one Christmas movie that TBS plays non stop on Christmas day.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a quality comb.  The description on Amazon.com says \\&quot;made in India,\\&quot; but it is made in Switzerland.</li>
            <li> This comb is a great buy and worth the money. This is my first comb and I am very pleased with the quality and feel it provides. After combing for a couple days my beard has gone from, scraggly and rough to comb, to well kept and easily manageable. The only down side I can even come up with is the gold graphics on the side have been coming off, slowly, over the passed week; due to me putting it in my pocket and pulling it out so often. Overall, I am very pleased and will look to Swissco, first,  for any of my facial hair needs.</li>
            <li> Has held up in my pocket for about a year now, the gold paint wore off but the comb itself is going strong.  About the right length / teeth / etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know when Nurse Pratchett had the time to pose for this, but her leg&#x27;s shape make a pretty good beard comb. It&#x27;s light, small and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This little baby is THE beard comb to own! I mean a sexy woman&#x27;s leg, hand made in Switzerland? Get outta here! I defy you to find a more desirable beard comb. I mean, hell I&#x27;m brushing mine right now.</li>
            <li> comb lives up to the other reviews...........come on it&#x27;s a comb, I&#x27;m not going to do a backflip for it, but it does meet my expectations.  Also, the shapely leg handle is a \\&quot;nice\\&quot; touch</li>
            <li> Great mustache comb.  Wax does not clog in this comb due to the material.  This item is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Every man needs to comb his mustache, especially if he can grow a real one.  I bought this for my guy friend who has the thickest &#x27;stache.  It&#x27;s holding up well.  The look of a leg makes it pretty snazzy.</li>
            <li> Would have preferred a finer comb for a mustache than this provided. The look of the product is great and it functions good enough, but again, finer is preferred.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my husband , he loves it! He thought what a novel idea a boot comb! he gets a lot of reactions from it! nice and compact!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. The teeth are smooth, so they don&#x27;t bite or scrap. My other combs do both of those things. Buy this thing and love it.</li>
            <li> i got this as a gift for my husband when we were dating and he thought it was a a hoot.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great value. Who wouldn&#x27;t want a special item like this? It beats a plain &#x27;stache comb any day. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent Indian made comb.</li>
            <li> Good little comb that&#x27;s big enough to get a hold of. Sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> The teeth are a perfect size and help remove any flakes. I also like the extended handle as it is a bit more comfortable in the hand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and sturdy. It helps me tame my moustache. It&#x27;s great for working wax through it. It&#x27;s also useful for combing eyelashes. I also use it easily in my beard. A wonderful tool!</li>
            <li> Awesome comb for grooming your handlebar.  Small enough to keep in your pocket, but not so small you can&#x27;t handle it.  Sturdy and well made--and who doesn&#x27;t love the ladies shoe on the end?</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and stylish comb! I like its style and the gap between the teeth is perfect for my beard.</li>
            <li> I keep losing these and buying more! They should sell 5-packs at a discount! The shape of the handle (the leg) isn&#x27;t exactly ergonomic (aggravates my arthritis with extended use), although it is more so than the tiny Kent combs (e.g. http://www.amazon.com/Kent-Hand-Beard-Moustache-81T/dp/B004K3J6H6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1416426818&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;beard+comb), which I hardly ever ran through my beard without losing my grip and it flying through the air.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comb shaped like a sexy leg. Practical and hilarious. The only issue is that the gold paint on the shoe does wear off quickly.</li>
            <li> this is a great mustache comb. It easily fits in my front pocket. It didn&#x27;t pull my mustache hair the way my regular comb does. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the boot shape on the end. So I trimmed the heel off.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my brother for christmas. He seems to enjoy it as a mustache comb so I would say that it works well. I have not used it since i do not have a mustache.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had moustache/beard combs in the past, usually being tiny little things with really sharp teeth, making grooming a rather unpleasant task, one I found myself doing less and less due to the lack of a decent comb.  I shopped a dozen or so facial hair grooming combs here on Amazon, and although this Swissco was on the upper end of the price scale, I decided in the end to get it based on the general glowing reviews compared to others.  And man, I seriously say when I first ran this comb across my face, I sighed in pure pleasure.  The teeth design, angle, length, everything about this comb combines needful grooming with a luxuriant experience!  I have an uploaded picture so you can see the relative size compared to a standard hardback book.  I found it to be an excellent length for grip and teeth area for both my life-long moustache and my periodic beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb is so worth the price, really.  If you women are looking for a way to induce your ape man in your life to tackle those tangles and bird nests, you will do well with this fun, woman&#x27;s leg shaped comb.  And guys, I have been using Argan Oil (specifically [[ASIN:B00KD73PBQ Argan Oil For Hair Treatment &amp; Elixir Serum]]) as a moustache/beard oil.  I never cared for the waxes (and I did try), but I found Argan Oil to do well even with my wiry hairs in terms of control plus a nice sheen, as well as just being generally healthy for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Very well made, strong and slips in my pocket without getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;Nice comb, I have a folding version also.</li>
            <li> This comb is excellent. It is strong and durable, and is able to put up with my thick and knotty beard. Very stylish. Probably is smaller than you are expecting it to be.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husbands unruley beard mainly because of the leg shape at the end.  LOVED the look of it.  We found it to be so much more than just an awesome piece to look at.  It does that job amazingly!  Combs right thru the hair, no pulls, addresses tangles (if any) and adore that face that it&#x27;s handmade...not in Switzerland like some previous reviews have thought.  I will be purchasing a backup just in case the original gets worn out from use.  :)</li>
            <li> works very well and has a extra smooth feel to it when brushing your moustache, however some hairs still curl. It might be the brush it might be the hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard and mustache combed well. It&#x27;s a good quality product with a fun design. I can highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Craftsmanship is top notch. It is a pleasing comb to use. I was expecting a bit finer comb but am glad the handle is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I just want to add to the list of people singing the praises of this moustache comb.  I was extremely surprised at how smooth the teeth were when I first ran it through my &#x27;stache.  It has a good, hefty feel to it that feels quite thick as far as combs go.  It is in no way uncomfortable to hold as the angles seem to be well thought out.  This is the first actual moustache comb I have bought/used aside from the chintzy plastic thing you get with Clubman wax and it is like a dream come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that we are only talking about a comb here, but the truth is, when you run a comb with sharp, pointy teeth through your whiskers, it isn&#x27;t necessarily the greatest feeling.  I must have combed my &#x27;stache for 5 minutes straight after opening this package.  All in all, 5 stars is a perfectly good rating for this and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good, dedicated comb for their manly facial locks.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent comb! It glides right through hairs very very slickly, smoothly, and sweetly. It&#x27;s especially good for managing a stache and a short beard. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve outgrown this as a beard comb. I have a 6 month old untrimmed conglomerate of bristly beard hair on my face. Using this comb now just brings about painful tugging from tangles and such and it doesn&#x27;t fit really. However, it&#x27;s still perfect for my stache. If you want it for your giant beard, though, I&#x27;d suggest you look elsewhere. I know I have to now.</li>
            <li> Nice comb good weight not the kind you can carry more a stay at home comb.I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice comb.</li>
            <li> Great style and materials, but quite a bit smaller than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Ordered this comb because it looked nice online. I had this shipped to my office and when I opened the package (in front of my colleagues), we could not stop laughing. This comb is sooooooooooo small, actually, tiny is a better word. Do not use this comb when anyone else is around, you will be laughed at for sure. Buy it for a joke, not for your beard!</li>
            <li> I love this comb, I keep it in my pocket and when my hair gets out of place or going up my noise bingo</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  A couple of people thought it was a whale instead of a leg, but that&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> This thing was a great comb! slides right through that facial hair like butter without tugging. Even looks like a sweet boot. Perfect size to keep in your pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up losing both of them somewhere! Oops! Time to buy another.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be an excellent comb,especially for the price. The quality of this hand made item is top notch:sturdy, smoothe, and straight. The fine toothed comb definitely straightens the shortest of hairs and makes a first time beard wearer like myself feel much more comfortable. I&#x27;ve tried using the small comb that comes with most beard waxes and find them a bit small; this hand made comb is just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> This is a quality hand made comb . Really sharp looking and works even better . Teeth glide through the stache . This is the comb that doesnt leave the house .</li>
            <li> I use this for my 5 lb dog whenever I give him a haircut. It works great on his little mustache. Very handy. I should have thought of ordering this sooner.</li>
            <li> Comb was smaller then I expected.</li>
            <li> I did not know what to expect when I ordered this.  It&#x27;s great.  I carry in my shirt pocket and use it quite often.  It meets my needs very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This Swissco product is a great novelty comb that works! It&#x27;s very sturdy. You can grip the ankle and still have total control over the speed and direction of the teeth while grooming. The toe and heel are perfect for parting and spring twisting your beard.</li>
            <li> Nicely finished moustache comb. No sharp edges &amp; very smooth plastic. Teeth seem strong &amp; base body is substantial. Would have preferred the teeth to be closer for easier shaping of my moustache but that may just be my styling preference. Overall, a very nice comb!</li>
            <li> I rocked a handlebar mustache for a good year (and it&#x27;s coming back!) and went through several different combs of differing length and teeth density and this one was by far my favorite. Several cheap ones broke in my pocket and even pulled some hairs out of my face but the Swissco Tortoise Moustache/Boot Comb always performed beautifully. The only drawback to this nice little comb was that over time the golden writing and the boot itself got rubbed out so much that in the end it was only tortoise. Other than that it was a very sturdy comb and I found it to be the perfect length.</li>
            <li> For years I have loved Swissco combs.  This particular one I had to have not only for the reputation Swissco has but for the sheer style of a lady&#x27;s leg.  What can be more luxurious than that?  It appropriately caresses your mustache and beard with the utmost care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There really isn&#x27;t anything to dislike about this product other than I wish it came with a better sleeve to store it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K</li>
            <li> If it had a bit finer teeth it would be better for me. It works pretty good.</li>
            <li> This comb is very stylish and who doesn&#x27;t love feeling a smooth leg? The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this as a &#x27;love it&#x27; item is because I realized I already had a comb that could serve the same purpose as this. But at least I have a good conversation piece when I take this bad boy out in public.</li>
            <li> I like the extra length of this comb compared to the Kent mustache combs, but I think the Kent is slightly better. It has a curve across the ends of the teeth that conforms to my chin and upper lip. Also, the teeth are set closer together on the Kent, which I think keeps the stache look nicer. But, this Swissco is a close second. It has a bigger handle than the Kent, so it&#x27;s a bit more comfortable to use. I think It would work great if my beard was longer than it is. The teeth are nice and smooth, and don&#x27;t poke your skin. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this boot comb (Let&#x27;s be honest: At the end of the day, it&#x27;s still just a comb!).</li>
            <li> Even though I do not have a moustache I bought a Swissco Tortoise Moustache/Boot Comb for its sheer enticing nature.  The quality of the comb is beyond doubt thanks to the 12 step process, the pumics shining and the handmade construction.  The aesthetic beauty of the leg and boot handle cannot be faulted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish that I had a luxurious upper lip forest upon which I could let this glorious personal grooming accoutrement roam in its boot styled manner.  I for one will be recommending this for any and all Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz drinkers with or without moustaches.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush and was so excited for it to arrive for my boyfriend. Once it came I noticed that the gold paint on the letter was chipping and the brush itself seemed a little scuffed so for it being new I found that weird. Washed it just to be sure but all in all its a brush and serves its purpose well. My boyfriend could care less about the paint and uses his all the time so I would recommend buying it. The only reason I gave it a 4 was due to the unfinished details.</li>
            <li> This is a great comb. Made well, great shape.the teeth are perfect and provide for great mustache care. The leg for a handle is a plus.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and super stylish :)&lt;br /&gt;Why have a boring old comb when you can use the &amp;#34;leg-lamp&amp;#34; facial hair equivalent?</li>
            <li> This is a fun little moustache comb. If you&#x27;ve never had a hand-cut comb, you&#x27;re missing out. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but moulded plastic combs just don&#x27;t compare. Your beard or moustache will be smooth and styled like never before!</li>
            <li> I really like the style of this bad boy, the chicks dig it too...so it can&#x27;t be all that bad...plus my mustache would feel lonely without it...it&#x27;s grown (no pun intended) quite fond of it! Lol</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it!! It is a perfect size to fit in his back pocket.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too funny not to love...</li>
            <li> I think that these goods, it is of very good quality. Satisfacio my needs and my life still had it very well</li>
            <li> I grew out my stache for my friends wedding and hit everyone at the wedding with a set of handlebars. My girlie hated it, but the bros LOVED it. This comb was icing on the cake. It&#x27;s functional and it reminds me of A Christmas Story. Win win.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a number of years, and like the feel, the compact size, and craftmanship. I keep one at home and the other with me in my pocket. The price is right.</li>
            <li> Definitely what I look for.</li>
            <li> When you let your mustache grow out long, you need something to keep it combed to the sides, out of your mouth, and cups of hot coffee. Using a bit of mustache wax to coat the hair, this comb is perfect for moving the hairs into a horizontal arrangement. I liked it so much I bought a second, to keep in the car.</li>
            <li> Not such a great feel. Kind of uncomfortable and the teeth are to close in proximity to one another. Looks great sitting on the shelf though.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sturdy little comb that fits in your pocket if needed.  I think it&#x27;s a little small for a beard but it&#x27;s perfect for a moustache.  The leg/boot design looks great but doesn&#x27;t make for the most comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> Would I recommend this product? Absolutely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I prefer the Swissco Tortoise Mustache/Beard Comb (Pack of 2) for less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb is very sharp looking. If Ralphie&#x27;s father from A Christmas Story were to have a comb for a mustache, this would assuredly be the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the golden \\&quot;boot\\&quot; is quickly wearing from the base. The actual comb teeth  probably only stretch about 2+ inches, though the \\&quot;handle\\&quot; extends it to about a total or 4.5 inches. The comb starts out at about .4 inches wide and tapers off to about .25-.275 by the end. The size makes it a bit less practical for a substantial beard, but great for lighter beards and mustaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swissco also thinks this comb may be interacting with your scalp (smoothly). Again, it has a smooth glide, albeit a bit of a minimized one because of the dimensions of the comb&#x27;s teeth. But it looks good. A cool gift idea, and talking piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Cool factor&lt;br /&gt;-Depth of upper section of teeth&lt;br /&gt;-Good construction&lt;br /&gt;-Smooth glide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Expensive (comparatively)&lt;br /&gt;-Small comb face&lt;br /&gt;-Wear of golden shoe&lt;br /&gt;-Amazon Add On item</li>
            <li> Works good-I like it- I have an old pair of spurs that are called &amp;#34;gal legs&amp;#34;. The rowel shank is in the same shape as the comb &amp;#34;leg&amp;#34;. You should call the comb a Gal Leg comb-you&#x27;d probabbly sell a lot more combs to old cowboys...</li>
            <li> I was to say the least a bit apprehensive about this purchase, but my beard guru Jack Passion said it&#x27;s what I need, so I ordered one. Maybe it was because it was the exact same one he mentioned, but either way I was amazed at the difference when grooming my beard. The fact that it&#x27;s hand-made probably has a lot to do with it as well. It is perfectly smooth (unlike your average comb), and easy to use.</li>
            <li> pretty nice comb. only wish it had finer teeth to get a neater look. the gold on the shoe has already worn off after less than a week</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality small comb for your mustache. I read in one review that the guy complained it was too small. I think his name was Yosemite Sam if I recall. For normal people this is the right size. I enjoy the bit of style exhibited in making the handle kind of sexy with the girls leg and all. But that&#x27;s how us mustache men roll...</li>
            <li> This comb I find is perfect for my &#x27;stache. My facial hair is thick and wiry and this comb does well when it comes to shaping my mustache. The quality shines through as their are no sharp teeth and no combing is unpleasant (which is nice because I have sensitive skin). The teeth are rather reasonably spaced so you can use it to really disperse any mustache wax you may be using. Also the brush is very durable and will grow on you, nothing is classier then pulling out this fine lady to comb your delicate mustache.</li>
            <li> Like to clip my beard and moustache close.  This comb may fit your needs, but it is a bit too thick to meet mine.  Got a big stache, go for it. Didn&#x27;t do much for me, however.  It is well made and seems nice quality, but you won&#x27;t trim too close because of the dimensions.</li>
            <li> I carry this with me everywhere now. It&#x27;s small enough to be thrown in my back pocket and I can forget it&#x27;s there. But when I need it, it&#x27;s always there. Has a long enough handle to keep a hold of, and strong enough to make through my beard even after getting completely matted. It does bend a bit being in my back pocket, but I just rotate its position in my pocket to bend it back, and it never breaks.</li>
            <li> I like the funny shape and good handle length. The teeth aren&#x27;t as well cut and polished as my Kent 81T but it&#x27;s easy to hold onto.</li>
