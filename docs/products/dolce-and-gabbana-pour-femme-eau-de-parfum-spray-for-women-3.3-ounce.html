            <li>My order came on time and in good conditions.</li>
            <li>The price was good for the size.  </li>
            <li>A good bang for the buck</li>
            <li>Perfume smelled good when it was 1st sprayed on</li>
            <li>I love this scent!  </li>
            <li>Great price with Amazon, and a fantastic perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is good for someone but, not me.  </li>
            <li>By far the best Dolce &amp; Gabbana yet!!!</li>
            <li>I love love love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume...</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance purchase of the year, scent-wise.</li>
            <li>Plus I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I had to hurry and grab this one, so much more cheaper here on Amazon than in retail stores.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll give it to my daughter, and hope she likes it better than me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it might work for someone else ?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky about my perfumes and I really love this one.</li>
            <li>I will be able to use through the spring and into the summer.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely though.</li>
            <li>I originally tried a sample of this at the department store and fell in love with it</li>
            <li>but then discovery that its too strong.</li>
            <li>I have several favorites but this one just rose to the top of all of them!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and musky and sensual, but I honestly couldn&#x27;t pick out one particular scent from the blend.</li>
            <li>In my experience, I would suggest not using scented lotions or creams if you are going to use this scent, that way the scent will stay true to its formula.</li>
            <li>Love so much but bit pricey</li>
            <li>Later in the day I want/need to spray more to be able to enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>Its definitely one of the Top 5 scents I now have :)</li>
            <li>I found a new love.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting more of this when I run out!</li>
            <li>Very pleasant but doesn&#x27;t last long on my body</li>
            <li>usual D&amp;G has its own perspective of what women are; sweet, sophisticated and perdurable.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a very heavy perfume and this one is great</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>I am glad I ordered (simply based on the reviews I saw online).</li>
            <li>I had gotten a small bottle of it and loved it</li>
            <li>Sweet, with marshmallows and a very well-done vanilla, also fruity but oddly, not your routine flower-sugar bomb.</li>
            <li>This has a nice scent, a little heavier than Bulgari Crystalline.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for the ladies!</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t used perfumes since Guess Gold went discontinued, just been using body sprays/splashes.</li>
            <li>Bottle empties fast as it doesn&#x27;t spray too well.  </li>
            <li>I do love this fragrance however, I had found that wearing this the scent starts off nicly but doesnt last long.</li>
            <li>I scent is too strong and does not last long like I thing it should.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lush and sophisticated and never overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so well crafted that you just smell beauty, not childish accords.</li>
            <li>I mean, I have SO many of them, its unreal.</li>
            <li>My wife love it and it seems to only require a little to go a long way.</li>
            <li>The dry down is soft and sweet, but not cloying.</li>
            <li>Trying this new scent (new for me), I typically use Bulgari Omnia Crystalline and wanted to branch out.</li>

            <li> This is absolutely gorgeous. Sweet, with marshmallows and a very well-done vanilla, also fruity but oddly, not your routine flower-sugar bomb. It&#x27;s so well crafted that you just smell beauty, not childish accords. If you&#x27;ve never tried it, do! Great price with Amazon, and a fantastic perfume. Longevity on Me about four hours, projection minimal, but others will smell it on you. It will feel like you&#x27;re enveloped in a yummy marshmallow cloud....and that&#x27;s a great way to feel!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this perfume. It smells wonderful! I had gotten a small bottle of it and loved it so I bought this one. Great deal for the price</li>
            <li> Excellent service - prompt delivery &amp; I love this perfume...Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I love this scent!  May be one of my best Amazon purchases ever.  Never thought I&#x27;d buy perfume online, but got a gift card and thought, &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;d smelled the scent before and knew I wanted to try it.  I get compliments on it everywhere I go!  Highly recommend it for the ladies!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance purchase of the year, scent-wise. The dry down is soft and sweet, but not cloying. There&#x27;s plenty of warmth-almost baby powder tempered by something earthier. Here&#x27;s the rub: even prone to exaggeration as I am, know that this scent is no longer noticeable BY THE TIME I GET TO THE CAR. What gives? I&#x27;ve tried mixing it with lotion, putting it on after lotion...nothing. This is the only reason I won&#x27;t buy it again. I can&#x27;t be the only one...</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell. I actually purchased this as my &amp;#34;every day&amp;#34; perfume so I didn&#x27;t need to wear the super expensive stuff from Paris or Barneys on a daily basis... BUT... the fellow I am dating seems to like this the best of them all. :)</li>
            <li> My wife love it and it seems to only require a little to go a long way. Plus I love the smell.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect scent. I will wear it all winter long. Wish I had tried it sooner. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I was trying out perfumes at my local Macy&#x27;s and came across this one.  All I can say is WOW!  I really haven&#x27;t used perfumes since Guess Gold went discontinued, just been using body sprays/splashes. I had to hurry and grab this one, so much more cheaper here on Amazon than in retail stores. Dolce &amp; Gabbana Pour Femme smells so enticing, sexy and sensual!!!!!  By far the best Dolce &amp; Gabbana yet!!!</li>
            <li> Came in timely, as described. Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> S usual D&amp;G has its own perspective of what women are; sweet, sophisticated and perdurable.  My order came on time and in good conditions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is good for someone but, not me.  I scent is too strong and does not last long like I thing it should.  The price was good for the size.  I&#x27;m keeping it - to much trouble to return.  Maybe I&#x27;ll give it to my daughter, and hope she likes it better than me.  I happen to be at Macy&#x27;s and they were sampling the scent - thought I&#x27;ll like it but guess not for me.  I&#x27;m sure it might work for someone else ?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about my perfumes and I really love this one. It&#x27;s lush and sophisticated and never overwhelming. It&#x27;s sweet and musky and sensual, but I honestly couldn&#x27;t pick out one particular scent from the blend. I will definitely be getting more of this when I run out!</li>
            <li> Trying this new scent (new for me), I typically use Bulgari Omnia Crystalline and wanted to branch out. This has a nice scent, a little heavier than Bulgari Crystalline. I originally tried a sample of this at the department store and fell in love with it but there are times when it seems to take on a slightly different scent and I think it is my body wash that affects it. In my experience, I would suggest not using scented lotions or creams if you are going to use this scent, that way the scent will stay true to its formula. I am please with this purchase and think it is a great product. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a very heavy perfume and this one is great I will be able to use through the spring and into the summer.</li>
            <li> Perfectly packaged and I loved it!</li>
            <li> Very pleasant but doesn&#x27;t last long on my body</li>
            <li> Love so much but bit pricey</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scent but it fades very quickly. Bottle empties fast as it doesn&#x27;t spray too well.  Smells lovely though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a perfume freak. I mean, I have SO many of them, its unreal. This is a beautiful scent. I am glad I ordered (simply based on the reviews I saw online). I found a new love. Its definitely one of the Top 5 scents I now have :)</li>
            <li> This perfume smells incredible!  I have several favorites but this one just rose to the top of all of them!</li>
            <li> I saved probably $30 from going to the department store and my wife loves it! A good bang for the buck</li>
            <li> I do love this fragrance however, I had found that wearing this the scent starts off nicly but doesnt last long. Later in the day I want/need to spray more to be able to enjoy the scent. I have tried to spray alittle extra in the am but then discovery that its too strong. I wish th escent last longer through out the day so Im not having to play the game on knowing how much is too much....Good stuff though!!!</li>
            <li> It is a nice fragrance will not buy again!  Service was great!</li>
            <li> Perfume smelled good when it was 1st sprayed on but the scent had disappeared before I had even left the bathroom. A complete waste of money.</li>
