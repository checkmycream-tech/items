            <li>As Nails Strengthening Top Coat, 0.45 oz]].</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many yrs.</li>
            <li>This product was well rated and I believe it was worthwhile to purchase.</li>
            <li>I started using Nail Magic about 5 years ago</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely magic.  </li>
            <li>It is better then gel because you have to use acetone to get that off.  </li>
            <li>Love Love it....</li>
            <li>I used to be able to purchase this at Wal Mart,but they.discontinued this product there.</li>
            <li>It is truly nail magic.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need to bottom coats or top coats, just this</li>
            <li>so I stopped using nail magic.</li>
            <li>I always peel the top layer off the tip because something causes a bubble.</li>
            <li>and I do put additional nail magic on it to cover the chipped parts.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.</li>
            <li>My nails look better than ever, and I am faithful about polishing them.  </li>
            <li>After just 2 weeks, my nails looked 80% better.  </li>
            <li>This nail polish/strengthener is truly magical.  </li>
            <li>My nails are stronger and better shaped and grow longer now.</li>
            <li>I began using Nail Magic in 1981.  </li>
            <li>After the acrylic nails came off, a friend told me about Nail Magic</li>
            <li>Upon her suggestion I purchased Nail Magic, followed the directions, but it did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>That really is magic for me!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I was purchasing another nail hardener at Sally&#x27;s, and the checkout gal recommended Nail magic, instead of the one I had.</li>
            <li>Now, my nail is strong, and healthy.</li>
            <li>and my nails were strong, long and beautiful!</li>
            <li>Thanks for good service.</li>
            <li>I have nails that split and break easily.  </li>
            <li>would strongly recommend Nail Tek II over this or any of the Sally Hansen stuff.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product and also the botanical oil.</li>
            <li>I have been usin it for probably a month now and my nails are amazingly strong</li>
            <li>After 1 week of using this on my nails they got strong and stopped breaking.</li>
            <li>This works magic, before my nails were constantly chipping and peeling and now most of them are as strong as good acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>And I use cheap nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Magic is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>This product has the right name,  because if you&#x27;ve never had nails in your life, you will once you use Nail Magic.</li>
            <li>This magic nail polish does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>So it is nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Good price, came on time, and was passages properly.</li>
            <li>I was extremely surprised at how effective this product is.  </li>
            <li>Although the smell is a little strong, its a great product.  </li>
            <li>So this really had me excited seeing that it was working!</li>
            <li>This product helps my nail to grows quick,.</li>
            <li>I came back to Nail Magic after trying many others and proving to myself</li>
            <li>I am plagued with split and chipped nails - especially during the winter - and have tried many, many things.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I just brush a new coat on instead of taking it off and reapplying every couple of days.</li>
            <li>I like how it&#x27;s absorbed into the nail quickly.</li>
            <li>If does get better pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I must say my experience for the last 2.5 weeks has been pretty good.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a nail hardener ever!</li>
            <li>and it really coats well for base/top and/or primary polish.</li>
            <li>The product didn&#x27;t produce the same results for me as it did for my sister, However, to be honest, I may not have been as diligent in applying the product as she was.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>dried quickly nice gloss but flaked off partially or mostly off nails within hrs.</li>
            <li>, I used to be able to bend my nail because it was so soft.</li>
            <li>My nails are always soft, cracking and peeling unless I use Nail Magic.</li>
            <li>I went into Sallys about a year ago and told the woman that no matter what I do my nails wont grow right.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, i am like the others, my nails will grow they just seem to ALWAYS break right when the length gets how I want it.</li>
            <li>With Nail Magic, I have a lot less breakage &amp; peeling and my polish stays on better.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong but its to be expected with most nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I saw results right away with the first use  </li>
            <li>excelent, very fast shiping</li>
            <li>Two negative things about this product is that it seems to go a lot quickly, leaving you buying more and more.  </li>
            <li>Oregon&#x27;s best kept secret!</li>
            <li>first I didn&#x27;t see any difference, my nails kept breaking</li>
            <li>At first it burned all the time</li>
            <li>When you follow directions and stay consistent</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of nail hardeners which never seemed to do anything at all.  </li>
            <li>I remember the date because it was soon after I got married.  </li>
            <li>The polish does however chip daily unless you put a top coat over it .</li>
            <li>It seems a little different, but still very good.</li>
            <li>I use it under other nail polish, but also use it alone as it has a nice shine.</li>
            <li>I will search around for another hardener/strengthener for a more reasonable price, if I can&#x27;t find one I will have to come back to this one.</li>
            <li>I am truly baffled at the positive reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work with the Nail Magic since it has a different formula than other polishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always worn fingernail polish &amp; a top coat, but my nails would always break off or peel before thy got very long.</li>
            <li>The polish doesn&#x27;t last, chips easily and used alone looks like plastic.</li>
            <li>the slightly pinkish color on my nails looks as if I have just had a nice manicure</li>
            <li>And since when do I have to use a certain number of words if I don&#x27;t want to???</li>
            <li>Have used it for many yrs., and it really keeps your polish stable, for a  long time!</li>
            <li>and my nails are so much stronger.  </li>
            <li>the clerk at Sally&#x27;s told me that if you do it too much your nails can crumble.</li>
            <li>Fast Service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still seeing some splitting, but the instructions say that&#x27;s normal for the first 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, for my nails, they didn&#x27;t grow much.</li>
            <li>Thanks Suzy</li>
            <li>This really has helped my nails grow.</li>
            <li>has really helped keep my nail polish on longer as well.</li>
            <li>I have used this product off and on for years and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>: there are two draw backs, one is the smell is very chemically and two, for me, it DOES burn my cuticles.</li>
            <li>Does it really have formaldehyde and toluene?</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>The color is beautiful, I only have to put the usual 2 coats on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a natural pink &amp; your nails look polished.</li>
            <li>Your nails will grow long, strong and fast if you use it twice a week as instructed.  </li>
            <li>My nails are long and strong now.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like how other nail polishes look on top of it.</li>
            <li>it was the first time I had a hand full of long nails!!</li>
            <li>Works better than any other nail strengthener that I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Nails become hard without any polish on them, grew to nice length, no bending &amp; breaking.</li>
            <li>Applied on clean dry filed nails,</li>
            <li>Everyday I put one coat and within a week my nails were looking a million times better.</li>
            <li>My nail technician suggested I purchase this and put it on every few days, coat on top of coat.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t super long but all of them were a decent length.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had all nails the same length for as long as I can with Nail Magic.</li>
            <li>Will resume using Mavala&#x27;s other products still available for remaining nail and cuticles.</li>
            <li>I see  a new grow.</li>
            <li>I think this is a new formula</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a new product.</li>
            <li>The only problem I see with this is that nail polish does not last as long with Nail Magic under it, but it seems like a small price to pay for such good results in restoring health to my nails.</li>
            <li>They are now finally growing out long and strong</li>
            <li>Tips wore off first and second day after applying to nails.  </li>
            <li>Your soft nail will peel off for several weeks after you start using this, and the nail that grows in comes in super hard and strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for long nails YAY!!</li>
            <li>The side of the box clearly states that it does, and also comes with a warning and a list of ingredients as the picture I&#x27;ve taken indicates.</li>
            <li>It allowed me to have long nails for the first time in years even with doing dishes and cleaning.</li>
            <li>Been using it a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t really noticed anything different.</li>
            <li>her nails were soft and would bend and split.</li>
            <li>Within a month, I saw a considerable amount of hardness in my nail as well as its growth.  </li>
            <li>After 6 months of usage, my nails is no longer brittle nor soft.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for such a &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>So far, no results as far as strengthening my nails... Will keep trying.</li>
            <li>After only two applications, I noticed how much stronger my nails felt - and went for two weeks without a split or chip.  </li>
            <li>I learned about nail magic a few years back</li>
            <li>I tried this product for few weeks now, I yhink iy&#x27;s a good product but not strong enough for people like me with really soft nails.</li>
            <li>So many beauty products these days are just a waste of money, but I would buy Nail Magic even if it was $50 a bottle --it would still be way cheaper than fake nails, since one bottle lasts me for months and months.</li>
            <li>Once the entire nail was a new &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; nail, I never had another problem.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t quite magic at first, but after using a couple of times a week for the last few weeks it seems to have made my nails less likely to split and not so brittle</li>
            <li>however, mine came only half full.</li>
            <li>B004KRXD4E Sally Hansen Advanced Hard</li>
            <li>As Nails Advanced Hard</li>
            <li>I continued regular use of it and a complete 180 happened</li>
            <li>Only thing that ever worked on my soft nails.  </li>
            <li>My color wouldn&#x27;t last 24 hours with magic nail as the base coat/ top coat.</li>
            <li>They are strong and healthy and this will always be my base coat.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li>The only frustration I&#x27;ve had is it only comes in clear.</li>
            <li>Was a waste of $ and time for me, seems no more than a clear gloss nail polish, with a strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Other main stream products perform as well at a substantially lower price.  </li>
            <li>Worse, it made them brittle and chip easily around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it is because, as the nails grew, there was a section where the new hard nails met the old soft nails.  </li>
            <li>This is such a good product that I worry it might be bad for me.</li>
            <li>I saw several online boards that recommended adding crushed eyeshadow to clear polish to create any color you want.</li>

            <li> and I love the results.</li>
            <li> My nails look better than ever, and I am faithful about polishing them.  </li>
            <li> After just 2 weeks, my nails looked 80% better.  </li>
            <li> This nail polish/strengthener is truly magical.  </li>
            <li> My nails are stronger and better shaped and grow longer now.</li>
            <li> I began using Nail Magic in 1981.  </li>
            <li> After the acrylic nails came off, a friend told me about Nail Magic</li>
            <li> Upon her suggestion I purchased Nail Magic, followed the directions, but it did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> That really is magic for me!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing another nail hardener at Sally&#x27;s, and the checkout gal recommended Nail magic, instead of the one I had.</li>
            <li> Now, my nail is strong, and healthy.</li>
            <li> and my nails were strong, long and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Thanks for good service.</li>
            <li> I have nails that split and break easily.  </li>
            <li> would strongly recommend Nail Tek II over this or any of the Sally Hansen stuff.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product and also the botanical oil.</li>
            <li> I have been usin it for probably a month now and my nails are amazingly strong</li>
            <li> After 1 week of using this on my nails they got strong and stopped breaking.</li>
            <li> This works magic, before my nails were constantly chipping and peeling and now most of them are as strong as good acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> And I use cheap nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Magic is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> This product has the right name,  because if you&#x27;ve never had nails in your life, you will once you use Nail Magic.</li>
            <li> This magic nail polish does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> So it is nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Good price, came on time, and was passages properly.</li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised at how effective this product is.  </li>
            <li> Although the smell is a little strong, its a great product.  </li>
            <li> So this really had me excited seeing that it was working!</li>
            <li> This product helps my nail to grows quick,.</li>
            <li> I came back to Nail Magic after trying many others and proving to myself</li>
            <li> I am plagued with split and chipped nails - especially during the winter - and have tried many, many things.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I just brush a new coat on instead of taking it off and reapplying every couple of days.</li>
            <li> I like how it&#x27;s absorbed into the nail quickly.</li>
            <li> If does get better pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I must say my experience for the last 2.5 weeks has been pretty good.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a nail hardener ever!</li>
            <li> and it really coats well for base/top and/or primary polish.</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t produce the same results for me as it did for my sister, However, to be honest, I may not have been as diligent in applying the product as she was.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> dried quickly nice gloss but flaked off partially or mostly off nails within hrs.</li>
            <li> , I used to be able to bend my nail because it was so soft.</li>
            <li> My nails are always soft, cracking and peeling unless I use Nail Magic.</li>
            <li> I went into Sallys about a year ago and told the woman that no matter what I do my nails wont grow right.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, i am like the others, my nails will grow they just seem to ALWAYS break right when the length gets how I want it.</li>
            <li> With Nail Magic, I have a lot less breakage &amp; peeling and my polish stays on better.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong but its to be expected with most nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I saw results right away with the first use  </li>
            <li> excelent, very fast shiping</li>
            <li> Two negative things about this product is that it seems to go a lot quickly, leaving you buying more and more.  </li>
            <li> Oregon&#x27;s best kept secret!</li>
            <li> first I didn&#x27;t see any difference, my nails kept breaking</li>
            <li> At first it burned all the time</li>
            <li> When you follow directions and stay consistent</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of nail hardeners which never seemed to do anything at all.  </li>
            <li> I remember the date because it was soon after I got married.  </li>
            <li> The polish does however chip daily unless you put a top coat over it .</li>
            <li> It seems a little different, but still very good.</li>
            <li> I use it under other nail polish, but also use it alone as it has a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I will search around for another hardener/strengthener for a more reasonable price, if I can&#x27;t find one I will have to come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I am truly baffled at the positive reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work with the Nail Magic since it has a different formula than other polishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always worn fingernail polish &amp; a top coat, but my nails would always break off or peel before thy got very long.</li>
            <li> The polish doesn&#x27;t last, chips easily and used alone looks like plastic.</li>
            <li> the slightly pinkish color on my nails looks as if I have just had a nice manicure</li>
            <li> And since when do I have to use a certain number of words if I don&#x27;t want to???</li>
            <li> Have used it for many yrs., and it really keeps your polish stable, for a  long time!</li>
            <li> and my nails are so much stronger.  </li>
            <li> the clerk at Sally&#x27;s told me that if you do it too much your nails can crumble.</li>
            <li> Fast Service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still seeing some splitting, but the instructions say that&#x27;s normal for the first 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, for my nails, they didn&#x27;t grow much.</li>
            <li> Thanks Suzy</li>
            <li> This really has helped my nails grow.</li>
            <li> has really helped keep my nail polish on longer as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for years and it really does work.  </li>
            <li> : there are two draw backs, one is the smell is very chemically and two, for me, it DOES burn my cuticles.</li>
            <li> Does it really have formaldehyde and toluene?</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> The color is beautiful, I only have to put the usual 2 coats on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a natural pink &amp; your nails look polished.</li>
            <li> Your nails will grow long, strong and fast if you use it twice a week as instructed.  </li>
            <li> My nails are long and strong now.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like how other nail polishes look on top of it.</li>
            <li> it was the first time I had a hand full of long nails!!</li>
            <li> Works better than any other nail strengthener that I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nails become hard without any polish on them, grew to nice length, no bending &amp; breaking.</li>
            <li> Applied on clean dry filed nails,</li>
            <li> Everyday I put one coat and within a week my nails were looking a million times better.</li>
            <li> My nail technician suggested I purchase this and put it on every few days, coat on top of coat.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t super long but all of them were a decent length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had all nails the same length for as long as I can with Nail Magic.</li>
            <li> Will resume using Mavala&#x27;s other products still available for remaining nail and cuticles.</li>
            <li> I see  a new grow.</li>
            <li> I think this is a new formula</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a new product.</li>
            <li> The only problem I see with this is that nail polish does not last as long with Nail Magic under it, but it seems like a small price to pay for such good results in restoring health to my nails.</li>
            <li> They are now finally growing out long and strong</li>
            <li> Tips wore off first and second day after applying to nails.  </li>
            <li> Your soft nail will peel off for several weeks after you start using this, and the nail that grows in comes in super hard and strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it for long nails YAY!!</li>
            <li> The side of the box clearly states that it does, and also comes with a warning and a list of ingredients as the picture I&#x27;ve taken indicates.</li>
            <li> It allowed me to have long nails for the first time in years even with doing dishes and cleaning.</li>
            <li> Been using it a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t really noticed anything different.</li>
            <li> her nails were soft and would bend and split.</li>
            <li> Within a month, I saw a considerable amount of hardness in my nail as well as its growth.  </li>
            <li> After 6 months of usage, my nails is no longer brittle nor soft.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for such a &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> So far, no results as far as strengthening my nails... Will keep trying.</li>
            <li> After only two applications, I noticed how much stronger my nails felt - and went for two weeks without a split or chip.  </li>
            <li> I learned about nail magic a few years back</li>
            <li> I tried this product for few weeks now, I yhink iy&#x27;s a good product but not strong enough for people like me with really soft nails.</li>
            <li> So many beauty products these days are just a waste of money, but I would buy Nail Magic even if it was $50 a bottle --it would still be way cheaper than fake nails, since one bottle lasts me for months and months.</li>
            <li> Once the entire nail was a new &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; nail, I never had another problem.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite magic at first, but after using a couple of times a week for the last few weeks it seems to have made my nails less likely to split and not so brittle</li>
            <li> however, mine came only half full.</li>
            <li> B004KRXD4E Sally Hansen Advanced Hard</li>
            <li> As Nails Advanced Hard</li>
            <li> I continued regular use of it and a complete 180 happened</li>
            <li> Only thing that ever worked on my soft nails.  </li>
            <li> My color wouldn&#x27;t last 24 hours with magic nail as the base coat/ top coat.</li>
            <li> They are strong and healthy and this will always be my base coat.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li> The only frustration I&#x27;ve had is it only comes in clear.</li>
            <li> Was a waste of $ and time for me, seems no more than a clear gloss nail polish, with a strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Other main stream products perform as well at a substantially lower price.  </li>
            <li> Worse, it made them brittle and chip easily around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it is because, as the nails grew, there was a section where the new hard nails met the old soft nails.  </li>
            <li> This is such a good product that I worry it might be bad for me.</li>
            <li> I saw several online boards that recommended adding crushed eyeshadow to clear polish to create any color you want.</li>
            <li> Now and again a nail breaks as expected from a nutrient problem but from how fragile my nails were before using this was a MAJOR turn around!</li>
            <li> They actually grow so long and hard, so quickly, that I need to clip them regularly or else I&#x27;d be like one of those Guinness Record people with nails ten feet long.  </li>
            <li> Product works no better than similar nail strengtheners that are sold much cheaper in chain stores.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty hard.</li>
            <li> But then my nails started to get really hard for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li> To the reviewer who has used it for a month and complained about breakage and chipping, that happened to me too, when I first started using it.  </li>
            <li> since it contains formaldehyde you might want to use another strengthener as well and switch off after your nails get long and after the initial repair stage.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It also dried my cuticles, years ago, when I first started using it, but as long as I am careful to not let it touch them, no problem.  </li>
            <li> It smells strong and if your nail are very thin, like when you&#x27;ve just taken off acrylics, this may burn at the beginning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see what the next months will bring as far as length is concerned.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks of usage to the products directions my nails started to feel harder and were starting to grow faster as well!</li>
            <li> One coat is enough, sometimes for a little gloss I add a 2nd layer.</li>
            <li> The fumes are really bad too, more than a regular polish.</li>
            <li> I  have been using it for about 4 weeks now and my nails feel dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Big waste of money, I&#x27;m going back to Nutra Nail growth conditioner and zero polish.</li>
            <li> Then I started using it again on a regular bases and didnt think anything of it until one day I looked at my hand and was like HOLY COW</li>
            <li> I have has a few nails split since using it but it has drastically cut back on my nails splitting on a regular bases!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to the advertisement.</li>
            <li> One nail snapped off for no apparent reason, other nails are chipping in areas they never chipped before.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with burning like other reviewers  and those that said there nails were breaking off probably used this too much  or applied it too thickly</li>
            <li> My left hand ring finger nail was splitting on the underside down the center.</li>
            <li> Only use a little.</li>
            <li> A small bottle used as directed tips only, lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Nails are getting harder (after years of acrylic nails).  </li>
            <li> I had to stop using it after just two tries.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time on my nails -- everyone thinks that they are not real.  </li>
            <li> I have had nails that peel in layers all my life and have spent a fortune trying to find something that works.  </li>
            <li> It does harden the cuticle, so be careful not to apply to the cuticle.</li>
            <li> I will recommend Peggy Sage cure express, the only harder that works for me; unfortunately not available in the USA.</li>
            <li> I doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy any other brand nail polish.</li>
            <li> Tried other brands to no avail.  </li>
            <li> and when I ordered it, I was skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> I even have to keep trimming them due to the speed of growth.</li>
            <li> It makes a great base coat if you just use one thin layer.  </li>
            <li> They are hard and actually growing.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> My nails continued to grow and eventually I had to cut them down a bit so it can be workable.  </li>
            <li> my nails arw def less bendable</li>
            <li> i am hoping less prone to nicks and tears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about half way through my bottle now</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical because Nail Magic seemed fake to me.</li>
            <li> My nails are long and hard and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with chipping nail polish.</li>
            <li> It did make my nails superficially hard but despite using it according to the boxed instructions, they were not noticeably harder without the stuff on after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I only have one real complaint and that is the over powering smell.  </li>
            <li> I have difficultly growing long nails; I use other nail product for growth [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> After two years wearing acrylic nails, my nails were so weak, sensitive and thin.</li>
            <li> Normally il have one or two long nails and the rest broken!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim while in a beauty supply store because my natural nails were brittle broken and weak from all the acrylic nails I had in the past.</li>
            <li> My nails are dry, cracking, splitting, layering, thin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this helped at all.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working the way I remembered that it worked in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> Not exactly magic for me.</li>
            <li> This was kind of painful to use on my nails and had a very disturbing smell.</li>
            <li> In the past, the only way to have &amp;#34;nice nails&amp;#34; was to have fake nails.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few things I&#x27;ve ever used that seriously works like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> My nails were always breaking and I was finding it hard to grow them.  </li>
            <li> My nails come in hard as bone, I am not kidding.</li>
            <li> and my nails are hard and durable.</li>
            <li> Now they are as hard as nails.</li>
            <li> I believe I used this product for at least 2 months.</li>
            <li> I put this on at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick and upon application it feels like a barrier was put on your nails.  </li>
            <li> I have always bit my nails due to them being very thin, splitting, chipping, etc.</li>
            <li> I have been going monthly for pedicure and manicure and several years ago I had acrylic nails and when they removed my nails were in terrible shape and for the last 12 years</li>
            <li> But that is only if your nail are very very thin and damaged from artificial things.</li>
            <li> Until all the weak nail grew out, this was in about two months.  </li>
            <li> It has something to do with growing out the weak nail, which is replaced by the stronger nail.  </li>
            <li> Although, that can be tough.</li>
            <li> Clipping them is difficult because they are so hard.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the worse nail hardeners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I used to use this on my nails as well, but now I am addicted to shellac</li>
            <li> It is really frustrating.</li>
            <li> Apply two thin coats as the directions state, and use a cuticle oil.</li>
            <li> I am just a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> For anyone with split nails, peeling nails, weak nails, chipping nails, etc., this is the product for you!  </li>
            <li> I can keep my polish on for at least 7 days with no chips when I use this as my base coat.</li>
            <li> My nails are still peeling though not as badly, however, I had also been taking supplements for hair and nails.</li>
            <li> Which I did, but it makes color chip off so bad.</li>
            <li> I just always wore it as my base under my polish.</li>
            <li> I use it every couple of days and wear it as my base coat.</li>
            <li> It says in the instructions you can use as a base coat.</li>
            <li> My nails were stronger and longer, but this is a horrible base coat.</li>
            <li> My nails would break into the nail bed and be very painful - forget any length to try and polish.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product as instructed, but nails still awful.</li>
            <li> I was a habitual nail biter, and had horrible nails all my life so got acrylic nails for my wedding.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t produce the same results for me as it did for my sister, However, to be honest, I may not have been as diligent in applying the product as she was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before.  I have nails that split and break easily.  Not so with this excellent product.</li>
            <li> Product works no better than similar nail strengtheners that are sold much cheaper in chain stores.  Was hoping for longer lasting polish.  Tips wore off first and second day after applying to nails.  Did not see a difference in nail strength, as they continued to peel as before.  This product did not live up to the advertisement.</li>
            <li> Only gave it three stars because it does not last thru washing dishes.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a friend.  My nails were always breaking and I was finding it hard to grow them.  I use this regularly now and my nails are so much stronger.  I have also got some for my mum, her nails kept splitting, she is hooked too now.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised. Only use a little.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worse nail hardeners I&#x27;ve tried. It did make my nails superficially hard but despite using it according to the boxed instructions, they were not noticeably harder without the stuff on after a few weeks. Worse, it made them brittle and chip easily around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend Nail Tek II over this or any of the Sally Hansen stuff.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other nail strengthener that I&#x27;ve ever tried! My nails are much stronger and look great! Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I saw results right away with the first use  my nails arw def less bendable a d i am hoping less prone to nicks and tears. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with burning like other reviewers  and those that said there nails were breaking off probably used this too much  or applied it too thickly (I&#x27;m not going to use it but once in a blue moon ) the clerk at Sally&#x27;s told me that if you do it too much your nails can crumble.</li>
            <li> I like the actual product however, mine came only half full.</li>
            <li> Fast Service. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim while in a beauty supply store because my natural nails were brittle broken and weak from all the acrylic nails I had in the past. Everyday I put one coat and within a week my nails were looking a million times better. I continued regular use of it and a complete 180 happened and my nails were strong, long and beautiful! It saves me tons of money on getting my nails done and works legitimately like magic! I hope they make this for the rest of my life!!</li>
            <li> I have always bit my nails due to them being very thin, splitting, chipping, etc. My nail technician suggested I purchase this and put it on every few days, coat on top of coat. It has worked and my nails are even growing! They are now the strongest and longest they have ever been!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now. I like how it&#x27;s absorbed into the nail quickly. I&#x27;m still seeing some splitting, but the instructions say that&#x27;s normal for the first 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I read the question/replies about the product having/not having formaldehyde and not listing it&#x27;s ingredients. The side of the box clearly states that it does, and also comes with a warning and a list of ingredients as the picture I&#x27;ve taken indicates.</li>
            <li> Only product I&#x27;ve ever found that actually strengthens my nails.  They are now finally growing out long and strong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this and it does have the strength to help build thicker and stronger nails. However, for my nails, they didn&#x27;t grow much. I have difficultly growing long nails; I use other nail product for growth [[ASIN:B004KRXD4E Sally Hansen Advanced Hard As Nails Advanced Hard As Nails Strengthening Top Coat, 0.45 oz]].</li>
            <li> It does what it says. Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> This product has the right name,  because if you&#x27;ve never had nails in your life, you will once you use Nail Magic. Your nails will grow long, strong and fast if you use it twice a week as instructed.  Have a lil patience but you will see a difference in your nails.</li>
            <li> I have been going monthly for pedicure and manicure and several years ago I had acrylic nails and when they removed my nails were in terrible shape and for the last 12 years I started using this product and I am always complimented on my nails and even my manicurist told me she has been doing nails for ten years and my nails are the nicest she has seen.  They are strong and healthy and this will always be my base coat.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many yrs.It seems a little different, but still very good.Thanks for good service. Thanks Suzy</li>
            <li> But it seems to be making a difference already.  My nails are not splitting and breaking as often.  I was also having problems with them sort of &amp;#34;bubbling up,&amp;#34; but that has stopped too.  This product was well rated and I believe it was worthwhile to purchase.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. Best out there in my opinion</li>
            <li> I tried this product for few weeks now, I yhink iy&#x27;s a good product but not strong enough for people like me with really soft nails. I will recommend Peggy Sage cure express, the only harder that works for me; unfortunately not available in the USA.</li>
            <li> I started using Nail Magic about 5 years ago and It is an amazing nail hardener.  The directions say only put one coat on over your polish.  About 6 months ago I started putting two coats on  over my colored polish and I can go two weeks and do not have to redue my nails..  And I use cheap nail polish.  This product is absolutely magic.  It is better then gel because you have to use acetone to get that off.  This comes off with regular nail polish remover.... Love Love it....</li>
            <li> Nails are getting harder (after years of acrylic nails).  And since when do I have to use a certain number of words if I don&#x27;t want to???</li>
            <li> Used to help strengthen growing after quit biting.  Applied on clean dry filed nails, dried quickly nice gloss but flaked off partially or mostly off nails within hrs. same day.  Reapplied daily, same results for a week. Was a waste of $ and time for me, seems no more than a clear gloss nail polish, with a strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy Mavala from Switzerland, penetrating nail hardener (used yrs ago) &amp; thrilled Amazon sells it. A small bottle used as directed tips only, lasts a long time.  Nails become hard without any polish on them, grew to nice length, no bending &amp; breaking. Will resume using Mavala&#x27;s other products still available for remaining nail and cuticles.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to purchase this at Wal Mart,but they.discontinued this product there.Have used it for many yrs., and it really keeps your polish stable, for a  long time! I had my big toenail removed 2 yrs. ago,and so I have nothing but skin on that toe....................I always do my own pedicure,so this is not a problem with this this polish........2 or 3 coats of colored polish on my toes,then this polish (kind of top coat!)....I just put this polish on my big toe every day...lasts till my next pedicure!  Try this product!!!!! I used to use this on my nails as well, but now I am addicted to shellac (yes, I pamper myself now)...Started the shellac 8 mths ago and love it!!!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product and also the botanical oil. After two years wearing acrylic nails, my nails were so weak, sensitive and thin. This product helps my nail to grows quick,. I cut my nails tips as soon as  I see  a new grow. Until all the weak nail grew out, this was in about two months.  Now, my nail is strong, and healthy. I recommend this products</li>
            <li> I am just a little disappointed. The product is a good hardener until it chips off. But they all tend to perform that way. Other main stream products perform as well at a substantially lower price.  So it is nothing special.  I only have one real complaint and that is the over powering smell.  But pre-purchase research warned of this.</li>
            <li> This works magic, before my nails were constantly chipping and peeling and now most of them are as strong as good acrylic nails. Now and again a nail breaks as expected from a nutrient problem but from how fragile my nails were before using this was a MAJOR turn around! It allowed me to have long nails for the first time in years even with doing dishes and cleaning.</li>
            <li> This really has helped my nails grow. since it contains formaldehyde you might want to use another strengthener as well and switch off after your nails get long and after the initial repair stage.&lt;br /&gt;This has really helped keep my nail polish on longer as well. I can keep my polish on for at least 7 days with no chips when I use this as my base coat. I personally never put coats on every day or whatever I just always wore it as my base under my polish.</li>
            <li> I came back to Nail Magic after trying many others and proving to myself this was the best product on the market for problem nails.  My nails are dry, cracking, splitting, layering, thin.  All of these problems are reduced remarkably when I use Nail Magic.  I apply it on my nails several times a week.  The only problem I see with this is that nail polish does not last as long with Nail Magic under it, but it seems like a small price to pay for such good results in restoring health to my nails.</li>
            <li> I am truly baffled at the positive reviews for this product. I  have been using it for about 4 weeks now and my nails feel dry and brittle. One nail snapped off for no apparent reason, other nails are chipping in areas they never chipped before. The polish doesn&#x27;t last, chips easily and used alone looks like plastic. The fumes are really bad too, more than a regular polish. Big waste of money, I&#x27;m going back to Nutra Nail growth conditioner and zero polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this helped at all. My nails are still peeling though not as badly, however, I had also been taking supplements for hair and nails. I believe I used this product for at least 2 months.</li>
            <li> I would use this forever on my nails. The best nail care product I&#x27;ve ever had! It is truly nail magic.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like this product to strengthen nails. It is unmatched. Your soft nail will peel off for several weeks after you start using this, and the nail that grows in comes in super hard and strong. It&#x27;s one of the few things I&#x27;ve ever used that seriously works like it&#x27;s supposed to. My nails come in hard as bone, I am not kidding. Unbreakable, unbendable. It takes a month or so, so be patient and do follow the directions. It smells strong and if your nail are very thin, like when you&#x27;ve just taken off acrylics, this may burn at the beginning. But that is only if your nail are very very thin and damaged from artificial things. If does get better pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I thought that this stuff would help strengthen my nails and keep me from biting them.  I think this is a new formula and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working the way I remembered that it worked in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nail polish brand since the 90&#x27;s when my mom showed it to me and you don&#x27;t need to bottom coats or top coats, just this and that&#x27;s it. I found this on Amazon and immediately ordered it because I just can&#x27;t find it anywhere. Good price, came on time, and was passages properly.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks of usage to the products directions my nails started to feel harder and were starting to grow faster as well! The smell is a bit strong but its to be expected with most nail polishes. I&#x27;m about half way through my bottle now and I know for a fact another one of these will be in my cart shortly.</li>
            <li> Purchased before, this was my 2nd bottle. I love it, good for nails, helps them grow and it really coats well for base/top and/or primary polish.</li>
            <li> excelent, very fast shiping</li>
            <li> Oregon&#x27;s best kept secret!</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for years and it really does work.  The only problem, which the directions specifically state, is that as your nail grows out, it will tend to break off.  It has something to do with growing out the weak nail, which is replaced by the stronger nail.  After extended use, my nails are longer and stronger and do not break off. I use it under other nail polish, but also use it alone as it has a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I have always has nails that would split and break. A friend recommended this product which I picked up at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supplies, but I&#x27;ve been told it is at Walgreens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I didn&#x27;t see any difference, my nails kept breaking so I stopped using nail magic. Then I started using it again on a regular bases and didnt think anything of it until one day I looked at my hand and was like HOLY COW it was the first time I had a hand full of long nails!! They weren&#x27;t super long but all of them were a decent length. Normally il have one or two long nails and the rest broken!!! So this really had me excited seeing that it was working! I have been usin it for probably a month now and my nails are amazingly strong, I used to be able to bend my nail because it was so soft. Now they are strong! I have has a few nails split since using it but it has drastically cut back on my nails splitting on a regular bases!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRAWBACKS: there are two draw backs, one is the smell is very chemically and two, for me, it DOES burn my cuticles. At first it burned all the time then it stopped burning for a while and again started. But I don&#x27;t care it only lasts a short time. It&#x27;s worth it for long nails YAY!!</li>
            <li> I went into Sallys about a year ago and told the woman that no matter what I do my nails wont grow right. I always peel the top layer off the tip because something causes a bubble. She gave me this and I was skeptical because Nail Magic seemed fake to me. She promised me it would work and it did. I use it every couple of days and wear it as my base coat. another plus is that it drys in seconds. Get it at Sallys beauty supply. its cheaper</li>
            <li> Without a doubt this is Magic! My nails are always soft, cracking and peeling unless I use Nail Magic. This is such a good product that I worry it might be bad for me. I use it faithfully.</li>
            <li> Not as good for me as some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read. Not sure why. I&#x27;ve used the product as instructed, but nails still awful. Not exactly magic for me.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff and I think it works too.  My nails are stronger and I think are healthier too.</li>
            <li> Been using it a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t really noticed anything different. But again, it has only been 2 weeks. It does seem to chip around the tip of the nail and I do put additional nail magic on it to cover the chipped parts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review on a product before but I decided this one deserves a shout out. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now and I love it. My nails are long and hard and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with chipping nail polish. It seems to wear off along the tips instead of chipping but that&#x27;s not a problem if you reapply it every 2-3 days. Most of the time I just brush a new coat on instead of taking it off and reapplying every couple of days. The only frustration I&#x27;ve had is it only comes in clear. I wanted to add color to my nails but I don&#x27;t like how other nail polishes look on top of it. I found a solution. I saw several online boards that recommended adding crushed eyeshadow to clear polish to create any color you want. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work with the Nail Magic since it has a different formula than other polishes. I tried it tonight and I love the results. The color is beautiful, I only have to put the usual 2 coats on and my nails are hard and durable. Now that I&#x27;ve found a way to add color I doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy any other brand nail polish. This stuff is the greatest!  I love it! 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve every used. My left hand ring finger nail was splitting on the underside down the center. I also kept chipping the tips of my nails on everything. I put this on at least twice a week. One coat is enough, sometimes for a little gloss I add a 2nd layer. I don&#x27;t like the way colored polished taints my nails yellow so I avoid using colored polish. I&#x27;ve never had all nails the same length for as long as I can with Nail Magic. My sister was the one to tell me about this product. her nails were soft and would bend and split.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working! Not every1 will have the same results but it works 4 me. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate.  My nails would break into the nail bed and be very painful - forget any length to try and polish.  This is my 2nd bottle and I now have to file and cut my nails off. It is Magic for me!</li>
            <li> Best nail gardener ever.  Tried other brands to no avail.  Have used 15years.</li>
            <li> I learned about nail magic a few years back and when I ordered it, I was skeptical at first.  Despite the chemical smell, I did not get any burning sensation of any kind.  I kept it up and followed the directions.  Within a month, I saw a considerable amount of hardness in my nail as well as its growth.  My nails continued to grow and eventually I had to cut them down a bit so it can be workable.  Occasionally I would accidentally hit them against surfaces or doors and they always stayed in tact. The consistency is thick and upon application it feels like a barrier was put on your nails.  Two negative things about this product is that it seems to go a lot quickly, leaving you buying more and more.  And also the price creeps up every now and then.  I was used to buying it for $7 or $8, now it&#x27;s well over $10.  I will search around for another hardener/strengthener for a more reasonable price, if I can&#x27;t find one I will have to come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Nail Magic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail Magic is worth every penny.  My nails look better than ever, and I am faithful about polishing them.  I will be buying this again and again.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a nail hardener ever! I must say my experience for the last 2.5 weeks has been pretty good. I can feel the difference in my nails. They are pretty hard. I&#x27;m anxious to see what the next months will bring as far as length is concerned.</li>
            <li> Ordered my 2nd bottle today as it does wonders to my nails.  Although the smell is a little strong, its a great product.  After 6 months of usage, my nails is no longer brittle nor soft.  Thank you so much for such a &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, i am like the others, my nails will grow they just seem to ALWAYS break right when the length gets how I want it. This magic nail polish does exactly as advertised. When you follow directions and stay consistent it does its job. It serves as a great top coat over colored polish, really helps preserve the color too! I recommend this to everyone look no further this is all you need.</li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised at how effective this product is.  My nails were constantly peeling, breaking, and short.  I have tried many different types of nail hardeners which never seemed to do anything at all.  I bought this on a whim after reading the reviews.  After just 2 weeks, my nails looked 80% better.  Now it has been a month or so and I no longer have any issues with peeling.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! If you follow the directions, it works great. My nails grow faster &amp; longer than if I didn&#x27;t use any product. I&#x27;ve always worn fingernail polish &amp; a top coat, but my nails would always break off or peel before thy got very long. With Nail Magic, I have a lot less breakage &amp; peeling and my polish stays on better. It also looks great when you wear it alone. It&#x27;s kind of a natural pink &amp; your nails look polished.</li>
            <li> This nail polish/strengthener is truly magical.  My nails are stronger and better shaped and grow longer now. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This was kind of painful to use on my nails and had a very disturbing smell. I had to stop using it after just two tries.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years, and it is still the best around.  Not sold locally, so very glad to be able to order on amazon.</li>
            <li> So far, no results as far as strengthening my nails... Will keep trying. Have been using it for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Made a difference in my nails.</li>
            <li> This product works well and has had a 10 year track record of great results in this household.  My wife and daughter use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I began using Nail Magic in 1981.  I remember the date because it was soon after I got married.  I was a habitual nail biter, and had horrible nails all my life so got acrylic nails for my wedding.  After the acrylic nails came off, a friend told me about Nail Magic and I started using it.  Because of the taste, it cured my nail biting.  But then my nails started to get really hard for the first time in my life.  To the reviewer who has used it for a month and complained about breakage and chipping, that happened to me too, when I first started using it.  I think it is because, as the nails grew, there was a section where the new hard nails met the old soft nails.  Once the entire nail was a new &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; nail, I never had another problem.  It also dried my cuticles, years ago, when I first started using it, but as long as I am careful to not let it touch them, no problem.  It makes a great base coat if you just use one thin layer.  I get compliments all the time on my nails -- everyone thinks that they are not real.  They actually grow so long and hard, so quickly, that I need to clip them regularly or else I&#x27;d be like one of those Guinness Record people with nails ten feet long.  Clipping them is difficult because they are so hard.  Sometimes I worry that the company will go out of business, so I always buy plenty of extras because I would never ever stop using it.  So many beauty products these days are just a waste of money, but I would buy Nail Magic even if it was $50 a bottle --it would still be way cheaper than fake nails, since one bottle lasts me for months and months.</li>
            <li> A friend raved about this product; swears that it has worked wonders for her.  Her nails are beautiful, so she must be correct.  Upon her suggestion I purchased Nail Magic, followed the directions, but it did not work for me.  I&#x27;m not blaming the product.</li>
            <li> For anyone with split nails, peeling nails, weak nails, chipping nails, etc., this is the product for you!  I am plagued with split and chipped nails - especially during the winter - and have tried many, many things.  By far, this seems to work the best.  After only two applications, I noticed how much stronger my nails felt - and went for two weeks without a split or chip.  That really is magic for me!&lt;br /&gt;The added bonus - the slightly pinkish color on my nails looks as if I have just had a nice manicure - would recommend this product without reservation.</li>
            <li> Only thing that ever worked on my soft nails.  Now they are as hard as nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in February 2014 and used up until July 2014 and did not see any improvement in my nails. I followed the instructions and thought I gave it enough time to work it&#x27;s &amp;#34;magic.&amp;#34;  Not all nail treatments work for everyone and this one did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Nail Magic does a good job of strengthening and hardening nails if the directions are followed.</li>
            <li> I have had nails that peel in layers all my life and have spent a fortune trying to find something that works.  In the past, the only way to have &amp;#34;nice nails&amp;#34; was to have fake nails.  This stuff WORKS.</li>
            <li> After 1 week of using this on my nails they got strong and stopped breaking. The polish does however chip daily unless you put a top coat over it . My nails are long and strong now. I even have to keep trimming them due to the speed of growth. Will get again when my bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year now. I was pleased with the results. My nails were stronger and longer, but this is a horrible base coat. It says in the instructions you can use as a base coat. Which I did, but it makes color chip off so bad. My color wouldn&#x27;t last 24 hours with magic nail as the base coat/ top coat. It is really frustrating. I&#x27;m looking for a new product.</li>
            <li> This product had made my nails grow after only 2 weeks! It has shown me a huge improvement! I will continue to use nail magic!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite magic at first, but after using a couple of times a week for the last few weeks it seems to have made my nails less likely to split and not so brittle so they snap off.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Made my nail beds tender and sore and destroyed my cuticles. Does it really have formaldehyde and toluene? Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing another nail hardener at Sally&#x27;s, and the checkout gal recommended Nail magic, instead of the one I had. I took her advice and oh is it magic.&lt;br /&gt;It truly works great. My nails feel as though they have acrylics on. They are hard and actually growing. I had very short nails, I was a nail biter. Not any more!&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience any stinging, as others have said. It does harden the cuticle, so be careful not to apply to the cuticle. Although, that can be tough. Apply two thin coats as the directions state, and use a cuticle oil. You will be truly amazed it&#x27;s magic!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  It peels a bit after day two but I reapply every two days and my nails have grown double their length in two weeks.</li>
