            <li>I&#x27;ve found my amazon purchases of the Obagi serum to be just as effective as the one I got from my doctor.  </li>
            <li>I liked the consistency of the product, but after two days I broke out and could not use it.  </li>
            <li>I did some research on the discoloration of the product and found out that once it oxidizes, it is no longer effective.</li>

            <li>but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I can always trust Obagi to create the most effective and top of the line products.</li>

            <li>Hello fabulous glowing woman!I am a fan for life!</li>
            <li>OUTSTANDING PRODUCT ~ HAVE USED IT FOR 14 YEARS</li>
            <li>AT 64 LOOKS MORE LIKE</li>
            <li>I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT THIS PRODUCT HAD 20% C WHICH IS THE HIGHEST AMOUNT YOU CAN GET.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this serum.</li>
            <li>however if you tried from the obagi store its completely different texture and effectiveness which make me wonder if i got the best bargin here?</li>
            <li>Got this product from my dematologists and paid a lot a lot more for this.  </li>
            <li>I love Vitamin C</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using mostly Obagi for about a year now</li>
            <li>and I love what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love it, Arrive on time ..</li>
            <li>I immediately notice that when I run out of this product, wherever I get it from, that my skin is not as smooth and radiant. !</li>
            <li>/&gt;I should have known better......</li>
            <li>Great product and works great if you use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Obagi cost a little more but it is&lt;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and even more beneficial after exfoliating!!</li>
            <li>The biggest problem with Ascorbic Acid creams and serums is that because they are unstable, they are oxidized very quickly and once it is oxidized it does not provide any benefit to the skin at all, even caused more damage to your skin.  </li>
            <li>can not live without this best product for skin care</li>
            <li>I use like fresh aloe from plant and shea butter and rose hip seed oil for moisture all work well together.</li>
            <li>I tried the one they rayed the best and sold the most, wasted $35.00</li>
            <li>Looked closer and found bottle was almost completely full, to the top.</li>
            <li>For beautiful skin I would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li>The doc says they are fine.  </li>
            <li>IT SEEMED FINE,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure my skin tone is more even.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use a cheap substitute.</li>
            <li>The price was fabulous and the delivery on time.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure that the product is FRESH.</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin looking radiant and smooth.</li>
            <li>and it is the genuine product.</li>
            <li>it glides on your face and leaves it feeling smooth  and silky.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my skin look younger and feel great.</li>
            <li>Gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li>Serum is an important step in the Obagi System of Skin Care.  </li>
            <li>This occurs with exposure to light and air.</li>
            <li>The company makes good products and my sister, who works for a plastic surgeon, uses everything Obagi without a problem and it shows on her 67-year old skin.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle from an esthetician and it was about 30% more per bottle</li>
            <li>It makes a significant difference to the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>Was originally recommended to me by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that gives my 43 year-old face A NICE GLOW!</li>
            <li>You can feel the difference with the first application 8)</li>
            <li>Leaves the delicate skin around the eye perfectly hydrated and smooth but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I am a frequent Amazon Shopper and satisfied most of the time.</li>
            <li>Obagi Professional-C 20% Vitamin C Serum seems to work very well to help shrink pores and smooth out skin for a more youthful look.</li>
            <li>In other words, yes you are getting it for a cheaper price (obagi is a wonderful product) but order it from somewhere else and spend the money on it to get the real product.</li>
            <li>I think the Skingenixx stuff is better anyway, and its much cheaper.</li>
            <li>so much any more.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it turning yellow which means it has oxidized and is no longer any good.</li>
            <li>Wish that wasn&#x27;t true because it&#x27;s a pricey item, but...</li>
            <li>This product is a good product, I use it before, and I come back to use it again.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C it works super well for wrinkles, discoloration, and unevenness of the skin.  </li>
            <li>Have ordered this in the past from Amazon and will continue to as the price is very good</li>
            <li>The 20% was thicker and only slightly more color, and worked fine.  </li>
            <li>I have always used Obagi professional C-20% for many years.</li>
            <li>this is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>And honestly, she did look 10 years younger than her age.</li>
            <li>so it is well worth the cost</li>
            <li>Time will tell if it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several years and have always found it to be stable and effective.</li>
            <li>But if you find something that works and it does wonders for your skin, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to back off on my Clarisonic and still feel like i have fresh skin and clean pores.</li>
            <li>Customer service department made it right.  </li>
            <li>but after this experience I will buy only from a reputable spa or dermatologist office and pay full</li>
            <li>Product made my skin supple and really did rejuvenate it!</li>
            <li>the skina nd feels younger looking and more even</li>
            <li>This is a first time for me</li>
            <li>Overall, my skin is more radiant and the texture is noticeably improved.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>You also should aware with your Vitamin C face serum or cream if it had colored changed.</li>
            <li>My first was the 15% C-Serum.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my upper chest area, and have noticed more even pigment in that area.  </li>
            <li>This is the first anti-aging product that I have used that doesn&#x27;t interfere with the application of my foundation makeup, or BB Creme.  </li>
            <li>I have recently learned however, that it is better to mix a powder form of vitamin c with an oil or HA and apply immediately to the face.  </li>
            <li>AT FIRST</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and i thought i was getting a great deal i usually buy from a licensed obagi seller around where i live for $100.00</li>
            <li>I have a good skin usually and can tolerate very high concentration prescription products.  </li>
            <li>I had previously bought this product from my facial spa place and dermatologist office several times and it was CLEAR with a nice pleasant fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>The 5% was more thin and clear, smelled fine and worked fine.  </li>
            <li>this was a very good product however I thought it was expensive and</li>
            <li>vs. clear meaning that it is not as fresh as it can be.  </li>
            <li>The Vit C works very well on my face.</li>
            <li>I saw that this dealer had the Obagi 20% for such a cheap price and thought I was getting a deal.</li>
            <li>every day, and it works really well.</li>
            <li>Fresh Obagi Vita C serum is CLEAR in color.</li>
            <li>They really work.</li>
            <li>I really like the obagi 20% serum.</li>
            <li>Nothing else will do as much for your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll absolutely order this again.</li>
            <li>i cancelled it and sitched to Obagi Gentle cleaners</li>
            <li>came very orange which I could put up with</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t ready and it burned.</li>
            <li>the ascorbic acid takes on a yellowish tinge, so it is important to check your creams or serums before you put them on your face, and if there is any yellow discoloration, throw it away.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This bottle I purchased is very  diluted like water.</li>
            <li>Very comparible to the cellex C product.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>love this product, but this product leaked and the box and the instructions were wet and the bottle was crusty.</li>
            <li>The serum gave me almost immediate satisfaction as I really noticed the difference of my tone just after a couple of days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every time I receive my order, the Vitamin C is clear and fresh as it should be.</li>
            <li>People really need to do their research on Vitamin C, I did a lot of research before buying and what Vit C should look like and what it should not look like.</li>
            <li>I loved the way my skin began to fill within a week, I have complex skin</li>
            <li>And I could tell it&#x27;s not the same as original because the color was light yellow.  </li>
            <li>I find that the smell that it has right now is like the smell of an old product.</li>
            <li>This product should only be used twice a week as it is a powerful exfoliater and more than that would make your skin dry.</li>
            <li>I have used Obagi Professional Serum 20% for 7 years, first recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>I love Obagi Vita C Serum, however, I found the serum came to me slightly &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Have used several bottles and keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>Overall though it helps my skin with the tone, not oily at all and the quantity is enough for many months</li>
            <li>Got extra coupon for next time purchase that I will use for sure</li>
            <li>and it really helps, its worth it, the problem is if you use it religiously for the max benefit you need two.</li>
            <li>I was told by my doctor&#x27;s office that it should have a goldish tint and the older the product</li>
            <li>The 20% Vitamin C is usually very concentrated, a dark color and smells strong.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li>Have used this before and highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>You never know how old the product really is.  </li>
            <li>Your price was much lower than I paid at my skin care professional.</li>
            <li>Thought I would try from Amazon since normally it is $90.00.</li>
            <li>At first I was not sure if I could use it as I am allergic to fragrance and my skin is sensitive to many products.</li>
            <li>They told me that is normal because of oxidation.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, especially for dry skin.</li>
            <li>SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex!]</li>
            <li>How did I live without this serum?</li>
            <li>I also purchased this product and it is not the same as the first one purchased in a doctors office.  </li>
            <li>Purchased in-office the first time, but then chose Amazon to save some money on subsequent purchases.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I have been paying double for at the dermatologist!</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to Obagi Vitamin C Serum by an esthetician at a medical spa</li>
            <li>I have used Obagi Vitamin C serum since 2007 and when I purchase a new bottle, it is clear in color and darkens to a orange tint as time goes on.</li>
            <li>This item was sealed as though it was new, so I am unsure if it has ever been opened, but the serum is old.</li>
            <li>that in the doctor&#x27;s office where I first purchased it and as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s the same stuff.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and the results are positive with regular use.</li>
            <li>For me it worked better than the Ogabi #3, #4, and #5, which tended to cause sun spots to darken before (hopefully) lightening, along with using a little retina-A 1% mixed in with  the #3.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply under other daily products.</li>
            <li>The 20% vitamin c serum is always a yellow/golden color, the one that they sent was a clear color.</li>
            <li>The color should be clear.</li>
            <li>It is clear in color.  </li>
            <li>I found this info off of a web site when I researched the bottle I got as well was clear in color.  </li>
            <li>This serum has always had a yellow/golden tint, what I received is perfectly clear.  </li>
            <li>THE VITAMIN C IS SUPPOSED TO KEEP YOUR PORES CLEAR</li>
            <li>It was clear upon application to my face that the product was rancid.  </li>
            <li>The product was absolutely clear in color.</li>
            <li>I really makes a BIG difference after months of using this.</li>
            <li>It leaves you soft.</li>
            <li>Hope that this review will educate others as far as the color of this product.</li>
            <li>The product appeared old and was oxidized when we received them.</li>
            <li>It completely transforms your skin, \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; or not.  </li>
            <li>Product was obviously old and expired based on color an smell - no way to tell from the codes on the bottle - will not buy from them again.</li>
            <li>I used the entire bottle and it did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>and I recommend it to anyone who wants to set the clock back</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to my friend who was also looking for something that she could use because her skin is sensitive too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The  retinoin helps exfoliate and shed cells, then the Vitamin C serum follows to  complete the task of rejuvenation.</li>
            <li>Old and have 5 kids</li>
            <li>Recommend this to any user that has professional recommendation.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward - Not only does this serum make my skin glow, it has also lessened the effects of the exzema!</li>
            <li>so far, it seems working on my skin.</li>
            <li>I live in a very high altitude, dry climate.  </li>
            <li>This really helps to calm down my red itchy skin..</li>
            <li>This is my second time around for this particular product and the jury is still out.  </li>
            <li>The bottle usually has air space and is filled to around the neck.</li>
            <li>no other c products feels this way to me.  </li>
            <li>No other lotions or products are needed for your skin care.  </li>
            <li>Only use vit c when it is a clear color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, this one was old and very yellow.</li>
            <li>I am an aesthetician and thought I would try Obagi Professional C-20% actually recommended by one of my clients but this formula did not work out for me.</li>
            <li>It is apparent that this company is not an authorized dealer for Obagi.</li>
            <li>The orignal ones had  dark golden yellow color.  </li>
            <li>Not cheap, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Everyone keeps yapping about how the color should be YELLOW when in fact the serum turns yellow once it becomes oxidized and old.</li>
            <li>My skin looks more youthful and especially under my eyes, they do not look so tired anymore.</li>
            <li>Also, I do not understand why 101 Medical Spa lists the same product at different prices, stated differently, why 101 Medical Spa gets multiple listing for the exact same product.</li>
            <li>With items costing this much I hesitate to toss a half used bottle in the trash especially when I cannot even verify if my friend&#x27;s claim is accurate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am extremely pissed off that I spent $100 on the same exact serum that I have been purchasing on Amazon for $40.  </li>

            <li> I used this product and really liked it until one day i decided to check the list of ingredients and realized that it is nowhere to be found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found my amazon purchases of the Obagi serum to be just as effective as the one I got from my doctor.  </li>
            <li> I liked the consistency of the product, but after two days I broke out and could not use it.  </li>
            <li> I did some research on the discoloration of the product and found out that once it oxidizes, it is no longer effective.</li>
            <li> I really liked this Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li> Best product ever, makes skin dewy soft!</li>
            <li> Very good and fast service, thank you.</li>
            <li> but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I can always trust Obagi to create the most effective and top of the line products.</li>
            <li> Very strong make sure you can graduate from the lower concentration before moving on to this.</li>

            <li> I love this product and have been using it for two years.</li>
            <li> I would have love it to smell either more like oranges.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and love it.</li>
            <li> Love, love the results....</li>
            <li> I love the product (paid $85) and when I stopped using it</li>
            <li> Hello fabulous glowing woman!I am a fan for life!</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING PRODUCT ~ HAVE USED IT FOR 14 YEARS</li>
            <li> AT 64 LOOKS MORE LIKE</li>
            <li> I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT THIS PRODUCT HAD 20% C WHICH IS THE HIGHEST AMOUNT YOU CAN GET.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this serum.</li>
            <li> however if you tried from the obagi store its completely different texture and effectiveness which make me wonder if i got the best bargin here?</li>
            <li> Got this product from my dematologists and paid a lot a lot more for this.  </li>
            <li> I love Vitamin C</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using mostly Obagi for about a year now</li>
            <li> and I love what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love it, Arrive on time ..</li>
            <li> I immediately notice that when I run out of this product, wherever I get it from, that my skin is not as smooth and radiant. !</li>
            <li> /&gt;I should have known better......</li>
            <li> Great product and works great if you use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Obagi cost a little more but it is&lt;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and even more beneficial after exfoliating!!</li>
            <li> The biggest problem with Ascorbic Acid creams and serums is that because they are unstable, they are oxidized very quickly and once it is oxidized it does not provide any benefit to the skin at all, even caused more damage to your skin.  </li>
            <li> can not live without this best product for skin care</li>
            <li> I use like fresh aloe from plant and shea butter and rose hip seed oil for moisture all work well together.</li>
            <li> I tried the one they rayed the best and sold the most, wasted $35.00</li>
            <li> Looked closer and found bottle was almost completely full, to the top.</li>
            <li> For beautiful skin I would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> The doc says they are fine.  </li>
            <li> IT SEEMED FINE,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure my skin tone is more even.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use a cheap substitute.</li>
            <li> The price was fabulous and the delivery on time.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure that the product is FRESH.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin looking radiant and smooth.</li>
            <li> and it is the genuine product.</li>
            <li> it glides on your face and leaves it feeling smooth  and silky.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my skin look younger and feel great.</li>
            <li> Gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li> Serum is an important step in the Obagi System of Skin Care.  </li>
            <li> This occurs with exposure to light and air.</li>
            <li> The company makes good products and my sister, who works for a plastic surgeon, uses everything Obagi without a problem and it shows on her 67-year old skin.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle from an esthetician and it was about 30% more per bottle</li>
            <li> It makes a significant difference to the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Was originally recommended to me by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that gives my 43 year-old face A NICE GLOW!</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference with the first application 8)</li>
            <li> Leaves the delicate skin around the eye perfectly hydrated and smooth but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent Amazon Shopper and satisfied most of the time.</li>
            <li> Obagi Professional-C 20% Vitamin C Serum seems to work very well to help shrink pores and smooth out skin for a more youthful look.</li>
            <li> In other words, yes you are getting it for a cheaper price (obagi is a wonderful product) but order it from somewhere else and spend the money on it to get the real product.</li>
            <li> I think the Skingenixx stuff is better anyway, and its much cheaper.</li>
            <li> so much any more.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it turning yellow which means it has oxidized and is no longer any good.</li>
            <li> Wish that wasn&#x27;t true because it&#x27;s a pricey item, but...</li>
            <li> This product is a good product, I use it before, and I come back to use it again.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C it works super well for wrinkles, discoloration, and unevenness of the skin.  </li>
            <li> Have ordered this in the past from Amazon and will continue to as the price is very good</li>
            <li> The 20% was thicker and only slightly more color, and worked fine.  </li>
            <li> I have always used Obagi professional C-20% for many years.</li>
            <li> this is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> And honestly, she did look 10 years younger than her age.</li>
            <li> so it is well worth the cost</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years and have always found it to be stable and effective.</li>
            <li> But if you find something that works and it does wonders for your skin, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to back off on my Clarisonic and still feel like i have fresh skin and clean pores.</li>
            <li> Customer service department made it right.  </li>
            <li> but after this experience I will buy only from a reputable spa or dermatologist office and pay full</li>
            <li> Product made my skin supple and really did rejuvenate it!</li>
            <li> the skina nd feels younger looking and more even</li>
            <li> This is a first time for me</li>
            <li> Overall, my skin is more radiant and the texture is noticeably improved.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> You also should aware with your Vitamin C face serum or cream if it had colored changed.</li>
            <li> My first was the 15% C-Serum.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my upper chest area, and have noticed more even pigment in that area.  </li>
            <li> This is the first anti-aging product that I have used that doesn&#x27;t interfere with the application of my foundation makeup, or BB Creme.  </li>
            <li> I have recently learned however, that it is better to mix a powder form of vitamin c with an oil or HA and apply immediately to the face.  </li>
            <li> AT FIRST</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> and i thought i was getting a great deal i usually buy from a licensed obagi seller around where i live for $100.00</li>
            <li> I have a good skin usually and can tolerate very high concentration prescription products.  </li>
            <li> I had previously bought this product from my facial spa place and dermatologist office several times and it was CLEAR with a nice pleasant fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> The 5% was more thin and clear, smelled fine and worked fine.  </li>
            <li> this was a very good product however I thought it was expensive and</li>
            <li> vs. clear meaning that it is not as fresh as it can be.  </li>
            <li> The Vit C works very well on my face.</li>
            <li> I saw that this dealer had the Obagi 20% for such a cheap price and thought I was getting a deal.</li>
            <li> every day, and it works really well.</li>
            <li> Fresh Obagi Vita C serum is CLEAR in color.</li>
            <li> They really work.</li>
            <li> I really like the obagi 20% serum.</li>
            <li> Nothing else will do as much for your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll absolutely order this again.</li>
            <li> i cancelled it and sitched to Obagi Gentle cleaners</li>
            <li> came very orange which I could put up with</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t ready and it burned.</li>
            <li> the ascorbic acid takes on a yellowish tinge, so it is important to check your creams or serums before you put them on your face, and if there is any yellow discoloration, throw it away.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This bottle I purchased is very  diluted like water.</li>
            <li> Very comparible to the cellex C product.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> love this product, but this product leaked and the box and the instructions were wet and the bottle was crusty.</li>
            <li> The serum gave me almost immediate satisfaction as I really noticed the difference of my tone just after a couple of days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every time I receive my order, the Vitamin C is clear and fresh as it should be.</li>
            <li> People really need to do their research on Vitamin C, I did a lot of research before buying and what Vit C should look like and what it should not look like.</li>
            <li> I loved the way my skin began to fill within a week, I have complex skin</li>
            <li> And I could tell it&#x27;s not the same as original because the color was light yellow.  </li>
            <li> I find that the smell that it has right now is like the smell of an old product.</li>
            <li> This product should only be used twice a week as it is a powerful exfoliater and more than that would make your skin dry.</li>
            <li> I have used Obagi Professional Serum 20% for 7 years, first recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> I love Obagi Vita C Serum, however, I found the serum came to me slightly &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Have used several bottles and keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Overall though it helps my skin with the tone, not oily at all and the quantity is enough for many months</li>
            <li> Got extra coupon for next time purchase that I will use for sure</li>
            <li> and it really helps, its worth it, the problem is if you use it religiously for the max benefit you need two.</li>
            <li> I was told by my doctor&#x27;s office that it should have a goldish tint and the older the product</li>
            <li> The 20% Vitamin C is usually very concentrated, a dark color and smells strong.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> Have used this before and highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> You never know how old the product really is.  </li>
            <li> Your price was much lower than I paid at my skin care professional.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try from Amazon since normally it is $90.00.</li>
            <li> At first I was not sure if I could use it as I am allergic to fragrance and my skin is sensitive to many products.</li>
            <li> They told me that is normal because of oxidation.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, especially for dry skin.</li>
            <li> SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex!]</li>
            <li> How did I live without this serum?</li>
            <li> I also purchased this product and it is not the same as the first one purchased in a doctors office.  </li>
            <li> Purchased in-office the first time, but then chose Amazon to save some money on subsequent purchases.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been paying double for at the dermatologist!</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Obagi Vitamin C Serum by an esthetician at a medical spa</li>
            <li> I have used Obagi Vitamin C serum since 2007 and when I purchase a new bottle, it is clear in color and darkens to a orange tint as time goes on.</li>
            <li> This item was sealed as though it was new, so I am unsure if it has ever been opened, but the serum is old.</li>
            <li> that in the doctor&#x27;s office where I first purchased it and as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s the same stuff.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and the results are positive with regular use.</li>
            <li> For me it worked better than the Ogabi #3, #4, and #5, which tended to cause sun spots to darken before (hopefully) lightening, along with using a little retina-A 1% mixed in with  the #3.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply under other daily products.</li>
            <li> The 20% vitamin c serum is always a yellow/golden color, the one that they sent was a clear color.</li>
            <li> The color should be clear.</li>
            <li> It is clear in color.  </li>
            <li> I found this info off of a web site when I researched the bottle I got as well was clear in color.  </li>
            <li> This serum has always had a yellow/golden tint, what I received is perfectly clear.  </li>
            <li> THE VITAMIN C IS SUPPOSED TO KEEP YOUR PORES CLEAR</li>
            <li> It was clear upon application to my face that the product was rancid.  </li>
            <li> The product was absolutely clear in color.</li>
            <li> I really makes a BIG difference after months of using this.</li>
            <li> It leaves you soft.</li>
            <li> Hope that this review will educate others as far as the color of this product.</li>
            <li> The product appeared old and was oxidized when we received them.</li>
            <li> It completely transforms your skin, \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; or not.  </li>
            <li> Product was obviously old and expired based on color an smell - no way to tell from the codes on the bottle - will not buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle and it did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone who wants to set the clock back</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to my friend who was also looking for something that she could use because her skin is sensitive too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The  retinoin helps exfoliate and shed cells, then the Vitamin C serum follows to  complete the task of rejuvenation.</li>
            <li> Old and have 5 kids</li>
            <li> Recommend this to any user that has professional recommendation.  </li>
            <li> Fast forward - Not only does this serum make my skin glow, it has also lessened the effects of the exzema!</li>
            <li> so far, it seems working on my skin.</li>
            <li> I live in a very high altitude, dry climate.  </li>
            <li> This really helps to calm down my red itchy skin..</li>
            <li> This is my second time around for this particular product and the jury is still out.  </li>
            <li> The bottle usually has air space and is filled to around the neck.</li>
            <li> no other c products feels this way to me.  </li>
            <li> No other lotions or products are needed for your skin care.  </li>
            <li> Only use vit c when it is a clear color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, this one was old and very yellow.</li>
            <li> I am an aesthetician and thought I would try Obagi Professional C-20% actually recommended by one of my clients but this formula did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> It is apparent that this company is not an authorized dealer for Obagi.</li>
            <li> The orignal ones had  dark golden yellow color.  </li>
            <li> Not cheap, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Everyone keeps yapping about how the color should be YELLOW when in fact the serum turns yellow once it becomes oxidized and old.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more youthful and especially under my eyes, they do not look so tired anymore.</li>
            <li> Also, I do not understand why 101 Medical Spa lists the same product at different prices, stated differently, why 101 Medical Spa gets multiple listing for the exact same product.</li>
            <li> With items costing this much I hesitate to toss a half used bottle in the trash especially when I cannot even verify if my friend&#x27;s claim is accurate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am extremely pissed off that I spent $100 on the same exact serum that I have been purchasing on Amazon for $40.  </li>
            <li> Is that the product is excellent, but the one I received was damaged, expired, smelled super bad, impossible to use</li>
            <li> I was excited to see this product on Amazon for so much less than you can get it somewhere else, but after using it a few weeks I&#x27;m not sure this product is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to believe one of the other reviewers, didn&#x27;t really believe that the product was not the same, so I ordered the product despite the other reviewer&#x27;s comments.</li>
            <li> Love this product but when I purchased from this seller, the seal was broken and the serum seemed watered down.</li>
            <li> The results are also long lasting, not temporary!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and deep wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I previously tried other Obagi products many years ago and my skin was too sensitive, I&#x27;m sorry to say.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the first few months I used this it stung my skin slightly which it should do.</li>
            <li> Product was not old and packaging was well and in tact.  </li>
            <li> It had very harmful preservative that may be extremely harmful if it gets on small children.</li>
            <li> If you have dry and/or flaky skin, it will help.</li>
            <li> I use a prescription topical cream everyday which makes my skin very oily and dull looking.</li>
            <li> Obagi Vitamin C serum works to elements red and dark areas.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Despite these finding, I used it for 3 days anyway and found that it just did not give me the same effects as previously when I bought it at the SPA/Dermatologist office.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this for less than a month</li>
            <li> A little back story -</li>
            <li> The only downfall is the price as it is a little costly.</li>
            <li> NOT a real serum.</li>
            <li> Product turned yellow within a few days.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I have bought a few different brands</li>
            <li> The 1-ounce bottle lasts a few months (only need 5-6 drops per application)</li>
            <li> I no longer use my topical prescription cream everyday, as prescribed.</li>
            <li> After having used it for the last few months, I can say that it arrives as expected and works as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was obvious to me as I opened the bottle the product was not as thick and serum like as my bottle purchased from a local doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> MINE WAS PALE YELLOW FROM THE GET GO</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.......</li>
            <li> There was not the &amp;#34;vitamin C smell&amp;#34; I expected like the other product I purchased from the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I have tried other C serums but see results with this one.</li>
            <li> They are a step up from other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> w other stuff</li>
            <li> I was purchasing all kinds of other products but this one has seemed to help keep my acne at bay...</li>
            <li> The Amazon price is a bargain in comparison to other sites or purchasing @ a med spa.</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin C serum before and ordered this one feeling slightly worried about whether this was the expected product.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to find the exact same produce, sealed in the same type package for unver 1/2 the price I paid inthe past.</li>
            <li> It looked dull and didn&#x27;t have the same glow as when I was using the Obagi serum.  </li>
            <li> This is thin and clear as water.</li>
            <li> You have to keep the bottle in a dark drawer or cabinet.</li>
            <li> It should be thick and yellow in color.</li>
            <li> This productthe Obagi vitamin C serum was watered down.  </li>
            <li> It is all watered down.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money on any other vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> It has defintely improved my skin&#x27;s appearance and slightly smoothed my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> After using it even got less than a week..</li>
            <li> The bottle was not tamper resistant which was odd.</li>
            <li> Not as typically packaged.</li>
            <li> (paid less than $60).  </li>
            <li> and I decided to order it here because the price was much less than purchasing from a salon.</li>
            <li> My friend, who also uses it, told me it is not good for your skin if it turns yellow or orange.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and have purchased locally at least three times.  </li>
            <li> and that is definitely not true.</li>
            <li> If it is yellow, it is no good and has oxidized which means the product will do nothing for your skin.</li>
            <li> I have found that this product seems to turn them a little red.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> NOT consistent with the color and fragrance of the item I have purchased in the past from area retailers.</li>
            <li> I talked to my doctor and he suggested to add a little bit of the solution to my cream.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it but a few weeks and still waiting on results</li>
            <li> Horrible how can you do this to customers what kind of buisness are you running?</li>
            <li> Since I have had a few bottles to do this I have been in a quandary.  </li>
            <li> it takes a few weeks for your skin to show results my skin feels firmer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to waste it, so I will probably use it on my neck and décolleté .</li>
            <li> and I saw the results in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I gave it the benefit of the doubt and ordered it through amazon to save a few bucks,  </li>
            <li> It still was too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this serum here a few times because it&#x27;s cheaper.  </li>
            <li> You need very little product so it lasts along time</li>
            <li> But when I received it and opened the bottle it was not safely sealed.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if the color effects the potency of the product.</li>
            <li> and I have purchased this in the past from Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li> In the past, I bought this serum from Obagi rep and paid around $100.00.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if this will change</li>
            <li> No more melasma.</li>
            <li> In the past month my two closest friends have commented (unsolicited) that my face looks good....and trust me, they pay attention to even the smallest details.  </li>
            <li> This usually lasts about 2 months</li>
            <li> After your skin gets acclimated to the serum, no more stinging.</li>
            <li> I recieved my so called obagi professional c serum 20% and its a fake!</li>
            <li> It developed an unpleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t feel like a 20% formulation.  </li>
            <li> dull oily skin...</li>
            <li> I am not very happy with this bottle.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s mean your Vitamin C oxidized before you get to put it on your skin.</li>
            <li> Obagi can be very expensive when you are doing the total program.  </li>
            <li> THIS ITEM, UNFORTUNATELY, WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR A REFUND.  </li>
            <li> NO GOOD</li>
            <li> Plus the smell on that stuff is definitely not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with it.</li>
            <li> The audio quality is poor - scratchy.  </li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY WITH EITHER ITEM</li>
            <li> The oil base seems to help my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Have purchased others less expensive and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a year or so, but its getting really expensive.</li>
            <li> well I opened the bottle and realised its a fake product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that there&#x27;s no way they can take all that packaging apart and put some fake liquid in there.  </li>
            <li> Sad</li>
            <li> #34;please see our website for list of authorized dealers in my area and be wary of those claiming to sell our products&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I received the serum I was unhappy to notice that the serum was not 20%.</li>
            <li> This product does not act like a 20% solution and it has an unpleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product was absolutely impossible to tolerate.</li>
            <li> and I figured I could return it if the product was bad.</li>
            <li> but it has a bad odor.</li>
            <li> However I was disappointed</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product!!!</li>
            <li> Have me terrible acne</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good price for a great product!</li>
            <li> Will take care of multiple problems.  You and your skin will thank you for regular use.  Not cheap, but worth it.</li>
            <li> It is a great product....will buy it again</li>
            <li> Best ever ! Don&#x27;t use a cheap substitute.</li>
            <li> I love Obagi Vita C Serum, however, I found the serum came to me slightly &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; vs. clear meaning that it is not as fresh as it can be.  The price was fabulous and the delivery on time.  Just make sure that the product is FRESH.</li>
            <li> This is rge good stuff at a great price</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist to puff up the skin.  It works well, I have seen improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> i use this in the morning and it makes my skin perfect,  i love obagis Products, this Product i use summer and Winter time</li>
            <li> This product does not act like a 20% solution and it has an unpleasant fragrance. I&#x27;m not happy with it.</li>
            <li> The Vit C works very well on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was so cheap. But when I received it and opened the bottle it was not safely sealed.  And I could tell it&#x27;s not the same as original because the color was light yellow.  The orignal ones had  dark golden yellow color.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy the product from the seller anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this Vitamin C serum by Obagi. It leaves my skin looking radiant and smooth. I really makes a BIG difference after months of using this. I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> The Best in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Have used this before and highly recommend the product. Start out with a lower strength, like 10%.</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi for some time now. I saw that this dealer had the Obagi 20% for such a cheap price and thought I was getting a deal. When I received the serum I was unhappy to notice that the serum was not 20%. The 20% vitamin c serum is always a yellow/golden color, the one that they sent was a clear color. In other words, yes you are getting it for a cheaper price (obagi is a wonderful product) but order it from somewhere else and spend the money on it to get the real product. This product anywhere else costs somewhere between $80-95.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and deep wrinkles.  I have tried hundreds of products-- even a TCH peel, but nothing made my skin look better.  Of all the products I have tried Obagi Professional-C seems to be the best.  It has defintely improved my skin&#x27;s appearance and slightly smoothed my wrinkles.  Amazon.com seems to have the best price.  I bought my first bottle from an esthetician and it was about 30% more per bottle</li>
            <li> Product made my skin supple and really did rejuvenate it! The results are also long lasting, not temporary! It transformed my face five years younger.....</li>
            <li> I love how my skin looks when I use this serum.</li>
            <li> I having been using this product for about 8 months that I received from my dermotologist and needed more. Thought I would try from Amazon since normally it is $90.00. Great price and great product, Smooths out the skina nd feels younger looking and more even</li>
            <li> It leaves you soft. You make-up goes on real smooth.</li>
            <li> This productthe Obagi vitamin C serum was watered down.  You could tell when you opened the bottle.  Don&#x27;t by this product from this seller.</li>
            <li> Have ordered this in the past from Amazon and will continue to as the price is very good and it is the genuine product.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in my skin in a week&#x27;s time. I look younger because my facial skin looks healthier. Better price online that in the doctor&#x27;s office where I first purchased it and as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s the same stuff.</li>
            <li> Received my 20% serum today and I agree with all the others. This is a fake product!!! It is all watered down. It should be thick and yellow in color. This is thin and clear as water. NOT a real serum. No wonder all sales are final!!!</li>
            <li> Have used several bottles and keep coming back for more. Leaves the delicate skin around the eye perfectly hydrated and smooth but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Good product. Haven&#x27;t used it but a few weeks and still waiting on results</li>
            <li> can not live without this best product for skin care</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to believe one of the other reviewers, didn&#x27;t really believe that the product was not the same, so I ordered the product despite the other reviewer&#x27;s comments. I agree. The product ordered from 101 Medical Spa does not have the same weight, consistency, anc color as the same product when I purchase it from my dermatologist. Definitely very different. Also, I do not understand why 101 Medical Spa lists the same product at different prices, stated differently, why 101 Medical Spa gets multiple listing for the exact same product. Seems one seller should list one product at one price.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years. Used to put it on at night. Now use it in morning under sunscreen. Much better results.</li>
            <li> I also purchased this product and it is not the same as the first one purchased in a doctors office.  I contacted the 101 Medicalspa for a refund forget about it.  I was also taken.  I complainedto amazon and also got nowhere.  Beware of this seller!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a year or so, but its getting really expensive. I think the Skingenixx stuff is better anyway, and its much cheaper. I have been using their vitamin c serum [[ASIN:B00VXE0EEY Skingenixx VITAMIN C SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex!]] every day, and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. perpect!!!!!!!! .I will keep this one using.....I also recommand to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have always used Obagi professional C-20% for many years. However, this one was old and very yellow. The color should be clear. I am not sure if the color effects the potency of the product. I am not very happy with this bottle. I have opened it and will used it. I should send it back since the color shows that is has expired. That is the problem with purchasing the serum on Amazon or a seller. You never know how old the product really is.  Therefore, I am giving this only a 2 star rating.  This is a first time for me and I have purchased this in the past from Amazon sellers. Hope that this review will educate others as far as the color of this product.</li>
            <li> Best product ever, makes skin dewy soft!</li>
            <li> I recieved my so called obagi professional c serum 20% and its a fake! How do i know you ask ? Because i have been using this serum for 2 years and i thought i was getting a great deal i usually buy from a licensed obagi seller around where i live for $100.00 well I opened the bottle and realised its a fake product. Horrible how can you do this to customers what kind of buisness are you running?</li>
            <li> Is that the product is excellent, but the one I received was damaged, expired, smelled super bad, impossible to use</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 2 years now on and off.  My friend, who also uses it, told me it is not good for your skin if it turns yellow or orange.  Since I have had a few bottles to do this I have been in a quandary.  With items costing this much I hesitate to toss a half used bottle in the trash especially when I cannot even verify if my friend&#x27;s claim is accurate.&lt;br /&gt;  The oil base seems to help my dry skin.  I have some pre-skin cancers on my forehead. The doc says they are fine.  I have found that this product seems to turn them a little red.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product only wish I could verify the fact about the changing color.</li>
            <li> Arrived as it should! This is a must have for skin</li>
            <li> In the past, I bought this serum from Obagi rep and paid around $100.00.  I was shocked to find the exact same produce, sealed in the same type package for unver 1/2 the price I paid inthe past.</li>
            <li> The product appeared old and was oxidized when we received them. Would not take back since it was opened. The glass is blue and you cannot tell if the product is discolored until you open it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have been using it for 5 years. It makes a significant difference to the appearance of my skin. You can feel it working when you put it on.</li>
            <li> Nice product brightness noticed in a day or so. would recommend.  Good value from Amazon. Product was not old and packaging was well and in tact.  One often worries about purchasing beauty products from Amazon as to their shelf life. This was recieved and performed.</li>
            <li> probably as good as it gets</li>
            <li> I love all Obagi products. It was recommended to me by my wonderful dermatologist. I especially love the C serum and use it every day to even my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see this product on Amazon for so much less than you can get it somewhere else, but after using it a few weeks I&#x27;m not sure this product is the real deal.  It developed an unpleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t feel like a 20% formulation.  Buyer beware!  I will not be finishing the bottle.</li>
            <li> Everyone keeps yapping about how the color should be YELLOW when in fact the serum turns yellow once it becomes oxidized and old. Fresh Obagi Vita C serum is CLEAR in color. I know this for a fact because I purchased this serum from from Dermstore.com (which happens to be an authorized seller of Obagi items) just so I could see if there truly was a difference. And let me tell you I am extremely pissed off that I spent $100 on the same exact serum that I have been purchasing on Amazon for $40.  Not to mention, the results from this product speak for itself. It completely transforms your skin, \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; or not.  I cant believe people are upset that their serum is not yellow. YELLOW&#x3D;OLD!</li>
            <li> I have tried other C serums but see results with this one.</li>
            <li> Product was obviously old and expired based on color an smell - no way to tell from the codes on the bottle - will not buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Love this but expensive</li>
            <li> Love this product. Have purchased others less expensive and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Obagi can be very expensive when you are doing the total program.  I searched Amazon and this was the best price for this product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It is the best of all serum.  I like  Obagi products.  They really work. They are a step up from other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WANT TO CANCEL THIS REVIEW</li>
            <li> This really helps to calm down my red itchy skin.. After using it even got less than a week.. My redness and itchiness disappeared</li>
            <li> I bought the 5% and 20% from 101 med spa. The 5% was more thin and clear, smelled fine and worked fine.  The 20% was thicker and only slightly more color, and worked fine.  I&#x27;d say that there&#x27;s no way they can take all that packaging apart and put some fake liquid in there.  What is the point? Its not gold. Think about it folks! Vitamin C is one of the cheapest vitamins~ it doesn&#x27;t need to cost $100!!  For me it worked better than the Ogabi #3, #4, and #5, which tended to cause sun spots to darken before (hopefully) lightening, along with using a little retina-A 1% mixed in with  the #3.  Vitamin C w other stuff I use like fresh aloe from plant and shea butter and rose hip seed oil for moisture all work well together. I haven&#x27;t been using the 3,4,5 so much any more.  Plus the smell on that stuff is definitely not pleasant.</li>
            <li> this is the best product with vitamin c in it that i have used.  it glides on your face and leaves it feeling smooth  and silky.  no other c products feels this way to me.  i definitely see improvement in my skin since i started using it (and the obagi system too).  this is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
            <li> I really like the obagi 20% serum. it takes a few weeks for your skin to show results my skin feels firmer and I have been told that my skin looks radiant. I will continue to buy obagi c serum.</li>
            <li> Very good and fast service, thank you.</li>
            <li> How did I live without this serum? It has transformed the texture of my face coupled with Retin A and Obagi Hydrate Luxe cream.</li>
            <li> This is one product I am never without.  Nothing else will do as much for your skin.</li>
            <li> No other lotions or products are needed for your skin care.  I live in a very high altitude, dry climate.  This product makes my skin look younger and feel great.</li>
            <li> I used this product and really liked it until one day i decided to check the list of ingredients and realized that it is nowhere to be found. Finally i found the list online and realized why they didnt have it on amazon... It had very harmful preservative that may be extremely harmful if it gets on small children. Please exersice caution and read about Phenoxyethanol, i wish i did before i bought it and used most of it. Well definetly not buying it again.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C it works super well for wrinkles, discoloration, and unevenness of the skin.  Yes.. I would order again in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this product but when I purchased from this seller, the seal was broken and the serum seemed watered down. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Makes my skin feel so smooth!  The best thing you can do for your skin is to apply some form of Vitamin C and this product works!</li>
            <li> This should be added to your facial regimen as it makes quite the difference.  Use it today &amp; see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin C serum before and ordered this one feeling slightly worried about whether this was the expected product. After having used it for the last few months, I can say that it arrives as expected and works as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great. It has lessened wrinkles I had around the eyes, and it brightened my skin quite a lot. Overall, my skin is more radiant and the texture is noticeably improved. I&#x27;ll absolutely order this again.</li>
            <li> Obagi products are all wonderful  Everyone of them is awesome. i have been using them for about 2 yrs now and love them  However I was disappointed when i ordered 2 cleanser, they were going to charge me double the shipping. i cancelled it and sitched to Obagi Gentle cleaners</li>
            <li> Bought from eBeauty through Amazon even after the warnings because the price was good and I figured I could return it if the product was bad. I don&#x27;t return often but have never had a problem through Amazon&lt;br /&gt;It came very orange which I could put up with but it has a bad odor. I tried to start a return and it is not returnable. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I am an aesthetician and thought I would try Obagi Professional C-20% actually recommended by one of my clients but this formula did not work out for me. It caused me to get some whiteheads and patches of irritation compared to my choice in a vitamin c product. I don&#x27;t want to waste it, so I will probably use it on my neck and décolleté .</li>
            <li> Product turned yellow within a few days.  Customer service department made it right.  They were awesome and went beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Was originally recommended to me by my dermatologist.  Purchased in-office the first time, but then chose Amazon to save some money on subsequent purchases.  I&#x27;ve found my amazon purchases of the Obagi serum to be just as effective as the one I got from my doctor.  Same consistency, same tingling sensation, same results on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy the Obagi version and stay away from the generics.  I did see cheaper 20% vitamin C serums on Amazon and recently gave one a shot.  Total waste of money.  :(  I used the entire bottle and it did absolutely nothing.  Not only that, some of the brown spots I&#x27;d already gotten rid of came back.  Sad panda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff definitely works.  Stick with it.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few different brands but this one is by far the best. I coild see improvements within 3-4 dsys.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and have purchased locally at least three times.  Thus I know what the product should look and smell like and how it reacts on skin.  This product arrived in an unsealed Obagi carton.  The bottle was not tamper resistant which was odd. When I open the bottle and inserted accompanying dropper ingredients overflowed. Looked closer and found bottle was almost completely full, to the top. Not as typically packaged. The bottle usually has air space and is filled to around the neck. The product in this bottle had an off smell to it. It is clear in color.  NOT consistent with the color and fragrance of the item I have purchased in the past from area retailers. I did not use this item on my face but did apply to the back of my hand. Definitely not the experience I have had with Obagi. THE ITEM IS NOT RETURNABLE. I am a frequent Amazon Shopper and satisfied most of the time. Not in this instance.  I would give NO STARS if that were an option.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over six months. I must say that am amazed at the results. My face looks much younger and clearer. This product is a must buy for me and I recommend it to anyone who wants to set the clock back</li>
            <li> CAN SOMEONE SETTLE THE &#x27;COLOR QUESTION&#x27; ONCE AND FOR ALL...MAYBE AN OBAGI DISTRIBUTOR??  MINE WAS PALE YELLOW FROM THE GET GO AND I LOVE IT! I PURCHASED AT A DERMATOLOGY / SKIN CARE INSTITUTE.</li>
            <li> The best Vitamin C I have ever used. Gentle, yet effective. Love it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been paying double for at the dermatologist!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Recommended by a doctor, it makes my skin glow and lessens wrinkles!  I have used it daily since April 2013 and believe it makes a difference in the quality of my skin.  I recommend it for all!</li>
            <li> The product was expired</li>
            <li> I love this serum. At first I was not sure if I could use it as I am allergic to fragrance and my skin is sensitive to many products. However, this product more than met my needs and I am very happy with using it. This is my second time I bought this serum because I see the difference it has made on my face. I have recommended this to my friend who was also looking for something that she could use because her skin is sensitive too.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Have been using for years with a prescription of retinoin. The  retinoin helps exfoliate and shed cells, then the Vitamin C serum follows to  complete the task of rejuvenation.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product and it works great for her skin.  Product always arrives on time and the best price around.  Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> For me works as a sunblock and neutralizer--goes deep into the skin.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time buying this product and will never stop buying it. My skin looks more youthful and especially under my eyes, they do not look so tired anymore. I am 39 yrs. Old and have 5 kids so life has taken a toll on my skin, this product is helping me look youthful again.</li>
            <li> Saw noticeable difference with regular usage!!</li>
            <li> Nice product - great source of healing power for battered and abused skin... This is a must for protection and healing.</li>
            <li> Very strong make sure you can graduate from the lower concentration before moving on to this. I wasn&#x27;t ready and it burned.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to purchase this product to help with my overall skin appearance and save my face from future aging.  I must say I do love this product.  I was purchasing all kinds of other products but this one has seemed to help keep my acne at bay...even in my age (&amp;#62;40).  ;)</li>
            <li> This product should only be used twice a week as it is a powerful exfoliater and more than that would make your skin dry.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, especially for dry skin.</li>
            <li> this was a very good product however I thought it was expensive and the price varies depending where one purchased the product.</li>
            <li> I found this info off of a web site when I researched the bottle I got as well was clear in color.  Thought this was interesting. \\&quot; You also should aware with your Vitamin C face serum or cream if it had colored changed. That&#x27;s mean your Vitamin C oxidized before you get to put it on your skin. The biggest problem with Ascorbic Acid creams and serums is that because they are unstable, they are oxidized very quickly and once it is oxidized it does not provide any benefit to the skin at all, even caused more damage to your skin.  Watch for yellowing of your serum- it indicates oxidation As it undergoes oxidation the ascorbic acid takes on a yellowish tinge, so it is important to check your creams or serums before you put them on your face, and if there is any yellow discoloration, throw it away.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The 20% Vitamin C is usually very concentrated, a dark color and smells strong. This bottle I purchased is very  diluted like water. It looks and feels like only 5% Vitamin C if that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Obagi products for years, and they are all of the highest quality. I love this c-serum. Very comparible to the cellex C product. Obagi medical always sends a quality product as described.</li>
            <li> There was no inner seal on the bottle when I received it. This same product from my dermatologist always came with an inner seal.&lt;br /&gt;Othere wise I love this product and have been using it for two years.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Have been using it for several years now.</li>
            <li> I have used Obagi Professional Serum 20% for 7 years, first recommended by my dermatologist.  Serum is an important step in the Obagi System of Skin Care.  It is non-greasy and the results are positive with regular use.</li>
            <li> Even my eye doctor told me my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  The audio quality is poor - scratchy.  Sometimes you get what you pay for - should have bought the DVD.</li>
            <li> I like the glow it gives to my skin. The only down side is the smell of it. I would have love it to smell either more like oranges. I find that the smell that it has right now is like the smell of an old product. Overall, I like the way my skin looks cause of it and the feeling so I still like it.</li>
            <li> Great for your skin and a wonderful addition to the Obagi regime.  If you have dry and/or flaky skin, it will help.</li>
            <li> Good product which I use all the time.  Recommend this to any user that has professional recommendation.  Not for everyone.</li>
            <li> This serum has always had a yellow/golden tint, what I received is perfectly clear.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Hmmm....</li>
            <li> Good Quality Serum C in USA</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5 years.  It is the only non-makeup product that I use on my face. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! The only thing that gives my 43 year-old face A NICE GLOW! Love it.</li>
            <li> This item was sealed as though it was new, so I am unsure if it has ever been opened, but the serum is old. I have used Obagi Vitamin C serum since 2007 and when I purchase a new bottle, it is clear in color and darkens to a orange tint as time goes on. This occurs with exposure to light and air. When I opened this bottle, it was a rust color. I am not sure if this will change it&#x27;s efficacy, but I will choose not to make this purchase again through this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and love it. Your price was much lower than I paid at my skin care professional.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product to bring a youthful glow to the skin.  I highly recommend it and even more beneficial after exfoliating!!</li>
            <li> funciona maravilhoso,eu recomendo,valeu o que custou</li>
            <li> I believe this is one of the best Vitamin C Serums on the market!  Love, love the results....</li>
            <li> Love the obagi products have been using over a yr now and my skin looks great. No more melasma.</li>
            <li> This is my second time around for this particular product and the jury is still out.  It does not hydrate the skin, but I must like what I see or I would not have bought it again.</li>
            <li> This item was my second order of an Obagi product through Amazon.  My first was the 15% C-Serum.  It took about a month with the 15% serum to see a noticeable difference.  When I finished the 15% I went to the 20%.  In the past month my two closest friends have commented (unsolicited) that my face looks good....and trust me, they pay attention to even the smallest details.  I also use it on my upper chest area, and have noticed more even pigment in that area.  This is the first anti-aging product that I have used that doesn&#x27;t interfere with the application of my foundation makeup, or BB Creme.  At the conclusion of my last facial, the esthetician recommended using this product every morning, and a retinol product every night.  And honestly, she did look 10 years younger than her age.</li>
            <li> Sold in nicer spas and salons.  Product goes on a bit oily - though light-weight.  I have recently learned however, that it is better to mix a powder form of vitamin c with an oil or HA and apply immediately to the face.  Pre-mixed versions do not have the potency of just mixed vitamin C, so I no longer use this product.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Obagi Vitamin C Serum by an esthetician at a medical spa I went to. I love the product (paid $85) and when I stopped using it I noticed an obvious difference in my skin.  It looked dull and didn&#x27;t have the same glow as when I was using the Obagi serum.  The 1-ounce bottle lasts a few months (only need 5-6 drops per application) so it is well worth the cost (paid less than $60).  I will continue to use this product and have recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t glowed like this in years. A little back story - I have exzema on my face (mouth, nose, forehead &amp; hairline) and have had it since the age of 14. I use a prescription topical cream everyday which makes my skin very oily and dull looking. Fast forward - Not only does this serum make my skin glow, it has also lessened the effects of the exzema! My recent visit to my dermatologist said it all for me. Once he looked at my face, he immediately asked what I had done to my skin. I told him that I have been using this serum and he was totally amazed at how I looked. He offered to write me a prescription version of this serum but I told him I&#x27;d rather keep using this, as it seems to do wonders for me. I no longer use my topical prescription cream everyday, as prescribed. I know use it maybe twice a week. Goodbye dull oily skin... Hello fabulous glowing woman!I am a fan for life!</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING PRODUCT ~ HAVE USED IT FOR 14 YEARS AND IT NEVER DISAPPOINTS, MY SKIN AT 64 LOOKS MORE LIKE I&#x27;M IN MY 40&#x27;S!</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS WHEN I PURCHASED THE OBAGI C CLEANSING GEL.  NOT HAPPY WITH EITHER ITEM AT ALL.  I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT THIS PRODUCT HAD 20% C WHICH IS THE HIGHEST AMOUNT YOU CAN GET.  AT FIRST IT SEEMED FINE, BUT WITH THE COMBINATION OF THE C GEL CLEANSER AND THIS MY COMBINATION SKIN WAS GETTING CLOGGED UP IN THE T-ZONE.  THE VITAMIN C IS SUPPOSED TO KEEP YOUR PORES CLEAR AND ACTUALLY MAKE THEM SMALLER WITH USE.  NOT SO WITH ME.  I SENT THE CLEANSER BACK FOR A REFUND.  THIS ITEM, UNFORTUNATELY, WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR A REFUND.  OF COURSE NOT, THIS WAS $59.00.  SO I AM OUT OF THE MONEY AND NOT USING THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Have me terrible acne</li>
            <li> I am in love with this serum. It is exactly what I was looking for. Dries perfectly into my skin and I saw the results in just a few weeks.  I can always trust Obagi to create the most effective and top of the line products. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> All Obagi products are great. I am trying to use all the vitamin C products. You need very little product so it lasts along time</li>
            <li> Obagi Professional-C 20% Vitamin C Serum seems to work very well to help shrink pores and smooth out skin for a more youthful look.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a period of times from amazon.com however if you tried from the obagi store its completely different texture and effectiveness which make me wonder if i got the best bargin here? I think not, only wasting $37</li>
            <li> Great product that yields results.  The Amazon price is a bargain in comparison to other sites or purchasing @ a med spa.</li>
            <li> Like the product and all its promises. Easy to apply under other daily products.Time will tell if it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Vit C must be stored properly, or it spoils.  It was clear upon application to my face that the product was rancid.  Returned the product, will not order from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> I liked the consistency of the product, but after two days I broke out and could not use it.  I previously tried other Obagi products many years ago and my skin was too sensitive, I&#x27;m sorry to say.  The company makes good products and my sister, who works for a plastic surgeon, uses everything Obagi without a problem and it shows on her 67-year old skin.</li>
            <li> Obagi Vitamin C serum works to elements red and dark areas.  Helps skin look great!</li>
            <li> The product seems to be working although I recently bought it.My only concern is that Amazon deleted my questions to the seller (asking if the package came sealed and if the content is watery) because it was inappropriate..????!!!!! I send again a feedback and still have no answer. MAkes me wonder. Overall though it helps my skin with the tone, not oily at all and the quantity is enough for many months</li>
            <li> Got this product from my dematologists and paid a lot a lot more for this.  So happy to find this available here.</li>
            <li> Great product and works great if you use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Obagi cost a little more but it is&lt;br /&gt;a reliable product.&lt;br /&gt;When you order ask about the expiration date. You have to keep the bottle in a dark drawer or cabinet. It will oxidize over time and turn orange. Only use vit c when it is a clear color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a reliable</li>
            <li> This really works. I swear my skin feels brighter the minute I put it on. I&#x27;ve been able to back off on my Clarisonic and still feel like i have fresh skin and clean pores. I never let this stuff run out on me.</li>
            <li> love this product, but this product leaked and the box and the instructions were wet and the bottle was crusty.</li>
            <li> This product was yellow. It didn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> . I had previously bought this product from my facial spa place and dermatologist office several times and it was CLEAR with a nice pleasant fragrance to it. The serum gave me almost immediate satisfaction as I really noticed the difference of my tone just after a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;The product I received from Amazon -obagi medical had a different pungent odor and has a  noticeable yellow tint to it. Despite these finding, I used it for 3 days anyway and found that it just did not give me the same effects as previously when I bought it at the SPA/Dermatologist office.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt and ordered it through amazon to save a few bucks,  but after this experience I will buy only from a reputable spa or dermatologist office and pay full price.&lt;br /&gt; I intend to return this oxidized product and  ask for a refund. I did some research on the discoloration of the product and found out that once it oxidizes, it is no longer effective.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I have a good skin usually and can tolerate very high concentration prescription products.  This product was absolutely impossible to tolerate. I talked to my doctor and he suggested to add a little bit of the solution to my cream. It still was too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Great price! Would suggest that everyone try this vitamin c serum. You can feel the difference with the first application 8)</li>
            <li> Obagi Pro-C 20% Vit C is a wonderful product. I&#x27;ve used this for several years and have always found it to be stable and effective. For beautiful skin I would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love Vitamin C and I&#x27;ve been using mostly Obagi for about a year now and I love what it does for my skin. I would never stop using this and only wish that I&#x27;d started using this sooner. Every time I receive my order, the Vitamin C is clear and fresh as it should be. This usually lasts about 2 months and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it turning yellow which means it has oxidized and is no longer any good. The only downfall is the price as it is a little costly. But if you find something that works and it does wonders for your skin, it&#x27;s worth the price. I keep reading where Vitamin C should be yellow and that is definitely not true. If you read anything about this product it should NEVER be yellow. If it is yellow, it is no good and has oxidized which means the product will do nothing for your skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time and have never had a problem with any bottle that I have received. In addition, the first few months I used this it stung my skin slightly which it should do. After your skin gets acclimated to the serum, no more stinging. People really need to do their research on Vitamin C, I did a lot of research before buying and what Vit C should look like and what it should not look like. YELLOW &#x3D; Oxidized Vitamin C &#x3D; NO GOOD</li>
            <li> I really liked this Vitamin C Serum.  My anesthetist recommended I use some Vit. C on my face and I decided to order it here because the price was much less than purchasing from a salon.</li>
            <li> I love it, Arrive on time .. Got extra coupon for next time purchase that I will use for sure</li>
            <li> The best serum I&#x27;ve ever used.  I am a fan for eternity.</li>
            <li> Obagi 20% Vit C serum is the best!  I have used it for years and alwasy get compliments on the tone and texture of my skin.  thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Just an FYI,  Dr, Obaji sold his Obaji line and I don&#x27;t think they carry it at his office anymore.  I&#x27;ve ordered this serum here a few times because it&#x27;s cheaper.  For years, I bought it at Dr. Obaji&#x27;s office, since he was my dermatologist.  Even the C Serums I got at his office had different colors and consistency.  They told me that is normal because of oxidation. The ones I&#x27;ve bought here have worked the same as the ones I bought at Obaji&#x27;s office. I immediately notice that when I run out of this product, wherever I get it from, that my skin is not as smooth and radiant. ! Wish that wasn&#x27;t true because it&#x27;s a pricey item, but...it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for less than a month and I can already see the difference.  My skin is clearer, the sun damage pigments look lighter.  I&#x27;m pretty sure my skin tone is more even.  I&#x27;ll have to see what my skin looks like in 6 months time.</li>
            <li> I loved the way my skin began to fill within a week, I have complex skin and it really helps, its worth it, the problem is if you use it religiously for the max benefit you need two.</li>
            <li> This product is a good product, I use it before, and I come back to use it again. I always recommend to friends</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised.  Prompt service.</li>
            <li> Best product, love it, love it. Don&#x27;t waste you money on any other vitamin C serum. I tried the one they rayed the best and sold the most, wasted $35.00</li>
            <li> It is apparent that this company is not an authorized dealer for Obagi. It was obvious to me as I opened the bottle the product was not as thick and serum like as my bottle purchased from a local doctor&#x27;s office. There was not the &amp;#34;vitamin C smell&amp;#34; I expected like the other product I purchased from the doctor&#x27;s office. The product was absolutely clear in color. I was told by my doctor&#x27;s office that it should have a goldish tint and the older the product the darker the color as it oxidizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Obagi ended their email to me stating &amp;#34;please see our website for list of authorized dealers in my area and be wary of those claiming to sell our products&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have known better......&amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  Plain and simple.......Shame on me for thinking it was the same product at such a cheaper price!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their defense, if there is such a thing.....They offered a rma after I suggested they were a fraud. The problem in my returning is  I no longer have the box.  And we all know what that means on a return.</li>
            <li> so far, it seems working on my skin.</li>
