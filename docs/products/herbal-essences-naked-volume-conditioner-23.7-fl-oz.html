    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;I will admit that they both smell great!</li>
            <li>All the time people ask me what i have in my hair that smells so good!</li>
            <li>If you can get rid of some of that without sacrificing results, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Love the smell!!</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>Your hair even smells good all day.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wavy/curly hair was puffy but not in a good way.</li>
            <li>fact that it contains no parabens is definitely a good thing.</li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>However, it did smell good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good every day conditioner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy with it and would say it is one of the best mass market products around, and for the price, it is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful fresh grapefruit and mint fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best, but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>It also washed out reasonably easily as conditioners go, and I&#x27;m happy with how my hair feels.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has the strong scent of grapefruit and mint and smells great.</li>
            <li>So this was a pleasant, refreshing surprise.  </li>
            <li>Do your own research and read ingredients.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>How about a nice Hawaiian Punch!?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It would be more fair to see that it doesn&#x27;t impede volume, but you need to get your volume from something else.</li>
            <li>It honestly looked like I did not wash</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be nice to use-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, it is creamy and easy to apply, and felt pleasant on my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong scent that can be smelled for hours after using.</li>
            <li>So far the three which seen best for providing body, shine and detangling are the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>From the first use I was hooked on the refreshing, awakening smell!!</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent (grapefruit and mint) which reminds me of one of my favorite Lush products :D  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this is the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed it&#x27;s still around when many products have gone by the wayside.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this with the same variety of shampoo, and I&#x27;ve been impressed with how my hair looks shiny but not greasy, and the frizz is under control despite the humidity.</li>
            <li>also like that the shampoo has the lid on top and the thicker conditioner has the lid on the bottom</li>
            <li>really enjoyed the scent and feel of it though.</li>
            <li>Yes, but, it is not something which I would use every day, more like once/ week.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner has a nice, light scent.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>but I was more concerned about how it looked.</li>
            <li>middle schooler has reported that she&#x27;s not that impressed with the fragrance or performance of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This is just okay.</li>
            <li>the mint/citrus combination is always a favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very invigorating, happy scent.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit, I do use just a bit more than the conditioner I was using...</li>
            <li>:) There is no residue feeling.  </li>
            <li>1smileycat :-)</li>
            <li>My hair has a litle more bounce than it did before.</li>
            <li>If my hair felt great, I&#x27;d live with it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great smelling conditioner and leaves my hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>This is also a great conditioner for those people allergic to stronger versions or have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But this unique mix of grapefruit and mint is very appealing and leaves your scalp and hair feeling and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>Clean, refreshing grapefruit mint fragrant conditioner yields plenty of volume and body to my hair without parabens or coloring.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to break it off and end up with split ends.</li>
            <li>It rinses easily and does not seem to build up on my hair.</li>
            <li>It claims &amp;#34;grapefruit and mint&amp;#34; but to me it just smells like a strong fruit punch.</li>
            <li>My hair looks fine, but I canâ€™t say if it created a noticeable amount of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This worked well at detangling my hair, which is important to me because my hair tangles easily</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Herbal Essences Naked Volume Conditioner&amp;#34; has a pleasant scent, is easily applied, and seems to work as well as most widely-available conditioners we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>got this primarily to use as a co-wash for my black daughters&#x27; hair, as we go through a lot of conditioner with them and they do best with paraben free products.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I am thrilled to see Herbal Essences offering this in the large size.    </li>
            <li>if that is because I love the smell so much!!</li>
            <li>I had not used Herbal essence since I was a teen, and have to say that I am by and large impressed.  </li>
            <li>I like volumizing products, and I always liked the Herbal Essences that I bought in the past, so I was happy to give this conditioner a try.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t tried Herbal Essence in a long time but this product conditioned my hair and smelled great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I like it, not my favorite, but then it does not cost me $10 to wash my hair with this ;)</li>
            <li>First off, I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>It did leave our hair looking clean and silky</li>
            <li>/&gt;It rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>but I definitely don&#x27;t go there for the pleasant aroma.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my all time favorite conditioner, but it&#x27;s certainly one I would use if I had it on hand, if nothing else because of the way it makes my hair smell after using it.</li>
            <li>The Detangler, Super Rich Conditioner, 16.9-ounce]],\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It made my brush run smoothly through my freshly washed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; so I was pleasantly surprised at how nice</li>
            <li>The scent was okay, but didn&#x27;t really do much for texture and bounce.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a bad product, but it did leave me unimpressed.  </li>
            <li>The first time that I used it, I almost immediately got the strong memory of being in my dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get even a mild tinging feeling or even a nose-clearing</li>
            <li>It is good at detangling (and I have long hair, so that does help) but here, in the tropics, I like a lighter conditioner which doesn&#x27;t sit on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great and for me, the way it volumizes my hair is by just not weighing it down.</li>
            <li>It is fresh and luxurious.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It sits securely and the opens easily with wet hands, and the lid closes securely.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, the smell pretty much dissipates with the rinse, so you don&#x27;t have to spend all day thinking, &amp;#34;Hey!</li>
            <li>I paired this with a Herbal Essence shampoo (Tousle Me Softly) and ended up with the same bouncing, shiny, gorgeous results as always ...</li>
            <li>Always loved Herbal Essence Shampoo and Conditioner since I was a young teen.</li>
            <li>real clincher is that the conditioner rinses out of the hair a bit too easily to effectively help with detangling, including the next morning.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to strong fragrances just go ahead and avoid this conditioner</li>
            <li>for the scent - it&#x27;s not necessarily unpleasant, but it is unusual.  </li>
            <li>have soft, baby fine hair which doesn&#x27;t have any texture or body.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to test out this (new?)</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;It smells good&amp;#34; was my first impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll preface this review by saying that I am picky about bath products, some would say obsessive ;)  </li>
            <li>As background, I&#x27;ve most recently been using Pantene conditioners for years.  </li>
            <li>However, people with chemical sensitivities around fragrance would be better served using a different product.</li>
            <li>I will attempt more of the &amp;#34;Naked Collection&amp;#34; in the future.</li>
            <li>The smaller size would probably be better in that case, this one is pretty big.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and when it dried, my waves were pronounced and I had a good bit of body in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves no residue hair is super soft too!!</li>
            <li>That left me expecting a smaller bottle, so I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair quite silky and easily de-tangled, and generally, that&#x27;s a goal of conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I very much like that they are making a natural, paraben free product, and for the price, I really ought to give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>More specifically, she was not able to pull a comb through her hair easily after using the conditioner as the label indicated.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has a very light scent, not noticable once you dry your hair.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and does not weight my hair down.  </li>
            <li>It left it shiny and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I lean toward cheap shampoos, so my standards are pretty low.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s white, creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t describe the leftover fragrance as strong in an overpowering way, but it is definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Typically at the end of my clean cycle, my bangs start to look greasy and limp, but they pretty much look great the whole time between shampoos with this</li>
            <li>It left my hair somewhat soft, but no less or more full than without.</li>
            <li>In reality, you canâ€™t really smell any mint, but I like grapefruit, the fragrance is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Herbal Essence Naked Volume conditioner smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>I will (absolutely) purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a math person, so I didn&#x27;t pay much heed to the 23.7 Fl Oz measurement but rather looked at the picture.</li>
            <li>I am partial to mint, so this is really appealing to me.</li>
            <li>My hair just didn&#x27;t feel conditioned, really.  </li>
            <li>An unusual scent combined with drier-feeling hair, though, makes me not recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I really like the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say that they did a whole lot for my hair.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t really get either of those smells.</li>
            <li>I think the subtraction of the parabens are really helpful for that.  </li>
            <li>My hair cooperates very well when I style</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair light and fluffy, and it washes out cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I love the line and by their other scents</li>
            <li>, so gravity helps the conditioner but isn&#x27;t in play on the shampoo, which would be much more likely to leak whilst upside-down if not closed</li>
            <li>But at the same time, I am not seeing that it actually adds volume (did I mention my hear was very fine?)</li>
            <li>First, I was surprised by the size of this bottle.</li>
            <li>(It is similar to many if not most conditioners I have used, not bad, but pretty average).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it worked wonders, but it smells good and gets a few bonus points for good results while subtracting a few of the typical chemicals.</li>
            <li>It is similar in consistency to many commercial conditioners, I want to say balsam.  </li>
            <li>So, I didn&#x27;t particularly like the scent or want it hanging around my head all day.  </li>
            <li>family highly recommends this conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say about the volume part, but so far it&#x27;s been decent.  </li>
            <li>I had to wash it twice before my hair was normal.</li>
            <li>For me, this generous sized bottle of conditioner is what I pair with a normal sized shampoo.</li>
            <li>(My hair is long, thick and wavy, so I use a great deal of conditioner).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have too much trouble with tangling so it may be helpful for that, but for body, there are better conditioners out there.</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences has always been a safe choice for me as I cannot deal with heavy scents without reaction.  </li>
            <li>However, after water, the first two ingredients are stearyl alcohol and cetyl alcohol, both which are too harsh in stripping the hair of natural oils, so it wasn&#x27;t great for their natural black hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is fairly thick, but it&#x27;s very finely textured so most conditioners weigh it down.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have any problem with tangles with my super long hair.  </li>
            <li>Many SLS-free or organic products that I have tried have made my hair flat and greasy, and at least this conditioner didn&#x27;t do that, but it did not add any significant volume.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m still giving it four stars because this product is great for the other three girls in our household: one Asian daughter&#x27;s coarse hair, my coarse hair (I&#x27;m white), and my white daughter&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is an all natural conditioner, no perfumes, no artificial colors or scents, no residues left on your hair or dyes.</li>
            <li>This is a nice alternate to the stronger conditioners that have heavy dyes or perfumes and it still gets your hair conditioned.</li>
            <li>And, as promised, my hair did have more volume and bounce than usual.    </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve enjoyed other conditioners with mint that left your scalp feeling tingly and invigorated.</li>
            <li>But after trying just this product, I would be interested in the entire line, even if just this scent.  </li>
            <li>While it seems to work with giving the hair some body and shine, our daughter&#x27;s dense head of moderately fine, long hair means that she needs something which helps her keep the tangles brushed out.  </li>
            <li>I consider this to be the slightly nicer end of &amp;#34;the cheap stuff,&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this enough to be positive, but it seems to add</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo and condition seem to get used at the same ratio, which is an added bonus (I tend to use twice as much conditioner typically with the cheap stuff).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not confident that it is doing as good of a job as building up my hair as my other volumizing shampoos.  </li>
            <li>And, if I had one note of criticism, maybe after some time elapses and people understand why this bottle is white (to indicate its more natural ingredients), maybe they could add a little design to the bottle (to \\&quot;jazz\\&quot;</li>
            <li>received Herbal Essences Naked Volume Conditioner to try &amp; was surprised that it seems to be adding much needed volume to my hair.  </li>
            <li>stars for being a natural, paraben-free product</li>
            <li>This product is in no way natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fragrant, and while that&#x27;s a big plus to me, people that don&#x27;t like fragrance might find it too</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any added volume, but other than that it seems like a decent conditioner.</li>
            <li>However, after using this Herbal Essences product, my hair felt less soft and more dried out than when I use Pantene (either their [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It works very well to condition my hair which is shoulder length, as well as both of my daughters&#x27; hair which is long, and my husband&#x27;s hair which is very short.  </li>
            <li>far as results go, it&#x27;s a very generic conditioner.</li>
            <li>I recently had a perm, but didn&#x27;t experience any volume increase the last time I used my normal shampoo and didn&#x27;t use conditioner.</li>
            <li>If I were still living in New York (that was a long time ago)</li>
            <li>I probably would use it every other day, but here moisture is more of a problem than dryness, and so I usually go with lighter weight products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Herbal Essences Naked Volume Conditioner was pretty average all around.</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft though not quite as soft as some other conditioners have made it-</li>
            <li>Before I cut it, my hair would be difficult to untangle after I washed it as my hair is very fine.</li>

            <li> middle schooler has reported that she&#x27;s not that impressed with the fragrance or performance of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This is just okay.</li>
            <li> the mint/citrus combination is always a favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very invigorating, happy scent.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit, I do use just a bit more than the conditioner I was using...</li>
            <li> :) There is no residue feeling.  </li>
            <li> 1smileycat :-)</li>
            <li> My hair has a litle more bounce than it did before.</li>
            <li> If my hair felt great, I&#x27;d live with it.  </li>
            <li> This is a great smelling conditioner and leaves my hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> This is also a great conditioner for those people allergic to stronger versions or have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But this unique mix of grapefruit and mint is very appealing and leaves your scalp and hair feeling and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li> Clean, refreshing grapefruit mint fragrant conditioner yields plenty of volume and body to my hair without parabens or coloring.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to break it off and end up with split ends.</li>
            <li> It rinses easily and does not seem to build up on my hair.</li>
            <li> It claims &amp;#34;grapefruit and mint&amp;#34; but to me it just smells like a strong fruit punch.</li>
            <li> My hair looks fine, but I canâ€™t say if it created a noticeable amount of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This worked well at detangling my hair, which is important to me because my hair tangles easily</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Herbal Essences Naked Volume Conditioner&amp;#34; has a pleasant scent, is easily applied, and seems to work as well as most widely-available conditioners we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> got this primarily to use as a co-wash for my black daughters&#x27; hair, as we go through a lot of conditioner with them and they do best with paraben free products.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I am thrilled to see Herbal Essences offering this in the large size.    </li>
            <li> if that is because I love the smell so much!!</li>
            <li> I had not used Herbal essence since I was a teen, and have to say that I am by and large impressed.  </li>
            <li> I like volumizing products, and I always liked the Herbal Essences that I bought in the past, so I was happy to give this conditioner a try.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried Herbal Essence in a long time but this product conditioned my hair and smelled great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I like it, not my favorite, but then it does not cost me $10 to wash my hair with this ;)</li>
            <li> First off, I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> It did leave our hair looking clean and silky</li>
            <li> /&gt;It rinses clean.  </li>
            <li> but I definitely don&#x27;t go there for the pleasant aroma.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my all time favorite conditioner, but it&#x27;s certainly one I would use if I had it on hand, if nothing else because of the way it makes my hair smell after using it.</li>
            <li> The Detangler, Super Rich Conditioner, 16.9-ounce]],\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It made my brush run smoothly through my freshly washed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; so I was pleasantly surprised at how nice</li>
            <li> The scent was okay, but didn&#x27;t really do much for texture and bounce.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a bad product, but it did leave me unimpressed.  </li>
            <li> The first time that I used it, I almost immediately got the strong memory of being in my dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get even a mild tinging feeling or even a nose-clearing</li>
            <li> It is good at detangling (and I have long hair, so that does help) but here, in the tropics, I like a lighter conditioner which doesn&#x27;t sit on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells great and for me, the way it volumizes my hair is by just not weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It is fresh and luxurious.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It sits securely and the opens easily with wet hands, and the lid closes securely.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, the smell pretty much dissipates with the rinse, so you don&#x27;t have to spend all day thinking, &amp;#34;Hey!</li>
            <li> I paired this with a Herbal Essence shampoo (Tousle Me Softly) and ended up with the same bouncing, shiny, gorgeous results as always ...</li>
            <li> Always loved Herbal Essence Shampoo and Conditioner since I was a young teen.</li>
            <li> real clincher is that the conditioner rinses out of the hair a bit too easily to effectively help with detangling, including the next morning.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to strong fragrances just go ahead and avoid this conditioner</li>
            <li> for the scent - it&#x27;s not necessarily unpleasant, but it is unusual.  </li>
            <li> have soft, baby fine hair which doesn&#x27;t have any texture or body.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to test out this (new?)</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;It smells good&amp;#34; was my first impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface this review by saying that I am picky about bath products, some would say obsessive ;)  </li>
            <li> As background, I&#x27;ve most recently been using Pantene conditioners for years.  </li>
            <li> However, people with chemical sensitivities around fragrance would be better served using a different product.</li>
            <li> I will attempt more of the &amp;#34;Naked Collection&amp;#34; in the future.</li>
            <li> The smaller size would probably be better in that case, this one is pretty big.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and when it dried, my waves were pronounced and I had a good bit of body in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves no residue hair is super soft too!!</li>
            <li> That left me expecting a smaller bottle, so I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair quite silky and easily de-tangled, and generally, that&#x27;s a goal of conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I very much like that they are making a natural, paraben free product, and for the price, I really ought to give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> More specifically, she was not able to pull a comb through her hair easily after using the conditioner as the label indicated.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a very light scent, not noticable once you dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and does not weight my hair down.  </li>
            <li> It left it shiny and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I lean toward cheap shampoos, so my standards are pretty low.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s white, creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t describe the leftover fragrance as strong in an overpowering way, but it is definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Typically at the end of my clean cycle, my bangs start to look greasy and limp, but they pretty much look great the whole time between shampoos with this</li>
            <li> It left my hair somewhat soft, but no less or more full than without.</li>
            <li> In reality, you canâ€™t really smell any mint, but I like grapefruit, the fragrance is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Herbal Essence Naked Volume conditioner smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> I will (absolutely) purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a math person, so I didn&#x27;t pay much heed to the 23.7 Fl Oz measurement but rather looked at the picture.</li>
            <li> I am partial to mint, so this is really appealing to me.</li>
            <li> My hair just didn&#x27;t feel conditioned, really.  </li>
            <li> An unusual scent combined with drier-feeling hair, though, makes me not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say that they did a whole lot for my hair.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t really get either of those smells.</li>
            <li> I think the subtraction of the parabens are really helpful for that.  </li>
            <li> My hair cooperates very well when I style</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair light and fluffy, and it washes out cleanly.  </li>
            <li> I love the line and by their other scents</li>
            <li> , so gravity helps the conditioner but isn&#x27;t in play on the shampoo, which would be much more likely to leak whilst upside-down if not closed</li>
            <li> But at the same time, I am not seeing that it actually adds volume (did I mention my hear was very fine?)</li>
            <li> First, I was surprised by the size of this bottle.</li>
            <li> (It is similar to many if not most conditioners I have used, not bad, but pretty average).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it worked wonders, but it smells good and gets a few bonus points for good results while subtracting a few of the typical chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is similar in consistency to many commercial conditioners, I want to say balsam.  </li>
            <li> So, I didn&#x27;t particularly like the scent or want it hanging around my head all day.  </li>
            <li> family highly recommends this conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really say about the volume part, but so far it&#x27;s been decent.  </li>
            <li> I had to wash it twice before my hair was normal.</li>
            <li> For me, this generous sized bottle of conditioner is what I pair with a normal sized shampoo.</li>
            <li> (My hair is long, thick and wavy, so I use a great deal of conditioner).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have too much trouble with tangling so it may be helpful for that, but for body, there are better conditioners out there.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences has always been a safe choice for me as I cannot deal with heavy scents without reaction.  </li>
            <li> However, after water, the first two ingredients are stearyl alcohol and cetyl alcohol, both which are too harsh in stripping the hair of natural oils, so it wasn&#x27;t great for their natural black hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thick, but it&#x27;s very finely textured so most conditioners weigh it down.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have any problem with tangles with my super long hair.  </li>
            <li> Many SLS-free or organic products that I have tried have made my hair flat and greasy, and at least this conditioner didn&#x27;t do that, but it did not add any significant volume.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m still giving it four stars because this product is great for the other three girls in our household: one Asian daughter&#x27;s coarse hair, my coarse hair (I&#x27;m white), and my white daughter&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is an all natural conditioner, no perfumes, no artificial colors or scents, no residues left on your hair or dyes.</li>
            <li> This is a nice alternate to the stronger conditioners that have heavy dyes or perfumes and it still gets your hair conditioned.</li>
            <li> And, as promised, my hair did have more volume and bounce than usual.    </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve enjoyed other conditioners with mint that left your scalp feeling tingly and invigorated.</li>
            <li> But after trying just this product, I would be interested in the entire line, even if just this scent.  </li>
            <li> While it seems to work with giving the hair some body and shine, our daughter&#x27;s dense head of moderately fine, long hair means that she needs something which helps her keep the tangles brushed out.  </li>
            <li> I consider this to be the slightly nicer end of &amp;#34;the cheap stuff,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this enough to be positive, but it seems to add</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo and condition seem to get used at the same ratio, which is an added bonus (I tend to use twice as much conditioner typically with the cheap stuff).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not confident that it is doing as good of a job as building up my hair as my other volumizing shampoos.  </li>
            <li> And, if I had one note of criticism, maybe after some time elapses and people understand why this bottle is white (to indicate its more natural ingredients), maybe they could add a little design to the bottle (to \\&quot;jazz\\&quot;</li>
            <li> received Herbal Essences Naked Volume Conditioner to try &amp; was surprised that it seems to be adding much needed volume to my hair.  </li>
            <li> stars for being a natural, paraben-free product</li>
            <li> This product is in no way natural.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fragrant, and while that&#x27;s a big plus to me, people that don&#x27;t like fragrance might find it too</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any added volume, but other than that it seems like a decent conditioner.</li>
            <li> However, after using this Herbal Essences product, my hair felt less soft and more dried out than when I use Pantene (either their [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It works very well to condition my hair which is shoulder length, as well as both of my daughters&#x27; hair which is long, and my husband&#x27;s hair which is very short.  </li>
            <li> far as results go, it&#x27;s a very generic conditioner.</li>
            <li> I recently had a perm, but didn&#x27;t experience any volume increase the last time I used my normal shampoo and didn&#x27;t use conditioner.</li>
            <li> If I were still living in New York (that was a long time ago)</li>
            <li> I probably would use it every other day, but here moisture is more of a problem than dryness, and so I usually go with lighter weight products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Herbal Essences Naked Volume Conditioner was pretty average all around.</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft though not quite as soft as some other conditioners have made it-</li>
            <li> Before I cut it, my hair would be difficult to untangle after I washed it as my hair is very fine.</li>
            <li> I usually try to finish up a product even if I don&#x27;t love it, but I threw this out before the bottle was even half empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really added a lot of volume- some perhaps, but definitely a lot of bounce.&lt;br</li>
            <li> or so I have been using boutique organic products from a few high end companies.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair and she has long hair, but thinner.  </li>
            <li> Volume-wise, it does seem similar to the Pantene conditioner that I&#x27;ve used for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo when I used it alone, made my hair flat and oily looking.</li>
            <li> I have medium thick straight hair, shoulder length, and I wash my hair about once a week (gasp!), unless I&#x27;m out working in the yard a lot.</li>
            <li> I recently went from having very long hair to a shorter style.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t  use conditioner because it weighs my hair down, makes my already soft hair softer &amp; leaves it limp and harder to curl.</li>
            <li> have long curly hair here.</li>
            <li> However, my wife, who has unusually thick and not-easily-tamed hair, reports that it did not work as well as the more expensive conditioners she obtains directly from the hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Did not clear up for 3 days after washing product off.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s still tons of other ones left in there</li>
            <li> I massaged it into my hair in the shower after shampooing and left it in for a couple of minutes and then rinsed it out and towel dried my hair.</li>
            <li> The *only* reason that I did not is that I find it a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> However, the few times I used it with the shampoo, I had the same results.</li>
            <li> I do not notice a grapefruit scent, and I can smell the mint only very slightly.</li>
            <li> It was flat and within a few hours my hair looked oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used other brands like Suave and Herbal Essences quite a bit in the past, but I switched back to Pantene a while ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That said, the Pantene still gives her a poufy head of hair compared to some other conditioners she has used.</li>
            <li> It works well to detangle and does not weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it has an odd fragrance that just doesn&#x27;t appeal to me.</li>
            <li> The conditioner reminds me of a fake tropical concoction, smelling more like an artificial passion fruit or mango fruit punch.</li>
            <li> even though this contains no dyes, parabens or heavy residues.</li>
            <li> I blow dried my hair.</li>
            <li> The scent lingers, but is not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Dried my hair out as well as my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue.</li>
            <li> The large size of the bottle though might be difficult for arthritic or very small hands.</li>
            <li> I like the scent; it&#x27;s soft enough to not be annoying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, in terms of creating volume, I am not sure.</li>
            <li> For the past 20 years</li>
            <li> I have thick hair to begin with, but it is softer with a fluffy feel, but still manageable.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure yet</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner one time and the rash was unbelievable! !</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the end</li>
            <li> but this one is a fail to me.</li>
            <li> This one was a bad idea.</li>
            <li> I hate hate</li>
            <li> hated my hair.</li>
            <li> The worst part was that these products gave me terrible dandruff, which I never had before.</li>
            <li> They took out some of the worst cancer-causing chemicals</li>
    </ol>

            <li> ......soft my hair.... and volumize it!....... for my hair works! All the time people ask me what i have in my hair that smells so good!</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner because I was looking for a sulfate-free volumizing products. I used this along with the Herbal Essences Naked Volumizing Shampoo. Many SLS-free or organic products that I have tried have made my hair flat and greasy, and at least this conditioner didn&#x27;t do that, but it did not add any significant volume. The worst part was that these products gave me terrible dandruff, which I never had before. I usually try to finish up a product even if I don&#x27;t love it, but I threw this out before the bottle was even half empty. I appreciate that Herbal Essences is trying to make sulfate-free products, but this does not do its job at all.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve been using Herbal Essences products for years and I was excited to test out this (new?) variety of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the smell. It is supposed to be a mix of grapefruit and mint. In reality, you canâ€™t really smell any mint, but I like grapefruit, the fragrance is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it is creamy and easy to apply, and felt pleasant on my hair. It made my brush run smoothly through my freshly washed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, in terms of creating volume, I am not sure. My hair looks fine, but I canâ€™t say if it created a noticeable amount of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a satisfactory product.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Herbal Essences Naked Volume Conditioner&amp;#34; has a pleasant scent, is easily applied, and seems to work as well as most widely-available conditioners we&#x27;ve tried. However, my wife, who has unusually thick and not-easily-tamed hair, reports that it did not work as well as the more expensive conditioners she obtains directly from the hairdresser. More specifically, she was not able to pull a comb through her hair easily after using the conditioner as the label indicated.</li>
            <li> This was a big letdown. The Herbal Essence Naked Volume conditioner smells fabulous. It is fresh and luxurious. Your hair even smells good all day. I loved the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I hate hate hated my hair. My wavy/curly hair was puffy but not in a good way. It was like a hay stack. My hair was flyaway but didn&#x27;t wave at all. It was just a flyaway puff that wouldn&#x27;t do anything. I had to wash it twice before my hair was normal. This one was a bad idea.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this is the smell. It also washed out reasonably easily as conditioners go, and I&#x27;m happy with how my hair feels. I can&#x27;t say it worked wonders, but it smells good and gets a few bonus points for good results while subtracting a few of the typical chemicals. If you can get rid of some of that without sacrificing results, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Clean, refreshing grapefruit mint fragrant conditioner yields plenty of volume and body to my hair without parabens or coloring. It smells yummy. I and my hair felt yummy after using it. I applaud Clairol  for providing a paraben-free option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some manufacturers are voluntarily removing and/or reformulating products for those consumers cautiously avoiding parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The trend is to avoid parabens which protect against microorganisms to preserve and extend product shelf life. Parabens are endocrine disruptors stored in the body tissue that interfere with glandular activity and hormone production. The impacts on kids and adults include developmental disorders, dysfunction of the immune system, learning problems as well as reproductive disorders. Do your own research and read ingredients.</li>
            <li> For me, this generous sized bottle of conditioner is what I pair with a normal sized shampoo. (My hair is long, thick and wavy, so I use a great deal of conditioner). Therefore, I am thrilled to see Herbal Essences offering this in the large size.    I paired this with a Herbal Essence shampoo (Tousle Me Softly) and ended up with the same bouncing, shiny, gorgeous results as always ... even though this contains no dyes, parabens or heavy residues. I never needed purple conditioner anyway.    The comb glided through my hair while still damp (which tells me that the conditioner did its job). And, as promised, my hair did have more volume and bounce than usual.    I will (absolutely) purchase this product again. And, if I had one note of criticism, maybe after some time elapses and people understand why this bottle is white (to indicate its more natural ingredients), maybe they could add a little design to the bottle (to \\&quot;jazz\\&quot; it up a bit). Maybe the outline of some tree leaves or some such ...</li>
            <li> Always loved Herbal Essence Shampoo and Conditioner since I was a young teen. I&#x27;m amazed it&#x27;s still around when many products have gone by the wayside. I hadn&#x27;t tried Herbal Essence in a long time but this product conditioned my hair and smelled great. I might buy this again. Nice.</li>
            <li> First, I was surprised by the size of this bottle. I&#x27;m not a math person, so I didn&#x27;t pay much heed to the 23.7 Fl Oz measurement but rather looked at the picture. That left me expecting a smaller bottle, so I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this primarily to use as a co-wash for my black daughters&#x27; hair, as we go through a lot of conditioner with them and they do best with paraben free products. However, after water, the first two ingredients are stearyl alcohol and cetyl alcohol, both which are too harsh in stripping the hair of natural oils, so it wasn&#x27;t great for their natural black hair. However, I&#x27;m still giving it four stars because this product is great for the other three girls in our household: one Asian daughter&#x27;s coarse hair, my coarse hair (I&#x27;m white), and my white daughter&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this enough to be positive, but it seems to add volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have soft, baby fine hair which doesn&#x27;t have any texture or body. Normally I don&#x27;t  use conditioner because it weighs my hair down, makes my already soft hair softer &amp; leaves it limp and harder to curl. I limit the amount of conditioner I use &amp; don&#x27;t use it for every shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I received Herbal Essences Naked Volume Conditioner to try &amp; was surprised that it seems to be adding much needed volume to my hair.  I recently had a perm, but didn&#x27;t experience any volume increase the last time I used my normal shampoo and didn&#x27;t use conditioner. So  I can attribute the volume increase to the conditioner, not the perm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review if my experience with this conditioner changes.  Currently, it seems to be adding some volume.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thick, but it&#x27;s very finely textured so most conditioners weigh it down. I&#x27;m happy to report that this one doesn&#x27;t. It has a wonderful fresh grapefruit and mint fragrance. I am partial to mint, so this is really appealing to me. I massaged it into my hair in the shower after shampooing and left it in for a couple of minutes and then rinsed it out and towel dried my hair. This worked well at detangling my hair, which is important to me because my hair tangles easily and it&#x27;s easy to break it off and end up with split ends. I blow dried my hair. It left it shiny and easy to manage. It also added a bit of volume. It is a product that I would purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with the same variety of shampoo, and I&#x27;ve been impressed with how my hair looks shiny but not greasy, and the frizz is under control despite the humidity. I lean toward cheap shampoos, so my standards are pretty low. I consider this to be the slightly nicer end of &amp;#34;the cheap stuff,&amp;#34; so I was pleasantly surprised at how nice my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and condition seem to get used at the same ratio, which is an added bonus (I tend to use twice as much conditioner typically with the cheap stuff). I have medium thick straight hair, shoulder length, and I wash my hair about once a week (gasp!), unless I&#x27;m out working in the yard a lot. Typically at the end of my clean cycle, my bangs start to look greasy and limp, but they pretty much look great the whole time between shampoos with this combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that the shampoo has the lid on top and the thicker conditioner has the lid on the bottom, so gravity helps the conditioner but isn&#x27;t in play on the shampoo, which would be much more likely to leak whilst upside-down if not closed properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent. It claims &amp;#34;grapefruit and mint&amp;#34; but to me it just smells like a strong fruit punch. Luckily, the smell pretty much dissipates with the rinse, so you don&#x27;t have to spend all day thinking, &amp;#34;Hey! How about a nice Hawaiian Punch!?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;It smells good&amp;#34; was my first impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not confident that it is doing as good of a job as building up my hair as my other volumizing shampoos.  It leaves my hair quite silky and easily de-tangled, and generally, that&#x27;s a goal of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the fact that it contains no parabens is definitely a good thing. That&#x27;s probably why it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using the rest of the bottle because I like how it smells, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider it a volumizing conditioner. It would be more fair to see that it doesn&#x27;t impede volume, but you need to get your volume from something else.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a very light scent, not noticable once you dry your hair. I found it to condition my hair without a lot of extra heaviness. I tested it without the matching shampoo, so my comments are only on the conditioner itself.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling conditioner and leaves my hair feeling soft.  Both my wife and I use it.  I have short hair and she has long hair, but thinner.  When using it, neither she nor I noticed any additional volume.  It did leave our hair looking clean and silky though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the scent and feel of it though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface this review by saying that I am picky about bath products, some would say obsessive ;)  For the past 20 years or so I have been using boutique organic products from a few high end companies.  I had not used Herbal essence since I was a teen, and have to say that I am by and large impressed.  It has a nice clean scent (grapefruit and mint) which reminds me of one of my favorite Lush products :D  The scent lingers, but is not too heavy.  I very much like that they are making a natural, paraben free product, and for the price, I really ought to give it 5 stars.  The *only* reason that I did not is that I find it a bit heavy. It is similar in consistency to many commercial conditioners, I want to say balsam.  It is good at detangling (and I have long hair, so that does help) but here, in the tropics, I like a lighter conditioner which doesn&#x27;t sit on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had gotten the shampoo too, and likely will be buying some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Yes, but, it is not something which I would use every day, more like once/ week.  That is because of the environment here.  If I were still living in New York (that was a long time ago) I probably would use it every other day, but here moisture is more of a problem than dryness, and so I usually go with lighter weight products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with it and would say it is one of the best mass market products around, and for the price, it is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for the scent&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for value&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for being a natural, paraben-free product&lt;br /&gt;3-4 for consistency/ weight. (It is similar to many if not most conditioners I have used, not bad, but pretty average).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like it, not my favorite, but then it does not cost me $10 to wash my hair with this ;)</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a nice, light scent. It smells good. I do not notice a grapefruit scent, and I can smell the mint only very slightly. It works well to detangle and does not weigh my hair down at all. It rinses easily and does not seem to build up on my hair. I don&#x27;t really notice any added volume, but other than that it seems like a decent conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like volumizing products, and I always liked the Herbal Essences that I bought in the past, so I was happy to give this conditioner a try.  As background, I&#x27;ve most recently been using Pantene conditioners for years.  I&#x27;ve also used other brands like Suave and Herbal Essences quite a bit in the past, but I switched back to Pantene a while ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a bad product, but it did leave me unimpressed.  Volume-wise, it does seem similar to the Pantene conditioner that I&#x27;ve used for a long time.  So, no complaints there.  However, after using this Herbal Essences product, my hair felt less soft and more dried out than when I use Pantene (either their [[ASIN:B00HZ6SOY6 Pro-V Sheer Volume Conditioner]] or their [[ASIN:B0087PWNJG Daily Moisture Renewal Conditioner]]).  My hair just didn&#x27;t feel conditioned, really.  I was not impressed with the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent - it&#x27;s not necessarily unpleasant, but it is unusual.  The first time that I used it, I almost immediately got the strong memory of being in my dentist&#x27;s office.  Now, I don&#x27;t mind the dentist...but I definitely don&#x27;t go there for the pleasant aroma.  :)  So, I didn&#x27;t particularly like the scent or want it hanging around my head all day.  If my hair felt great, I&#x27;d live with it.  An unusual scent combined with drier-feeling hair, though, makes me not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner one time and the rash was unbelievable! ! This product is in no way natural.  Did not clear up for 3 days after washing product off. Dried my hair out as well as my scalp.  Not the volume claimed.  Will be throwing away and going back to my macadamia oil conditioner by organix. if you have skin allergies beware!</li>
            <li> I have the shampoo for this so figured if I combined the two, it might work as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long curly hair here. The shampoo when I used it alone, made my hair flat and oily looking. I was hoping with the conditioner, it would perhaps give it the lift that the label states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that they both smell great! It is invigorating and the grapefruit comes through for me. However, the few times I used it with the shampoo, I had the same results. It was flat and within a few hours my hair looked oily. However, it did smell good but I was more concerned about how it looked. It honestly looked like I did not wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I canâ€™t recommend this scent. I love the line and by their other scents but this one is a fail to me.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner. It smells great and for me, the way it volumizes my hair is by just not weighing it down. It&#x27;s not my all time favorite conditioner, but it&#x27;s certainly one I would use if I had it on hand, if nothing else because of the way it makes my hair smell after using it. It leaves my hair light and fluffy, and it washes out cleanly.  I like it!</li>
            <li> I really like the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I recently went from having very long hair to a shorter style. Before I cut it, my hair would be difficult to untangle after I washed it as my hair is very fine. The Herbal Essence Naked Volume Conditioner helped somewhat with that. After the cut, my medium length hair works well with this conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue. But at the same time, I am not seeing that it actually adds volume (did I mention my hear was very fine?) even immediately after a shower. I like the scent; it&#x27;s soft enough to not be annoying. However, people with chemical sensitivities around fragrance would be better served using a different product. I like it enough to consider purchasing it once my trial bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> Love the smell!! Leaves no residue hair is super soft too!!</li>
            <li> They took out some of the worst cancer-causing chemicals but there&#x27;s still tons of other ones left in there and I can&#x27;t say that they did a whole lot for my hair. The scent was okay, but didn&#x27;t really do much for texture and bounce. I don&#x27;t have too much trouble with tangling so it may be helpful for that, but for body, there are better conditioners out there.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has the strong scent of grapefruit and mint and smells great. This is an all natural conditioner, no perfumes, no artificial colors or scents, no residues left on your hair or dyes. This is a nice alternate to the stronger conditioners that have heavy dyes or perfumes and it still gets your hair conditioned. This is also a great conditioner for those people allergic to stronger versions or have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We have 3 girls in the house so along with my wife, we use a *lot* of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our middle schooler has reported that she&#x27;s not that impressed with the fragrance or performance of this conditioner.  She described it as \\&quot;smelling like soap.\\&quot;  I guess I would agree, if I didn&#x27;t know it was supposed to smell like grapefruit and mint, I might describe it as that as well....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real clincher is that the conditioner rinses out of the hair a bit too easily to effectively help with detangling, including the next morning. While it seems to work with giving the hair some body and shine, our daughter&#x27;s dense head of moderately fine, long hair means that she needs something which helps her keep the tangles brushed out.  So far the three which seen best for providing body, shine and detangling are the [[ASIN:B0009OMNHU Paul Mitchell The Detangler, Super Rich Conditioner, 16.9-ounce]],\\&quot; [[ASIN:B00CYTM490 Garnier Fructis Conditioner SLEEK AND SHINE - 40 oz. - Pump]]s and [[ASIN:B0087PWNDC Pantene Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal Hair Conditioner 12.6 Fl Oz (packaging may vary)]] with the Pantene her favorie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that volumizing may be battling detangling - which is to say that if you want your hair to volumize, you&#x27;d want to strip out any oils, while if you want to detangle,  you need to leave some residue in the hair to reduce friction between the hairs.  That said, the Pantene still gives her a poufy head of hair compared to some other conditioners she has used.</li>
            <li> This is just okay. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it has an odd fragrance that just doesn&#x27;t appeal to me. Also, I&#x27;ve enjoyed other conditioners with mint that left your scalp feeling tingly and invigorated. This doesn&#x27;t do that AT ALL. Not something I&#x27;ll reorder.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences has always been a safe choice for me as I cannot deal with heavy scents without reaction.  Otherwise, I try to find something with no fragrance.  But this unique mix of grapefruit and mint is very appealing and leaves your scalp and hair feeling and smelling fresh.  I have thick hair to begin with, but it is softer with a fluffy feel, but still manageable.  I ordered the volumizing souffle that accompanies this conditioner, but my order was cancelled as I believe they ran out.  But after trying just this product, I would be interested in the entire line, even if just this scent.  I tend to latch on to products that don&#x27;t react on me.  My allergies are respiratory, not dermal.  And the slightest fragrance in soaps and detergents etc. can set me off.  So this was a pleasant, refreshing surprise.  I will attempt more of the &amp;#34;Naked Collection&amp;#34; in the future.</li>
            <li> The Herbal Essences Naked Volume Conditioner was pretty average all around. It has a very strong scent that can be smelled for hours after using. I wouldn&#x27;t describe the leftover fragrance as strong in an overpowering way, but it is definitely noticeable. If you&#x27;re sensitive to strong fragrances just go ahead and avoid this conditioner all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the grapefruit and mint, I didn&#x27;t really get either of those smells. The conditioner reminds me of a fake tropical concoction, smelling more like an artificial passion fruit or mango fruit punch. I&#x27;ve used various soaps from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for several years, and the mint in the Herbal Essences doesn&#x27;t even come into the same neighborhood. I don&#x27;t get even a mild tinging feeling or even a nose-clearing freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as results go, it&#x27;s a very generic conditioner. It left my hair somewhat soft, but no less or more full than without. I&#x27;d put it in the same ballpark as Suaves or VO5s.</li>
            <li> First off, I love the smell.  It&#x27;s grapefruit mint, and the mint/citrus combination is always a favorite of mine.  It&#x27;s a very invigorating, happy scent.  The grapefruit leads, with the mint enhancing it and adding a bit of sweetness.  It&#x27;s very fragrant, and while that&#x27;s a big plus to me, people that don&#x27;t like fragrance might find it too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be nice to use- it&#x27;s white, creamy and easy to apply. The large size of the bottle though might be difficult for arthritic or very small hands. The smaller size would probably be better in that case, this one is pretty big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sits securely and the opens easily with wet hands, and the lid closes securely.  I don&#x27;t anticipate any accidental &#x27;spills by cat.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rinses clean.  My hair felt soft though not quite as soft as some other conditioners have made it- and when it dried, my waves were pronounced and I had a good bit of body in my hair.  I&#x27;m not sure if it really added a lot of volume- some perhaps, but definitely a lot of bounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any problem with tangles with my super long hair.  I think the subtraction of the parabens are really helpful for that.  I&#x27;ll keep using it- it&#x27;s a good every day conditioner.  It&#x27;s not the best, but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Naked Volume Conditioner thru the Vine Voice program. From the first use I was hooked on the refreshing, awakening smell!! Love it!! In fact, everyone in my family loves the smell of it!  It just wakes you up!!  It works very well to condition my hair which is shoulder length, as well as both of my daughters&#x27; hair which is long, and my husband&#x27;s hair which is very short.  Works well for all of us!  I have to admit, I do use just a bit more than the conditioner I was using...but I&#x27;m not sure yet if that is because I love the smell so much!! :) There is no residue feeling.  My hair cooperates very well when I style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family highly recommends this conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 1smileycat :-)</li>
            <li> Smells nice and does not weight my hair down.  I can&#x27;t use conditioner because it makes my hair greasy, but this doesn&#x27;t so it&#x27;s a plus.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so I can&#x27;t really say about the volume part, but so far it&#x27;s been decent.  My hair has a litle more bounce than it did before.</li>
