            <li>I KNOW you can do better to compete better!</li>
            <li>This fit perfectly and made the shaver work as good as though it was new.</li>
            <li>Discarding a shaver when the battery is no longer good is a daunting prospect, but I have been using my shaver with a rechargeable battery for probably 10 years now, and it still holds a charge just fine.</li>

            <li>Nothing better then a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>This is the best, so far.</li>
            <li>Then I started to notice it was taking longer to get a smooth shave, and even then it was not as good.</li>
            <li>It was the perfect replacement for my old blade.</li>
            <li>I love it because it was an amazing price.  </li>
            <li>That said, Amazon had by far the best price for these heads beating even WalMart by $10!</li>
            <li>I had Norelco shavers since the 1960&#x27;s with great success.  </li>

            <li>Very good product just like having a new razor.</li>
            <li>I Love these replacement heads as they are good and give a clean shave.</li>
            <li>They are quick and easy to install and work great.</li>
            <li>The cut is very smooth</li>
            <li>They are very smooth and they never nip the corner of my lips while shaving.</li>
            <li>Replacement is incredibly easy and its just amazing and what a difference it makes.</li>
            <li>Good value and deliver was quick.  </li>
            <li>These were good replacements at the beginning, but quickly wore out.</li>
            <li>Good quick service on delivery of product.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly, the price was good and they work well.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery, good price.</li>
            <li>Good name-brand product, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It fit perfectly and my shave is like when the razor was new.</li>
            <li>Item received and new product fit perfectly  .</li>
            <li>Perfect fit for the Norelco razor, makes it shave just like new.  </li>
            <li>This annual purchase of new blades has extended the life of a perfectly good electric razor and makes for a good shave day in and day out.</li>
            <li>The product was easy to install and my husband is very happy we replaced the old head.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly, made a huge difference when I replaced my very old heads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d forgotten how nice it is to get a decent shave again!!!!</li>
            <li>Very good product, shipping was fast and accurate</li>
            <li>huge improvement, now I know the value of changing the blades periodically!</li>
            <li>Would have given five Stars but thought the price would be better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I did think the entre top of the razor, not just the 3 heads would come with it.</li>
            <li>norelco is always top of the line.  </li>
            <li>One thing you might want to conseder to prolong the life of your blades is to purchase the Norelco liquid wash for the blades, it is inexpensive and does a good job in cleaning the blades; they feel fresh once cleaned.</li>
            <li>You can get the most out of the liquid wash by mixing the liquid with filtered water in the container that you are going to use for your razor.</li>
            <li>Changing the shaving heads realy makes a diference, it feels more like a closer shave.</li>
            <li>Some heads were not made by Philips Norelco but Amazon had the proper heads and at  the best price.  </li>
            <li>I do not think I will do any more business with you because of shipping &amp; tax on shipping.    </li>
            <li>The shaver is okay</li>
            <li>A worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>I guess I paid about a buck or so,  more than I needed.  </li>
            <li>I love products that work as advertised.</li>
            <li>(hopefully they still make them, I&#x27;d better buy more...)</li>
            <li>was pleased with the shipping &amp; packing.</li>
            <li>The total value of this purchase (price + shipping) was great!  </li>
            <li>The product is fine--an appropriate replacement for the heads on my husband&#x27;s shaver.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask anything more of electric shaver blades.</li>
            <li>but at a better price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much better</li>
            <li>This is the beginning of my third year using my Norelco and am impressed that it is still working so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love These RePlaceMent Heads For My ElecTric RaZor.</li>
            <li>Any HAPPIER.  :-)</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find the replacment heads not only available on Amazon, but at a very fair price... thank you!</li>
            <li>great item fast shipping</li>
            <li>It seems some work better than others</li>
            <li>As with most cutters there is a 10-12 time use for them to sit and adjust,</li>
            <li>Everything OK</li>
            <li>This replacement head set fit perfectly and was a direct drop-in replacement for my existing shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product and should purchase another one to ensure that I have a spare.  </li>
            <li>Probably could use a better galvanized process so it wouldn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>We were pleased with the time of delivery.</li>
            <li>I not only recommend this wonderful product by Phillips Sonicare Toothbrush which I just discovered and am now using.</li>
            <li>I ordered the hair nose trimmer , which I have yet to use but am sure it will work out</li>
            <li>ok...  </li>
            <li>I an confident the installation was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Might feel better if the head holder was included.</li>
            <li>Yes I am satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this item before and am satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li>I have had a Norelco 8171XL electric shaver for almost 5 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I think its just a ploy to get more money from us.  </li>
            <li>Amazon price was better than anyplace I know.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was because there are a lot of guys using this model, a lot of folks bought these during the holidays or what, but stores in my area, IF they had a spot on the shelves for it, didn&#x27;t have it in stock AND wanted up to $10 more than I paid here.</li>
            <li>Why replace the razor, when you can just order replacement heads for his favorite razor?  </li>
            <li>TO ANY ONE LOOKING FOR A CONFORTABLE AND SAFE SHAVING.</li>
            <li>Seems to work better than the originals</li>
            <li>it were better</li>
            <li>Will buy again when I more replacements.</li>
            <li>Works much better than a manual razor or electronic razor made for the face.  </li>
            <li>It is working ok for now</li>
            <li>They seem to work OK as a replacement, but it seems all replacement parts are a rip, be it blades like this or brushes for power toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the great service.</li>
            <li>and I received the blades, nothing more.</li>
            <li>Boy it&#x27;s nice to have a smooth shave</li>
            <li>Jim    even better.  </li>
            <li>: Mostly on me, I should have done this years before.</li>
            <li>Saved some money and am getting a much better shave.</li>
            <li>I guess they work but are just OK</li>
            <li>, I am glad I did not pay more than $26 for them.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Packaging could be better.</li>
            <li>What more can you say about 3 shaving heads.  </li>
            <li>the Norelco replacement heads work OK.  </li>
            <li>I will for sure contact you again.</li>
            <li>This razor is passable, but is really more of a \\&quot;first\\&quot; electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan on buying more replacement heads when this set runs its course; I&#x27;m going to upgrade to a razor with more flexibility and precision.</li>
            <li>Just what my husband needed, couldn&#x27;t find replacement in the store, he loves his shaver, so glad I could find replacement blades for him.</li>
            <li>I have used these shaver heads for about 3 years now and have been well pleased.</li>
            <li>but now I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this guy, gal, company, distributer, what-</li>
            <li>They need to be cleaned-out more often.  </li>
            <li>so I am getting more shaves per charge.</li>
            <li>The recommendation is to replace annually incase one of you out there has been using yours for greater than one year.  </li>
            <li>Everywhere else I had checked was a lot more.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Norelco razors for several years, and this is their best shaving heads yet.  </li>
            <li>Sure makes a difference when shaving.</li>
            <li>Love my Norelco Razor.</li>
            <li>These people know what to have for most things out there.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to shop here for most of my needs.  </li>
            <li>Love this razor and the heads hold up well</li>
            <li>me,the Norelco products are the better in this line.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did....</li>
            <li>and I am well satisfied with the product both times.  </li>
            <li>Sure beats having to replace the razor.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great service.</li>
            <li>every thing was ok...</li>
            <li>Make sure your Norellco is a Speed XL.</li>
            <li>Best shavw I have had recently.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love a smooth face on my husband!</li>
            <li>Glad to have been able to get replacement heads, instead of buying yet another electric razor to add to my collection.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I replaced the heads on my SpeedXL shaver but the shave wasn&#x27;t noticeably better.</li>
            <li>To top it off, the HQ8 heads are cheaper too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll find it becomes a better shaver.</li>
            <li>Fast, reliable seller, Product is and always has been great.</li>
            <li>Did I get a much better shave.  </li>
            <li>But most men probably already knew this information anyway.</li>
            <li>Best Buy for the Price, with this being my 2nd replacement.</li>
            <li>Attempted to buy at Walmart, but was always out and cost more.</li>
            <li>I would have rated five stars because I have been using the Norelco for many years, but since the site had faulty information, you get 1 star.</li>
            <li>They do prolong the life the Norelco electric razor which I&#x27;ve had more than 5 years now.  </li>
            <li>They rescued my shaver - what more can I say?</li>
            <li>what I got was just the blades, then I had to buy the holder which is $18-25 more</li>
            <li>Maybe there is more to manufacturing than I realise. :)</li>
            <li>I hope I can find more when I need them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more convenient than using a razor blade</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco shavers for over 40 years because I think they are a better quality than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>18 months at the most.</li>
            <li>I tried buying these at Target, and they didn&#x27;t fit!</li>
            <li>Let me explain, I wanted to be sure that I was not wasting money replacing the head of my shaver to soon.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>After the cleaning with the aid of a toothpick, brush and alcohol, I found I was able to shave with greater ease and satisfactory closeness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure we will be buying Norelco for years to come.</li>
            <li>Definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>I always make sure I maintain the head/blade assembly.  </li>
            <li>I find that a static or non-moving head does a much better job at shaving.  </li>
            <li>Most electric razors from any brand are made in Asia today.  </li>
            <li>Checked prices (since its all the same product) and found the best deal on Amazon (prime).</li>
            <li>(I love that they text me when it&#x27;s been delivered).</li>
            <li>so I ended up with more</li>
            <li>the job done and the women love it.</li>
            <li>Just do it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Product arrived promptly and was as described or better.</li>
            <li>and I could not beat this price anywhere and am glad I checked Amazon before I purchase any.thing</li>
            <li>but hey they make a lot more money with these sub par materials</li>
            <li>I have noticed that these shaver heads hold up better to hair.</li>
            <li>and I was in love again.  </li>
            <li>Notice how they have 3 concentric rings, giving you much more shaving area.</li>
            <li>but it seems to leave more hair when shaving.  </li>
            <li>Because I have opened the package I did not feel it was appropriate to return or exchange them.</li>
            <li>I was able to pick out the correct blades for my razor model by the description in the add.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I could recommend this as being OKAY for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m satisfied with the product itself.</li>
            <li>Make sure the heads match the model of your razor.</li>
            <li>will purchase more via Amazon when / if needed</li>
            <li>and u require me to type more.</li>
            <li>The item was a excellent purchase that I needed as a replacement for a shaver that I&#x27;ve had for several years.</li>
            <li>Great replacement and fast service.</li>
            <li>He has tried different ones, the Norelco is the best.  </li>
            <li>| 17 more words required.</li>
            <li>| 17 more words required</li>
            <li>My razor works better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install.</li>
            <li>I am still using the one i tried to replace and are performing better.</li>
            <li>Eventually I was getting so many cuts on my face, including razor burn</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are now in a test period to see which is the better shaver.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Could not ask for more.</li>
            <li>Except for free....that would be much better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try them, but it would be an interesting experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than going to the store.</li>
            <li>This product is just okay.</li>
            <li>and I love having them delivered instead of going out to find them somewhere.</li>
            <li>Had my doubts about whether replacement blades would work as well as the originals, but not any more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I checked with Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I love the blades and the shaver.</li>
            <li>Norelco products have always satisfied all my shaving needs for years.</li>
            <li>Sure cheaper than buying another shaver.  </li>
            <li>do i need to explain my inpression in so many words?</li>
            <li>I opted to replace the heads and Im glad i did.</li>
            <li>Since this has been a very dependable razer he was happy to not have to replacement.</li>
            <li>ON LINE IS MORE CONVENIENT..</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>the razor blades i purchased were a better price than any</li>
            <li>I shopped Internet sites for price comparison and found Amazon to have the better price.</li>
            <li>I should replace my shaver blades more</li>
            <li>I changed the heads or blades and it works much better, with a much better shave.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>Much better shave.  </li>
            <li>Love the Norelco shaved...</li>
            <li>It requires more dexterity than I have.</li>
            <li>Could not find a better deal then this one.</li>
            <li>Being able to purchase these allowed me to continue using my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>I will buy more as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
            <li>I looked online and found replacement blades and matched the design on top the blade basket to pin-point the one I needed.</li>
            <li>and it is many years</li>
            <li>Have used for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the shave</li>
            <li>The HQ9 Heads give you more shaving service, therefore a quicker shave..</li>
            <li>pleased with Amazon Service and follow up.</li>
            <li>For me, this worked out OK</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get much better than the Norelco brand.  </li>
            <li>I would like to be able to replace the batteries some day.</li>
            <li>I will be very happy if the replacement heads have the  same life.</li>
            <li>It shaves much better now that I have replaced them.</li>
            <li>nothing more to relate</li>
            <li>This product gets top ratings 5âs</li>
            <li>Also to be able to get a replacement head</li>
            <li>and I recommend you get this kind if it fit you application.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>I am ordering more replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Pulled on whiskers more.</li>
            <li>Altogether pleased.</li>
            <li>What a great price just about ready to order some more.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>Came on time, definitely better shaving ...</li>
            <li>Need to replace these things more often and would not be able to do that at brick &amp; mortar prices.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shaver for many years now.</li>
            <li>The batteries still charge perfectly and I only seem to need to replace the blades every couple of year.</li>
            <li>The Norelco has lasted for many year</li>
            <li>Need more be said?</li>
            <li>If it was cheaper, perhaps you could make a better case.</li>
            <li>Factory replacement heads at a price considerably better than at the drug store.</li>
            <li>It took about 30 seconds to swap them out and now my razor does a much better job of shaving.</li>
            <li>I am pleased and I will keep buying them.</li>
            <li>only good!!!!</li>
            <li>Better than the $200 shaver that does not give any results.  </li>
            <li>But if you have the time the blade is much better.</li>
            <li>The Replacement Heads is just OK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than buying the razors on an annual basis.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my favorite shaver and came across this HQ9 replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Philips Norelo recommends replacing these heads once per year to obtain the best possible shave</li>
            <li>shaving results at a more than one-half the cost of the HQ9 heads, at this point.</li>
            <li>got these for father in law haven&#x27;t heard any complaints so must be okay</li>
            <li>what more can you expect.</li>
            <li>Glad that I did it.</li>
            <li>GETTING A BETTER SHAVE NOW.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be doing this once a year from now on :)</li>
            <li>completely satisfied as I have alwys been with the heads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shaver for many years and take it with me on vacations.</li>
            <li>They work, I can shave :).</li>
            <li>Have used this Norelco razor for many years.</li>
            <li>But at the price they are charging, it almost makes more sense to buy a brand-new electric razor.</li>
            <li>First this is the best blade head in the series because it gives best precision, its almost half the price at which it was available in walmart,</li>
            <li>Dropped right in and worked perfectly, however I was expecting a closer shave...not much difference at all.</li>
            <li>Having said that, these are as good as you will find anywhere and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>these new heads work great and easy to replace!</li>
            <li>These shaving heads were reasonably priced and are very effective.  </li>
            <li>Good service, easy to install, quick delivery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far,- - so good!  </li>
            <li>if you liked the original blades in your razor, I guess you&#x27;ll probably like the replacement blades.</li>
            <li>GREAT replacement products, my hubby&#x27;s electric razor is like new!</li>
            <li>The HQ9 has 2 more set of fins per head compared to the original HQ8... and what a difference!    </li>
            <li>Gets a nice clean shave, with no problem.</li>
            <li>Great that you can buy heads for older models.</li>
            <li>They are again providing nice close clean looking shaves.</li>
            <li>They are a exact replacement and was able to get them at a good price</li>
            <li>Nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate his nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>They work great in my older Norelco razor.</li>
            <li>The new blades fit very good</li>
            <li>very good results with these heads, comfort when shaving, easy to replace your old blades.</li>

            <li>works great, highly recommend</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with the outstanding customer service that I have received, and my husband is thrilled to have his favorite shaver back in working order.</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly  and was exactly as described , and very reasonably priced</li>
            <li>I am getting a very clean shave</li>
            <li>18 months is actually a pretty good lifetime for a consumable wear item like these HQ9&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Price was fair and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>and I can get a pretty darn good close shave with this anytime..</li>
            <li>Yep, these were pretty good.</li>
            <li>Get good shave when they are in their first year of use.</li>
            <li>Although very good they do not last the 12 month  life, it&#x27;s more like 6 months.</li>
            <li>THAT CAME WITH ORIGINAL  RAZOR!</li>
            <li>Made a new razor out of it - Great</li>
            <li>Every time I switch shaving heads I&#x27;m reminded of how great it is to have new heads.  </li>
            <li>Saved me a lot of money as I did not need to get a new razor and got to keep my great Norelco razer.</li>
            <li>The new heads make for a great shave.</li>
            <li>razor is like new again and the shipping was great.</li>
            <li>Great replacement heads... makes my Norelco shaver feel like new again.....</li>
            <li>These new rotary blades are great.</li>
            <li>The were new and what can you say but they worked great.  </li>
            <li>However it works great when new.</li>
            <li>When I added these to my razor, I was amazed to get the close shave I once experienced when my razor was new.</li>
            <li>It works great and performs like a new razor.</li>
            <li>I bought these as my Norelco needed new heads and this was a great price.</li>
            <li>Works great like a new razor now.</li>
            <li>New Blades were GREAT.</li>
            <li>These heads worked great and my Norelco Razor is almost like brand new.</li>
            <li>THESE NEW HEADS WORK GREAT IN MY RAZOR.  </li>
            <li>Found these : genuine Philips product, delivered fast, GREAT pricing.</li>
            <li>Easy to install, I just need to remember to change them out more than once a year</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are easy to install and make shaving much more convenient again.  </li>
            <li>Easy swap out &amp; works much better.</li>
            <li>easy installation.....much better shave now</li>
            <li>Already using it for about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;First impression was that it cuts hair more easily but still can not feel any difference or improvement in shaving time.</li>
            <li>and he was very happy with the product and the price was reasonable and much cheaper</li>
            <li>each razor gets better and better with the technology that&#x27;s available now.</li>
            <li>If your heads are more then one year old, this will greatly improve your shave.</li>
            <li>My husband especially appreciated being able to buy this on line as there are so many styles to plow through at the stores.</li>
            <li>Easy to change and gives a pretty good shave.</li>
            <li>Shaves me clean and close!  </li>
            <li>I was amazed how enjoyable my morning shaves have changed, since purchasing this Philips Norelco replacement heads, they work really fine.</li>
            <li>Norelco is a good product, and replacing heads after about two years of usage certainly improved performance.</li>
            <li>You know how it is, when I need to shave, nothing but a nice clean smooth shave will do.</li>
            <li>Overall a very good transaction</li>
            <li>My shaver was not shaving very good recently.  </li>
            <li>Very good Electric razor and blades, used the same brand for years.</li>
            <li>Excellent, just as I expected.</li>
            <li>The provider did a great job shipping the shaving head and the price was far below the cost in the stores.</li>
            <li>, even my 8 year old model still works great.</li>
            <li>I believe the HQ9 gives me the closest and most comfortable shave of all the heads I have used.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than buying blades and a closer more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I never used the top of the line models, so can not compare the higher ends, but this is effective for me.</li>
            <li>So I bought them and am happy with the old razor again.</li>
            <li>The combination of the more powerful motor with the traditional type head is the best for my skin.</li>
            <li>My dad is happy to not be nicking his face with the old shaver heads.</li>
            <li>I have had this brand of shaver before and got many of years use from it, so I am happy that I made the correct choice and only purchased the head :)</li>
            <li>Just be sure to determine which replacement heads fit your razor model.</li>
            <li>the sound of the unit is better.</li>
            <li>Perfect, works as expected</li>

            <li>Norelco electric razor into which these replacement heads fit</li>
            <li>, Fits is what Norelco&#x27;s Store gave me each time I reordered, that is a smooth procedure now with Amazon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not any different than the one that was on the razor when I purchased it which is great.</li>
            <li>Close and comfortable.</li>
            <li>In addition, they are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and I am now about ready to go to a manual razor, which I have used once with good success.  </li>
            <li>The good old HQ9 heads cut well and can run for a while before they need a cleaning or replacement.</li>
            <li>I purchased these replacement heads for my Norelco razor because the old ones were wearing out;  they no longer gave me a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Plus, they were only around $24.50, which is a good $10 cheaper than they are in most stores.  </li>
            <li>Good way to rejunvenate and old razor.</li>
            <li>versu an electric razor, but it is good enough on most days.    </li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>Over a period of time my old heads were not doing a good job.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The Norelco replacement heads I received fit nicely and serve very well.</li>
            <li>SO far so good.</li>
            <li>This is an old, but good.</li>
            <li>Saving nearly $70 makes good sense.</li>
            <li>Good product for an old razor..</li>
            <li>To be fair, my husbands shaver head was way old.  </li>
            <li>No problem with shipment or installation of the head, works better now with new head but not as good as when I first purchased the razor.</li>
            <li>Fits just like the original and shaves fine.</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and now I feel like I have a new razor with which I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>very glad we found them....was about to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you have the right model  </li>
            <li>So glad I looked on the internet and found just the right ones for my husbands razor.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you pick the right model for your razor.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you match up the model number of your razor to the right replacement set.</li>
            <li>They are a good replacement and significantly improve the shaving experience compared to my 18 month old heads.</li>
            <li>I had resharpended my old heads and found that this helped but durabilty was not as good as the original.</li>
            <li>Ready to go for a nice, clean  shave.</li>
            <li>In replacing the heads on an older (Top of the line) shavers I have to say these heads are ok.</li>
            <li>For some reason, Norelco has decided that these particular shaver heads should cost more than many shavers.</li>
            <li>Seems to be an original product and is a fit to the razor.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this shaver and really loves the feature that allows you to run it under the shower to clean it!!</li>
            <li>Nice close shave just like the shaver was new!</li>
            <li>good value for a close shave... seems good shaves last for about a year before new heads are recommended</li>
            <li>If you regularly clean your shaver heads as directed on your shaver manual, do not expect a huge improvement in shaving.</li>
            <li>These replacements heads provide a smooth, clean shave without any nicks or discomfort.</li>

            <li>I made it 3 years on original blades.</li>
            <li>Replacing the heads/blades made a significant difference in the shave I receive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>

            <li>I decided to replace the original blades with this</li>
            <li>Installation was fairly straightforward, and I see some improvement in my shave.</li>
            <li>Bought these replacement heads as the original ones were worn out.</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t had to replace the original heads on my razor.</li>
            <li>Exactly as ordered  Have replaced blades many times before</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my razor for 10 years and it works great so long as I change blades every year.  </li>
            <li>fits like original, o wait it is original</li>
            <li>significantly lower price than Walmart</li>
            <li>#34;tune up&amp;#34; my Norelco Shaver, and immediately noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li>They are original brand replacements for the original heads.  </li>
            <li>After using the original Philips blades that came with my shaver for around 6 years.</li>
            <li>so long LOL ... ... ...</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted but at a much better price</li>
            <li>might as well use the original blades.</li>
            <li>I used the original heads in my shaver for almost two years and the shave was getting tougher and tougher.</li>
            <li>Works just like the original.</li>
            <li>I have been using the original head/blades since I bought the razor over 3 years ago.  </li>
            <li>These are not like the original heads and blades.  </li>
            <li>These worked as well as the original blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Replacemewnts look identical to original and appear to be original mfg. parts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the original blades in the shaver since I bought it about 7 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Original shaving heads seemed sharper.</li>
            <li>The product is just like the original and the pricing is the lowest I could find.</li>
            <li>Looked like original packaging.</li>
            <li>Amazon usually has the best price.</li>
            <li>Replaced my razor heads with these and they seem to work as well as the original product, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them.</li>
            <li>These are the original replacement heads from Norelco.</li>
            <li>They work just like the original ones.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>I was initially impressed by this line of razors and its blades, but no more.  </li>
            <li>makes me as happy as I can be while writing this here review that seems too long.</li>
            <li>Works and shaves just as well as the original shaving head.</li>
            <li>Result: these replacement head blades are inferior to the original blades that come with the shavers.</li>
            <li>This is my first replacement after more than three years of usage.</li>
            <li>After a year of use, it was time to replace the original blades</li>
            <li>These are original replacement heads, and I change them about once a year.</li>
            <li>Original quality blades .</li>
            <li>These replacement cutters should be replaced every six months or so to keep the razor&#x27;s original shaving efficiency.</li>
            <li>Works just like the original.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was original.</li>
            <li>Work like the original</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and has worked just fine.</li>
            <li>They tug and do not cut anywhere close to the original heads.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it was what I needed and was original equipment.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what we ordered and arrived in time frame pleased with product and would order again.  </li>
            <li>They certainly have made shaving more comfortable than with the heads that were wearing through.</li>
            <li>Amazing what a difference new shaving heads make.</li>
            <li>Nice to have new blades</li>
            <li>Since replacing the heads, one pass is all it takes for a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Clean close shave just would like trim part attatchd in stead of changn head.</li>
            <li>A clean shave and face with no cuts or pulls.</li>
            <li>Unless you own some top of the line foil razor that costs several hundred dollars and is made in Germany, these will have to do.  </li>
            <li>Clean shave</li>
            <li>They shave close and clean.</li>
            <li>Clean shaves again.</li>
            <li>Have used 3 different brands over the years, but these are by far the best.</li>
            <li>I will replace more often now that a reasonable pticed cutter head is available</li>
            <li>the Norelco shaver is many years old but the darn thing just wont die :)</li>
            <li>This is my third cordless shaver and the best one so far.</li>
            <li>Ah, Clean shaves gain.....</li>
            <li>No electric shaver can provide a perfectly clean shaven face like the snowplow method (razor and shaving cream) can do.</li>
            <li>Thought it was about time I did as all that was happening was the razor was pulling hair out of my face instead of a clean cut.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t clean them as often or as well as</li>
            <li>Good service and much needed product, thanks</li>
            <li>Just as good as the first shave with a brand new razor.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed, fit&#x27;s Philips shaver, easy to change heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;PRO&#x27;s: exact fit, easily replaced,</li>
            <li>I wholeheartedly recommend these replacement heads to anyone interested in a quick, satisfying shave.  </li>
            <li>The heads easily came right out.    </li>
            <li>Easy, close shave right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Easy to just drop right in.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on the Arctic Razors and people writing that the speedshaver was as good or better than the new product I decided to get a replacement head for my old speedshaver.  </li>
            <li>Returned my old razor to good as new without having to replace it :-)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>If your razor is old, this is a Good way to get faster and better cuts without getting a new razor</li>
            <li>When you buy original equipment replacement parts at a fair price - you get the proper performance.</li>
            <li>In followup to the previous comment, these replacements are actually quite nice and produce an excellent shave.  </li>
            <li>Good value, original parts that need to be regularly replaced.</li>
            <li>With these I feel like I have to go over certain spots more than others.</li>
            <li>nothing special</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so convenient to buy with Amazon vs. making a special trip to a store in search of the correct blade type.</li>
            <li>Nothing special here.</li>
            <li>That is right!  </li>
            <li>they work great, are way sharper than my old ones, and saved me a ton of money on a new razor!</li>
            <li>When these are new, they cut nicely, and I can shave quickly.  </li>
            <li>Oh, by the way, I decided to clean the \\&quot;head holder\\&quot; really good during this switch and my \\&quot;head holder\\&quot; got loose and wobbly so that it wasn&#x27;t staying in place like it used to (the 3 plastic holders were getting out of place rather easily).  </li>
            <li>perfect replacement fit, new blades make the 6 year old razor cut like new.</li>
            <li>Very good heads for one of the few good razors left.</li>
            <li>think my calm approach to the chat was important.</li>
            <li>They worked as expected and I am happy with the reads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty good about emptying my shaver of clippings frequently,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much better a fresh blade works and the autoship program keeps you from forgetting to change regularly.</li>
            <li>After owning several Norelco razors, including this one, my experience has shown that they are really good for about  2 years before you&#x27;ll note a degradation in the quality of the shave.      </li>
            <li>I regularly replace the heads and the shavers continue to provide good service.  </li>
            <li>;, so that the shave is quick and clean.  </li>
            <li>I believe that a real razor delivers a closer and better shave.</li>
            <li>In any case paying $25-$30 once a year is better than spending that much every three months or so for Mach 3 heads.</li>
            <li>I also feel this is environmentally more responsible.</li>
            <li>Norelco recommends you replace them every year, but I get a good two years out of them before there&#x27;s a big drop off in performance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good for another several years, now.</li>
            <li>Although their blades do an adequate job, their shavers are not quite as clean as the Gillette or Schick blades.</li>
            <li>That would be true if you have a lot of beard.</li>
            <li>At some point the cutters have to be replaced, and these are the ones to get back to good shaves.</li>
            <li>Always keep an extra set on hand and change once a year for a good shave</li>
            <li>Extremely simple to replace in the shaver and the quality was good.</li>
            <li>Best performance from your Norellco shaver requires that these heads are replaced at least 2X/yr.</li>
            <li>Very reliable and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li>you buy this product, be sure to view one of the YouTube videos on how to replace the blades--much, much easier than the written instructions in the package.</li>
            <li>The product is good and I now have one for future use</li>
            <li>This is a good product but every man knows there is no such thing.</li>
            <li>The Amazon price is more reasonable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller but every bit as good.</li>
            <li>It kind of was a pain to place the cutters and shields into the old receptacle and &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Glad Amazon carries these as it makes ordering replacement blade so much easier than having to try and find them in a store or have a store employee unlock them from a case.</li>
            <li>Not like shaving with a razor, but good enough to suffice.  </li>
            <li>Many Thanks.</li>
            <li>Guess my shaver battery will give out first, but thus far these do give a good shave.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price too.</li>
            <li>They came quickly, we&#x27;re very easy to install and make the shaver work like new.  </li>
            <li>Exactly like the original, quick and easy to replace.  </li>
            <li>Works great and now the old razor has new life and meets my performance needs.</li>
            <li>I was glad that we didn&#x27;t have to purchase a new shaver as the replacement was available on-line.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads are as good as having a whole new shaver but, for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>They allow him to shave much more quickly and they give him a really close shave.</li>
            <li>I replaced my older blades with the hopes of getting a closer shave, for I thought the older ones were not doing a good job.  </li>
            <li>It is very quiet, easy to use, and fits hands and face nicely.</li>
            <li>My old Philip shaver works like a new one with this heads, no need to buy a new shaver, save a lot, very good to me !</li>
            <li>Does this sound right?  </li>
            <li>They fit exactly right.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace old heads &amp; now shaver is good as new.</li>
            <li>These are exact replacement heads, which installed easily.  </li>
            <li>Every January, I quickly and easily install a replacement set of heads, even though the old ones were still working okay.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected-came on time - easy to use timed delivery.</li>
            <li>I had been using the electric shaver with the original heads for so long that it no longer gave me a good shave</li>
            <li>The Norelco replacement heads are original equipment so they shold fit exactly.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to replace the old blades with these new ones, leading to distinctly more comfortable and closer shaves.</li>
            <li>I just like how this razor, which I&#x27;ve had since 2007, does not irritate my skin and gets a good shave as long as you keep the blades relatively clean.</li>
            <li>While certainly that will keep things more fresh, I waited almost four years.  </li>
            <li>Just at a far better price, in many cases as much as $10 cheaper!</li>
            <li>Always use the original replacement and will be worth it.</li>
            <li>They fit many different models, so make sure you order the right ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco says to replace the heads once a year.</li>
            <li>I think the new heads worked better than the original heads.  </li>
            <li>Fit perfectly, easy to install, makes my husband&#x27;s razor just like new!</li>
            <li>So nice when you put new blades in your shaver, makes it smooth and fast.</li>
            <li>your&#x27;e lucky</li>
            <li>Found these replacement heads purchased at amazon.com met all my expectations in giving a close shave quickly.</li>

            <li>If your face gets dirt on it and you do not get all of it off before using, as happens to me because of my line of work, you will quickly damage the comb.</li>
            <li>Since most new Norelco&#x27;s suck, you&#x27;re better off buying new heads once a year until somebody comes up with a better razor at reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My Norelco is now like new, and is giving me a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>After I change it to new heads shaves very smooth.</li>

            <li>You can most likely save yourself the thirty bucks on new heads for another year or so, and keep getting that satisfying Norelco shave :)</li>
            <li>product for  older Norelco shavers!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and fit the razor.  </li>
            <li>These were cheap, fast and original.</li>
            <li>I shave both my face and head, so I&#x27;m very satisfied with the length they last.  </li>

            <li>His face looks pretty smooth</li>
            <li>The replacement heads were an exact fit for the shaver.  </li>
            <li>The machine works like the very first day.</li>
            <li>Over all good shaver stays chargd long time.</li>
            <li>New blades bring new life to a good razor, smoother, closer and quicker.  </li>
            <li>My husband loved the new razor head, he said it was just like having a new razor.  </li>
            <li>got  the new heads for my electric razor for 1/4 of the price of buying a new razor--same result--closer shave --good comfort</li>
            <li>would have given the product five stars if the manufacturer had included the large easy to see replacement directions from the Amazon web site in the package.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these replacement heads, he popped them into the old razor, and it&#x27;s working good as new again!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;New set of blades, and a quick recharge, and by razor is shaving like new again. :)</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and so far haven&#x27;t heard any complains other than how great the replacement heads are and good saving in our pocket instead of buying another new unit.</li>
            <li>A great way to keep your Norelco mowing those whiskers down is replacing the heads and blades.  </li>
            <li>But before buying this, make sure that your old ones are clean.</li>
            <li>What will also give you a better shave is pouring hot water on the shave heads right after use, and cleaning each shave head with hot water and alcohol every month.</li>
            <li>I found myself returning more and more to my Gillette Fusion razor with increasing frequency each day; first to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; what the Norelco missed, then inevitably for full shaving creme and razor shaves.  </li>
            <li>The shaves were better but not what they were when the razor was new.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much better my shave became with these new blades.</li>
            <li>I had a new shaver with the top notch performance I used to get.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>I did not have to spend more to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re much better off buying a reconditioned speedshaver razor for around $42, which will include new heads.</li>
            <li>With the new heads in, both problems went away and I am therefore a happier, better shaved man now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These replacement HQ9 Norelco Shaver heads are rather pricey for sure, but they are still way cheaper than buying a brand new razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For about $40 you can buy a brand new Norelco shaver ie $10 more.</li>
            <li>better than buying a new razor</li>
            <li>The new ones always work noticeably better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because now my razor is like brand new.</li>
            <li>After installing the new ones, I wasn&#x27;t sure I could tell if there was an improvement.  </li>
            <li>I love getting new heads because they cut so close.  </li>
            <li>Better to save aggravation and just buy new razor.</li>
            <li>THEY WERE BETTER THAN NEW ONES.</li>
            <li>love this razor and did not want to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li>Renewed my razor now it works better than a new one I purchased to replace it with.</li>
            <li>and I am definitely glad we tried the replacement heads instead of the $$$ for a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that we could buy these and not have to buy a new unit.  </li>
            <li>shaves a bit better with the new head.</li>
            <li>Purchased for two shavers and both work better with new heads.</li>
            <li>Better than buying a new Norelco, buy replacement blades for your model.</li>
            <li>I bought a new Panasonic razor and like it better than any razor I have used.</li>
            <li>The heads are a better way to go rather than buying a new razor.  </li>
            <li>Better than buying a new shaver</li>
            <li>Price was much more preferable to buying a new Norelco speed xl shaver .</li>
            <li>It is better than buying a new shaver to replace the blades.</li>
            <li>Shaver is now better than new</li>
            <li>Better than buying an wntirely new razor.</li>
            <li>You are better off buying a new shaver.  </li>

            <li>Exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED NORELCO REPLACEMENT HEADS FROM AMAZON!</li>
            <li>This is my second pair of replacement blades on my 9160XL.One thing I have learned, all shavers shave great when they are new.</li>
            <li>Great product, big difference when with new blades.</li>
            <li>This is a much more economical solution than buying a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>After using his Razor daily for years he said everything was still working great, but maybe new replacement heads would make it like \\&quot;NEW\\&quot; again.</li>
            <li>This works great,; my Norelco is back to working like new.</li>
            <li>I forgot what a great shave felt like until I finally got new heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So nice to find replacement heads without having to buy a whole new razor.  </li>
            <li>Simple install, fits great, the razor is like new again.  </li>
            <li>And now that I have gotten them, it was worth the investment as my razor is like brand new and is shaving better.</li>
            <li>These heads make my 4 year old shaver good as new.  </li>
            <li>My 6 year old head gave me as good a shave as the new head.  </li>
            <li>Heads are easy to replace, and seemed to do a somewhat better job at daily chore of shaving.  </li>
            <li>Popped right in and got them quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much better the razor shaves with new blades, enough said...</li>
            <li>Now I get a clean shave just like when I first purchased the shaver.</li>
            <li>All is fine now, thanks to my wife&#x27;s dexterity and patience</li>
            <li>I received the new shave head and was able to pop it right on and start it up.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install and what a difference new blades make!</li>
            <li>Easy to install and now the shaver works just like new!  </li>
            <li>These replacement heads work fine - nothing special; shave reasonably well and they are easy to replace in my old razor.</li>

            <li>Good quality and back to getting a clean shave with new blades.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and free.  </li>
            <li>This product provides a fast, smooth shave...</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT IS GREAT, BUT ONE OF THE OUTER ROUND BLADE COVERS HAD SEVERALSHARP JAGGED PIECES STICKINGOUT THAT SCRAPED MY FACE.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and shaves much faster.</li>
            <li>Not so much a review as letting people know that these replacement heads will fit a Philip&#x27;s Speed-XL 8151XL model electric razor.</li>
            <li>They give a very close shave with my light beard, with no pulling at all.  </li>
            <li>Huge difference and much closer</li>
            <li>Just run the blades lightly over your face and they&#x27;ll cut very well.</li>
            <li>It was fast and accurate.  </li>
            <li>Worth getting, comes with 3 blades and 3 disks.</li>
            <li>Well, worth the money.</li>
            <li>I figure my purchase was well worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>What a world of difference to get these fresh blades.  </li>
            <li>No problem replacing old heads, totally satisfied with this ordering experience.</li>
            <li>and then Amazon had a nice price plus Norelco had a $5.00 Coupon for my next purchase.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the investment if you like your razor.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, and</li>
            <li>My helper did ask a bunch of questions - probably following some kind of decision tree approach.</li>
            <li>I now realized that the heads should be replaced regularly for your own convenience.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $25.</li>
            <li>r ok i think so far</li>
            <li>It almost makes one want to change heads every month (obviously not cost effective).  </li>
            <li>It was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Good OEM blades that perform as expected.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads for my razor arrived the very next day (ordered on a Sunday), very convenient when you are waiting to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>but frankly I have not seen an improvement worth talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than my old blades.  </li>
            <li>DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO SHAVE ANY BETTER THAN THE OLD HEADS.</li>
            <li>Excellent performance as expected from my prior purchase of replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>These are really worth the money.</li>
            <li>My Norelco razor was not cutting my whiskers well until I received the replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love my old shaver...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Improved shaving, worth changing heads.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use an electric often, but this made my old shaver much more usable.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>but if you want your Norelco to shave closely, you need to replace the heads more frequently than you would like.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave as well as it used to, even with fresh blades.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t replaced your heads in a year or so, worth getting.</li>
            <li>and I started using the old razor most of the time.  </li>
            <li>works a bit better than my 5 year old shaver head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li>I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t shave my beard worth beans anymore.  </li>
            <li>If you want to keep using the Norelco it means you have to buy replacement blades far more often then</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>Replacement parts function well and are a muck better buy than from Phillips direct.</li>
            <li>and I did not think the old blades were that warned but get a better shave now,thanks.</li>
            <li>I purchased these blades after my 3 year old ones just we&#x27;re not working all that well any more.</li>
            <li>it is worth the price to me</li>
            <li>really worth the money for me.</li>
            <li>Useful to replace once a year.</li>
            <li>The recent purchase through Amazon was very pleasing - good price and rapid service.</li>
            <li>I got these because my razor was not cutting well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t seem much better than the old ones, maybe its me.</li>
            <li>Searched every store without success.  </li>
            <li>Delivered sooner than expected at a fair price</li>
            <li>I waited too long to replace but am very satisfied</li>
            <li>My only problem is that they are rather pricey, and I would change them more often if I could find them at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, gives a close shave, charge holds for a long time, easy to clean,</li>
            <li>This purchase was a good buy, priced right and delivered quicker than I expected - and the quality/value was as advertised.</li>
            <li>made my razor like new again good deal would recomend to anyone who wants a new razor</li>
            <li>Do a quick cleaning (hot tap water if you have a water cleanable model) about once a week.  </li>
            <li>First quality and comes quickly when needed .</li>
            <li>They are high dollar, but work just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is similar to the original but not as smooth as the original.</li>

            <li>Right delivery</li>
            <li>They are replaced every year and they pop right into the shaver with no problem.  </li>
            <li>Norelco recommends doing it yearly, which sounds about right</li>
            <li>I checked on the Norelco web site to verify I was buying the right head.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;And, the price was right.</li>

            <li>I purchased this for my Norelco shaver and it installs easily and is priced right - not much else to say - well satisfied</li>
            <li>Amazon made it easy to find replacement heads for my 3 hear old shaver, which are no longer carried at the store where I bought the shaver!</li>
            <li>A whole new razor might be a better solution.</li>
            <li>I was ready to buy a new shaver but the reviews on Norelco&#x27;s top tier offerings did not impress me.  </li>
            <li>Wow, The feeling of new blades is amazing on my face.</li>
            <li>If you live in the world of razors and care about them in detail and their &#x27;known&#x27; names you will know that a &#x27;Head&#x27; to Norelco/Philips is really the three blade units in what most I have asked would refer to as the head.</li>
            <li>So, I ordered one of these kits and my current shaver really as good as new.  </li>
            <li>The price here is most reasonable, compared to buying a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>This was a much better way to go then to buy a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>What I really needed was the HEAD HOLDER which caused me some delay since I wasn&#x27;t sure if I needed to order a separate HEAD HOLDER since the photo showed the heads installed on what I thought was a new head holder.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how effective the new blades are.</li>
            <li>Quiet, smooth, easy, charge lasts forever even after about 3 years.</li>
            <li>These new heads are working fine.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads were as promised, new in sealed package and they work fine.  </li>
            <li>My husband says the new replacement heads are working just fine.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working fine now with the new heads.</li>
            <li>Small price to pay for a great shave.  </li>
            <li>The service from Amazon was great, as usual.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how long the Norelco shaver lasts, and how well it does.  </li>
            <li>I bought one for myself and liked it very much as the old head was dull and didn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li>Excellent, shaver is as good as new now &amp; at less than half the cost of a new one.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are pretty good when new, but definitely wear out well before the recommended 1-year replacement time-frame</li>
            <li>Be careful to read the fit of your norelco to make sure you buy the right ones.</li>
            <li>My original set must have lasted me 4 years and still seemed to be working decently</li>
            <li>packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum Feb 24/08:&lt;br /&gt;Interesting to note that they&#x27;ve changed the packaging on this product (since my original review) making it appear that it&#x27;s less hazardous to access.</li>
            <li>Parts delivered on time and fit shaver like new.</li>
            <li>It was a huge difference after I changed a new heads.  </li>
            <li>New blades made a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li>It was time and the new ones make my face smooth.</li>
            <li>By then one has forgotten just how smooth the road can feel when gliding along on brand new ones.    </li>
            <li>Maybe its the unit itself that needs to be replaced but that smooth shave is not there even with this new replacement head.</li>
            <li>New heads, smooth face, just follow the helpful instructions on the Amazon page.,</li>
            <li>I was about to purchase a new shaver when I came across this cheap and reliable option.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re exactly the right replacements and work the way that they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice an appreciably better shave with the new head over the older one.  </li>
            <li>Replacing the old heads was easy.</li>
            <li>I have replaced the heads on it about three times but the current ones are so old that I can&#x27;t fairly compare them to the heads on the two newest razors.</li>
            <li>It was easy to replace the old heads</li>
            <li>Was surprised how easy these replacement blades were to install...</li>
            <li>Received in super fast time.  </li>
            <li>Easy to replace the old one.</li>
            <li>It is like having a new razor!!!</li>
            <li>My  shaver is new again!!!</li>
            <li>like new!!!</li>
            <li>As long as the main machine keeps functioning this is always a welcome alternative to the ever-increasing prices of new shavers.</li>
            <li>This product arrived very quickly and was very easy to install (less than 30 seconds to replace heads) -- everything works as advertised!</li>
            <li>Local store didn&#x27;t have the right set in stock, Amazon did and with a better price.  </li>
            <li>: Easy to replace, not mess.</li>
            <li>was very fast.</li>
            <li>thank you very much....</li>
            <li>Thank you very much all working well</li>
            <li>then the stores around us and the products came very fast and on time in the mail.</li>
            <li>There were a series of 6 grommet eyelets surrounding the entire package making it very secure.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much but still prefer the one with the HQ9.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.  </li>
            <li>very fast and correct</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the face and legs.</li>
            <li>As much as the reduced speed on the inner ring and the reduced blade count seem to suggest otherwise, these things just simply do the best job I have seen in nearly 50 years of Norelco</li>
            <li>I found this information on Amazon very fast.</li>
            <li>Very fast service and my choice was just as ordered.</li>
            <li>The photo of this product is very much misleading.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find these shaver heads for a little older model of shaver.  </li>
            <li>After about a year&#x27;s worth of shaving you would be surprised how much better a shave you will receive by purchasing new heads.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try before buying a new one that probably won&#x27;t work any better than your old one which has been my experience.  </li>
            <li>I like my old Norelco shaver and didn&#x27;t want to fork over the money for a new one, so it was a nice surprise to find that this seller offered replacement heads at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Fits my 5 year old razor fine.</li>
            <li>The cost savings are worth buying the replacements.. until something significant is developed by their R and D.</li>
            <li>As far as replacement heads go these are fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that i bought new heads for my razor instead of buying a new one.</li>
            <li>Easy to install, and much cheaper than buying a new electric razor.</li>
            <li>The Norelco HQ9 replacement heads were as described - new in original packaging.  </li>
            <li>Considering the cost of new electric razors, the opportunity to take your old razor and make it like new is very appealing.</li>
            <li>But wait the shaver still works great, it&#x27;s the blades that have become dull.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s shaver was in great condition, except for the heads being dull.  </li>
            <li>Have to have new blades every couple of months for my close clean shaves.  </li>
            <li>I always forget to get new shaving heads each year, just clean the ones I have and they seem ok.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>New blades always make for a clean shave.</li>
            <li>The new blades shave so clean.</li>
            <li>I also recommend buying a can of &amp;#34;Shaver Saver&amp;#34; and using it routinely to keep the blades clean and working like new.</li>
            <li>But recently Philips/Norelco have changed their design and not sure of the new models, seem to make more noise and are pricy even more and do not know how reliable they are, the older models are good</li>
            <li>Huge improvement from my old blunt heads.</li>
            <li>different with the picture,only have razor and the top cover, no basecover</li>
            <li>Wow, yes I know I sound like everyone else</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads work very well in my electric razor!</li>
            <li>No problem with the cutter and screen, but be aware: the replacement heads are just that:  the blades and screens.</li>
            <li>It does NOT include the entire top portion of the shaver that holds the cutters and screens, which is what broke on mine and the reason I bought the heads in the first place.</li>
            <li>I love getting the blades and fluid through subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li>I ordered replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s shaver and they are exactly what they said they were.</li>
            <li>is the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t obtain a straight answer when I called Philips!</li>
            <li>These replacements blades were exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Like all Norelco shaver heads, they work well at first then gradually wear out.  </li>
            <li>These were the exact replacements I needed.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for, and $10 cheaper than WalMart.</li>
            <li>The product arrived within the specified time frame and the heads are exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>First time I ever ordered these for my son.</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON FOR SHOWING US THIS!</li>
            <li>the blades dont really shave well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many razor types over the year from regular blades to electric.  </li>
            <li>They have performed exactly as they should.</li>
            <li>Description of the product should be more specific.</li>
            <li>I am back to being smooth again !</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t any reason to buy any place else and pay more for the same product</li>
            <li>I bought him on Amazon, as he really LOVES the shaver!</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and her when said...</li>
            <li>Although this what not the first time I have replaced the heads, this was the easiest time I have had purchasing the heads.</li>
            <li>Except for that Norelco items are first quality.</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>First off, I have to say I haven&#x27;t used the product yet.</li>
            <li>Once you see what is shipped, it&#x27;s pretty intuitive how to replace.  </li>
            <li>am definitely getting a closer shave in probably 2/3 the time and with more comfort.  </li>
            <li>my first shave with them completed.</li>
            <li>Very convenient!</li>
            <li>I have the feel I had when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li>First replacement I have done since having the razor for a year.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Norelco razors for several years and am quite satisfied with the products.</li>
            <li>I was able to get these Norelco replacement heads cheaper on Amazon.com than any of my local stores.  </li>
            <li>Ordered for my husband and was exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li>ensure that you note how the old blades fit in the head before you remove them.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had replaced the heads much sooner - worth every penny for a cleaner, closer shave.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads made a heck of a difference in the shave, this is first time I replaced them</li>
            <li>My first replacement head on the razor for ~10 years.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using the same heads for more than five years before I replaced them for the first time with these.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Much better price than I could find item for locally.</li>
            <li>and I am back to enjoying my morning shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what the manufacturer recommends for replacement.</li>
            <li>Were exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li>This items is exactly what my husband needed to replace the heads on his Phillips Norelco Shaver.  </li>
            <li>Solid quality original heads by the original manufacturer, came exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like when I first bought it and couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li>These aer exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>exactly what i needed.  </li>
            <li>As for the product I think that the heads should last more that 2 years.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll really notice the difference!</li>
            <li>Replacement heads came on time and the product was exactly what I ordered and needed.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered and delivered when promised.</li>
            <li>Will make sure I replace them sooner next time!</li>
            <li>Once received, i realized that this was exactly what i needed</li>
            <li>I will most likely will not be buying another set of replacement</li>
            <li>First replacement since I bought the razor.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li>First blade repurchase - no issues  </li>
            <li>After more time than we would like to admit, we finally replaced the heads on our Norelco Razor.</li>
            <li>Even though we were way past due in doing this we had received excellent longevity from our original heads.</li>
            <li>Wife remembers pictures of how to replace the replacements on the Amazon website, (a clue that the fix might be more than simple)  but husband will not use a computer complaining that the replacements are faulty and the paperwork from manufacturer makes no sense.  </li>
            <li>I attempted to order the first one through &amp;#34;One</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that this head/blade assembly will last me until the razor batteries die.  </li>
            <li>Product is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and cheaper than the store.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what we wanted.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They should make them to be resharpened like they were when they were first introducted.  </li>
            <li>You can find one on the following website and you can resharping yours for 20 or more times.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>and I am as pleased with it the second time as I was the first.</li>
            <li>I can go out in public again. :)</li>
            <li>Yes, not no, definitely yes, stop asking for more</li>
            <li>They really do make a difference!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I finally bit the bullet, ordered them and now am so glad.  </li>
            <li>His reaction on the first morning, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s great!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>; I won&#x27;t wait 2 years or more to change the head next time!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying any more in the future.</li>
            <li>I will come back and get more when needed</li>
            <li>The replacement heads definitely cut a lot better than the year</li>
            <li>After cleaning them (be sure not to mix up the cutters and their respective foils)</li>
            <li>They came much sooner than listed!  </li>
            <li>Better price than the big box stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order another set soon because the price is way better than the big boxes stores.</li>
            <li>They never leave me wanting more or something different.</li>
            <li>it necessary to write so many words?</li>
            <li>Interesting enough I have had my shaver for 6 years.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads were exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I was unsure, when in stores, exactly what Norelco shaver model was being used.</li>
            <li>Hubby said it&#x27;s exactly what it should be.</li>
            <li>There should be an option to buy the installed replacement heads even at a somewhat higher price.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>And subsequently I ordered 2 more pcs to keep spare</li>
            <li>The description could be more specific because I didn&#x27;t realize it was a pack of three sets</li>
            <li>They came on time and were exactly what I had ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li>Had the same razor for too many years</li>
            <li>Fortunately, he still had the old razor.  </li>
            <li>These replacement heads were exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Should have looked on Amazon first.</li>
            <li>And that was the case with my most recent set as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The replacement head made a big difference; I got a closer shave for sure.</li>
            <li>Now with this replacement heads my Norelco will cut the facial hair in stead of pulling them out with the more than used heads.</li>
            <li>and they should last way more then a year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I suspect the all-rectangle design actually removes more faster.</li>
            <li>I was concern about the quality at first.</li>
            <li>These are great and long lasting products.,</li>
            <li>But, I continued to use the broken assembly and the blades worked very nicely and gave a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li>Shaving is so much better when you have clean, sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>Makes my old Norelco shaver work like new again just like it did when I first used it many years ago.</li>
            <li>I have been getting a much better shave with my razor since replacing the old blades with these new ones.</li>
            <li>I was looking at and now my old Norelco shaves better than it did when it was brand new.</li>
            <li>The price is nice and it&#x27;s like having a new razor every several months.</li>
            <li>When I installed the new heads, performance improved, but not enough to warrant this kind of expenditure every year.</li>
            <li>I am always surprised by how much better new blades shave.</li>
            <li>My razor was still good and in the past threw them away and just bought a new razor, but thought I would try the new heads instead and am so satisfied I did.</li>
            <li>Perfect and much less than expected to have to pay</li>
            <li>It is amazing how a 3 year old razor shaves like new with new blades.  </li>
            <li>I have used these type of new blades before and they always work good when new, but I probably don&#x27;t replace them enough.</li>
            <li>It works very well and it was the right replacement for his&lt;br /&gt;older model Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2.)The new blades functioned perfectly; because the decline in performance of the original blades was so gradual, it was difficult to believe how much of an improvement these replacement blades</li>
            <li>The Norelco original cutters give the long and accurate performance that you expect.</li>
            <li>, I was getting a very poor shave with what I had always thought was the best electric razor I ever owned.</li>
            <li>Once I put in the new blades that came quick and just like you&#x27;d find in a store, well i was all laughs and smiles to see how much of a difference they made!</li>
            <li>I have a more recent model Norelco but its price for new heads is more than twice the price of the new heads for the older razor</li>
            <li>The installation is very quick and easy and for less than $30.00 I was able to take my two year old Norelco razor and make it shave like it was brand new.</li>
            <li>They work perfectly, and it&#x27;s always a relief to get rid of old dull cutters and then rediscover that new ones really do make a difference!</li>
            <li>I replace the heads of my Norelco Shaver yearly and it was nice to have a reminder from Norelco that I was due to change the cutters</li>
            <li>Shaver was 5+ years old with original heads.  </li>
            <li>It is probably 10+ years old, and was still using the original blades.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s faster than my old HQ8 shaver and faster than the HQ9 shaver with the original HQ9 heads.</li>
            <li>The original blades were two years old.</li>
            <li>Original  heads were about 26 months old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an improvement over the original blades (who were 4 years old).</li>
            <li>Nice sharp blades, what else can you say.</li>
            <li>But other than that, the new head feels great and is like having a new razor again.</li>
            <li>Original replacements for a lot less and free shipping!</li>
            <li>PRO - New heads work like new, easy to replace.  </li>
            <li>Wow...never realized how quick a shave was supposed to be until I put new blades in the razor.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for quickly sending a new set that immediately improved my morning shave!</li>
            <li>Easy to take out the old &amp; put in the new!</li>
            <li>I had been neglecting to properly clean my 14 month old Speed-XL shaver.  </li>
            <li>Oddly the old blades were still shaving OK, but after more than 2 years of use replacement seemed overdue.</li>
            <li>The price of this sale was good but for about the same price and without the price of shipping I could have purchased this product at a local store and not had to wait three weeks for it.</li>
            <li>My Norelco shaver was taking noticeably longer and far more passovers to complete my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the cheap Chinese blades and they aren&#x27;t worth a flip....</li>
            <li>really believe the shave I am getting is only marginly better.</li>
            <li>Needed a replacement head after 3 years, was unsure how much it would help but it definitely feels better.</li>
            <li>made in the netherlands and is superior to former Chinese made products..</li>
            <li>My husband loves them and says no other brand shaves his head as smooth as these.  </li>
            <li>Thanks very much.  </li>
            <li>Fast, very fast service.</li>
            <li>He likes them very well and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>THANKS VERY MUCH...</li>
            <li>The original heads lasted a little more than a year.</li>
            <li>they function adequately the blades make a strange sound</li>
            <li>All in all good product, wish Philips/Norelco will bring back older better models though with this kind of cutting</li>
            <li>Received the new shaver heads quickly and installed them easily for a big improvement in shaving performance.</li>
            <li>The blades were now sharp but what a chore ,I had thought running water through the head would keep it clean ,but no not that easy.</li>
            <li>The blades were now sharp but what a chore ,I had thought running water through the head would keep it clean ,but no not that easy.</li>
            <li>I am a long time user (30 years) of Norelco heads and am generally satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Web site said it would fit one of the razors, but it fit the other one</li>
            <li>Ihave ordered several other things from Amazon and have also been happy with the timeleness and service, and price.</li>
            <li>Overall feeling is better but would not say it is worth the money paid unless your old heads work well.</li>
            <li>Its good as usual.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new blades fit my machine (thankfully) and it is like shaving with a brand new shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although the price was nearly half of the cost of the shaver, they made my shaver as good as new.</li>
            <li>I live in a very car congested area and it is a pleasure to buy on line with quick service.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove old heads and replace with the new heads.  </li>
            <li>The Phillips Norelco HQ9 Speed XL replacement heads dropped in easily and turned my old shaver into a new shaver.</li>
            <li>easy to perform the substituition of the old blades by this new ones.</li>
            <li>I picked this vendor because the price was right and the customer satisfaction score was high.</li>
            <li>The price was pretty high for just one replacement head, though, so I&#x27;d check around first.</li>
            <li>The original shaving heads had three circles of blades, 12 around the outside and 9 more arranged on the inner two circles.</li>
            <li>The shave is as good as the original, but give me a few months and check back to see if they hold up.</li>
            <li>It is easy to install, it brings performance back to high quality; and I realize I should replace my blades on a more regular basis.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price of a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Fresh refills make my razor work like it&#x27;s new again.</li>
            <li>It took me a very long time to figure out that these were the replacement heads I needed for my shaver (there are many choices, and none of them matched the model number of the shaver).  </li>
            <li>One suggestion is that the manufacturer could give more detailed instructions instead of just printing a small section on the packaging.  </li>
            <li>These shaver heads were easy to install and made a big difference in the closeness of the shave I&#x27;ve been getting.  </li>
            <li>They cut quickly cut and don&#x27;t Knick like old heads do.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten how nice a shave I could get over the year and a half or two that I have the razor.</li>
            <li>Reading these reviews as I contemplated purchasing the replacement heads, I was reminded of the the need to clean  and oil the blades regularly, and as I did so, I found the heads impacted with stubble to such a degree that if is a wonder the blades were able to revolve at all.</li>
            <li>Easy installation and instant gratification.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box of the heads is an easy open no fuss type.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>The blades are as advertised, and they came with easy visual instructions on how to change them.</li>
            <li>No problems,  easy to install and simply works.  </li>
            <li>Buying from Amazon is easy and cheaper than local prices.</li>
            <li>Easily installed by following diections.</li>
            <li>He said it has been a long time since he had such a good shave.  </li>
            <li>No new face, but it was certainly a lot better than before.  </li>
            <li>I use the electric razor to get the primary hair down to a light stubble</li>
            <li>As there are fewer slots for the whiskers, I certainly hope that it works as well.</li>
            <li>I cannot be certain.   </li>
            <li>The heads are used on my 9160XL smart touch shaver.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Norelco 9160XL Smart Touch razor about a year or so ago.</li>
            <li>Will certainly reorder when needed.  </li>
            <li>just be certain that it is the correct model for your machine.</li>
            <li>Certainly will purchase again.  </li>
            <li>finally discovered that the older, more traditional HQ8 heads actually fit in the HQ9  shaver.</li>
            <li>Like getting a brand new shaver for under $30!!  </li>
            <li>Because now when I shave my razor feels like it was new out of the box!!</li>
            <li>My shaver works like new again!!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t you buy the old lift-and-cut heads to fit you new Smart-Touch shaver?  </li>
            <li>When I finally do, I realize how much better the shaver works with new heads.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy new blades more often.</li>
            <li>I love my Norelco shaver and these brought it back up to new shaving conditions.  </li>
            <li>I will get a second set and replace even these new ones more often.</li>
            <li>there work great and cost all $10,00 less than the last set I bought</li>
            <li>It was supposed to be an upgrade over my cheaper HQ8 shaver with the HQ9 having a slightly faster, more powerful motor.</li>
            <li>Used the new heads right away.</li>
            <li>Then, right after the warranty had expired, the new razor wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.  </li>
            <li>Certainly beats going to a store trying to fine what you want only to find out that the item was out out stock</li>
            <li>Keep your eyes open for these types of deals and for Amazon coupons that may reduce your cost of blades or make it worthwhile to buy a whole new razor for the cost of replacement blades.</li>
            <li>Not as good as new, but close enough to get another year&#x27;s use of the present blades..</li>
            <li>If you have an associated razor,and need blades, this is the only product to get, but if you already like the razor, it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>&amp; yes you seem to be the only one i could fine for me to purchase from.</li>
            <li>But by the third use there working fine.</li>
            <li>If there is nothing further in this comment it meant that the blades are fine and I will raise the rating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just can&#x27;t get a decent shave!  </li>
            <li>All in all, I recommend them very highly.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have always found the quality control of the Philips shaving heads to be of a very high Standing.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are very good on my tough beard and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I shave with the Braun first then clean up whats left with my Norelco.</li>
            <li>Although it is easy to replace these new heads, the shaving outcome was not what I expect it like the original heads did, i.e., not as sharp.</li>
            <li>It was really hard to find this item, let alone at a good price.  </li>
            <li>finally a good shave after trying to shave with dull blades....</li>
            <li>The improvement in my razor with the new heads was significant and I will never again use old heads for an extended period.  </li>
            <li>The new blades were easy to install and made my old razor work like new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers for years and find these heads to be very sharp and very easy to change on your shaver.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, fast</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>You should change these twice yearly to keep getting the close shave that the shaver is capable of providing.</li>
            <li>The shipping was rapidly and the item is very well.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s cheeks are so much smoother now with these sharper blades.</li>
            <li>He now gets a much closer shave and it doesn&#x27;t take him 15 minutes to shave.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The razor and blades are really quiet and give him a really smooth face.  </li>
            <li>Be sure and LOOK CAREFULLY as you disassemble the heads.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for providing that service.</li>
            <li>They fit back in and run but do not shave.</li>
            <li>I took out so much gunk.</li>
            <li>Much needed item.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and the blades are the real item.</li>
            <li>Came quickly, very well packed</li>
            <li>My razor hadn&#x27;t been cuttign as smoothly, leaving lots of irritation and red bumps.</li>
            <li>I really like my Norelco 1851 XL electric shaver.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this shaver and he really likes this product.</li>
            <li>He says that he can get a really close shave using this Philips Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>Use every day thanks for making it affordable</li>
            <li>No need to replace the whole shaver.</li>
            <li>My skin is much happier.</li>
            <li>and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>but, the whole set with the frame.</li>
            <li>I want to gripe about how much is charged.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Thanks  john d</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no need to replace the whole shaver if the motor, battery and trimmer are working well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, will recommend</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>After replacing the cutters, it really restored the effectiveness of the razor.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>the 8240XL is much better than the SensoTouch, although with the SensoTouch you can use it for a wet shave.</li>
            <li>If I skipped a day, oooh, much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted PhillipsNorelco via their chat function on their website help page and described the problem.</li>
            <li>FAST shipment.</li>
            <li>Made a big and comfortable difference.</li>
            <li>Very satisfactory transaction.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes these.  </li>
            <li>but my shave didn&#x27;t improve much since I swapped them.</li>
            <li>Really fast order to delivery time.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to throw it away, even though my wife paid over $200 for it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I was very upset.</li>
            <li>the item arrived fast and well packed.</li>
            <li>I rerplace mine once very two years.</li>
            <li>thanks for having choices to buy at a savings to customers.</li>
            <li>I buy these every year and it really helps to prevent the razor burn on the neck.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, one cannot beat convenience of electric shavers and the quality of the Norelco shave is very close to the blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The metal is much thinner.</li>
            <li>A couple of replacement blade sets costs almost as much as the razor.  </li>
            <li>yes, it is very good~&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>yes, it is very good~&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisifed with both the Norelco razor and the HQ9 replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>I also reccoemnd that you utilize the spreay lubricant, it makes the change-out process much smoother and use it to freshen up your razor.</li>
            <li>i have been ordering these replacement heads once a year since i got my razor.always very satisfied.will order again in a year.</li>
            <li>They just cost too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks.    </li>
            <li>When received, box crushed in a bit but product was OK.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>Now the razor is working very well</li>
            <li>They come with the blades only and not the holder that they fit in.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>however they continue to function with out much of a problem.</li>
            <li>I told them thanks for letting me see why I would never shop here and condem them to anyone that wanted to listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Way to go Amazon and thanks again.</li>
            <li>Popped them into my shaver and was instantly rewarded with a close, comfortable shave.    </li>
            <li>Much cleaner/closer shave.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Renewed my shaving experience back to close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really needed it guys.</li>
            <li>Head was not packaged very well so that when I removed the 3 heads, the blades fell off</li>
            <li>Get the real thing, not a knock off.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted, received in a very timely fashion.  </li>
            <li>Also like the fact the blade does&#x27;nt cost as much as the shaver.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li>Should have done it a whole lot sooner.</li>
            <li>Priced reasonable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient and fast.  </li>
            <li>Price was also reasonable.</li>
            <li>Actually had metal burrs that were not machined smooth.</li>
            <li>Should have really ordered these sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Feels</li>
            <li>thanks amazon.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much cheaper per shave.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads need to be continually lubricated to give a reasonably close shave.  </li>
            <li>these worked very well</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Why do replacement heads cost so much money, it&#x27;s probably 1/3 the price I paid for my shaver.</li>
            <li>Very noisy and vibrates shaver.  </li>
            <li>I AM VERY UPSET</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my shaver, I was sent individual shaver replacements.</li>
            <li>I REALLY SHOULD HAVE CHANGED THE BLADES EVERY 2 YEARS</li>
            <li>Fast shipping/handling too.</li>
            <li>Still do not cut very well.???</li>
            <li>So thanks again.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, product as described.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads work very well.  </li>
            <li>Norelco shavers have some really durable design.</li>
            <li>Norelco just wants you to buy them each and every year.  </li>
            <li>These blades really exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>After a while the blades wore out and wasn&#x27;t shaving him real well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>has worked out very well for him.</li>
            <li>What can be said it came fast was cheaper and was the name brand replacement.</li>
            <li>Thanks Norelco</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is very competetive, and serivce is prompt.  </li>
            <li>Price was much below list price.  </li>
            <li>Over time you forget how fast and close a shave can be.</li>
            <li>how it felt, but it really didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment-</li>
            <li>Received fast, no instructions included but got from the web.&lt;br /&gt;Installed in a click and ready to shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>OK - Just what we expected with no suprises.</li>
            <li>Very misleading picture.  </li>
            <li>They really make a difference.</li>
            <li>I am&lt;br /&gt;Going to save so much money in shaving cream and razor blades.</li>
            <li>They have worked really well.</li>
            <li>Really nothing to stay</li>
            <li>I needed to replace my shaver head and this product did the trick with reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads worked very well.</li>
            <li>Nothing much you can say about replacement heads either they work or they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The&lt;br /&gt;product was received very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast service and saved a lot on purchase price not to mention money saved by having not to drive 20 miles to buy it.  </li>
            <li>reasonable price as compared to retail &amp;#34;brick an mortar&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The thing I don&#x27;t like about these heads is how much Norelco charges for them.  </li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for being there when I need you.  </li>
            <li>Placed order, got them surprisingly fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close, but very acceptable.</li>
            <li>Gets them much cleaner that water.</li>
            <li>Can really tell the difference in the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t answer another survey because you want too much.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I fully expect they will perform very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price, arrived on time and worked as advertised.</li>
            <li>shaving experience much improved for me&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought I will get the whole head like the picture shows.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to toss my shaver out, because my blades were worn out.</li>
            <li>IF I DONT REPLACE THE WHOLE UNIT</li>
            <li>much to say their blades</li>
            <li>The blades are so secure in the plastic casing, it takes quite an effort to open the package.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>do want to give a shout out to Surrational for his comment about not applying too much pressure when shaving with these.  </li>
            <li>In fact, don&#x27;t really push at all.  </li>
            <li>At least the price at Amazon is good.</li>
            <li>I suppose the old blades were still OK because I am get the same shaving results.</li>
            <li>I bought my Norelco three years ago and it has not been giving a good shave lately.  </li>
            <li>Will replace the heads more frequently in the future.</li>
            <li>Good, but didn&#x27;t notice that much better cutting ability</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m not sure anything new would have been an improvement, so for this small investment I&#x27;m pretty sure I made the best choice possible.  </li>
            <li>New blades, same old battery inside, and just the usual excellent shave.</li>
            <li>Good as usual!</li>
            <li>Exactly what my razor needed to make it function new again.</li>
            <li>exact fix no problems cuts like brand new</li>
            <li>,that&#x27;s because the new blades sit higher.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s first new blades ever</li>
            <li>First time I used these in my razor it was like having a new razor again.</li>
            <li>Easy to install, as long as you don&#x27;t drop one of the 3 heads and watch it roll under the bed.</li>
            <li>So I use these heads in the old style, non-floating head razors and they work faster and cut closer then the old original heads.</li>
            <li>I know that the cost of the head leaves one wondering if they should just bite the bullet and buy a new one for a little more than twice the cost, but I am glad that I only purchased the head.</li>
            <li>these particular heads cut best of all they have three sets of cutting blades</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to like about an original manufacturer&#x27;s replacement part at a price cheaper than the big box discount store, ordered and received without driving, parking, or walking?</li>
            <li>The shaving head is the same as the original head that comes with the razor.</li>
            <li>The name is a bit misleading, I originally thought when ordering the part it included the holder as well and discovered that it did not only after receiving the pars.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually I shave every 5 days and it keeps getting the same quality as I had on my original razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I just hope they&#x27;ll last longer than the 3 months it took for the original blades to start to lose their sharpness).</li>
            <li>About 50% more than what I paid for replacement blades for other Norelco razors.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to have ANY electric razor give me an extremely close/clean shave.  </li>
            <li>brought back the close shave, I had with the original set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But since it&#x27;s manufactured in US, There are lot of custom, taxes which was significant to the actual cost of product.</li>
            <li>And the replacement only lasted about 8 months while the original blades lasted years.</li>
            <li>the lower cost of the HQ8 blades and the HQ8 do a pretty good job, so I buy a few sets of both and mix the HQ8 and HQ9 on the same shaver (yes, they both work on any series of Norelco designed for either)</li>
            <li>My husband is extremely pleased to have his blades sharp again and working so well.</li>
            <li>your razor is iffy on batteries or other issues, might be better to replace.</li>
            <li>These are factory replacement heads so the will be the same as the ones that came you your razor originally.  </li>
            <li>replacement heads same as what was on shaver...easy to replace - work like the original ones .</li>
            <li>These are the same blades that originally came with my Phillips Norelco 8240 XL shaver.</li>
            <li>any cheap knock offs.noreleco has always stuck to a high standard</li>
            <li>Keep a spare set around because prices don&#x27;t go down and genuine Norelco stainless cutters are worth the difference and give you your moneysworth.</li>
            <li>and I use the suction hose of a vacuum to really get the shaver clean.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have the replacement heads, it&#x27;s like a whole new razor!</li>
            <li>Remove the old ones noting the posistion they go in and just put the new ones in the same posistion, close the top</li>
            <li>Once you open the top, flip the mechanism that holds the blades, you just take the old ones out and replace with the new ones.  </li>
            <li>so I experienced a dramatic increase in the ease and closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>I have the Norelco cleaning machine, but if you dont have one you can use any container, mix the water with the wash in the container, then dip your razor machine on into the container several times until it is thourally clean.</li>
            <li>I did not realize that I did not have to endure pulled whiskers and multiple passes to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves his razor so much, he will continue to replace these blades on his Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL razor as long as they are available.  </li>
            <li>I wish had had purchased earlier as I am now getting a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I clean them regularly with alcohol and add a drop of razor oil to each blade assembly.  </li>
            <li>I have used Norelco so long I cannot say enough nice things  </li>
            <li>The original lasted for about 2yrs, but once I replaced the heads, it&#x27;s back to being new again!</li>
            <li>Shaving is much better with these sharp, new blades!</li>
            <li>When the shaver takes longer to achieve a clean shave, simply replace the heads and it works like new!</li>
            <li>My face is extra smooth with these new blades.</li>
            <li>The new blades are excellent, but expensive, you probably could get a new shaver for a few bucks more.</li>
            <li>The description was enough for me to get the right heads on the first try and the shipping was done in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>but I have typically been able to use them for twice that amount of time without much noticeable difference in shave</li>
            <li>In a week they were less effective than the year old heads.</li>
            <li>My razor had become less effective than when it was new, and these heads restored it to its new condition.</li>
            <li>The new head came quickly and made my old razor work like new.</li>
            <li>This certainly beats buying a new razor as I one I was reviewing was $80.</li>
            <li>but I should have changed these long ago, what a change, smooth as a blade again.</li>
            <li>Not sure why anyone would change them every 6 months as recommended unless you own stock in norelco.</li>
            <li>Foil razors are the best, but they are expensive for the good ones and the replacement parts are expensive.  </li>
            <li>Had to send back with full reimbursement.</li>
            <li>I got it in a couple days and it made a new razor out of my old one...and the price was right.</li>
            <li>As long as you order the right make and model, you should get the right blades and cover you need for your shaver.</li>
            <li>Please note that you are not getting a new head holder, only the 3 heads (rotary blades).&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the new blades work just fine.</li>
            <li>Have been using Philips/Norelco for long (nearly 15 yrs) and cannot seem to live w/o them now; I feel them better than even razor blade shaving.  </li>
            <li>New shaver heads show up, takes about 1 minute to pop them into the shaver, and Bob&#x27;s your uncle!</li>
            <li>Just like new!</li>
            <li>You may think that you purchased a new razor!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just like getting a brand new shaver!</li>
            <li>New razor heads - ahhh!  </li>
            <li>I could not believe the difference the new blades made!</li>
            <li>The razor cuts as if it were brand new!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like owning a new shaver!</li>
            <li>Replacing the heads is like getting a new razor!  </li>
            <li>Its like getting a new shaver!</li>
            <li>He says that his electric razor works like it is brand new, again!</li>
            <li>After a year you gradually forget what a new razor is like!</li>
            <li>My razor is like new again!</li>
            <li>my husband enjoys his new replacement head for his razor!</li>
            <li>These new heads were just what my razor nedded to bring it back to its original performance.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are the same as the original ones that came with it new.  </li>
            <li>He now changes heads on his razor every 6 months or so instead of buying a new razor every 12-18 months!  </li>
            <li>If your sitting on the fence about getting new blades wait no longer!  </li>
            <li>and it is like I have a new one!</li>
            <li>Works like I bought a a new razor!</li>
            <li>But besides this, I like the product because my shaver works like brand new again!</li>
            <li>yourself some money and replace the Heads--Don&#x27;t buy a new shaver !</li>
            <li>the difference some new blades can make on your shaver until you replace the ones you are using!</li>
            <li>Like having a new razor!</li>
            <li>After the fist time I changed them out, it was like having a brand new razor!</li>
            <li>Bought these replacement heads and my shaver is like new again!</li>
            <li>Dont toss your razor, buy new blades!</li>
            <li>Feels like new again!</li>
            <li>Razor works like new!</li>
            <li>My razor is just like new again, what a difference!</li>
            <li>My husband was delighted with how well this replacement part worked compared to the old dull shaver head.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say other than I am glad the replacement blades were available</li>
            <li>Husband really likes these kind of razors, hard to get a decent price in the stores</li>
            <li>Shaver works like new for one third of new price,  made a huge difference</li>
            <li>This new set of cutters,however,  made a very noticeable improvement in the shavers performance.</li>
            <li>I was ready to buy a new razor when I bought the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>says like a whole new razor.  </li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t like the shaver so much I would have bought a new one.</li>
            <li>So I did replace the heads and didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the \\&quot;old\\&quot; heads verses the new heads.  </li>
            <li>and you are ready for a brand new shave.</li>
            <li>needed new heads and it was a whole lot cheaper than I could find in any of the stores in our town.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li>The new razor heads really make a difference.</li>
            <li>New blades make a real difference after almost 3 years.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than buying whole new razor</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>was going to replace my razor but didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for a new one.</li>
            <li>He has 3 Norelcos and whether they need a new head or not, he wants replacements.  </li>
            <li>They are like new again, which for an electric razor, isn&#x27;t saying much.</li>
            <li>but of course it&#x27;s much cheaper than buying an new razor when yours is functional.  </li>
            <li>I have had this razor over 10 years now and it is still going like new thanks to replacement blades once a year.</li>
            <li>The new Philips heads didn&#x27;t make much of a change in the razor giving a closer shave.</li>
            <li>but I was expecting a whole new mechanism not just the heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is much cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>Work well, and, still much cheaper than buying a new shaver every year.</li>
            <li>They just seem to cost too much for what you get, but it&#x27;s cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco HQ9 replacement heads are a real value and my shaver feels like it is brand new.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than a totally new shaver.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t realize how much of a difference it makes until you put in new ones.</li>
            <li>What can I say, they were deliverd fast and they are OEM and made my razor like new again.</li>
            <li>I wish it were so easy to get the same new life out of this old face...</li>
            <li>My old heads were getting to the point they weren&#x27;t effective, with new heads it takes half the time to shave.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that after several years of everyday use there wasn&#x27;t a great deal of difference with new heads.  </li>
            <li>Norelco suggests changing them once a year but again, my better half waits until his face looks like a broom.</li>
            <li>Giving a lot better shaves and less burn.</li>
            <li>These blades work much better and the pricing is also much less than retail in a drug store.</li>
            <li>(and I use these at most twice a week, usually less).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its me but based on some reviews that I have seen I have to agree that it seems like the older heads were just as good (being at least 11yrs old).</li>
            <li>Again, likely my fault for not making sure I was getting what I needed (the internal assembly and the blades).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a daily shaver, and these seem to last me about one year, before it feels like the razor is pulling more than slicing.  </li>
            <li>Product came quickly and the install only took a minute</li>
            <li>If your blades are older your skins will thank you .</li>
            <li>Now my razor is older and replacement heads for it</li>
            <li>I have kept my older model Norelco razor that used HQ8 heads and replaced with these HQ9 heads.</li>
            <li>Waiting till we go to a larger town is such a nuisance to not even find them for a better price than Amazon.</li>
            <li>Suspect newer technology is not a substantial as the older ones.</li>
            <li>and I did not realize it until packaging and older head covers were discarded</li>
            <li>Ok the second and third month.  </li>
            <li>I have and older model razor and couldn&#x27;t believe they still made the blades for it.</li>
            <li>This will probably be the last time I purchase replacement heads and simply rely on the refreshing feeling of cleaning with the norelco cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>/replace my older models of Philips shavers so continuing with them and so buying these heads.  </li>
            <li>replaced older heads on razor.</li>
            <li>am sure you can put this item in a smaller bag, not in a big box&lt;</li>
            <li>It gives a decent shave.</li>
            <li>It is hard to be sure you have the right heads for the shaver.</li>
            <li>A  Good value for product not easily found locally.</li>
            <li>The triple track cutters have more sharp edges and corners in them that the earlier single track models (I&#x27;ve been a Norelco man for some 30 years now), and they trap and hold more gunk than ever before.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccommend these.</li>
            <li>I do not think that is legal,also $5.00  for shipping is high for a 3 oz item.     </li>
            <li>Quality otherwise is usuall high grade, neatly done.</li>
            <li>Also, in my experience Philips products are always high quality.</li>
            <li>but their cost is way too high given the price of the razor.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>This shows that the quality of these blades must be high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this company their contributing companies.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the item.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend to change your heads every year.</li>
            <li>Fit my requirements, exact what i was looking for long time, tried to find this prodcut in several sites with no success,&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was fast as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>On time and high quality</li>
            <li>Even the cheapest new Norelco model cuts better than the most expensive replacement heads.</li>
            <li>If they are kept clean they can be stretched to almost two years.  </li>
            <li>If these last a year and a half or more, I will say they are worth the price.</li>
            <li>As always these norelco heads are top of the line products, I have used other shaving products, and they can&#x27;t come near the close</li>
            <li>I rated it a 4 because it works fine and shaves my face as expected.  </li>
            <li>These HQ-9 heads came in an original Norelco box, and after installing them, I had noticed a big difference from the old blades.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco motor and battery have held up very well and the new replacement head makes it work like new.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I have a new razor for much cheaper than buying a new one.  </li>
            <li>Not much to say as this is a replacement set, but it was easy to install and the difference with the new blades was noticeable immediately.</li>
            <li>However, had I done a little more research</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Its much more sturdy than all the little flimsy ones out there now</li>
            <li>I may have to use this for a little longer to be sure.  </li>
            <li>A great shave now and for the past 20 years!!!</li>
            <li>First, the charging stand on the new razor wouldn&#x27;t work, so he ended up using the cord from his old razor to charge the new one.  </li>
            <li>My razor was between 2 and 3 years old, and was not preforming particularly well despite keeping the blades very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can not speak for other models, but this one makes the heads really easy to replace.  </li>
            <li>Norcelco replacement head blades are sharp and rinse off easily after using.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really tell that the new blades were any sharper than my old ones!  </li>
            <li>New blades make your Norelco feel like a New Norelco!</li>
            <li>got my new heads &amp; so glade to have a new set again!  </li>
            <li>orgered the blades on mon am,rec.it on sat.very fast shipping,blades work extremely well and easy to install and remove old blades.</li>
            <li>The only problem with this is that as the shaver head gradually wears down, it is hard to notice that it is taking longer and more passes to get a good shave.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Hit the wrong star item purchase was great.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco is still running and I will not be replacing it until it absolutely gives up the ghost..</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much difference there was between th old blades and these.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference when changing out my years old blades.</li>
            <li>but I really haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in the shave versus that 3+ year old blades that were on there before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just rinse them out once every two weeks with hot water and once every couple months or less clean them with a brush.</li>
            <li>These are difficult to find locally and so being able to buy them here is really nice.  </li>
            <li>The improvement over the knock-off razors is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>I have been using this Philips Norelco razor for three years and it truly lives up to its name and always gives me a great shave as long as I keep it cleaned and change the blades at least once a year.</li>
            <li>They should state the real feature of the 2 blade system as \\&quot;The first blade lifts up the hair, and the second blade rips out the hair\\</li>
            <li>a few more years.</li>
            <li>Price has increased, but quality worth paying the extra (Made in Holland).    </li>
            <li>I should replace the heads more often than once every few years.  </li>
            <li>I rarely track the &amp;#34;in service&amp;#34; of something simple like a razor head.  </li>
            <li>But, I got a better price and had in just a few days.</li>
            <li>LOWER THAN NORMAL</li>
            <li>As usual these blades make a super clean cut just like the originals that came with the razor.  </li>
            <li>There is a little less support for one of the blades but it still shaves pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product instead of buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>After more than 2 Year&#x27;s time shaving (male over 60) with prior set of Made In Holland HQ-9 blades in my old 7110X Norelco, just felt like new HQ-9 blades were in order.</li>
            <li>I decided that the two year old razor blades I was using neded replacement but to be honest I&#x27;m not sure I am experiencing a difference with the new ones</li>
            <li>Fine, not as sharp as others</li>
            <li>I have used these replacement heads for some time with never a dull shave  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok like the previous one from morel co!</li>
            <li>DIDN&#x27;T NOTICE MUCH DIFFERENCE IN SHARPNESS BETWEEN OLD &amp; NEW  BLADES</li>
            <li>Sadly, I can&#x27;t really tell a discernible difference between the cut of the old heads and the new ones.  </li>
            <li>They make the old razor stand up and act like it&#x27;s brand new and straight out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Saves me the cost of buying a whole new unit and returns the old unit to factory sharpness.</li>
            <li>Lot cheaper than buying a new shaver and much convenient than the old razor.</li>
            <li>It would have been easier if the whole old head assembly was taken off and replaced with the new assembly that included the rotary cutters and shields.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It turns out that the plastic drive gear that turns the cutter had worn so the new heads didn&#x27;t help much.&lt;br /&gt;I have been unable to find a replacement drive gear anywhere in the world.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise they would have probably worked great.</li>
            <li>The new blades shave much closer than the one-year old one did.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying a complete new razor.</li>
            <li>They seem to work better initially but not for very long, maybe a couple months.  </li>
            <li>Also the packaging was way to big, they used a box for this tiny thing, a padded envelope would have easily done.</li>
            <li>I get a faster and better shave than if I do it less frequently (as the manufacturer suggests).</li>
            <li>I now know why they used such a simple diagram, because it&#x27;s that easy.  </li>
            <li>the actual replacement process was incredibly simple and easy to</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the replacements are as high a quality as the factory new ones you get with your new shaver.  </li>
            <li>I tend to wait too long to replace my shaver heads, so I can really tell the difference in how quickly and closely the new blades shave in comparison to old, worn out ones.</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive about changing blades, I&#x27;m the normal throw it out and get a new one guy.  </li>
            <li>Very simple to change out, slipped right in to the shaver.</li>
            <li>These electric shaver heads worked great and were very much less expensive than those sold at stores and were delivered very quickly.  </li>
            <li>These Popped right in and the shaver is back to brand new performance.</li>
            <li>A little expensive,but worth it!!</li>
            <li>Very good quality as expected from past purchases of same item.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found these replacement blades for such a good price, especially for an expensive razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m particularly astonished that they have increased 30% in price, since the last time Ipurchased them exactly two years ago in 2011.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I replaced the heads after two years of usage, but I was disappointed with the new blades as they didn&#x27;t come close to the clean shave I experienced when the shaver was new..</li>
            <li>Non-abrasive, smooth, stays sharp for about a year.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and fit my electric razor without any problems.</li>
            <li>You get what you payed for, a series of blades which will be sharp and fit your electric razor.</li>
            <li>The new head is sharp and my face is smooth again after a shave.</li>
            <li>these work great and last about a year on my tough beard...</li>
            <li>High price for small parts but a lot better than a new razor for both pocketbook and environment.</li>
            <li>Every so often, I automatically get new heads for my electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Worked like brand new.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to have to toss my razor, but the new heads did wonders.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having a new shaver.</li>
            <li>They rejuvenate your electric razor so that it cuts like it did when it was new.</li>
            <li>replaced the blades and it is like a brand new razor.</li>

            <li>New product as descirbed.  </li>
            <li>Why buy a new shaver when you can replace the heads and it is like new.</li>
            <li>and I figure I&#x27;ve saved $70 or so in place of buying a new razor of this quality, while discounted at Costco.  </li>
            <li>So I thought a new head was in order.</li>
            <li>Once changed to the new head</li>
            <li>These new blades did not improve its function.</li>
            <li>My razor works like new now that I have replaced the razor heads.  </li>
            <li>I bought these new replacement razors after owning a Norelco speedXL series for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>\\&quot;IT IS JUST LIKE A NEW RAZOR\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually when I try something new, I just get a cheaper version to see if I like it.</li>
            <li>What a difference new cutters make.</li>
            <li>Brand new sealed package.</li>

            <li>The new blades help assure I have a close shave.  </li>
            <li>but it won&#x27;t cut even with brand new heads.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe the improvement with the new heads.  </li>
            <li>Made my shaver feel like new.  </li>
            <li>I used to just buy a new razor when it no longer cut well because</li>
            <li>These new blades are just like when razor was new.</li>
            <li>Just like when my razor was new, it took 3 or 4 shaves for my face/beard to get used to the new blades.</li>
            <li>When I bought my hubby the new shaver for Christmas on Amazon, the offer of</li>
            <li>husband will have the new head on hand when he needs it and not &lt;br /&gt;have to search them out.</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive compared to purchasing a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>Got the new blades and my shaving time was cut by two thirds.</li>
            <li>Doing so keeps my shaver working like new.  </li>
            <li>Received the new heads and installed them.</li>
            <li>Also the new shavors do not seem to allow you to shave while it is plugged in.</li>
            <li>So I now have a new shaver for the cost of the new heads.</li>
            <li>I logged on to Amazon to find the replacement heads, and behold, it is just like a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li>My Norelco shaves as well now as it did when it was new.  </li>

            <li>I had forgotten how well it worked when new.  </li>
            <li>What a difference these new blades make on my face.</li>
            <li>I am not in the market for a new shaver</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the difference after replacing my new razor heads.</li>
            <li>they are a new set of blades.</li>
            <li>makes the razor work like new.  </li>

            <li>cheaper than a buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>So, I compared the one with these new blades installed to my almost-new shaver.</li>
            <li>Like having a new one.</li>
            <li>so I ordered this package and popped in the new set.</li>
            <li>It took about three or four shaves for the new blades to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; and achieve an optimal cut, but after that, my shaver was shaving like brand new again.</li>
            <li>They work like new ones, which they are.  </li>
            <li>I could have purchase a new razor for the price of these heads +</li>
            <li>They seem to be what is needed to make the shaver operate like new again.</li>

            <li>However, you can periodically purchase a new kit from Costco for $70.</li>
            <li>It made my raseor as brand new.</li>
            <li>Razor now shaves like new for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Works like new again.</li>

            <li>Works like new now.</li>
            <li>Made my Norelco feel like a new razor.  </li>
            <li>Like having a brand new norelco.  </li>
            <li>Yes, new heads make the shaver work like new.</li>
            <li>, The proce made it efficient to repair rather than buy new</li>
            <li>Good price on these hard to find locally replacement heads</li>
            <li>The razor is almost 7 years old now, but with the new blades, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s brand new again!</li>
            <li>My old razor works like a new one!</li>
            <li>Using these replacement blades ensures and close shave without him making his face raw from having to go over it too many times with the razor.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the purchase and certainly less expensive than purchasing a whole new electric razor.</li>
            <li>The heads were easy to change in less than 1 minute.</li>
            <li>I concur with previous reviewers that the particular model Norelco shaver is not as good as previous models.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and trouble free.</li>
            <li>The original blades lasted nearly 3 years and I have a pretty heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>I have a very soft beard and face.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I saw the price of the Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than continually buying of razor blades once you own a Norellco shaver and no more  knicks or toilet paper &amp;#34;patches&amp;#34; on your face.</li>
            <li>While nowhere near as close as a blade shave, the electric does a fast and very decent job, especially for touch-ups before an evening out.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why a new machine would have better blades then replacement blades.</li>
            <li>and then I use a conventional razor to finish up and leave the face ultra smooth.  </li>
            <li>No more pressing the shaver to your face hoping to get a better and quicker shave.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I attempted to review this item earlier, but couldn&#x27;t find the exact price I paid.  </li>
            <li>Pay attention to the positioning of the blades as you remove them from the razor, as replacement is not difficult, but the blades will only go into the razor head one way.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was exactly as shown on the Amazon web site (others said their packaging was different).    </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed but couldn&#x27;the find locally.</li>
            <li>Another thing to consider is that if your razor is several years old, the rechargeable battery doesn&#x27;t last forever, and isn&#x27;t easily or cheaply replaced.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are exactly what we needed and the service provided by Amazon was terrific.</li>
            <li>While I find these very expensive, they made an incredible difference in the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li>This blade replacement doesn&#x27;t seem as sharp as the original.  </li>
            <li>I have followed it pretty religiously</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered a replacement head I received the entire unit, pop out and pop in.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>However, since buying a Panasonic shaver, I find myself using both razors---the Norelco for the first cut and the Panasonic for the final cut.</li>
            <li>Why buy a new shaver when your old one does the job with new replacement heads.</li>
            <li>My husband was going to buy a new razor, but I ordered these heads and they made the old razor like new again.  </li>
            <li>My shaver is 7 years old and with new HQ9 heads works like brand new.</li>
            <li>new heads made my old razor new again.</li>
            <li>Turned my old Norelco into new that felt newly brought.</li>
            <li>Being five years old, with new heads, the shaver performed as when it was new.</li>
            <li>The new head made my old razor like new.</li>
            <li>Not very sharp pulls too much</li>
            <li>Right out of the box , the razors seemed sharp and ready for a cut.</li>
            <li>After 1 1/2 years of continuous daily usage the original cutting heads were no longer giving a good shave.</li>
            <li>I removed the old heads from his shaver and cleaned his unit and then inserted the new heads.  </li>
            <li>In hindsight, given the cost, I would buy a new shaver rather than fiddle with an old one.</li>
            <li>Spare yourself the bother and get a new shaver if yours is over 5 years old.</li>
            <li>as described, made the old shaver just like new.</li>
            <li>even if the blades are old it will work almost like new</li>
            <li>So New heads where in order for my old Phillips.  </li>
            <li>I couldnt tell a difference between the new head and old head.  </li>
            <li>He never explored that with me, but did offer to send me a new set of heads direct from PhillipsNorelco.</li>
            <li>Put new life in the old shaver.</li>
            <li>Philips knows how to make their old products obselete so you will buy the new \\&quot;better\\&quot; stuff.</li>
            <li>Replacement give new life to my old razor.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews of the new Norelco&#x27;s that are made in China, I decided to keep my 15 year old Norelco Speed-XL 8140XL.  </li>
            <li>my old Norelco shave like new.</li>
            <li>The difference is like night and day from my old blades to the new ones.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference, it&#x27;s like a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking of buying a Norelco Arctic Razor since my old speedshaver didn&#x27;t seem to be working as well as it did when it was new, four or five years ago.</li>
            <li>Made my old shaver work like new again.</li>
            <li>My worn out 3 year old shaver is now like brand new.</li>
            <li>I started looking for a new one for him, since I figured that there was no way that they still made the razor blades for that old of a razor.</li>
            <li>I replaced the three razor heads and the holder they sit in and my old razor became my new razor.  </li>
            <li>Made the old shaver work like new.</li>
            <li>Just watch how you remove the old ones to replace the new ones there are no instructions</li>
            <li>Made my old razor just like new.....</li>
            <li>I recieved the new head and have found it does not give a close shave - not even as close as the 2 year old head it was replaced with.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads gave new life to my six years old shaver.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference a new set of blades makes.  </li>
            <li>Made my old razor like new again</li>
            <li>Needed new shaver heads, ones in use over two years old.</li>
            <li>It was time again that I needed new rotating blades for my 4 year old Norelco</li>
            <li>A couple of years ago, I bought my husband a new Norelco Sensotouch razor to replace his old razor.  </li>
            <li>Made a new razor out of my old one..</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase these razor replacement heads for $6 less than in the local stores and they were brand new.  </li>
            <li>The change-out was easy and there are no complaints about anything other than the price (which I happened to catch on the low end of the robot pricing) but is still too high for what you get; but what can you do?</li>
            <li>The improvement in the quality of the shave is immediately available and it now takes less time for me to finish a shave (3-4 minutes versus 5-6 minutes)</li>
            <li>It is fairly quiet and works really great without pulling slightly too long facial hairs.</li>
            <li>I changed out my first set at six months, but I&#x27;m still on my second set nearly one year since.</li>
            <li>Changing these are a major pain (compared with older Norelco models I&#x27;ve owned), but that&#x27;s not a reflection on these replacement blades.</li>
            <li>they are anything other than a true replacement I will add to this comment.</li>
            <li>The product was reasonably priced and made the shaver same as a new product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I replaced the old the heads (about 4 years old) with the new package.</li>
            <li>Wow like having my old razor brand new again...</li>
            <li>So new heads are good, absurd pricing is not.</li>
            <li>Perfect replacement; much less expensive than replacing my razor.</li>
            <li>As usual the order arrived quickly and all worked out, it&#x27;s the exact product you get from Norelco.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to have a little-used Norelco of the same type.</li>
            <li>Quick, simple and relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Rather than buying an expensive new razor, these heads were very reasonable, easy to install and saved me from discarding a perfectly good razor just because the heads were dull!  </li>
            <li>Prior to receiving my most recent set of replacement heads, however, I was able to work around this issue by simply removing both the damaged cutter and its screen from the shaver so that the other two could still spin and be used (trying to avoid the open hole left by the removed cutter and screen, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did definitely improve the shaver however not as much as I&#x27;d hoped, that may not be the fault of this product though, it may be getting near the time to invest in a new one.    </li>
            <li>I had my old head on the shaver for the last 2 years and didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference the new head would make.</li>
            <li>I hope they last as long as the original equipment</li>
            <li>They last at least a year or more!</li>
            <li>Worked very well at first but thought it would stay sharp longer than it did.  </li>
            <li>Is it just me or do the replacement heads never seem to last as long as the original equipment..?</li>
            <li>My original heads lasted a year and a half.</li>
            <li>This was a straightforward and mundane purchase; just replacement cutters for my two year-old Norelco but it, of course, represents an improvement of performance for a worn product.  </li>
            <li>I do notice some slight differences from the original heads; they seem loser.</li>
            <li>Quick service, correct item and SHARP heads.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Norelco for not outsourcing everything to China.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco, If you were smart, you&#x27;d bring back all of your products manufacturing back to the Netherlands.  </li>
            <li>The new set are OK, they are not as sharp as I expected.</li>
            <li>I had a difficult time finding replacement heads, so I finally found these, and they are working just great.</li>
            <li>I needed to return a part I ordered for my Norelco SX Speed shaver and it was handled promptly and with clear instructions.  </li>
            <li>The pictoral instructions were not as clear as I thought they should be, so I had to take some time to figure it out.</li>
            <li>These blades are a bit expensive but they work great and last almost six months.</li>
            <li>Completely met my expectations and delivery</li>
            <li>toss your old mount away.</li>
            <li>but I wish you would ship directly to Puerto Rico to end the hassle and burden of using my son&#x27;s Florida address...</li>
            <li>My only issue - which was really my fault - was assuming that the assembly inside the watch (which holds the blades) was included.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to revive my old Norelco Speed XL.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully they will make a much easier way to shave in the future....</li>
            <li>My old Norelco was not performing as well as it used to</li>
            <li>Too old at 75 I guess.</li>
            <li>I realized the old ones were no functioning</li>
            <li>So much cheaper to buy off the net!  </li>
            <li>Maybe my shaver is getting old.</li>
            <li>Discard the three old razor discs.  </li>
            <li>My old heads were 5 years old.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I am seventy two years old and my hands dont work that</li>
            <li>I have been using the old heads for three years without changing it.  </li>
            <li>I replaced them as the old ones seem to be nicking me.</li>
            <li>I did not realize the old ones needed replacement.</li>
            <li>And thru Amazon, you buy the replacement blades cheaper, then the complete head assembly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before to replace the old cutters from my electric shaver.</li>
            <li>My razor is around 3 years old</li>
            <li>My razor must be four or five years old.  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed as a replacement for the old shaver heads.</li>
            <li>I switched my blades to this replacement head, my shave was noticeably faster and took far fewer passovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000050B6D Philips Norelco HQ6 Quadra Action Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]  </li>
            <li>but when my husband took apart his razor to change the heads he found a problem with the razor that could not be fixed so we returned the heads.</li>
            <li>so I bought Norelco HQ9 replacement  heads, to my complete surprise</li>
            <li>They do last much longer than the box</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just for some reason they couldn&#x27;t tell me on the phone how much they were until I got there after my 2 hour and fifteen minutes on lightrail and buses and the 9 minute ride from the closest bus stop on my motorized wheel chair with my oxygen bottle on the back.</li>

            <li>Replacement instructions are clear, concise.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obvious that Norelco has succumbed to the idea that their profits are really in selling the heads rather than the quality items they used to sell.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize the old heads needed replaced until I installed these.  </li>

            <li>My shaver shaves fast and is quiet.</li>
            <li>I did not realize how worn out the old blades had gotten until I replaced them.</li>
            <li>It does seem to be an improvement over the old head, and I saved quite a bit of money in the process.</li>
            <li>Item appears to indicate that 3 complete heads are included in box.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t like shaving with razors (sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>Getting a close shave again with my old shaver.</li>
            <li>My only knock is that I don&#x27;t notice that much difference in the shave.  </li>
            <li>and I had been using the originals for nearly 2 years.</li>
            <li>My old HQ-9 heads were about six years old, and started pulling and pinching.  </li>
            <li>The product was received in a timely matter and put directly to use.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my 1+ year old razor.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>was expecting the complete plastic holding head as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li>Shaver is 12 years old.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize how trashed my old heads were until I replaced it.</li>
            <li>STANDARD UNIT--NOT MUCH CHANGE IN PRICE</li>
            <li>Much cheaper from Amazon than purchasing at local mega-store.</li>
            <li>A noticeable difference by using these blades to replace blades that were a year old.</li>
            <li>THE REGULAR PRICE FOR NORELCO REPLACEMENT HEADS ARE WAY TOO HIGH FOR ME!</li>
            <li>Although my Norelco model called for HQ8, the HQ9 fits just as well and the extra combs in the heads give a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know that you need to replace these every year and am now still using old heads as a test.</li>
            <li>It work was replacing my 8 year old heads</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands but Norelco has always been my favorite.  </li>
            <li>We were pleased to find the replacement heads that were not available to us locally.  </li>
            <li>I went back and ordered a few more to have on hand when we need them again.</li>
            <li>Shave feels much better (assuming the old one was there for over a year and assuming you shave at least once every 2 days).</li>
            <li>It was well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re new and sharp and drop right in as they should.</li>
            <li>The price of the heads seems high compared to an entire new shaving unit.  </li>
            <li>The installation was easy, and there is little or no drag while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>As usual, the new blades made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It just seems for me that eventually a brand that I use for a long time just does not work very well even when buying new.  </li>
            <li>However, I personally did not view a large difference between the new blades and the old blades I had in my razor, which were several years old.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than any real store, and cheaper than any other online source.</li>
            <li>Trust someone who tried this and other options: these big heads give you the fastest smooth shave, bar none.</li>
            <li>Hard to get a clean shave, and it clogs up to fast.  </li>
            <li>I have been using old razor heads for 5 years (almost everyday shave) but did not notice a significant improvement in shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The switch to the new set was not a problem and the head was cleaned thoroughly prior to putting in the new set of cutters.  </li>
            <li>These replacement blades make you feel like you have a new razor again, at a fraction of the cost of actually buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy new heads every year or so instead of buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Normally, I would just replace the entire razor in order to get fresh batteries and a new motor; however it&#x27;s becoming difficult to find reasonalbly priced Speed-XL shavers.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I had the correct heads because the writing on the back of my shaver was soooo small for these old eyes.  </li>
            <li>conclude, I am happy that I can continue to use my one and favorite shaver but the replacement process was &#x27;mission impossible&#x27; for me and &#x27;mission hard&#x27; for my wife.</li>
            <li>The new heads performed as expected, providing a smooth shave in minimal time once again.  </li>
            <li>May old shaver head was over a year old, and new blades always improve the shave and this set is no different</li>
            <li>The new blades certainly improve the quality of the shave, but I&#x27;m not as \\&quot;wowed\\&quot; as I expected to be (probably based on the number of glowing reviews on this site).  </li>
            <li>am starting to use Amazon more for purchases that previously were made&lt;br /&gt;at stores such as Walmamrt SuperCenter.</li>
            <li>If you only replace your blades once a year, you will definitely notice a difference on the first use after blade replacement.</li>
            <li>These cutters are a vast improvement from the older HQ types.</li>
            <li>I purchased these same replacement heads a year before from a local retail store at a higher price.</li>
            <li>The Internet is just about the only place we can order the replacements at a decent price.  </li>
            <li>HQ8 Dual Precision Replacement Heads]]replacement heads will also actually work on my older shaver, despite that fact not being indicated by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I would certainly wait as long as I did again.</li>
            <li>I use my electric razor as a preshaver to remove my longer facial hair down to the stubble so that I can then obtain a completely smooth shave with a manual 4-blade razor.</li>
            <li>What can you say, other than they&#x27;ve  been making rotatory head shavers for 40+ years so they must be doing something right.</li>
            <li>Try replacing the heads before you fork out big bucks for all the fancy, non-esssential \\&quot;features\\&quot; they now build into high priced electric shavers.</li>
            <li>I used to stretch this because of the high cost locally $44....at $29.95 its da bomb!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you do the same you&#x27;ll feel and notice a difference!</li>
            <li>This ttook my old Norelco shaver back to new.</li>
            <li>made my ten year old razor work like new.</li>
            <li>I can only think that this means a) old heads were holding up as well as when new</li>
            <li>Makes my old razor new again - and Amazon had it a lot cheaper than the local retailers.</li>
            <li>Definitely brought new life to the old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Norelco is a good shaver and I needed new cutting heads after 2 continuous years of use.</li>
            <li>Super sharp blades give a very close shave with less irritation than a normal razor.  </li>
            <li>major improvement!</li>
            <li>A little more packaging than necessary, but no worse than other products.</li>
            <li>So you actually have a smaller high speed cutter area while the inner rings end up pulling your beard hairs when you try to shave as fast as your old Lift-and-Cut shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Little bit tricky determining which razor heads to buy, but I did figure properly after close examination and they work fine.</li>
            <li>Long whiskers around the larynx were a real pain.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, but really needed since shaving was taking way too long to get close shave.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>The humor of being human is that we will revolt against any &#x27;snap&#x27; changes but will tolerate incremental progression to something with no complaint.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>It arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>These will return you to the close shave that you expected when you first bought your razor.</li>
            <li>shaves better, less catch when long stuble is present.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit of doing to get the new ones in place properly.  </li>
            <li>That said, when he finally asked me to order new blades, I did and he couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>But a new head will give you an extra close shave.</li>
            <li>I was actually thinking about purchasing a new razor and looking at razor reviews on Amazon when the cutters came up as a suggested purchase.  </li>
            <li>cutter blades made my Norelco the same as new.  </li>
            <li>This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve replaced the heads on my razor and each time its like having a new razor</li>
            <li>Installing the replacement shaver head was simple and now the shaver works like new.</li>
            <li>However, as I haven&#x27;t purchase this specific product package, I can&#x27;t comment on the ease of access (or safety) of the new packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These have brought new life back to my electric razor.</li>
            <li>Big savings on a new one.</li>
            <li>Finally got it and the razor is like new.</li>
            <li>I have replaced the heads several times and it is just like buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>Makes the shaver perform like new instantly.</li>
            <li>You can replace the head and blades for about the same price as a new shaver.</li>
            <li>(new digital camera battery &amp; charger &amp; 2 tripods.  </li>
            <li>I finally replaced these heads on my razor and it now works like it did when it was brand new.</li>
            <li>Thought the razor was trash but this simple fix made it just like a new one.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s to say - simple replacement of the heads and works like new.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t replaced my blades in over two years, and I can definitely notice a difference with these new heads.</li>
            <li>The replacement blades restored the performance back to like new.</li>
            <li>The new heads I bought were billed as making a big difference in my shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>now have a new razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery, and installation was practically instant.</li>
            <li>Getting new heads on Amazon is a big convenience.</li>
            <li>Next time I wont wait 10 years for new blades.</li>
            <li>I purchased for 2 different razors and both work like a new razor.</li>
            <li>I have had to replace thee blades on my razor several time and always purchase them locally, paying way too much.</li>
            <li>For some reason these blades are not cutting as well as previous blade replacements.  </li>
            <li>Really, it&#x27;s a lot like changing tires on a car which I only do every several years.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Norelco razor that has lasted long enough that required replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>review process sucks since it forces me to write more than is necessary for this product</li>
            <li>The replacement heads do not remain sharp as long as the original heads.  </li>
            <li>have only given these replacement heads three stars because I personally wish that they could provide me with a much closer and smoother shave without having to use it in conjunction with a manual razor.</li>
            <li>These last pretty long.</li>
            <li>The old ones while still giving me a good shave would sometimes pull instead of cutting and the skin on my neck would often get irritated.</li>
            <li>No other razor is as dependable as Norelco.</li>
            <li>Price from Amazon was a major factor in where to purchase these HQ9 heads.</li>
            <li>I am not sure of the metal mixture these heads are but in my opinion they do not give the shave I got from the original Norelco factory heads.</li>
            <li>There is no other option for this razor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do a lot of online buying, I typically prefer to touch &amp; inspect before I buy, even though I frequently go online to check specs and prices first.</li>
            <li>I am careful to run it down almost all the way before recharging it â something that is easy because the indicator lights inform me of the status of the charge.</li>
            <li>Refuses to cook dinner or clean the dishes, but I think I can look past that.</li>
            <li>They may have been older, because I don&#x27;t recall how long I have had this razor.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this replacement when the original one gets dull!</li>
            <li>Obviously a little pricey, but then all razor blade products worth their salt are.  </li>
            <li>The new cutters were long overdue - they returned the shaver to &#x27;like new&#x27; performance.&lt;br /&gt;However, inside the padded envelope was only the cutters - NO PAPERWORK whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave, and it&#x27;s certainly faster than with the old blades that had become dull.  </li>
            <li>However, the quality of shaves I had been getting were deteriorating over the last few months despite keeping the head really clean.</li>
            <li>I had not replaced the last blades for a few years and was having problems getting a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I just need to try something else, but I am less and less satisfied with the shave that I get from my SpeedXL.  </li>
            <li>It is tough to find the correct heads since there are so many Philips shavers.</li>
            <li>replacements were very easy to install and make for a much better shave than the dull old blades I replaced which were beginning to &#x27;yank&#x27; the hairs out instead of cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new shaver heads were easy to install and have made my mornings a little less stressful.</li>
            <li>This is misleading &amp; incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;The individual heads were new and fit properly (and sharp for a close shave), but I expected the 3 outer&lt;br /&gt;mountings</li>
            <li>I waited far too long to replace my old shaver head.</li>
            <li>Replaced the four year old heads on my razor with one of these and found only a marginal improvement in my shaving experience.</li>
            <li>This product is a very satisfactory replacement for a wet razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to put my old blades back in the razor</li>
            <li>Recommend a very thorough cleaning of the part that holds the heads and be careful that each rotating blade stays with the head it came in since they are a matched set.  </li>
            <li>I bought these as a last ditch effort and WOW do they make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Pulls are minimal and the shave is much quicker and nicer.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t chaf the back of my neck like the old heads.</li>
            <li>Time will tell; but up to now, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;However, getting the blades out of this package could be considered a potential hazard.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>Once properly cleaned, my old cutter heads delivered a shave at like-new closeness and comfort.    </li>
            <li>Back to the old blade for me</li>
            <li>I replaced my old razor with a newer model last Spring (the 8140XL).  </li>
            <li>The old blades simply pulled my beard and it hurt.  </li>
            <li>The old heads were so worn out that they started biting my facial skin.  </li>
            <li>The product(new Head for razor Philips Norelco)  does not seem to shave me any closer than the one in use prior to purchse, and I have had the old Head for 3 years.  </li>
            <li>A breeze to put it in place and a pleasure to have my old shaver back!</li>
            <li>I used these to replace the heads which were several years old on my Norelco Speed shaver...  </li>
            <li>Installation is the same as removing and cleaning old ones.</li>
            <li>My only gripe was with the manufacturers nearly impenetrable packaging.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads provide a good recharge for the cutting power of the shaving system.  </li>
            <li>I buy the relatively expensive replacement heads about every 18-24 months and can&#x27;t honestly tell whether they improve the shaving.  </li>
            <li>This one with the 3 cutting rings are good.  </li>
            <li>Although a little bit pricey, it is still much cheaper to replace the heads than buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>There are two little tabs on each blade that have to be oriented right.</li>
            <li>and it was only my impression of the passage of time that made me think they were dulling, or b) the sharpness of the new heads was not manufactured with a quality standard that would have shown a vast improvement over 2 year old blades.  </li>
            <li>The difference of having new blades and the previous set is like getting a new face; go for it!</li>
            <li>We live in a rural area about 20 minutes from nearest big box store and i kept forgetting to buy them when i was out shopping.  </li>
            <li>Although I could not see any problems with the shaving head, I decided to try replacing the head as a last resort prior to buying a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>The new blade was not much sharper than the one I removed from my year old shaver.</li>
            <li>Insert the new ones (they only fit one way due to the little wings on the edge).  </li>
            <li>I ONLY PURCHASE TRUE NORELCO HEAD REPLACEMENTS BECAUSE THEY STAY SHARP A LONG TIME</li>
            <li>I wish I had not waited so long to order new heads.</li>
            <li>just what i needed to make my shaver work like new - shaving is not nearly the chore</li>
            <li>It has been so long since it was new</li>
            <li>I waited too long to do the replacement because I forgot what it was like new.</li>
            <li>Yet as soon as your shaving experience starts taking twice as long, grab a new set of heads.</li>
            <li>I think I will go back to the single cutter head should be a lot easier.o much gunk.</li>
            <li>even though his beard isn&#x27;t as tuff as my husbands, he will need it at some point and it is a lot less expensive than buying a new razor (that is if the razor itself is still in good working order.</li>
            <li>the less they cut my face pretty close but not that close</li>
            <li>the blades was a relatively simple process, everything but the actual blades is reused from the old ones, so don&#x27;t throw anything out!</li>
            <li>After my first use of product I didn&#x27;t think the blades were sharp enough.</li>
            <li>OEM part fits perfectly, is sharp and now makes the shaver work the same as when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>Rather than having to go over the same area time and time again to get all of the hairs, the new blades smoothly shear my whiskers in half the time and with even less effort.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what you need to restore the cutting performance of your shaver--and certainly cheaper than buying a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li>This particular model shaves very well but pulls out a few whiskers below my nose; Ouch!   </li>
            <li>Blades are not nearly as effective as original.  </li>
            <li>Over due for replacement so got on Amazon for fast service.  </li>
            <li>My beard is not that thick and the original heads lasted 6 years.  </li>
            <li>Getting new heads is like getting a new razor without, but for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>Changing these cutter heads roughly once a year always makes it shave as if it were new!</li>
            <li>The HQ9 Speed XL Replacement Heads, which fit my razor come complete with new heads and new cutting blades.</li>
            <li>The Norelco blades that I replaced were three-years old and the new ones that I purchased a few weeks ago gave a rougher shave than the old ones, leaving my face sore.  </li>
            <li>You have to take the heads out and clean the build up out at least once a month..</li>
            <li>Ad shows a complete head assembly but only three rotating cutters are actually included.</li>
            <li>The inner rings have a slower surface speed than the old, larger area, outer ring.  </li>
            <li>After using the Norelco shaver for several months after the recommended replacement date, I expected a much batter shave.  </li>
            <li>This is the third head for my razor which is several years old.</li>
            <li>He had to change his old blades so no different, didn&#x27;t have at our local store.</li>
            <li>Shaver is several years old... finally decided to order a replacement head.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend purchasing this item as it is a direct replacement for what I previously owned.</li>
            <li>I plan on using these new heads for as long as the shaver will last.  </li>
            <li>I had my original heads for about a year and a half (using about every other day)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t do much about these average replacement shaving heads.  </li>
            <li>They recommend replacement after one year, but they&#x27;re built extremely well using the finest materials and will last much longer then one year.</li>
            <li>The Norelco cutter heads you sell are the same as sold by other vendors but you always have them, price them reasonably and ship them speedily.</li>
            <li>Ladies, will love them for their legs and other delicate areas instead of razor blades.</li>
            <li>Wow what a difference with the Panasonic I would have to scrape away for a long time and still end up with a stubble.</li>
            <li>I was long overdue on replacing my razor heads, so the difference was considerable.</li>
            <li>The old blades served well for three years,which I thought was a long time.</li>
            <li>The stores around me charged over $35, so I came here and saved myself a few dollars with the exact model required for replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>The previous one lasted more than a year, but not sure this one is going to serve the same.</li>
            <li>Get dull too quick and won&#x27;t give a close shave like I like.</li>
            <li>Now I just barely glide the razor across my face with the new and sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>However, for loose skin like mine, this is the best on the market for me ... and no more cutting of the face by the blade.</li>
            <li>This product is just what I expected IE makes a new razor out of existing one.</li>
            <li>They work fine but are expensive give the cost of a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice the difference my previous time, which was almost two years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I find they work very well for about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li>Shave seems much closer and in slightly less</li>
            <li>When I bought my [first] shaver last year I never thought about having trouble getting replacement heads, but what I time I had.</li>
            <li>This method works for me, at least, and results in much less irritation because there is then far less chance of me catching or tugging the longer hairs with my manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got about 3 years out of the old ones (I only shave about 3 or 4 days a week), hope these last as long.</li>
            <li>I have used the HQ9 heads for last two years, and they cut very well and have longer life than any previous Norelco heads.</li>
            <li>the installation was fairly easy, although you should take a close look at how the old cutters are placed and locked in the holder before you casually dismantle things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are quieter, faster and shave much better.&lt;br /&gt;A little clearer instructions would help, but I figures it out</li>
            <li>Disappointing performance from Norelco, nonetheless, and at a head replacement cost that is higher than most other models.</li>
            <li>a sharp (feels like new) electric razor without the hassle of going to a store.  </li>
            <li>When I bought my SpeedXL the brand new blades were so sharp that one pass would do the trick.</li>
            <li>Needed new sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>Like some of the other reviews state, you will notice an improvement in the quality of your shave and decrease in shaving time once you replace the blades, IF you need new blades.</li>
            <li>The shaving heads work fine and were badly needed because the ones on the razor were not cutting close.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>If these are as well-made as the heads they replaced, it will be years before I need replacements - especially since the other&#x27;s were self-sharpening and were functioning as well as new ones.</li>
            <li>When the older one gets dull, you need the new one.</li>
            <li>Not much to say other than replacing your old, worn out blades can make your Norelco Razor perform like new.</li>
            <li>The old ones were so dull that I would really press deep into my skin to get them to shave.  </li>
            <li>After installing the new heads shaving took less than half the time and resulted in a much smoother shave.  </li>
            <li>Good blades, bad price.</li>
            <li>They seem to be cutting ok so far.  </li>
            <li>Many of the newer Norelco shavers and likely cutting heads are made in Far East countries like China, etc.</li>

            <li> Then I started to notice it was taking longer to get a smooth shave, and even then it was not as good.</li>
            <li> It was the perfect replacement for my old blade.</li>
            <li> I love it because it was an amazing price.  </li>
            <li> That said, Amazon had by far the best price for these heads beating even WalMart by $10!</li>
            <li> I had Norelco shavers since the 1960&#x27;s with great success.  </li>

            <li> Replacement is incredibly easy and its just amazing and what a difference it makes.</li>
            <li> Good value and deliver was quick.  </li>

            <li> Good quick service on delivery of product.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly, the price was good and they work well.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery, good price.</li>

            <li> It fit perfectly and my shave is like when the razor was new.</li>
            <li> Item received and new product fit perfectly  .</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for the Norelco razor, makes it shave just like new.  </li>
            <li> This annual purchase of new blades has extended the life of a perfectly good electric razor and makes for a good shave day in and day out.</li>
            <li> The product was easy to install and my husband is very happy we replaced the old head.  </li>
            <li> Works perfectly, made a huge difference when I replaced my very old heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d forgotten how nice it is to get a decent shave again!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product, shipping was fast and accurate</li>
            <li> huge improvement, now I know the value of changing the blades periodically!</li>
            <li> Would have given five Stars but thought the price would be better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I did think the entre top of the razor, not just the 3 heads would come with it.</li>
            <li> norelco is always top of the line.  </li>
            <li> One thing you might want to conseder to prolong the life of your blades is to purchase the Norelco liquid wash for the blades, it is inexpensive and does a good job in cleaning the blades; they feel fresh once cleaned.</li>
            <li> You can get the most out of the liquid wash by mixing the liquid with filtered water in the container that you are going to use for your razor.</li>
            <li> Changing the shaving heads realy makes a diference, it feels more like a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Some heads were not made by Philips Norelco but Amazon had the proper heads and at  the best price.  </li>
            <li> I do not think I will do any more business with you because of shipping &amp; tax on shipping.    </li>
            <li> The shaver is okay</li>
            <li> A worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I guess I paid about a buck or so,  more than I needed.  </li>
            <li> I love products that work as advertised.</li>
            <li> (hopefully they still make them, I&#x27;d better buy more...)</li>
            <li> was pleased with the shipping &amp; packing.</li>
            <li> The total value of this purchase (price + shipping) was great!  </li>
            <li> The product is fine--an appropriate replacement for the heads on my husband&#x27;s shaver.  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask anything more of electric shaver blades.</li>
            <li> but at a better price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much better</li>
            <li> This is the beginning of my third year using my Norelco and am impressed that it is still working so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love These RePlaceMent Heads For My ElecTric RaZor.</li>
            <li> Any HAPPIER.  :-)</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find the replacment heads not only available on Amazon, but at a very fair price... thank you!</li>
            <li> great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> It seems some work better than others</li>
            <li> As with most cutters there is a 10-12 time use for them to sit and adjust,</li>
            <li> Everything OK</li>
            <li> This replacement head set fit perfectly and was a direct drop-in replacement for my existing shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product and should purchase another one to ensure that I have a spare.  </li>
            <li> Probably could use a better galvanized process so it wouldn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> We were pleased with the time of delivery.</li>
            <li> I not only recommend this wonderful product by Phillips Sonicare Toothbrush which I just discovered and am now using.</li>
            <li> I ordered the hair nose trimmer , which I have yet to use but am sure it will work out</li>
            <li> ok...  </li>
            <li> I an confident the installation was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Might feel better if the head holder was included.</li>
            <li> Yes I am satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item before and am satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li> I have had a Norelco 8171XL electric shaver for almost 5 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I think its just a ploy to get more money from us.  </li>
            <li> Amazon price was better than anyplace I know.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was because there are a lot of guys using this model, a lot of folks bought these during the holidays or what, but stores in my area, IF they had a spot on the shelves for it, didn&#x27;t have it in stock AND wanted up to $10 more than I paid here.</li>
            <li> Why replace the razor, when you can just order replacement heads for his favorite razor?  </li>
            <li> TO ANY ONE LOOKING FOR A CONFORTABLE AND SAFE SHAVING.</li>
            <li> Seems to work better than the originals</li>
            <li> it were better</li>
            <li> Will buy again when I more replacements.</li>
            <li> Works much better than a manual razor or electronic razor made for the face.  </li>
            <li> It is working ok for now</li>
            <li> They seem to work OK as a replacement, but it seems all replacement parts are a rip, be it blades like this or brushes for power toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the great service.</li>
            <li> and I received the blades, nothing more.</li>
            <li> Boy it&#x27;s nice to have a smooth shave</li>
            <li> Jim    even better.  </li>
            <li> : Mostly on me, I should have done this years before.</li>
            <li> Saved some money and am getting a much better shave.</li>
            <li> I guess they work but are just OK</li>
            <li> , I am glad I did not pay more than $26 for them.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Packaging could be better.</li>
            <li> What more can you say about 3 shaving heads.  </li>
            <li> the Norelco replacement heads work OK.  </li>
            <li> I will for sure contact you again.</li>
            <li> This razor is passable, but is really more of a \\&quot;first\\&quot; electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan on buying more replacement heads when this set runs its course; I&#x27;m going to upgrade to a razor with more flexibility and precision.</li>
            <li> Just what my husband needed, couldn&#x27;t find replacement in the store, he loves his shaver, so glad I could find replacement blades for him.</li>
            <li> I have used these shaver heads for about 3 years now and have been well pleased.</li>
            <li> but now I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this guy, gal, company, distributer, what-</li>
            <li> They need to be cleaned-out more often.  </li>
            <li> so I am getting more shaves per charge.</li>
            <li> The recommendation is to replace annually incase one of you out there has been using yours for greater than one year.  </li>
            <li> Everywhere else I had checked was a lot more.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Norelco razors for several years, and this is their best shaving heads yet.  </li>
            <li> Sure makes a difference when shaving.</li>
            <li> Love my Norelco Razor.</li>
            <li> These people know what to have for most things out there.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to shop here for most of my needs.  </li>
            <li> Love this razor and the heads hold up well</li>
            <li> me,the Norelco products are the better in this line.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did....</li>
            <li> and I am well satisfied with the product both times.  </li>
            <li> Sure beats having to replace the razor.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great service.</li>
            <li> every thing was ok...</li>
            <li> Make sure your Norellco is a Speed XL.</li>
            <li> Best shavw I have had recently.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love a smooth face on my husband!</li>
            <li> Glad to have been able to get replacement heads, instead of buying yet another electric razor to add to my collection.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I replaced the heads on my SpeedXL shaver but the shave wasn&#x27;t noticeably better.</li>
            <li> To top it off, the HQ8 heads are cheaper too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll find it becomes a better shaver.</li>
            <li> Fast, reliable seller, Product is and always has been great.</li>
            <li> Did I get a much better shave.  </li>
            <li> But most men probably already knew this information anyway.</li>
            <li> Best Buy for the Price, with this being my 2nd replacement.</li>
            <li> Attempted to buy at Walmart, but was always out and cost more.</li>
            <li> I would have rated five stars because I have been using the Norelco for many years, but since the site had faulty information, you get 1 star.</li>
            <li> They do prolong the life the Norelco electric razor which I&#x27;ve had more than 5 years now.  </li>
            <li> They rescued my shaver - what more can I say?</li>
            <li> what I got was just the blades, then I had to buy the holder which is $18-25 more</li>
            <li> Maybe there is more to manufacturing than I realise. :)</li>
            <li> I hope I can find more when I need them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more convenient than using a razor blade</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for over 40 years because I think they are a better quality than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> 18 months at the most.</li>
            <li> I tried buying these at Target, and they didn&#x27;t fit!</li>
            <li> Let me explain, I wanted to be sure that I was not wasting money replacing the head of my shaver to soon.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> After the cleaning with the aid of a toothpick, brush and alcohol, I found I was able to shave with greater ease and satisfactory closeness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure we will be buying Norelco for years to come.</li>
            <li> Definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I always make sure I maintain the head/blade assembly.  </li>
            <li> I find that a static or non-moving head does a much better job at shaving.  </li>
            <li> Most electric razors from any brand are made in Asia today.  </li>
            <li> Checked prices (since its all the same product) and found the best deal on Amazon (prime).</li>
            <li> (I love that they text me when it&#x27;s been delivered).</li>
            <li> so I ended up with more</li>
            <li> the job done and the women love it.</li>
            <li> Just do it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly and was as described or better.</li>
            <li> and I could not beat this price anywhere and am glad I checked Amazon before I purchase any.thing</li>
            <li> but hey they make a lot more money with these sub par materials</li>
            <li> I have noticed that these shaver heads hold up better to hair.</li>
            <li> and I was in love again.  </li>
            <li> Notice how they have 3 concentric rings, giving you much more shaving area.</li>
            <li> but it seems to leave more hair when shaving.  </li>
            <li> Because I have opened the package I did not feel it was appropriate to return or exchange them.</li>
            <li> I was able to pick out the correct blades for my razor model by the description in the add.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I could recommend this as being OKAY for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m satisfied with the product itself.</li>
            <li> Make sure the heads match the model of your razor.</li>
            <li> will purchase more via Amazon when / if needed</li>
            <li> and u require me to type more.</li>
            <li> The item was a excellent purchase that I needed as a replacement for a shaver that I&#x27;ve had for several years.</li>
            <li> Great replacement and fast service.</li>
            <li> He has tried different ones, the Norelco is the best.  </li>
            <li> | 17 more words required.</li>
            <li> | 17 more words required</li>
            <li> My razor works better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install.</li>
            <li> I am still using the one i tried to replace and are performing better.</li>
            <li> Eventually I was getting so many cuts on my face, including razor burn</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are now in a test period to see which is the better shaver.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Could not ask for more.</li>
            <li> Except for free....that would be much better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try them, but it would be an interesting experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than going to the store.</li>
            <li> This product is just okay.</li>
            <li> and I love having them delivered instead of going out to find them somewhere.</li>
            <li> Had my doubts about whether replacement blades would work as well as the originals, but not any more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I checked with Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I love the blades and the shaver.</li>
            <li> Norelco products have always satisfied all my shaving needs for years.</li>
            <li> Sure cheaper than buying another shaver.  </li>
            <li> do i need to explain my inpression in so many words?</li>
            <li> I opted to replace the heads and Im glad i did.</li>
            <li> Since this has been a very dependable razer he was happy to not have to replacement.</li>
            <li> ON LINE IS MORE CONVENIENT..</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> the razor blades i purchased were a better price than any</li>
            <li> I shopped Internet sites for price comparison and found Amazon to have the better price.</li>
            <li> I should replace my shaver blades more</li>
            <li> I changed the heads or blades and it works much better, with a much better shave.  </li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Much better shave.  </li>
            <li> Love the Norelco shaved...</li>
            <li> It requires more dexterity than I have.</li>
            <li> Could not find a better deal then this one.</li>
            <li> Being able to purchase these allowed me to continue using my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> I will buy more as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
            <li> I looked online and found replacement blades and matched the design on top the blade basket to pin-point the one I needed.</li>
            <li> and it is many years</li>
            <li> Have used for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the shave</li>
            <li> The HQ9 Heads give you more shaving service, therefore a quicker shave..</li>
            <li> pleased with Amazon Service and follow up.</li>
            <li> For me, this worked out OK</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get much better than the Norelco brand.  </li>
            <li> I would like to be able to replace the batteries some day.</li>
            <li> I will be very happy if the replacement heads have the  same life.</li>
            <li> It shaves much better now that I have replaced them.</li>
            <li> nothing more to relate</li>
            <li> This product gets top ratings 5âs</li>
            <li> Also to be able to get a replacement head</li>
            <li> and I recommend you get this kind if it fit you application.</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> I am ordering more replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Pulled on whiskers more.</li>
            <li> Altogether pleased.</li>
            <li> What a great price just about ready to order some more.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> Came on time, definitely better shaving ...</li>
            <li> Need to replace these things more often and would not be able to do that at brick &amp; mortar prices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for many years now.</li>
            <li> The batteries still charge perfectly and I only seem to need to replace the blades every couple of year.</li>
            <li> The Norelco has lasted for many year</li>
            <li> Need more be said?</li>
            <li> If it was cheaper, perhaps you could make a better case.</li>
            <li> Factory replacement heads at a price considerably better than at the drug store.</li>
            <li> It took about 30 seconds to swap them out and now my razor does a much better job of shaving.</li>
            <li> I am pleased and I will keep buying them.</li>
            <li> only good!!!!</li>
            <li> Better than the $200 shaver that does not give any results.  </li>
            <li> But if you have the time the blade is much better.</li>
            <li> The Replacement Heads is just OK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than buying the razors on an annual basis.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my favorite shaver and came across this HQ9 replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips Norelo recommends replacing these heads once per year to obtain the best possible shave</li>
            <li> shaving results at a more than one-half the cost of the HQ9 heads, at this point.</li>
            <li> got these for father in law haven&#x27;t heard any complaints so must be okay</li>
            <li> what more can you expect.</li>
            <li> Glad that I did it.</li>
            <li> GETTING A BETTER SHAVE NOW.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be doing this once a year from now on :)</li>
            <li> completely satisfied as I have alwys been with the heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for many years and take it with me on vacations.</li>
            <li> They work, I can shave :).</li>
            <li> Have used this Norelco razor for many years.</li>
            <li> But at the price they are charging, it almost makes more sense to buy a brand-new electric razor.</li>
            <li> First this is the best blade head in the series because it gives best precision, its almost half the price at which it was available in walmart,</li>
            <li> Dropped right in and worked perfectly, however I was expecting a closer shave...not much difference at all.</li>
            <li> Having said that, these are as good as you will find anywhere and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> these new heads work great and easy to replace!</li>
            <li> These shaving heads were reasonably priced and are very effective.  </li>
            <li> Good service, easy to install, quick delivery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far,- - so good!  </li>
            <li> if you liked the original blades in your razor, I guess you&#x27;ll probably like the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> GREAT replacement products, my hubby&#x27;s electric razor is like new!</li>
            <li> The HQ9 has 2 more set of fins per head compared to the original HQ8... and what a difference!    </li>
            <li> Gets a nice clean shave, with no problem.</li>
            <li> Great that you can buy heads for older models.</li>
            <li> They are again providing nice close clean looking shaves.</li>
            <li> They are a exact replacement and was able to get them at a good price</li>
            <li> Nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate his nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> They work great in my older Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> The new blades fit very good</li>
            <li> very good results with these heads, comfort when shaving, easy to replace your old blades.</li>
            <li> Cost was really high for replacements, but they work great.</li>
            <li> works great, highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with the outstanding customer service that I have received, and my husband is thrilled to have his favorite shaver back in working order.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly  and was exactly as described , and very reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I am getting a very clean shave</li>
            <li> 18 months is actually a pretty good lifetime for a consumable wear item like these HQ9&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Price was fair and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> and I can get a pretty darn good close shave with this anytime..</li>
            <li> Yep, these were pretty good.</li>
            <li> Get good shave when they are in their first year of use.</li>
            <li> Although very good they do not last the 12 month  life, it&#x27;s more like 6 months.</li>
            <li> THAT CAME WITH ORIGINAL  RAZOR!</li>
            <li> Made a new razor out of it - Great</li>
            <li> Every time I switch shaving heads I&#x27;m reminded of how great it is to have new heads.  </li>
            <li> Saved me a lot of money as I did not need to get a new razor and got to keep my great Norelco razer.</li>
            <li> The new heads make for a great shave.</li>
            <li> razor is like new again and the shipping was great.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads... makes my Norelco shaver feel like new again.....</li>
            <li> These new rotary blades are great.</li>
            <li> The were new and what can you say but they worked great.  </li>
            <li> However it works great when new.</li>
            <li> When I added these to my razor, I was amazed to get the close shave I once experienced when my razor was new.</li>
            <li> It works great and performs like a new razor.</li>
            <li> I bought these as my Norelco needed new heads and this was a great price.</li>
            <li> Works great like a new razor now.</li>
            <li> New Blades were GREAT.</li>
            <li> These heads worked great and my Norelco Razor is almost like brand new.</li>
            <li> THESE NEW HEADS WORK GREAT IN MY RAZOR.  </li>
            <li> Found these : genuine Philips product, delivered fast, GREAT pricing.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, I just need to remember to change them out more than once a year</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are easy to install and make shaving much more convenient again.  </li>
            <li> Easy swap out &amp; works much better.</li>
            <li> easy installation.....much better shave now</li>
            <li> Already using it for about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;First impression was that it cuts hair more easily but still can not feel any difference or improvement in shaving time.</li>
            <li> and he was very happy with the product and the price was reasonable and much cheaper</li>
            <li> each razor gets better and better with the technology that&#x27;s available now.</li>
            <li> If your heads are more then one year old, this will greatly improve your shave.</li>
            <li> My husband especially appreciated being able to buy this on line as there are so many styles to plow through at the stores.</li>
            <li> Easy to change and gives a pretty good shave.</li>
            <li> Shaves me clean and close!  </li>
            <li> I was amazed how enjoyable my morning shaves have changed, since purchasing this Philips Norelco replacement heads, they work really fine.</li>
            <li> Norelco is a good product, and replacing heads after about two years of usage certainly improved performance.</li>
            <li> You know how it is, when I need to shave, nothing but a nice clean smooth shave will do.</li>
            <li> Overall a very good transaction</li>
            <li> My shaver was not shaving very good recently.  </li>
            <li> Very good Electric razor and blades, used the same brand for years.</li>
            <li> Excellent, just as I expected.</li>
            <li> The provider did a great job shipping the shaving head and the price was far below the cost in the stores.</li>
            <li> , even my 8 year old model still works great.</li>
            <li> I believe the HQ9 gives me the closest and most comfortable shave of all the heads I have used.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying blades and a closer more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I never used the top of the line models, so can not compare the higher ends, but this is effective for me.</li>
            <li> So I bought them and am happy with the old razor again.</li>
            <li> The combination of the more powerful motor with the traditional type head is the best for my skin.</li>
            <li> My dad is happy to not be nicking his face with the old shaver heads.</li>
            <li> I have had this brand of shaver before and got many of years use from it, so I am happy that I made the correct choice and only purchased the head :)</li>
            <li> Just be sure to determine which replacement heads fit your razor model.</li>
            <li> the sound of the unit is better.</li>
            <li> Perfect, works as expected</li>

            <li> The good old HQ9 heads cut well and can run for a while before they need a cleaning or replacement.</li>
            <li> I purchased these replacement heads for my Norelco razor because the old ones were wearing out;  they no longer gave me a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Plus, they were only around $24.50, which is a good $10 cheaper than they are in most stores.  </li>
            <li> Good way to rejunvenate and old razor.</li>
            <li> versu an electric razor, but it is good enough on most days.    </li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> Over a period of time my old heads were not doing a good job.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The Norelco replacement heads I received fit nicely and serve very well.</li>
            <li> SO far so good.</li>
            <li> This is an old, but good.</li>
            <li> Saving nearly $70 makes good sense.</li>
            <li> Good product for an old razor..</li>
            <li> To be fair, my husbands shaver head was way old.  </li>
            <li> No problem with shipment or installation of the head, works better now with new head but not as good as when I first purchased the razor.</li>
            <li> Fits just like the original and shaves fine.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly and now I feel like I have a new razor with which I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> very glad we found them....was about to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you have the right model  </li>
            <li> So glad I looked on the internet and found just the right ones for my husbands razor.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you pick the right model for your razor.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you match up the model number of your razor to the right replacement set.</li>
            <li> They are a good replacement and significantly improve the shaving experience compared to my 18 month old heads.</li>
            <li> I had resharpended my old heads and found that this helped but durabilty was not as good as the original.</li>
            <li> Ready to go for a nice, clean  shave.</li>
            <li> In replacing the heads on an older (Top of the line) shavers I have to say these heads are ok.</li>
            <li> For some reason, Norelco has decided that these particular shaver heads should cost more than many shavers.</li>
            <li> Seems to be an original product and is a fit to the razor.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver and really loves the feature that allows you to run it under the shower to clean it!!</li>
            <li> Nice close shave just like the shaver was new!</li>
            <li> good value for a close shave... seems good shaves last for about a year before new heads are recommended</li>
            <li> If you regularly clean your shaver heads as directed on your shaver manual, do not expect a huge improvement in shaving.</li>
            <li> These replacements heads provide a smooth, clean shave without any nicks or discomfort.</li>

            <li> They are original brand replacements for the original heads.  </li>
            <li> After using the original Philips blades that came with my shaver for around 6 years.</li>
            <li> so long LOL ... ... ...</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted but at a much better price</li>

            <li> I was initially impressed by this line of razors and its blades, but no more.  </li>
            <li> makes me as happy as I can be while writing this here review that seems too long.</li>
            <li> Works and shaves just as well as the original shaving head.</li>
            <li> Result: these replacement head blades are inferior to the original blades that come with the shavers.</li>
            <li> This is my first replacement after more than three years of usage.</li>
            <li> After a year of use, it was time to replace the original blades</li>

            <li> Original quality blades .</li>

            <li> I thought it was original.</li>

            <li> Amazing what a difference new shaving heads make.</li>
            <li> Nice to have new blades</li>
            <li> Since replacing the heads, one pass is all it takes for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Clean close shave just would like trim part attatchd in stead of changn head.</li>
            <li> A clean shave and face with no cuts or pulls.</li>
            <li> Unless you own some top of the line foil razor that costs several hundred dollars and is made in Germany, these will have to do.  </li>
            <li> Clean shave</li>
            <li> They shave close and clean.</li>
            <li> Clean shaves again.</li>
            <li> Have used 3 different brands over the years, but these are by far the best.</li>
            <li> I will replace more often now that a reasonable pticed cutter head is available</li>
            <li> the Norelco shaver is many years old but the darn thing just wont die :)</li>
            <li> This is my third cordless shaver and the best one so far.</li>
            <li> Ah, Clean shaves gain.....</li>
            <li> No electric shaver can provide a perfectly clean shaven face like the snowplow method (razor and shaving cream) can do.</li>
            <li> Thought it was about time I did as all that was happening was the razor was pulling hair out of my face instead of a clean cut.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t clean them as often or as well as</li>
            <li> Good service and much needed product, thanks</li>
            <li> Just as good as the first shave with a brand new razor.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed, fit&#x27;s Philips shaver, easy to change heads.  </li>

            <li> I wholeheartedly recommend these replacement heads to anyone interested in a quick, satisfying shave.  </li>

            <li> Easy, close shave right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Easy to just drop right in.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on the Arctic Razors and people writing that the speedshaver was as good or better than the new product I decided to get a replacement head for my old speedshaver.  </li>
            <li> Returned my old razor to good as new without having to replace it :-)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> If your razor is old, this is a Good way to get faster and better cuts without getting a new razor</li>
            <li> When you buy original equipment replacement parts at a fair price - you get the proper performance.</li>
            <li> In followup to the previous comment, these replacements are actually quite nice and produce an excellent shave.  </li>
            <li> Good value, original parts that need to be regularly replaced.</li>
            <li> With these I feel like I have to go over certain spots more than others.</li>
            <li> nothing special</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so convenient to buy with Amazon vs. making a special trip to a store in search of the correct blade type.</li>
            <li> Nothing special here.</li>
            <li> That is right!  </li>
            <li> they work great, are way sharper than my old ones, and saved me a ton of money on a new razor!</li>
            <li> When these are new, they cut nicely, and I can shave quickly.  </li>
            <li> Oh, by the way, I decided to clean the \\&quot;head holder\\&quot; really good during this switch and my \\&quot;head holder\\&quot; got loose and wobbly so that it wasn&#x27;t staying in place like it used to (the 3 plastic holders were getting out of place rather easily).  </li>
            <li> perfect replacement fit, new blades make the 6 year old razor cut like new.</li>
            <li> Very good heads for one of the few good razors left.</li>
            <li> think my calm approach to the chat was important.</li>
            <li> They worked as expected and I am happy with the reads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty good about emptying my shaver of clippings frequently,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much better a fresh blade works and the autoship program keeps you from forgetting to change regularly.</li>
            <li> After owning several Norelco razors, including this one, my experience has shown that they are really good for about  2 years before you&#x27;ll note a degradation in the quality of the shave.      </li>
            <li> I regularly replace the heads and the shavers continue to provide good service.  </li>
            <li> ;, so that the shave is quick and clean.  </li>
            <li> I believe that a real razor delivers a closer and better shave.</li>
            <li> In any case paying $25-$30 once a year is better than spending that much every three months or so for Mach 3 heads.</li>
            <li> I also feel this is environmentally more responsible.</li>
            <li> Norelco recommends you replace them every year, but I get a good two years out of them before there&#x27;s a big drop off in performance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m good for another several years, now.</li>
            <li> Although their blades do an adequate job, their shavers are not quite as clean as the Gillette or Schick blades.</li>
            <li> That would be true if you have a lot of beard.</li>
            <li> At some point the cutters have to be replaced, and these are the ones to get back to good shaves.</li>
            <li> Always keep an extra set on hand and change once a year for a good shave</li>
            <li> Extremely simple to replace in the shaver and the quality was good.</li>
            <li> Best performance from your Norellco shaver requires that these heads are replaced at least 2X/yr.</li>
            <li> Very reliable and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> you buy this product, be sure to view one of the YouTube videos on how to replace the blades--much, much easier than the written instructions in the package.</li>
            <li> The product is good and I now have one for future use</li>
            <li> This is a good product but every man knows there is no such thing.</li>
            <li> The Amazon price is more reasonable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller but every bit as good.</li>
            <li> It kind of was a pain to place the cutters and shields into the old receptacle and &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Glad Amazon carries these as it makes ordering replacement blade so much easier than having to try and find them in a store or have a store employee unlock them from a case.</li>
            <li> Not like shaving with a razor, but good enough to suffice.  </li>
            <li> Many Thanks.</li>
            <li> Guess my shaver battery will give out first, but thus far these do give a good shave.</li>
            <li> Not a bad price too.</li>
            <li> They came quickly, we&#x27;re very easy to install and make the shaver work like new.  </li>
            <li> Exactly like the original, quick and easy to replace.  </li>
            <li> Works great and now the old razor has new life and meets my performance needs.</li>
            <li> I was glad that we didn&#x27;t have to purchase a new shaver as the replacement was available on-line.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are as good as having a whole new shaver but, for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> They allow him to shave much more quickly and they give him a really close shave.</li>
            <li> I replaced my older blades with the hopes of getting a closer shave, for I thought the older ones were not doing a good job.  </li>
            <li> It is very quiet, easy to use, and fits hands and face nicely.</li>
            <li> My old Philip shaver works like a new one with this heads, no need to buy a new shaver, save a lot, very good to me !</li>
            <li> Does this sound right?  </li>
            <li> They fit exactly right.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace old heads &amp; now shaver is good as new.</li>
            <li> These are exact replacement heads, which installed easily.  </li>
            <li> Every January, I quickly and easily install a replacement set of heads, even though the old ones were still working okay.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected-came on time - easy to use timed delivery.</li>
            <li> I had been using the electric shaver with the original heads for so long that it no longer gave me a good shave</li>
            <li> The Norelco replacement heads are original equipment so they shold fit exactly.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy to replace the old blades with these new ones, leading to distinctly more comfortable and closer shaves.</li>
            <li> I just like how this razor, which I&#x27;ve had since 2007, does not irritate my skin and gets a good shave as long as you keep the blades relatively clean.</li>
            <li> While certainly that will keep things more fresh, I waited almost four years.  </li>
            <li> Just at a far better price, in many cases as much as $10 cheaper!</li>
            <li> Always use the original replacement and will be worth it.</li>
            <li> They fit many different models, so make sure you order the right ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco says to replace the heads once a year.</li>
            <li> I think the new heads worked better than the original heads.  </li>
            <li> Fit perfectly, easy to install, makes my husband&#x27;s razor just like new!</li>
            <li> So nice when you put new blades in your shaver, makes it smooth and fast.</li>

            <li> If your face gets dirt on it and you do not get all of it off before using, as happens to me because of my line of work, you will quickly damage the comb.</li>
            <li> Since most new Norelco&#x27;s suck, you&#x27;re better off buying new heads once a year until somebody comes up with a better razor at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My Norelco is now like new, and is giving me a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> After I change it to new heads shaves very smooth.</li>
            <li> In fact a better price than at Wal Mart..($33.00)As said previously I was very pleased with all thing concerning this product....</li>
            <li> You can most likely save yourself the thirty bucks on new heads for another year or so, and keep getting that satisfying Norelco shave :)</li>
            <li> product for  older Norelco shavers!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and fit the razor.  </li>
            <li> These were cheap, fast and original.</li>
            <li> I shave both my face and head, so I&#x27;m very satisfied with the length they last.  </li>

            <li> The machine works like the very first day.</li>
            <li> Over all good shaver stays chargd long time.</li>
            <li> New blades bring new life to a good razor, smoother, closer and quicker.  </li>
            <li> My husband loved the new razor head, he said it was just like having a new razor.  </li>
            <li> got  the new heads for my electric razor for 1/4 of the price of buying a new razor--same result--closer shave --good comfort</li>
            <li> would have given the product five stars if the manufacturer had included the large easy to see replacement directions from the Amazon web site in the package.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement heads, he popped them into the old razor, and it&#x27;s working good as new again!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;New set of blades, and a quick recharge, and by razor is shaving like new again. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and so far haven&#x27;t heard any complains other than how great the replacement heads are and good saving in our pocket instead of buying another new unit.</li>
            <li> A great way to keep your Norelco mowing those whiskers down is replacing the heads and blades.  </li>
            <li> But before buying this, make sure that your old ones are clean.</li>
            <li> What will also give you a better shave is pouring hot water on the shave heads right after use, and cleaning each shave head with hot water and alcohol every month.</li>
            <li> I found myself returning more and more to my Gillette Fusion razor with increasing frequency each day; first to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; what the Norelco missed, then inevitably for full shaving creme and razor shaves.  </li>
            <li> The shaves were better but not what they were when the razor was new.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much better my shave became with these new blades.</li>
            <li> I had a new shaver with the top notch performance I used to get.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> I did not have to spend more to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re much better off buying a reconditioned speedshaver razor for around $42, which will include new heads.</li>
            <li> With the new heads in, both problems went away and I am therefore a happier, better shaved man now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These replacement HQ9 Norelco Shaver heads are rather pricey for sure, but they are still way cheaper than buying a brand new razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For about $40 you can buy a brand new Norelco shaver ie $10 more.</li>
            <li> better than buying a new razor</li>
            <li> The new ones always work noticeably better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because now my razor is like brand new.</li>
            <li> After installing the new ones, I wasn&#x27;t sure I could tell if there was an improvement.  </li>
            <li> I love getting new heads because they cut so close.  </li>
            <li> Better to save aggravation and just buy new razor.</li>
            <li> THEY WERE BETTER THAN NEW ONES.</li>
            <li> love this razor and did not want to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li> Renewed my razor now it works better than a new one I purchased to replace it with.</li>
            <li> and I am definitely glad we tried the replacement heads instead of the $$$ for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that we could buy these and not have to buy a new unit.  </li>
            <li> shaves a bit better with the new head.</li>
            <li> Purchased for two shavers and both work better with new heads.</li>
            <li> Better than buying a new Norelco, buy replacement blades for your model.</li>
            <li> I bought a new Panasonic razor and like it better than any razor I have used.</li>
            <li> The heads are a better way to go rather than buying a new razor.  </li>
            <li> Better than buying a new shaver</li>
            <li> Price was much more preferable to buying a new Norelco speed xl shaver .</li>
            <li> It is better than buying a new shaver to replace the blades.</li>
            <li> Shaver is now better than new</li>

            <li> Exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li> THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED NORELCO REPLACEMENT HEADS FROM AMAZON!</li>
            <li> This is my second pair of replacement blades on my 9160XL.One thing I have learned, all shavers shave great when they are new.</li>
            <li> Great product, big difference when with new blades.</li>
            <li> This is a much more economical solution than buying a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> After using his Razor daily for years he said everything was still working great, but maybe new replacement heads would make it like \\&quot;NEW\\&quot; again.</li>
            <li> This works great,; my Norelco is back to working like new.</li>
            <li> I forgot what a great shave felt like until I finally got new heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So nice to find replacement heads without having to buy a whole new razor.  </li>
            <li> Simple install, fits great, the razor is like new again.  </li>
            <li> And now that I have gotten them, it was worth the investment as my razor is like brand new and is shaving better.</li>
            <li> These heads make my 4 year old shaver good as new.  </li>
            <li> My 6 year old head gave me as good a shave as the new head.  </li>
            <li> Heads are easy to replace, and seemed to do a somewhat better job at daily chore of shaving.  </li>
            <li> Popped right in and got them quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much better the razor shaves with new blades, enough said...</li>
            <li> Now I get a clean shave just like when I first purchased the shaver.</li>
            <li> All is fine now, thanks to my wife&#x27;s dexterity and patience</li>
            <li> I received the new shave head and was able to pop it right on and start it up.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install and what a difference new blades make!</li>

            <li> Good quality and back to getting a clean shave with new blades.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and free.  </li>
            <li> This product provides a fast, smooth shave...</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS GREAT, BUT ONE OF THE OUTER ROUND BLADE COVERS HAD SEVERALSHARP JAGGED PIECES STICKINGOUT THAT SCRAPED MY FACE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and shaves much faster.</li>
            <li> Not so much a review as letting people know that these replacement heads will fit a Philip&#x27;s Speed-XL 8151XL model electric razor.</li>
            <li> They give a very close shave with my light beard, with no pulling at all.  </li>
            <li> Huge difference and much closer</li>
            <li> Just run the blades lightly over your face and they&#x27;ll cut very well.</li>
            <li> It was fast and accurate.  </li>
            <li> Worth getting, comes with 3 blades and 3 disks.</li>
            <li> Well, worth the money.</li>
            <li> I figure my purchase was well worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> What a world of difference to get these fresh blades.  </li>
            <li> No problem replacing old heads, totally satisfied with this ordering experience.</li>
            <li> and then Amazon had a nice price plus Norelco had a $5.00 Coupon for my next purchase.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the investment if you like your razor.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, and</li>
            <li> My helper did ask a bunch of questions - probably following some kind of decision tree approach.</li>
            <li> I now realized that the heads should be replaced regularly for your own convenience.</li>
            <li> Well worth the $25.</li>
            <li> r ok i think so far</li>
            <li> It almost makes one want to change heads every month (obviously not cost effective).  </li>
            <li> It was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Good OEM blades that perform as expected.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads for my razor arrived the very next day (ordered on a Sunday), very convenient when you are waiting to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> but frankly I have not seen an improvement worth talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better than my old blades.  </li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO SHAVE ANY BETTER THAN THE OLD HEADS.</li>
            <li> Excellent performance as expected from my prior purchase of replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> These are really worth the money.</li>
            <li> My Norelco razor was not cutting my whiskers well until I received the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love my old shaver...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Improved shaving, worth changing heads.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use an electric often, but this made my old shaver much more usable.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> but if you want your Norelco to shave closely, you need to replace the heads more frequently than you would like.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as well as it used to, even with fresh blades.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t replaced your heads in a year or so, worth getting.</li>
            <li> and I started using the old razor most of the time.  </li>
            <li> works a bit better than my 5 year old shaver head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t shave my beard worth beans anymore.  </li>
            <li> If you want to keep using the Norelco it means you have to buy replacement blades far more often then</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> Replacement parts function well and are a muck better buy than from Phillips direct.</li>
            <li> and I did not think the old blades were that warned but get a better shave now,thanks.</li>
            <li> I purchased these blades after my 3 year old ones just we&#x27;re not working all that well any more.</li>
            <li> it is worth the price to me</li>
            <li> really worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> Useful to replace once a year.</li>
            <li> The recent purchase through Amazon was very pleasing - good price and rapid service.</li>
            <li> I got these because my razor was not cutting well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t seem much better than the old ones, maybe its me.</li>
            <li> Searched every store without success.  </li>
            <li> Delivered sooner than expected at a fair price</li>
            <li> I waited too long to replace but am very satisfied</li>
            <li> My only problem is that they are rather pricey, and I would change them more often if I could find them at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, gives a close shave, charge holds for a long time, easy to clean,</li>
            <li> This purchase was a good buy, priced right and delivered quicker than I expected - and the quality/value was as advertised.</li>
            <li> made my razor like new again good deal would recomend to anyone who wants a new razor</li>
            <li> Do a quick cleaning (hot tap water if you have a water cleanable model) about once a week.  </li>
            <li> First quality and comes quickly when needed .</li>
            <li> They are high dollar, but work just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is similar to the original but not as smooth as the original.</li>
            <li> I got the right heads</li>

            <li> Right delivery</li>
            <li> They are replaced every year and they pop right into the shaver with no problem.  </li>
            <li> Norelco recommends doing it yearly, which sounds about right</li>
            <li> I checked on the Norelco web site to verify I was buying the right head.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;And, the price was right.</li>
            <li> The right replacement........happy.</li>

            <li> The heads are easily replaced, and for a thrifty price, you have a virtually new electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Rather than buying a new razor made it a easy decison</li>
            <li> My razor is over 5 years old, but I keep fresh rotary blades in it, and expect it to outlive me !!    </li>
            <li> No other maintenance step is more important to a GOOD ELECTRIC SHAVE than  SHARP HEADS!!!</li>
            <li> These fit an older razor.  </li>
            <li> always use the hq9 replacement heads &amp; as usual they do a good smooth shave</li>
            <li> While they still might work, they are not as smooth and it takes longer to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> they give a very close clean shave without the burn.</li>
            <li> I get burn and scratch marks on my neck and have to go over and over certain areas to get a full shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very easy to install, just open and put in razor.</li>
            <li> Sharp, gives a nice, clean shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Norelco shaver and it installs easily and is priced right - not much else to say - well satisfied</li>
            <li> Amazon made it easy to find replacement heads for my 3 hear old shaver, which are no longer carried at the store where I bought the shaver!</li>
            <li> A whole new razor might be a better solution.</li>
            <li> I was ready to buy a new shaver but the reviews on Norelco&#x27;s top tier offerings did not impress me.  </li>
            <li> Wow, The feeling of new blades is amazing on my face.</li>
            <li> If you live in the world of razors and care about them in detail and their &#x27;known&#x27; names you will know that a &#x27;Head&#x27; to Norelco/Philips is really the three blade units in what most I have asked would refer to as the head.</li>
            <li> So, I ordered one of these kits and my current shaver really as good as new.  </li>
            <li> The price here is most reasonable, compared to buying a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> This was a much better way to go then to buy a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> What I really needed was the HEAD HOLDER which caused me some delay since I wasn&#x27;t sure if I needed to order a separate HEAD HOLDER since the photo showed the heads installed on what I thought was a new head holder.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how effective the new blades are.</li>
            <li> Quiet, smooth, easy, charge lasts forever even after about 3 years.</li>
            <li> These new heads are working fine.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads were as promised, new in sealed package and they work fine.  </li>
            <li> My husband says the new replacement heads are working just fine.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working fine now with the new heads.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay for a great shave.  </li>
            <li> The service from Amazon was great, as usual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how long the Norelco shaver lasts, and how well it does.  </li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and liked it very much as the old head was dull and didn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li> Excellent, shaver is as good as new now &amp; at less than half the cost of a new one.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are pretty good when new, but definitely wear out well before the recommended 1-year replacement time-frame</li>
            <li> Be careful to read the fit of your norelco to make sure you buy the right ones.</li>
            <li> My original set must have lasted me 4 years and still seemed to be working decently</li>
            <li> packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum Feb 24/08:&lt;br /&gt;Interesting to note that they&#x27;ve changed the packaging on this product (since my original review) making it appear that it&#x27;s less hazardous to access.</li>
            <li> Parts delivered on time and fit shaver like new.</li>
            <li> It was a huge difference after I changed a new heads.  </li>
            <li> New blades made a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li> It was time and the new ones make my face smooth.</li>
            <li> By then one has forgotten just how smooth the road can feel when gliding along on brand new ones.    </li>
            <li> Maybe its the unit itself that needs to be replaced but that smooth shave is not there even with this new replacement head.</li>
            <li> New heads, smooth face, just follow the helpful instructions on the Amazon page.,</li>
            <li> I was about to purchase a new shaver when I came across this cheap and reliable option.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re exactly the right replacements and work the way that they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice an appreciably better shave with the new head over the older one.  </li>
            <li> Replacing the old heads was easy.</li>
            <li> I have replaced the heads on it about three times but the current ones are so old that I can&#x27;t fairly compare them to the heads on the two newest razors.</li>
            <li> It was easy to replace the old heads</li>
            <li> Was surprised how easy these replacement blades were to install...</li>
            <li> Received in super fast time.  </li>
            <li> Easy to replace the old one.</li>
            <li> It is like having a new razor!!!</li>
            <li> My  shaver is new again!!!</li>
            <li> like new!!!</li>
            <li> As long as the main machine keeps functioning this is always a welcome alternative to the ever-increasing prices of new shavers.</li>
            <li> This product arrived very quickly and was very easy to install (less than 30 seconds to replace heads) -- everything works as advertised!</li>
            <li> Local store didn&#x27;t have the right set in stock, Amazon did and with a better price.  </li>
            <li> : Easy to replace, not mess.</li>
            <li> was very fast.</li>
            <li> thank you very much....</li>
            <li> Thank you very much all working well</li>
            <li> then the stores around us and the products came very fast and on time in the mail.</li>
            <li> There were a series of 6 grommet eyelets surrounding the entire package making it very secure.</li>
            <li> and I like it very much but still prefer the one with the HQ9.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.  </li>
            <li> very fast and correct</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the face and legs.</li>
            <li> As much as the reduced speed on the inner ring and the reduced blade count seem to suggest otherwise, these things just simply do the best job I have seen in nearly 50 years of Norelco</li>
            <li> I found this information on Amazon very fast.</li>
            <li> Very fast service and my choice was just as ordered.</li>
            <li> The photo of this product is very much misleading.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these shaver heads for a little older model of shaver.  </li>
            <li> After about a year&#x27;s worth of shaving you would be surprised how much better a shave you will receive by purchasing new heads.  </li>
            <li> Worth a try before buying a new one that probably won&#x27;t work any better than your old one which has been my experience.  </li>
            <li> I like my old Norelco shaver and didn&#x27;t want to fork over the money for a new one, so it was a nice surprise to find that this seller offered replacement heads at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Fits my 5 year old razor fine.</li>
            <li> The cost savings are worth buying the replacements.. until something significant is developed by their R and D.</li>
            <li> As far as replacement heads go these are fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that i bought new heads for my razor instead of buying a new one.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, and much cheaper than buying a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> The Norelco HQ9 replacement heads were as described - new in original packaging.  </li>
            <li> Considering the cost of new electric razors, the opportunity to take your old razor and make it like new is very appealing.</li>
            <li> But wait the shaver still works great, it&#x27;s the blades that have become dull.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s shaver was in great condition, except for the heads being dull.  </li>
            <li> Have to have new blades every couple of months for my close clean shaves.  </li>
            <li> I always forget to get new shaving heads each year, just clean the ones I have and they seem ok.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> New blades always make for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> The new blades shave so clean.</li>
            <li> I also recommend buying a can of &amp;#34;Shaver Saver&amp;#34; and using it routinely to keep the blades clean and working like new.</li>
            <li> But recently Philips/Norelco have changed their design and not sure of the new models, seem to make more noise and are pricy even more and do not know how reliable they are, the older models are good</li>
            <li> Huge improvement from my old blunt heads.</li>
            <li> different with the picture,only have razor and the top cover, no basecover</li>
            <li> Wow, yes I know I sound like everyone else</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads work very well in my electric razor!</li>
            <li> No problem with the cutter and screen, but be aware: the replacement heads are just that:  the blades and screens.</li>
            <li> It does NOT include the entire top portion of the shaver that holds the cutters and screens, which is what broke on mine and the reason I bought the heads in the first place.</li>
            <li> I love getting the blades and fluid through subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li> I ordered replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s shaver and they are exactly what they said they were.</li>
            <li> is the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t obtain a straight answer when I called Philips!</li>
            <li> These replacements blades were exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Like all Norelco shaver heads, they work well at first then gradually wear out.  </li>
            <li> These were the exact replacements I needed.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for, and $10 cheaper than WalMart.</li>
            <li> The product arrived within the specified time frame and the heads are exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> First time I ever ordered these for my son.</li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON FOR SHOWING US THIS!</li>
            <li> the blades dont really shave well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many razor types over the year from regular blades to electric.  </li>
            <li> They have performed exactly as they should.</li>
            <li> Description of the product should be more specific.</li>
            <li> I am back to being smooth again !</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any reason to buy any place else and pay more for the same product</li>
            <li> I bought him on Amazon, as he really LOVES the shaver!</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and her when said...</li>
            <li> Although this what not the first time I have replaced the heads, this was the easiest time I have had purchasing the heads.</li>
            <li> Except for that Norelco items are first quality.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say I haven&#x27;t used the product yet.</li>
            <li> Once you see what is shipped, it&#x27;s pretty intuitive how to replace.  </li>
            <li> am definitely getting a closer shave in probably 2/3 the time and with more comfort.  </li>
            <li> my first shave with them completed.</li>
            <li> Very convenient!</li>
            <li> I have the feel I had when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li> First replacement I have done since having the razor for a year.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Norelco razors for several years and am quite satisfied with the products.</li>
            <li> I was able to get these Norelco replacement heads cheaper on Amazon.com than any of my local stores.  </li>
            <li> Ordered for my husband and was exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li> ensure that you note how the old blades fit in the head before you remove them.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had replaced the heads much sooner - worth every penny for a cleaner, closer shave.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads made a heck of a difference in the shave, this is first time I replaced them</li>
            <li> My first replacement head on the razor for ~10 years.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using the same heads for more than five years before I replaced them for the first time with these.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Much better price than I could find item for locally.</li>
            <li> and I am back to enjoying my morning shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what the manufacturer recommends for replacement.</li>
            <li> Were exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li> This items is exactly what my husband needed to replace the heads on his Phillips Norelco Shaver.  </li>
            <li> Solid quality original heads by the original manufacturer, came exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like when I first bought it and couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> These aer exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed.  </li>
            <li> As for the product I think that the heads should last more that 2 years.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll really notice the difference!</li>
            <li> Replacement heads came on time and the product was exactly what I ordered and needed.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered and delivered when promised.</li>
            <li> Will make sure I replace them sooner next time!</li>
            <li> Once received, i realized that this was exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> I will most likely will not be buying another set of replacement</li>
            <li> First replacement since I bought the razor.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li> First blade repurchase - no issues  </li>
            <li> After more time than we would like to admit, we finally replaced the heads on our Norelco Razor.</li>
            <li> Even though we were way past due in doing this we had received excellent longevity from our original heads.</li>
            <li> Wife remembers pictures of how to replace the replacements on the Amazon website, (a clue that the fix might be more than simple)  but husband will not use a computer complaining that the replacements are faulty and the paperwork from manufacturer makes no sense.  </li>
            <li> I attempted to order the first one through &amp;#34;One</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that this head/blade assembly will last me until the razor batteries die.  </li>
            <li> Product is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and cheaper than the store.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what we wanted.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> They should make them to be resharpened like they were when they were first introducted.  </li>
            <li> You can find one on the following website and you can resharping yours for 20 or more times.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> and I am as pleased with it the second time as I was the first.</li>
            <li> I can go out in public again. :)</li>
            <li> Yes, not no, definitely yes, stop asking for more</li>
            <li> They really do make a difference!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I finally bit the bullet, ordered them and now am so glad.  </li>
            <li> His reaction on the first morning, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s great!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> ; I won&#x27;t wait 2 years or more to change the head next time!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying any more in the future.</li>
            <li> I will come back and get more when needed</li>
            <li> The replacement heads definitely cut a lot better than the year</li>
            <li> After cleaning them (be sure not to mix up the cutters and their respective foils)</li>
            <li> They came much sooner than listed!  </li>
            <li> Better price than the big box stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order another set soon because the price is way better than the big boxes stores.</li>
            <li> They never leave me wanting more or something different.</li>
            <li> it necessary to write so many words?</li>
            <li> Interesting enough I have had my shaver for 6 years.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads were exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I was unsure, when in stores, exactly what Norelco shaver model was being used.</li>
            <li> Hubby said it&#x27;s exactly what it should be.</li>
            <li> There should be an option to buy the installed replacement heads even at a somewhat higher price.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> And subsequently I ordered 2 more pcs to keep spare</li>
            <li> The description could be more specific because I didn&#x27;t realize it was a pack of three sets</li>
            <li> They came on time and were exactly what I had ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li> Had the same razor for too many years</li>
            <li> Fortunately, he still had the old razor.  </li>
            <li> These replacement heads were exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Should have looked on Amazon first.</li>
            <li> And that was the case with my most recent set as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The replacement head made a big difference; I got a closer shave for sure.</li>
            <li> Now with this replacement heads my Norelco will cut the facial hair in stead of pulling them out with the more than used heads.</li>
            <li> and they should last way more then a year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I suspect the all-rectangle design actually removes more faster.</li>
            <li> I was concern about the quality at first.</li>
            <li> These are great and long lasting products.,</li>
            <li> But, I continued to use the broken assembly and the blades worked very nicely and gave a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li> Shaving is so much better when you have clean, sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> Makes my old Norelco shaver work like new again just like it did when I first used it many years ago.</li>
            <li> I have been getting a much better shave with my razor since replacing the old blades with these new ones.</li>
            <li> I was looking at and now my old Norelco shaves better than it did when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> The price is nice and it&#x27;s like having a new razor every several months.</li>
            <li> When I installed the new heads, performance improved, but not enough to warrant this kind of expenditure every year.</li>
            <li> I am always surprised by how much better new blades shave.</li>
            <li> My razor was still good and in the past threw them away and just bought a new razor, but thought I would try the new heads instead and am so satisfied I did.</li>
            <li> Perfect and much less than expected to have to pay</li>
            <li> It is amazing how a 3 year old razor shaves like new with new blades.  </li>
            <li> I have used these type of new blades before and they always work good when new, but I probably don&#x27;t replace them enough.</li>
            <li> It works very well and it was the right replacement for his&lt;br /&gt;older model Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2.)The new blades functioned perfectly; because the decline in performance of the original blades was so gradual, it was difficult to believe how much of an improvement these replacement blades</li>
            <li> The Norelco original cutters give the long and accurate performance that you expect.</li>
            <li> , I was getting a very poor shave with what I had always thought was the best electric razor I ever owned.</li>
            <li> Once I put in the new blades that came quick and just like you&#x27;d find in a store, well i was all laughs and smiles to see how much of a difference they made!</li>
            <li> I have a more recent model Norelco but its price for new heads is more than twice the price of the new heads for the older razor</li>
            <li> The installation is very quick and easy and for less than $30.00 I was able to take my two year old Norelco razor and make it shave like it was brand new.</li>
            <li> They work perfectly, and it&#x27;s always a relief to get rid of old dull cutters and then rediscover that new ones really do make a difference!</li>
            <li> I replace the heads of my Norelco Shaver yearly and it was nice to have a reminder from Norelco that I was due to change the cutters</li>
            <li> Shaver was 5+ years old with original heads.  </li>
            <li> It is probably 10+ years old, and was still using the original blades.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faster than my old HQ8 shaver and faster than the HQ9 shaver with the original HQ9 heads.</li>
            <li> The original blades were two years old.</li>
            <li> Original  heads were about 26 months old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an improvement over the original blades (who were 4 years old).</li>
            <li> Nice sharp blades, what else can you say.</li>
            <li> But other than that, the new head feels great and is like having a new razor again.</li>
            <li> Original replacements for a lot less and free shipping!</li>
            <li> PRO - New heads work like new, easy to replace.  </li>
            <li> Wow...never realized how quick a shave was supposed to be until I put new blades in the razor.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for quickly sending a new set that immediately improved my morning shave!</li>
            <li> Easy to take out the old &amp; put in the new!</li>
            <li> I had been neglecting to properly clean my 14 month old Speed-XL shaver.  </li>
            <li> Oddly the old blades were still shaving OK, but after more than 2 years of use replacement seemed overdue.</li>
            <li> The price of this sale was good but for about the same price and without the price of shipping I could have purchased this product at a local store and not had to wait three weeks for it.</li>
            <li> My Norelco shaver was taking noticeably longer and far more passovers to complete my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the cheap Chinese blades and they aren&#x27;t worth a flip....</li>
            <li> really believe the shave I am getting is only marginly better.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement head after 3 years, was unsure how much it would help but it definitely feels better.</li>
            <li> made in the netherlands and is superior to former Chinese made products..</li>
            <li> My husband loves them and says no other brand shaves his head as smooth as these.  </li>
            <li> Thanks very much.  </li>
            <li> Fast, very fast service.</li>
            <li> He likes them very well and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> THANKS VERY MUCH...</li>
            <li> The original heads lasted a little more than a year.</li>
            <li> they function adequately the blades make a strange sound</li>
            <li> All in all good product, wish Philips/Norelco will bring back older better models though with this kind of cutting</li>
            <li> Received the new shaver heads quickly and installed them easily for a big improvement in shaving performance.</li>
            <li> The blades were now sharp but what a chore ,I had thought running water through the head would keep it clean ,but no not that easy.</li>
            <li> The blades were now sharp but what a chore ,I had thought running water through the head would keep it clean ,but no not that easy.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user (30 years) of Norelco heads and am generally satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Web site said it would fit one of the razors, but it fit the other one</li>
            <li> Ihave ordered several other things from Amazon and have also been happy with the timeleness and service, and price.</li>
            <li> Overall feeling is better but would not say it is worth the money paid unless your old heads work well.</li>
            <li> Its good as usual.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new blades fit my machine (thankfully) and it is like shaving with a brand new shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the price was nearly half of the cost of the shaver, they made my shaver as good as new.</li>
            <li> I live in a very car congested area and it is a pleasure to buy on line with quick service.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove old heads and replace with the new heads.  </li>
            <li> The Phillips Norelco HQ9 Speed XL replacement heads dropped in easily and turned my old shaver into a new shaver.</li>
            <li> easy to perform the substituition of the old blades by this new ones.</li>
            <li> I picked this vendor because the price was right and the customer satisfaction score was high.</li>
            <li> The price was pretty high for just one replacement head, though, so I&#x27;d check around first.</li>
            <li> The original shaving heads had three circles of blades, 12 around the outside and 9 more arranged on the inner two circles.</li>
            <li> The shave is as good as the original, but give me a few months and check back to see if they hold up.</li>
            <li> It is easy to install, it brings performance back to high quality; and I realize I should replace my blades on a more regular basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price of a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Fresh refills make my razor work like it&#x27;s new again.</li>
            <li> It took me a very long time to figure out that these were the replacement heads I needed for my shaver (there are many choices, and none of them matched the model number of the shaver).  </li>
            <li> One suggestion is that the manufacturer could give more detailed instructions instead of just printing a small section on the packaging.  </li>
            <li> These shaver heads were easy to install and made a big difference in the closeness of the shave I&#x27;ve been getting.  </li>
            <li> They cut quickly cut and don&#x27;t Knick like old heads do.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten how nice a shave I could get over the year and a half or two that I have the razor.</li>
            <li> Reading these reviews as I contemplated purchasing the replacement heads, I was reminded of the the need to clean  and oil the blades regularly, and as I did so, I found the heads impacted with stubble to such a degree that if is a wonder the blades were able to revolve at all.</li>
            <li> Easy installation and instant gratification.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box of the heads is an easy open no fuss type.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> The blades are as advertised, and they came with easy visual instructions on how to change them.</li>
            <li> No problems,  easy to install and simply works.  </li>
            <li> Buying from Amazon is easy and cheaper than local prices.</li>
            <li> Easily installed by following diections.</li>
            <li> He said it has been a long time since he had such a good shave.  </li>
            <li> No new face, but it was certainly a lot better than before.  </li>
            <li> I use the electric razor to get the primary hair down to a light stubble</li>
            <li> As there are fewer slots for the whiskers, I certainly hope that it works as well.</li>
            <li> I cannot be certain.   </li>
            <li> The heads are used on my 9160XL smart touch shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Norelco 9160XL Smart Touch razor about a year or so ago.</li>
            <li> Will certainly reorder when needed.  </li>
            <li> just be certain that it is the correct model for your machine.</li>
            <li> Certainly will purchase again.  </li>
            <li> finally discovered that the older, more traditional HQ8 heads actually fit in the HQ9  shaver.</li>
            <li> Like getting a brand new shaver for under $30!!  </li>
            <li> Because now when I shave my razor feels like it was new out of the box!!</li>
            <li> My shaver works like new again!!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t you buy the old lift-and-cut heads to fit you new Smart-Touch shaver?  </li>
            <li> When I finally do, I realize how much better the shaver works with new heads.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy new blades more often.</li>
            <li> I love my Norelco shaver and these brought it back up to new shaving conditions.  </li>
            <li> I will get a second set and replace even these new ones more often.</li>
            <li> there work great and cost all $10,00 less than the last set I bought</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be an upgrade over my cheaper HQ8 shaver with the HQ9 having a slightly faster, more powerful motor.</li>
            <li> Used the new heads right away.</li>
            <li> Then, right after the warranty had expired, the new razor wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.  </li>
            <li> Certainly beats going to a store trying to fine what you want only to find out that the item was out out stock</li>
            <li> Keep your eyes open for these types of deals and for Amazon coupons that may reduce your cost of blades or make it worthwhile to buy a whole new razor for the cost of replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Not as good as new, but close enough to get another year&#x27;s use of the present blades..</li>
            <li> If you have an associated razor,and need blades, this is the only product to get, but if you already like the razor, it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> &amp; yes you seem to be the only one i could fine for me to purchase from.</li>
            <li> But by the third use there working fine.</li>
            <li> If there is nothing further in this comment it meant that the blades are fine and I will raise the rating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t get a decent shave!  </li>
            <li> All in all, I recommend them very highly.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have always found the quality control of the Philips shaving heads to be of a very high Standing.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are very good on my tough beard and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I shave with the Braun first then clean up whats left with my Norelco.</li>
            <li> Although it is easy to replace these new heads, the shaving outcome was not what I expect it like the original heads did, i.e., not as sharp.</li>
            <li> It was really hard to find this item, let alone at a good price.  </li>
            <li> finally a good shave after trying to shave with dull blades....</li>
            <li> The improvement in my razor with the new heads was significant and I will never again use old heads for an extended period.  </li>
            <li> The new blades were easy to install and made my old razor work like new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for years and find these heads to be very sharp and very easy to change on your shaver.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, fast</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> You should change these twice yearly to keep getting the close shave that the shaver is capable of providing.</li>
            <li> The shipping was rapidly and the item is very well.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s cheeks are so much smoother now with these sharper blades.</li>
            <li> He now gets a much closer shave and it doesn&#x27;t take him 15 minutes to shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The razor and blades are really quiet and give him a really smooth face.  </li>
            <li> Be sure and LOOK CAREFULLY as you disassemble the heads.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for providing that service.</li>
            <li> They fit back in and run but do not shave.</li>
            <li> I took out so much gunk.</li>
            <li> Much needed item.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and the blades are the real item.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, very well packed</li>
            <li> My razor hadn&#x27;t been cuttign as smoothly, leaving lots of irritation and red bumps.</li>
            <li> I really like my Norelco 1851 XL electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this shaver and he really likes this product.</li>
            <li> He says that he can get a really close shave using this Philips Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> Use every day thanks for making it affordable</li>
            <li> No need to replace the whole shaver.</li>
            <li> My skin is much happier.</li>
            <li> and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> but, the whole set with the frame.</li>
            <li> I want to gripe about how much is charged.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Thanks  john d</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to replace the whole shaver if the motor, battery and trimmer are working well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, will recommend</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> After replacing the cutters, it really restored the effectiveness of the razor.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> the 8240XL is much better than the SensoTouch, although with the SensoTouch you can use it for a wet shave.</li>
            <li> If I skipped a day, oooh, much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted PhillipsNorelco via their chat function on their website help page and described the problem.</li>
            <li> FAST shipment.</li>
            <li> Made a big and comfortable difference.</li>
            <li> Very satisfactory transaction.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say.  </li>
            <li> My husband really likes these.  </li>
            <li> but my shave didn&#x27;t improve much since I swapped them.</li>
            <li> Really fast order to delivery time.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to throw it away, even though my wife paid over $200 for it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was very upset.</li>
            <li> the item arrived fast and well packed.</li>
            <li> I rerplace mine once very two years.</li>
            <li> thanks for having choices to buy at a savings to customers.</li>
            <li> I buy these every year and it really helps to prevent the razor burn on the neck.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, one cannot beat convenience of electric shavers and the quality of the Norelco shave is very close to the blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The metal is much thinner.</li>
            <li> A couple of replacement blade sets costs almost as much as the razor.  </li>
            <li> yes, it is very good~&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> yes, it is very good~&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisifed with both the Norelco razor and the HQ9 replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> I also reccoemnd that you utilize the spreay lubricant, it makes the change-out process much smoother and use it to freshen up your razor.</li>
            <li> i have been ordering these replacement heads once a year since i got my razor.always very satisfied.will order again in a year.</li>
            <li> They just cost too much.</li>
            <li> Thanks.    </li>
            <li> When received, box crushed in a bit but product was OK.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> Now the razor is working very well</li>
            <li> They come with the blades only and not the holder that they fit in.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> however they continue to function with out much of a problem.</li>
            <li> I told them thanks for letting me see why I would never shop here and condem them to anyone that wanted to listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way to go Amazon and thanks again.</li>
            <li> Popped them into my shaver and was instantly rewarded with a close, comfortable shave.    </li>
            <li> Much cleaner/closer shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Renewed my shaving experience back to close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really needed it guys.</li>
            <li> Head was not packaged very well so that when I removed the 3 heads, the blades fell off</li>
            <li> Get the real thing, not a knock off.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, received in a very timely fashion.  </li>
            <li> Also like the fact the blade does&#x27;nt cost as much as the shaver.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> Should have done it a whole lot sooner.</li>
            <li> Priced reasonable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient and fast.  </li>
            <li> Price was also reasonable.</li>
            <li> Actually had metal burrs that were not machined smooth.</li>
            <li> Should have really ordered these sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Feels</li>
            <li> thanks amazon.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much cheaper per shave.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads need to be continually lubricated to give a reasonably close shave.  </li>
            <li> these worked very well</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Why do replacement heads cost so much money, it&#x27;s probably 1/3 the price I paid for my shaver.</li>
            <li> Very noisy and vibrates shaver.  </li>
            <li> I AM VERY UPSET</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my shaver, I was sent individual shaver replacements.</li>
            <li> I REALLY SHOULD HAVE CHANGED THE BLADES EVERY 2 YEARS</li>
            <li> Fast shipping/handling too.</li>
            <li> Still do not cut very well.???</li>
            <li> So thanks again.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product as described.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work very well.  </li>
            <li> Norelco shavers have some really durable design.</li>
            <li> Norelco just wants you to buy them each and every year.  </li>
            <li> These blades really exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> After a while the blades wore out and wasn&#x27;t shaving him real well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> has worked out very well for him.</li>
            <li> What can be said it came fast was cheaper and was the name brand replacement.</li>
            <li> Thanks Norelco</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is very competetive, and serivce is prompt.  </li>
            <li> Price was much below list price.  </li>
            <li> Over time you forget how fast and close a shave can be.</li>
            <li> how it felt, but it really didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment-</li>
            <li> Received fast, no instructions included but got from the web.&lt;br /&gt;Installed in a click and ready to shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> OK - Just what we expected with no suprises.</li>
            <li> Very misleading picture.  </li>
            <li> They really make a difference.</li>
            <li> I am&lt;br /&gt;Going to save so much money in shaving cream and razor blades.</li>
            <li> They have worked really well.</li>
            <li> Really nothing to stay</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my shaver head and this product did the trick with reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads worked very well.</li>
            <li> Nothing much you can say about replacement heads either they work or they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The&lt;br /&gt;product was received very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fast service and saved a lot on purchase price not to mention money saved by having not to drive 20 miles to buy it.  </li>
            <li> reasonable price as compared to retail &amp;#34;brick an mortar&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The thing I don&#x27;t like about these heads is how much Norelco charges for them.  </li>
            <li> Fast Delivery.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for being there when I need you.  </li>
            <li> Placed order, got them surprisingly fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close, but very acceptable.</li>
            <li> Gets them much cleaner that water.</li>
            <li> Can really tell the difference in the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t answer another survey because you want too much.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I fully expect they will perform very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, arrived on time and worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> shaving experience much improved for me&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought I will get the whole head like the picture shows.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to toss my shaver out, because my blades were worn out.</li>
            <li> IF I DONT REPLACE THE WHOLE UNIT</li>
            <li> much to say their blades</li>
            <li> The blades are so secure in the plastic casing, it takes quite an effort to open the package.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> do want to give a shout out to Surrational for his comment about not applying too much pressure when shaving with these.  </li>
            <li> In fact, don&#x27;t really push at all.  </li>
            <li> At least the price at Amazon is good.</li>
            <li> I suppose the old blades were still OK because I am get the same shaving results.</li>
            <li> I bought my Norelco three years ago and it has not been giving a good shave lately.  </li>
            <li> Will replace the heads more frequently in the future.</li>
            <li> Good, but didn&#x27;t notice that much better cutting ability</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m not sure anything new would have been an improvement, so for this small investment I&#x27;m pretty sure I made the best choice possible.  </li>
            <li> New blades, same old battery inside, and just the usual excellent shave.</li>
            <li> Good as usual!</li>
            <li> Exactly what my razor needed to make it function new again.</li>
            <li> exact fix no problems cuts like brand new</li>
            <li> ,that&#x27;s because the new blades sit higher.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s first new blades ever</li>
            <li> First time I used these in my razor it was like having a new razor again.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, as long as you don&#x27;t drop one of the 3 heads and watch it roll under the bed.</li>
            <li> So I use these heads in the old style, non-floating head razors and they work faster and cut closer then the old original heads.</li>
            <li> I know that the cost of the head leaves one wondering if they should just bite the bullet and buy a new one for a little more than twice the cost, but I am glad that I only purchased the head.</li>
            <li> these particular heads cut best of all they have three sets of cutting blades</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like about an original manufacturer&#x27;s replacement part at a price cheaper than the big box discount store, ordered and received without driving, parking, or walking?</li>
            <li> The shaving head is the same as the original head that comes with the razor.</li>
            <li> The name is a bit misleading, I originally thought when ordering the part it included the holder as well and discovered that it did not only after receiving the pars.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually I shave every 5 days and it keeps getting the same quality as I had on my original razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I just hope they&#x27;ll last longer than the 3 months it took for the original blades to start to lose their sharpness).</li>
            <li> About 50% more than what I paid for replacement blades for other Norelco razors.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to have ANY electric razor give me an extremely close/clean shave.  </li>
            <li> brought back the close shave, I had with the original set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But since it&#x27;s manufactured in US, There are lot of custom, taxes which was significant to the actual cost of product.</li>
            <li> And the replacement only lasted about 8 months while the original blades lasted years.</li>
            <li> the lower cost of the HQ8 blades and the HQ8 do a pretty good job, so I buy a few sets of both and mix the HQ8 and HQ9 on the same shaver (yes, they both work on any series of Norelco designed for either)</li>
            <li> My husband is extremely pleased to have his blades sharp again and working so well.</li>
            <li> your razor is iffy on batteries or other issues, might be better to replace.</li>
            <li> These are factory replacement heads so the will be the same as the ones that came you your razor originally.  </li>
            <li> replacement heads same as what was on shaver...easy to replace - work like the original ones .</li>
            <li> These are the same blades that originally came with my Phillips Norelco 8240 XL shaver.</li>
            <li> any cheap knock offs.noreleco has always stuck to a high standard</li>
            <li> Keep a spare set around because prices don&#x27;t go down and genuine Norelco stainless cutters are worth the difference and give you your moneysworth.</li>
            <li> and I use the suction hose of a vacuum to really get the shaver clean.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have the replacement heads, it&#x27;s like a whole new razor!</li>
            <li> Remove the old ones noting the posistion they go in and just put the new ones in the same posistion, close the top</li>
            <li> Once you open the top, flip the mechanism that holds the blades, you just take the old ones out and replace with the new ones.  </li>
            <li> so I experienced a dramatic increase in the ease and closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> I have the Norelco cleaning machine, but if you dont have one you can use any container, mix the water with the wash in the container, then dip your razor machine on into the container several times until it is thourally clean.</li>
            <li> I did not realize that I did not have to endure pulled whiskers and multiple passes to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves his razor so much, he will continue to replace these blades on his Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL razor as long as they are available.  </li>
            <li> I wish had had purchased earlier as I am now getting a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I clean them regularly with alcohol and add a drop of razor oil to each blade assembly.  </li>
            <li> I have used Norelco so long I cannot say enough nice things  </li>
            <li> The original lasted for about 2yrs, but once I replaced the heads, it&#x27;s back to being new again!</li>
            <li> Shaving is much better with these sharp, new blades!</li>
            <li> When the shaver takes longer to achieve a clean shave, simply replace the heads and it works like new!</li>
            <li> My face is extra smooth with these new blades.</li>
            <li> The new blades are excellent, but expensive, you probably could get a new shaver for a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> The description was enough for me to get the right heads on the first try and the shipping was done in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> but I have typically been able to use them for twice that amount of time without much noticeable difference in shave</li>
            <li> In a week they were less effective than the year old heads.</li>
            <li> My razor had become less effective than when it was new, and these heads restored it to its new condition.</li>
            <li> The new head came quickly and made my old razor work like new.</li>
            <li> This certainly beats buying a new razor as I one I was reviewing was $80.</li>
            <li> but I should have changed these long ago, what a change, smooth as a blade again.</li>
            <li> Not sure why anyone would change them every 6 months as recommended unless you own stock in norelco.</li>
            <li> Foil razors are the best, but they are expensive for the good ones and the replacement parts are expensive.  </li>
            <li> Had to send back with full reimbursement.</li>
            <li> I got it in a couple days and it made a new razor out of my old one...and the price was right.</li>
            <li> As long as you order the right make and model, you should get the right blades and cover you need for your shaver.</li>
            <li> Please note that you are not getting a new head holder, only the 3 heads (rotary blades).&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the new blades work just fine.</li>
            <li> Have been using Philips/Norelco for long (nearly 15 yrs) and cannot seem to live w/o them now; I feel them better than even razor blade shaving.  </li>
            <li> New shaver heads show up, takes about 1 minute to pop them into the shaver, and Bob&#x27;s your uncle!</li>
            <li> Just like new!</li>
            <li> You may think that you purchased a new razor!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just like getting a brand new shaver!</li>
            <li> New razor heads - ahhh!  </li>
            <li> I could not believe the difference the new blades made!</li>
            <li> The razor cuts as if it were brand new!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like owning a new shaver!</li>
            <li> Replacing the heads is like getting a new razor!  </li>
            <li> Its like getting a new shaver!</li>
            <li> He says that his electric razor works like it is brand new, again!</li>
            <li> After a year you gradually forget what a new razor is like!</li>
            <li> My razor is like new again!</li>
            <li> my husband enjoys his new replacement head for his razor!</li>
            <li> These new heads were just what my razor nedded to bring it back to its original performance.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are the same as the original ones that came with it new.  </li>
            <li> He now changes heads on his razor every 6 months or so instead of buying a new razor every 12-18 months!  </li>
            <li> If your sitting on the fence about getting new blades wait no longer!  </li>
            <li> and it is like I have a new one!</li>
            <li> Works like I bought a a new razor!</li>
            <li> But besides this, I like the product because my shaver works like brand new again!</li>
            <li> yourself some money and replace the Heads--Don&#x27;t buy a new shaver !</li>
            <li> the difference some new blades can make on your shaver until you replace the ones you are using!</li>
            <li> Like having a new razor!</li>
            <li> After the fist time I changed them out, it was like having a brand new razor!</li>
            <li> Bought these replacement heads and my shaver is like new again!</li>
            <li> Dont toss your razor, buy new blades!</li>
            <li> Feels like new again!</li>
            <li> Razor works like new!</li>
            <li> My razor is just like new again, what a difference!</li>
            <li> My husband was delighted with how well this replacement part worked compared to the old dull shaver head.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say other than I am glad the replacement blades were available</li>
            <li> Husband really likes these kind of razors, hard to get a decent price in the stores</li>
            <li> Shaver works like new for one third of new price,  made a huge difference</li>
            <li> This new set of cutters,however,  made a very noticeable improvement in the shavers performance.</li>
            <li> I was ready to buy a new razor when I bought the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> says like a whole new razor.  </li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t like the shaver so much I would have bought a new one.</li>
            <li> So I did replace the heads and didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the \\&quot;old\\&quot; heads verses the new heads.  </li>
            <li> and you are ready for a brand new shave.</li>
            <li> needed new heads and it was a whole lot cheaper than I could find in any of the stores in our town.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The new razor heads really make a difference.</li>
            <li> New blades make a real difference after almost 3 years.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying whole new razor</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> was going to replace my razor but didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for a new one.</li>
            <li> He has 3 Norelcos and whether they need a new head or not, he wants replacements.  </li>
            <li> They are like new again, which for an electric razor, isn&#x27;t saying much.</li>
            <li> but of course it&#x27;s much cheaper than buying an new razor when yours is functional.  </li>
            <li> I have had this razor over 10 years now and it is still going like new thanks to replacement blades once a year.</li>
            <li> The new Philips heads didn&#x27;t make much of a change in the razor giving a closer shave.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting a whole new mechanism not just the heads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is much cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Work well, and, still much cheaper than buying a new shaver every year.</li>
            <li> They just seem to cost too much for what you get, but it&#x27;s cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco HQ9 replacement heads are a real value and my shaver feels like it is brand new.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than a totally new shaver.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize how much of a difference it makes until you put in new ones.</li>
            <li> What can I say, they were deliverd fast and they are OEM and made my razor like new again.</li>
            <li> I wish it were so easy to get the same new life out of this old face...</li>
            <li> My old heads were getting to the point they weren&#x27;t effective, with new heads it takes half the time to shave.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that after several years of everyday use there wasn&#x27;t a great deal of difference with new heads.  </li>
            <li> Norelco suggests changing them once a year but again, my better half waits until his face looks like a broom.</li>
            <li> Giving a lot better shaves and less burn.</li>
            <li> These blades work much better and the pricing is also much less than retail in a drug store.</li>
            <li> (and I use these at most twice a week, usually less).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its me but based on some reviews that I have seen I have to agree that it seems like the older heads were just as good (being at least 11yrs old).</li>
            <li> Again, likely my fault for not making sure I was getting what I needed (the internal assembly and the blades).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a daily shaver, and these seem to last me about one year, before it feels like the razor is pulling more than slicing.  </li>
            <li> Product came quickly and the install only took a minute</li>
            <li> If your blades are older your skins will thank you .</li>
            <li> Now my razor is older and replacement heads for it</li>
            <li> I have kept my older model Norelco razor that used HQ8 heads and replaced with these HQ9 heads.</li>
            <li> Waiting till we go to a larger town is such a nuisance to not even find them for a better price than Amazon.</li>
            <li> Suspect newer technology is not a substantial as the older ones.</li>
            <li> and I did not realize it until packaging and older head covers were discarded</li>
            <li> Ok the second and third month.  </li>
            <li> I have and older model razor and couldn&#x27;t believe they still made the blades for it.</li>
            <li> This will probably be the last time I purchase replacement heads and simply rely on the refreshing feeling of cleaning with the norelco cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> /replace my older models of Philips shavers so continuing with them and so buying these heads.  </li>
            <li> replaced older heads on razor.</li>
            <li> am sure you can put this item in a smaller bag, not in a big box&lt;</li>
            <li> It gives a decent shave.</li>
            <li> It is hard to be sure you have the right heads for the shaver.</li>
            <li> A  Good value for product not easily found locally.</li>
            <li> The triple track cutters have more sharp edges and corners in them that the earlier single track models (I&#x27;ve been a Norelco man for some 30 years now), and they trap and hold more gunk than ever before.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccommend these.</li>
            <li> I do not think that is legal,also $5.00  for shipping is high for a 3 oz item.     </li>
            <li> Quality otherwise is usuall high grade, neatly done.</li>
            <li> Also, in my experience Philips products are always high quality.</li>
            <li> but their cost is way too high given the price of the razor.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> This shows that the quality of these blades must be high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this company their contributing companies.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the item.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend to change your heads every year.</li>
            <li> Fit my requirements, exact what i was looking for long time, tried to find this prodcut in several sites with no success,&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was fast as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> On time and high quality</li>
            <li> Even the cheapest new Norelco model cuts better than the most expensive replacement heads.</li>
            <li> If they are kept clean they can be stretched to almost two years.  </li>
            <li> If these last a year and a half or more, I will say they are worth the price.</li>
            <li> As always these norelco heads are top of the line products, I have used other shaving products, and they can&#x27;t come near the close</li>
            <li> I rated it a 4 because it works fine and shaves my face as expected.  </li>
            <li> These HQ-9 heads came in an original Norelco box, and after installing them, I had noticed a big difference from the old blades.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco motor and battery have held up very well and the new replacement head makes it work like new.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I have a new razor for much cheaper than buying a new one.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say as this is a replacement set, but it was easy to install and the difference with the new blades was noticeable immediately.</li>
            <li> However, had I done a little more research</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Its much more sturdy than all the little flimsy ones out there now</li>
            <li> I may have to use this for a little longer to be sure.  </li>
            <li> A great shave now and for the past 20 years!!!</li>
            <li> First, the charging stand on the new razor wouldn&#x27;t work, so he ended up using the cord from his old razor to charge the new one.  </li>
            <li> My razor was between 2 and 3 years old, and was not preforming particularly well despite keeping the blades very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can not speak for other models, but this one makes the heads really easy to replace.  </li>
            <li> Norcelco replacement head blades are sharp and rinse off easily after using.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell that the new blades were any sharper than my old ones!  </li>
            <li> New blades make your Norelco feel like a New Norelco!</li>
            <li> got my new heads &amp; so glade to have a new set again!  </li>
            <li> orgered the blades on mon am,rec.it on sat.very fast shipping,blades work extremely well and easy to install and remove old blades.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this is that as the shaver head gradually wears down, it is hard to notice that it is taking longer and more passes to get a good shave.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Hit the wrong star item purchase was great.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco is still running and I will not be replacing it until it absolutely gives up the ghost..</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much difference there was between th old blades and these.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference when changing out my years old blades.</li>
            <li> but I really haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in the shave versus that 3+ year old blades that were on there before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just rinse them out once every two weeks with hot water and once every couple months or less clean them with a brush.</li>
            <li> These are difficult to find locally and so being able to buy them here is really nice.  </li>
            <li> The improvement over the knock-off razors is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Philips Norelco razor for three years and it truly lives up to its name and always gives me a great shave as long as I keep it cleaned and change the blades at least once a year.</li>
            <li> They should state the real feature of the 2 blade system as \\&quot;The first blade lifts up the hair, and the second blade rips out the hair\\</li>
            <li> a few more years.</li>
            <li> Price has increased, but quality worth paying the extra (Made in Holland).    </li>
            <li> I should replace the heads more often than once every few years.  </li>
            <li> I rarely track the &amp;#34;in service&amp;#34; of something simple like a razor head.  </li>
            <li> But, I got a better price and had in just a few days.</li>
            <li> LOWER THAN NORMAL</li>
            <li> As usual these blades make a super clean cut just like the originals that came with the razor.  </li>
            <li> There is a little less support for one of the blades but it still shaves pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product instead of buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> After more than 2 Year&#x27;s time shaving (male over 60) with prior set of Made In Holland HQ-9 blades in my old 7110X Norelco, just felt like new HQ-9 blades were in order.</li>
            <li> I decided that the two year old razor blades I was using neded replacement but to be honest I&#x27;m not sure I am experiencing a difference with the new ones</li>
            <li> Fine, not as sharp as others</li>
            <li> I have used these replacement heads for some time with never a dull shave  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok like the previous one from morel co!</li>
            <li> DIDN&#x27;T NOTICE MUCH DIFFERENCE IN SHARPNESS BETWEEN OLD &amp; NEW  BLADES</li>
            <li> Sadly, I can&#x27;t really tell a discernible difference between the cut of the old heads and the new ones.  </li>
            <li> They make the old razor stand up and act like it&#x27;s brand new and straight out of the box.  </li>
            <li> Saves me the cost of buying a whole new unit and returns the old unit to factory sharpness.</li>
            <li> Lot cheaper than buying a new shaver and much convenient than the old razor.</li>
            <li> It would have been easier if the whole old head assembly was taken off and replaced with the new assembly that included the rotary cutters and shields.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It turns out that the plastic drive gear that turns the cutter had worn so the new heads didn&#x27;t help much.&lt;br /&gt;I have been unable to find a replacement drive gear anywhere in the world.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise they would have probably worked great.</li>
            <li> The new blades shave much closer than the one-year old one did.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying a complete new razor.</li>
            <li> They seem to work better initially but not for very long, maybe a couple months.  </li>
            <li> Also the packaging was way to big, they used a box for this tiny thing, a padded envelope would have easily done.</li>
            <li> I get a faster and better shave than if I do it less frequently (as the manufacturer suggests).</li>
            <li> I now know why they used such a simple diagram, because it&#x27;s that easy.  </li>
            <li> the actual replacement process was incredibly simple and easy to</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the replacements are as high a quality as the factory new ones you get with your new shaver.  </li>
            <li> I tend to wait too long to replace my shaver heads, so I can really tell the difference in how quickly and closely the new blades shave in comparison to old, worn out ones.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about changing blades, I&#x27;m the normal throw it out and get a new one guy.  </li>
            <li> Very simple to change out, slipped right in to the shaver.</li>
            <li> These electric shaver heads worked great and were very much less expensive than those sold at stores and were delivered very quickly.  </li>
            <li> These Popped right in and the shaver is back to brand new performance.</li>
            <li> A little expensive,but worth it!!</li>
            <li> Very good quality as expected from past purchases of same item.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found these replacement blades for such a good price, especially for an expensive razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m particularly astonished that they have increased 30% in price, since the last time Ipurchased them exactly two years ago in 2011.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I replaced the heads after two years of usage, but I was disappointed with the new blades as they didn&#x27;t come close to the clean shave I experienced when the shaver was new..</li>
            <li> Non-abrasive, smooth, stays sharp for about a year.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and fit my electric razor without any problems.</li>
            <li> You get what you payed for, a series of blades which will be sharp and fit your electric razor.</li>
            <li> The new head is sharp and my face is smooth again after a shave.</li>
            <li> these work great and last about a year on my tough beard...</li>
            <li> High price for small parts but a lot better than a new razor for both pocketbook and environment.</li>
            <li> Every so often, I automatically get new heads for my electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Worked like brand new.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to toss my razor, but the new heads did wonders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a new shaver.</li>
            <li> They rejuvenate your electric razor so that it cuts like it did when it was new.</li>
            <li> replaced the blades and it is like a brand new razor.</li>
            <li> I ordered new replacement heads for my husbands shaver.  </li>
            <li> Makes your razer shave like new.</li>
            <li> Brings on new vigor.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like new blades on your razor.</li>
            <li> Heard the new Norelco electric razors and so so also.</li>
            <li> This makes the razor just like new.  </li>
            <li> He feels that the new blades have made shaving enjoyable...again.   </li>
            <li> I ordered these for my guy when he dropped his brand new razor on the floor and bent a head.  </li>
            <li> New product as descirbed.  </li>
            <li> Why buy a new shaver when you can replace the heads and it is like new.</li>
            <li> and I figure I&#x27;ve saved $70 or so in place of buying a new razor of this quality, while discounted at Costco.  </li>
            <li> So I thought a new head was in order.</li>
            <li> Once changed to the new head</li>
            <li> These new blades did not improve its function.</li>
            <li> My razor works like new now that I have replaced the razor heads.  </li>
            <li> I bought these new replacement razors after owning a Norelco speedXL series for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was kinda hoping owning new blades would alleviate the razor burn, however it did not.</li>
            <li> Its like having a new razor again.</li>
            <li> Works like a new one.</li>

            <li> \\&quot;IT IS JUST LIKE A NEW RAZOR\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually when I try something new, I just get a cheaper version to see if I like it.</li>
            <li> What a difference new cutters make.</li>
            <li> Brand new sealed package.</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s shaving like it did when it was new.</li>
            <li> , I feel like I have a new razor.</li>
            <li> The new blades help assure I have a close shave.  </li>
            <li> but it won&#x27;t cut even with brand new heads.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe the improvement with the new heads.  </li>
            <li> Made my shaver feel like new.  </li>
            <li> I used to just buy a new razor when it no longer cut well because</li>
            <li> These new blades are just like when razor was new.</li>
            <li> Just like when my razor was new, it took 3 or 4 shaves for my face/beard to get used to the new blades.</li>
            <li> When I bought my hubby the new shaver for Christmas on Amazon, the offer of</li>
            <li> husband will have the new head on hand when he needs it and not &lt;br /&gt;have to search them out.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive compared to purchasing a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> Got the new blades and my shaving time was cut by two thirds.</li>
            <li> Doing so keeps my shaver working like new.  </li>
            <li> Received the new heads and installed them.</li>
            <li> Also the new shavors do not seem to allow you to shave while it is plugged in.</li>
            <li> So I now have a new shaver for the cost of the new heads.</li>
            <li> I logged on to Amazon to find the replacement heads, and behold, it is just like a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li> My Norelco shaves as well now as it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li> So save yourself the money on getting new heads every year.  </li>

            <li> Like having a brand new norelco.  </li>
            <li> Yes, new heads make the shaver work like new.</li>
            <li> , The proce made it efficient to repair rather than buy new</li>
            <li> Good price on these hard to find locally replacement heads</li>
            <li> The razor is almost 7 years old now, but with the new blades, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s brand new again!</li>
            <li> My old razor works like a new one!</li>
            <li> Using these replacement blades ensures and close shave without him making his face raw from having to go over it too many times with the razor.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase and certainly less expensive than purchasing a whole new electric razor.</li>
            <li> The heads were easy to change in less than 1 minute.</li>
            <li> I concur with previous reviewers that the particular model Norelco shaver is not as good as previous models.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and trouble free.</li>
            <li> The original blades lasted nearly 3 years and I have a pretty heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> I have a very soft beard and face.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I saw the price of the Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than continually buying of razor blades once you own a Norellco shaver and no more  knicks or toilet paper &amp;#34;patches&amp;#34; on your face.</li>
            <li> While nowhere near as close as a blade shave, the electric does a fast and very decent job, especially for touch-ups before an evening out.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why a new machine would have better blades then replacement blades.</li>
            <li> and then I use a conventional razor to finish up and leave the face ultra smooth.  </li>
            <li> No more pressing the shaver to your face hoping to get a better and quicker shave.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I attempted to review this item earlier, but couldn&#x27;t find the exact price I paid.  </li>
            <li> Pay attention to the positioning of the blades as you remove them from the razor, as replacement is not difficult, but the blades will only go into the razor head one way.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was exactly as shown on the Amazon web site (others said their packaging was different).    </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed but couldn&#x27;the find locally.</li>
            <li> Another thing to consider is that if your razor is several years old, the rechargeable battery doesn&#x27;t last forever, and isn&#x27;t easily or cheaply replaced.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are exactly what we needed and the service provided by Amazon was terrific.</li>
            <li> While I find these very expensive, they made an incredible difference in the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> This blade replacement doesn&#x27;t seem as sharp as the original.  </li>
            <li> I have followed it pretty religiously</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered a replacement head I received the entire unit, pop out and pop in.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> However, since buying a Panasonic shaver, I find myself using both razors---the Norelco for the first cut and the Panasonic for the final cut.</li>
            <li> Why buy a new shaver when your old one does the job with new replacement heads.</li>
            <li> My husband was going to buy a new razor, but I ordered these heads and they made the old razor like new again.  </li>
            <li> My shaver is 7 years old and with new HQ9 heads works like brand new.</li>
            <li> new heads made my old razor new again.</li>
            <li> Turned my old Norelco into new that felt newly brought.</li>
            <li> Being five years old, with new heads, the shaver performed as when it was new.</li>
            <li> The new head made my old razor like new.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp pulls too much</li>
            <li> Right out of the box , the razors seemed sharp and ready for a cut.</li>
            <li> After 1 1/2 years of continuous daily usage the original cutting heads were no longer giving a good shave.</li>
            <li> I removed the old heads from his shaver and cleaned his unit and then inserted the new heads.  </li>
            <li> In hindsight, given the cost, I would buy a new shaver rather than fiddle with an old one.</li>
            <li> Spare yourself the bother and get a new shaver if yours is over 5 years old.</li>
            <li> as described, made the old shaver just like new.</li>
            <li> even if the blades are old it will work almost like new</li>
            <li> So New heads where in order for my old Phillips.  </li>
            <li> I couldnt tell a difference between the new head and old head.  </li>
            <li> He never explored that with me, but did offer to send me a new set of heads direct from PhillipsNorelco.</li>
            <li> Put new life in the old shaver.</li>
            <li> Philips knows how to make their old products obselete so you will buy the new \\&quot;better\\&quot; stuff.</li>
            <li> Replacement give new life to my old razor.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of the new Norelco&#x27;s that are made in China, I decided to keep my 15 year old Norelco Speed-XL 8140XL.  </li>
            <li> my old Norelco shave like new.</li>
            <li> The difference is like night and day from my old blades to the new ones.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference, it&#x27;s like a new razor.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking of buying a Norelco Arctic Razor since my old speedshaver didn&#x27;t seem to be working as well as it did when it was new, four or five years ago.</li>
            <li> Made my old shaver work like new again.</li>
            <li> My worn out 3 year old shaver is now like brand new.</li>
            <li> I started looking for a new one for him, since I figured that there was no way that they still made the razor blades for that old of a razor.</li>
            <li> I replaced the three razor heads and the holder they sit in and my old razor became my new razor.  </li>
            <li> Made the old shaver work like new.</li>
            <li> Just watch how you remove the old ones to replace the new ones there are no instructions</li>
            <li> Made my old razor just like new.....</li>
            <li> I recieved the new head and have found it does not give a close shave - not even as close as the 2 year old head it was replaced with.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads gave new life to my six years old shaver.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference a new set of blades makes.  </li>
            <li> Made my old razor like new again</li>
            <li> Needed new shaver heads, ones in use over two years old.</li>
            <li> It was time again that I needed new rotating blades for my 4 year old Norelco</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, I bought my husband a new Norelco Sensotouch razor to replace his old razor.  </li>
            <li> Made a new razor out of my old one..</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase these razor replacement heads for $6 less than in the local stores and they were brand new.  </li>
            <li> The change-out was easy and there are no complaints about anything other than the price (which I happened to catch on the low end of the robot pricing) but is still too high for what you get; but what can you do?</li>
            <li> The improvement in the quality of the shave is immediately available and it now takes less time for me to finish a shave (3-4 minutes versus 5-6 minutes)</li>
            <li> It is fairly quiet and works really great without pulling slightly too long facial hairs.</li>
            <li> I changed out my first set at six months, but I&#x27;m still on my second set nearly one year since.</li>
            <li> Changing these are a major pain (compared with older Norelco models I&#x27;ve owned), but that&#x27;s not a reflection on these replacement blades.</li>
            <li> they are anything other than a true replacement I will add to this comment.</li>
            <li> The product was reasonably priced and made the shaver same as a new product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I replaced the old the heads (about 4 years old) with the new package.</li>
            <li> Wow like having my old razor brand new again...</li>
            <li> So new heads are good, absurd pricing is not.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement; much less expensive than replacing my razor.</li>
            <li> As usual the order arrived quickly and all worked out, it&#x27;s the exact product you get from Norelco.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have a little-used Norelco of the same type.</li>
            <li> Quick, simple and relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Rather than buying an expensive new razor, these heads were very reasonable, easy to install and saved me from discarding a perfectly good razor just because the heads were dull!  </li>
            <li> Prior to receiving my most recent set of replacement heads, however, I was able to work around this issue by simply removing both the damaged cutter and its screen from the shaver so that the other two could still spin and be used (trying to avoid the open hole left by the removed cutter and screen, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did definitely improve the shaver however not as much as I&#x27;d hoped, that may not be the fault of this product though, it may be getting near the time to invest in a new one.    </li>
            <li> I had my old head on the shaver for the last 2 years and didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference the new head would make.</li>
            <li> I hope they last as long as the original equipment</li>
            <li> They last at least a year or more!</li>
            <li> Worked very well at first but thought it would stay sharp longer than it did.  </li>
            <li> Is it just me or do the replacement heads never seem to last as long as the original equipment..?</li>
            <li> My original heads lasted a year and a half.</li>
            <li> This was a straightforward and mundane purchase; just replacement cutters for my two year-old Norelco but it, of course, represents an improvement of performance for a worn product.  </li>
            <li> I do notice some slight differences from the original heads; they seem loser.</li>
            <li> Quick service, correct item and SHARP heads.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Norelco for not outsourcing everything to China.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco, If you were smart, you&#x27;d bring back all of your products manufacturing back to the Netherlands.  </li>
            <li> The new set are OK, they are not as sharp as I expected.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding replacement heads, so I finally found these, and they are working just great.</li>
            <li> I needed to return a part I ordered for my Norelco SX Speed shaver and it was handled promptly and with clear instructions.  </li>
            <li> The pictoral instructions were not as clear as I thought they should be, so I had to take some time to figure it out.</li>
            <li> These blades are a bit expensive but they work great and last almost six months.</li>
            <li> Completely met my expectations and delivery</li>
            <li> toss your old mount away.</li>
            <li> but I wish you would ship directly to Puerto Rico to end the hassle and burden of using my son&#x27;s Florida address...</li>
            <li> My only issue - which was really my fault - was assuming that the assembly inside the watch (which holds the blades) was included.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to revive my old Norelco Speed XL.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully they will make a much easier way to shave in the future....</li>
            <li> My old Norelco was not performing as well as it used to</li>
            <li> Too old at 75 I guess.</li>
            <li> I realized the old ones were no functioning</li>
            <li> So much cheaper to buy off the net!  </li>
            <li> Maybe my shaver is getting old.</li>
            <li> Discard the three old razor discs.  </li>
            <li> My old heads were 5 years old.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> I am seventy two years old and my hands dont work that</li>
            <li> I have been using the old heads for three years without changing it.  </li>
            <li> I replaced them as the old ones seem to be nicking me.</li>
            <li> I did not realize the old ones needed replacement.</li>
            <li> And thru Amazon, you buy the replacement blades cheaper, then the complete head assembly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before to replace the old cutters from my electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My razor is around 3 years old</li>
            <li> My razor must be four or five years old.  </li>
            <li> Just what I needed as a replacement for the old shaver heads.</li>
            <li> I switched my blades to this replacement head, my shave was noticeably faster and took far fewer passovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000050B6D Philips Norelco HQ6 Quadra Action Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]  </li>
            <li> but when my husband took apart his razor to change the heads he found a problem with the razor that could not be fixed so we returned the heads.</li>
            <li> so I bought Norelco HQ9 replacement  heads, to my complete surprise</li>
            <li> They do last much longer than the box</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just for some reason they couldn&#x27;t tell me on the phone how much they were until I got there after my 2 hour and fifteen minutes on lightrail and buses and the 9 minute ride from the closest bus stop on my motorized wheel chair with my oxygen bottle on the back.</li>
            <li> B000EI0IF0 Norelco HQ4PLUS Micro Action Plus Lift-and-Cut Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]    </li>
            <li> Replacement instructions are clear, concise.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obvious that Norelco has succumbed to the idea that their profits are really in selling the heads rather than the quality items they used to sell.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the old heads needed replaced until I installed these.  </li>
            <li> Received items (replacement razor heads) as promised thanks, would gladly do future business!</li>

            <li> My shaver shaves fast and is quiet.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how worn out the old blades had gotten until I replaced them.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be an improvement over the old head, and I saved quite a bit of money in the process.</li>
            <li> Item appears to indicate that 3 complete heads are included in box.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I also have an old razor with the HQ56 head.</li>
            <li> I found these replacements took just a couple of minutes to replace the old blades.</li>
            <li> but my old ruff face can wear it out.</li>
            <li> but so far technology hasn&#x27;t come up with replacement heads for that yet.</li>
            <li> Old blade cause a lot of pulling of hair, and these replacements take care of that problem.</li>
            <li> Much prefer replacing the heads than the entire razor.  </li>

            <li> The old ones needed replacing a lot sooner than orher Phillips shavers I have used.</li>
            <li> This will provide a slightly better shave, at least in my case it did.</li>
            <li> Ran across these and realized my blades were probably 2 years old.</li>
            <li> Worked well, replaced my old blades</li>
            <li> I thought that I was going to receive the complete head not just the blades.</li>
            <li> How can I obtain the complete head?</li>
            <li> Completely satisfies customer here.</li>
            <li> I bought these replacement heads, and WOW</li>
            <li> busy person-</li>
            <li> Ones I had were over two years old.</li>
            <li> My old heads had worn through the metal and made my razor unusable.</li>
            <li> I travel frequently and although I use a head guard, my electric shaver takes a beating</li>
            <li> old blade that came with my shaver.  </li>
            <li> thanks their easy-to-follow graphic directions.  </li>
            <li> Since I use the Philips Noreco electric razor, these replacement heads are a necessity as the old one wear out.  </li>
            <li> After a year it was time to replace the old blades.</li>
            <li> I did not know how worn my old heads were, until I used these.</li>
            <li> Needed replacement blades for my 2+yr old Norelco and these were the ones I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> And when I shaved, WOW....</li>
            <li> Replaced some old heads...</li>
            <li> surprised at how close</li>
            <li> The image listed for this product is misleading as it appears that you are ordering the whole head assembly when in fact, they just send you the 3 individual heads.</li>
            <li> My old ones lasted 6 years.  </li>
            <li> They are simple to install, and they work very well.  </li>
            <li> Replaced my old blades</li>
            <li> Just a replacement for old blades.</li>
            <li> My old heads had 6 years on them before I started to notice a dropoff in shaving efficiency.  </li>
            <li> Replaced my old shaving head with this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like shaving with razors (sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> Getting a close shave again with my old shaver.</li>
            <li> My only knock is that I don&#x27;t notice that much difference in the shave.  </li>
            <li> and I had been using the originals for nearly 2 years.</li>
            <li> My old HQ-9 heads were about six years old, and started pulling and pinching.  </li>
            <li> The product was received in a timely matter and put directly to use.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 1+ year old razor.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> was expecting the complete plastic holding head as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li> Shaver is 12 years old.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how trashed my old heads were until I replaced it.</li>
            <li> STANDARD UNIT--NOT MUCH CHANGE IN PRICE</li>
            <li> Much cheaper from Amazon than purchasing at local mega-store.</li>
            <li> A noticeable difference by using these blades to replace blades that were a year old.</li>
            <li> THE REGULAR PRICE FOR NORELCO REPLACEMENT HEADS ARE WAY TOO HIGH FOR ME!</li>
            <li> Although my Norelco model called for HQ8, the HQ9 fits just as well and the extra combs in the heads give a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know that you need to replace these every year and am now still using old heads as a test.</li>
            <li> It work was replacing my 8 year old heads</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands but Norelco has always been my favorite.  </li>
            <li> We were pleased to find the replacement heads that were not available to us locally.  </li>
            <li> I went back and ordered a few more to have on hand when we need them again.</li>
            <li> Shave feels much better (assuming the old one was there for over a year and assuming you shave at least once every 2 days).</li>
            <li> It was well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re new and sharp and drop right in as they should.</li>
            <li> The price of the heads seems high compared to an entire new shaving unit.  </li>
            <li> The installation was easy, and there is little or no drag while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> As usual, the new blades made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It just seems for me that eventually a brand that I use for a long time just does not work very well even when buying new.  </li>
            <li> However, I personally did not view a large difference between the new blades and the old blades I had in my razor, which were several years old.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than any real store, and cheaper than any other online source.</li>
            <li> Trust someone who tried this and other options: these big heads give you the fastest smooth shave, bar none.</li>
            <li> Hard to get a clean shave, and it clogs up to fast.  </li>
            <li> I have been using old razor heads for 5 years (almost everyday shave) but did not notice a significant improvement in shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The switch to the new set was not a problem and the head was cleaned thoroughly prior to putting in the new set of cutters.  </li>
            <li> These replacement blades make you feel like you have a new razor again, at a fraction of the cost of actually buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy new heads every year or so instead of buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Normally, I would just replace the entire razor in order to get fresh batteries and a new motor; however it&#x27;s becoming difficult to find reasonalbly priced Speed-XL shavers.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I had the correct heads because the writing on the back of my shaver was soooo small for these old eyes.  </li>
            <li> conclude, I am happy that I can continue to use my one and favorite shaver but the replacement process was &#x27;mission impossible&#x27; for me and &#x27;mission hard&#x27; for my wife.</li>
            <li> The new heads performed as expected, providing a smooth shave in minimal time once again.  </li>
            <li> May old shaver head was over a year old, and new blades always improve the shave and this set is no different</li>
            <li> The new blades certainly improve the quality of the shave, but I&#x27;m not as \\&quot;wowed\\&quot; as I expected to be (probably based on the number of glowing reviews on this site).  </li>
            <li> am starting to use Amazon more for purchases that previously were made&lt;br /&gt;at stores such as Walmamrt SuperCenter.</li>
            <li> If you only replace your blades once a year, you will definitely notice a difference on the first use after blade replacement.</li>
            <li> These cutters are a vast improvement from the older HQ types.</li>
            <li> I purchased these same replacement heads a year before from a local retail store at a higher price.</li>
            <li> The Internet is just about the only place we can order the replacements at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> HQ8 Dual Precision Replacement Heads]]replacement heads will also actually work on my older shaver, despite that fact not being indicated by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I would certainly wait as long as I did again.</li>
            <li> I use my electric razor as a preshaver to remove my longer facial hair down to the stubble so that I can then obtain a completely smooth shave with a manual 4-blade razor.</li>
            <li> What can you say, other than they&#x27;ve  been making rotatory head shavers for 40+ years so they must be doing something right.</li>
            <li> Try replacing the heads before you fork out big bucks for all the fancy, non-esssential \\&quot;features\\&quot; they now build into high priced electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I used to stretch this because of the high cost locally $44....at $29.95 its da bomb!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend you do the same you&#x27;ll feel and notice a difference!</li>
            <li> This ttook my old Norelco shaver back to new.</li>
            <li> made my ten year old razor work like new.</li>
            <li> I can only think that this means a) old heads were holding up as well as when new</li>
            <li> Makes my old razor new again - and Amazon had it a lot cheaper than the local retailers.</li>
            <li> Definitely brought new life to the old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Norelco is a good shaver and I needed new cutting heads after 2 continuous years of use.</li>
            <li> Super sharp blades give a very close shave with less irritation than a normal razor.  </li>
            <li> major improvement!</li>
            <li> A little more packaging than necessary, but no worse than other products.</li>
            <li> So you actually have a smaller high speed cutter area while the inner rings end up pulling your beard hairs when you try to shave as fast as your old Lift-and-Cut shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little bit tricky determining which razor heads to buy, but I did figure properly after close examination and they work fine.</li>
            <li> Long whiskers around the larynx were a real pain.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Expensive, but really needed since shaving was taking way too long to get close shave.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The humor of being human is that we will revolt against any &#x27;snap&#x27; changes but will tolerate incremental progression to something with no complaint.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> These will return you to the close shave that you expected when you first bought your razor.</li>
            <li> shaves better, less catch when long stuble is present.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit of doing to get the new ones in place properly.  </li>
            <li> That said, when he finally asked me to order new blades, I did and he couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> But a new head will give you an extra close shave.</li>
            <li> I was actually thinking about purchasing a new razor and looking at razor reviews on Amazon when the cutters came up as a suggested purchase.  </li>
            <li> cutter blades made my Norelco the same as new.  </li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve replaced the heads on my razor and each time its like having a new razor</li>
            <li> Installing the replacement shaver head was simple and now the shaver works like new.</li>
            <li> However, as I haven&#x27;t purchase this specific product package, I can&#x27;t comment on the ease of access (or safety) of the new packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These have brought new life back to my electric razor.</li>
            <li> Big savings on a new one.</li>
            <li> Finally got it and the razor is like new.</li>
            <li> I have replaced the heads several times and it is just like buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Makes the shaver perform like new instantly.</li>
            <li> You can replace the head and blades for about the same price as a new shaver.</li>
            <li> (new digital camera battery &amp; charger &amp; 2 tripods.  </li>
            <li> I finally replaced these heads on my razor and it now works like it did when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> Thought the razor was trash but this simple fix made it just like a new one.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say - simple replacement of the heads and works like new.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t replaced my blades in over two years, and I can definitely notice a difference with these new heads.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades restored the performance back to like new.</li>
            <li> The new heads I bought were billed as making a big difference in my shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> now have a new razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery, and installation was practically instant.</li>
            <li> Getting new heads on Amazon is a big convenience.</li>
            <li> Next time I wont wait 10 years for new blades.</li>
            <li> I purchased for 2 different razors and both work like a new razor.</li>
            <li> I have had to replace thee blades on my razor several time and always purchase them locally, paying way too much.</li>
            <li> For some reason these blades are not cutting as well as previous blade replacements.  </li>
            <li> Really, it&#x27;s a lot like changing tires on a car which I only do every several years.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Norelco razor that has lasted long enough that required replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> review process sucks since it forces me to write more than is necessary for this product</li>
            <li> The replacement heads do not remain sharp as long as the original heads.  </li>
            <li> have only given these replacement heads three stars because I personally wish that they could provide me with a much closer and smoother shave without having to use it in conjunction with a manual razor.</li>
            <li> These last pretty long.</li>
            <li> The old ones while still giving me a good shave would sometimes pull instead of cutting and the skin on my neck would often get irritated.</li>
            <li> No other razor is as dependable as Norelco.</li>
            <li> Price from Amazon was a major factor in where to purchase these HQ9 heads.</li>
            <li> I am not sure of the metal mixture these heads are but in my opinion they do not give the shave I got from the original Norelco factory heads.</li>
            <li> There is no other option for this razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do a lot of online buying, I typically prefer to touch &amp; inspect before I buy, even though I frequently go online to check specs and prices first.</li>
            <li> I am careful to run it down almost all the way before recharging it â something that is easy because the indicator lights inform me of the status of the charge.</li>
            <li> Refuses to cook dinner or clean the dishes, but I think I can look past that.</li>
            <li> They may have been older, because I don&#x27;t recall how long I have had this razor.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this replacement when the original one gets dull!</li>
            <li> Obviously a little pricey, but then all razor blade products worth their salt are.  </li>
            <li> The new cutters were long overdue - they returned the shaver to &#x27;like new&#x27; performance.&lt;br /&gt;However, inside the padded envelope was only the cutters - NO PAPERWORK whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave, and it&#x27;s certainly faster than with the old blades that had become dull.  </li>
            <li> However, the quality of shaves I had been getting were deteriorating over the last few months despite keeping the head really clean.</li>
            <li> I had not replaced the last blades for a few years and was having problems getting a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just need to try something else, but I am less and less satisfied with the shave that I get from my SpeedXL.  </li>
            <li> It is tough to find the correct heads since there are so many Philips shavers.</li>
            <li> replacements were very easy to install and make for a much better shave than the dull old blades I replaced which were beginning to &#x27;yank&#x27; the hairs out instead of cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new shaver heads were easy to install and have made my mornings a little less stressful.</li>
            <li> This is misleading &amp; incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;The individual heads were new and fit properly (and sharp for a close shave), but I expected the 3 outer&lt;br /&gt;mountings</li>
            <li> I waited far too long to replace my old shaver head.</li>
            <li> Replaced the four year old heads on my razor with one of these and found only a marginal improvement in my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> This product is a very satisfactory replacement for a wet razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to put my old blades back in the razor</li>
            <li> Recommend a very thorough cleaning of the part that holds the heads and be careful that each rotating blade stays with the head it came in since they are a matched set.  </li>
            <li> I bought these as a last ditch effort and WOW do they make a difference.  </li>
            <li> Pulls are minimal and the shave is much quicker and nicer.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t chaf the back of my neck like the old heads.</li>
            <li> Time will tell; but up to now, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;However, getting the blades out of this package could be considered a potential hazard.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> Once properly cleaned, my old cutter heads delivered a shave at like-new closeness and comfort.    </li>
            <li> Back to the old blade for me</li>
            <li> I replaced my old razor with a newer model last Spring (the 8140XL).  </li>
            <li> The old blades simply pulled my beard and it hurt.  </li>
            <li> The old heads were so worn out that they started biting my facial skin.  </li>
            <li> The product(new Head for razor Philips Norelco)  does not seem to shave me any closer than the one in use prior to purchse, and I have had the old Head for 3 years.  </li>
            <li> A breeze to put it in place and a pleasure to have my old shaver back!</li>
            <li> I used these to replace the heads which were several years old on my Norelco Speed shaver...  </li>
            <li> Installation is the same as removing and cleaning old ones.</li>
            <li> My only gripe was with the manufacturers nearly impenetrable packaging.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads provide a good recharge for the cutting power of the shaving system.  </li>
            <li> I buy the relatively expensive replacement heads about every 18-24 months and can&#x27;t honestly tell whether they improve the shaving.  </li>
            <li> This one with the 3 cutting rings are good.  </li>
            <li> Although a little bit pricey, it is still much cheaper to replace the heads than buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> There are two little tabs on each blade that have to be oriented right.</li>
            <li> and it was only my impression of the passage of time that made me think they were dulling, or b) the sharpness of the new heads was not manufactured with a quality standard that would have shown a vast improvement over 2 year old blades.  </li>
            <li> The difference of having new blades and the previous set is like getting a new face; go for it!</li>
            <li> We live in a rural area about 20 minutes from nearest big box store and i kept forgetting to buy them when i was out shopping.  </li>
            <li> Although I could not see any problems with the shaving head, I decided to try replacing the head as a last resort prior to buying a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> The new blade was not much sharper than the one I removed from my year old shaver.</li>
            <li> Insert the new ones (they only fit one way due to the little wings on the edge).  </li>
            <li> I ONLY PURCHASE TRUE NORELCO HEAD REPLACEMENTS BECAUSE THEY STAY SHARP A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> I wish I had not waited so long to order new heads.</li>
            <li> just what i needed to make my shaver work like new - shaving is not nearly the chore</li>
            <li> It has been so long since it was new</li>
            <li> I waited too long to do the replacement because I forgot what it was like new.</li>
            <li> Yet as soon as your shaving experience starts taking twice as long, grab a new set of heads.</li>
            <li> I think I will go back to the single cutter head should be a lot easier.o much gunk.</li>
            <li> even though his beard isn&#x27;t as tuff as my husbands, he will need it at some point and it is a lot less expensive than buying a new razor (that is if the razor itself is still in good working order.</li>
            <li> the less they cut my face pretty close but not that close</li>
            <li> the blades was a relatively simple process, everything but the actual blades is reused from the old ones, so don&#x27;t throw anything out!</li>
            <li> After my first use of product I didn&#x27;t think the blades were sharp enough.</li>
            <li> OEM part fits perfectly, is sharp and now makes the shaver work the same as when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> Rather than having to go over the same area time and time again to get all of the hairs, the new blades smoothly shear my whiskers in half the time and with even less effort.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what you need to restore the cutting performance of your shaver--and certainly cheaper than buying a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> This particular model shaves very well but pulls out a few whiskers below my nose; Ouch!   </li>
            <li> Blades are not nearly as effective as original.  </li>
            <li> Over due for replacement so got on Amazon for fast service.  </li>
            <li> My beard is not that thick and the original heads lasted 6 years.  </li>
            <li> Getting new heads is like getting a new razor without, but for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Changing these cutter heads roughly once a year always makes it shave as if it were new!</li>
            <li> The HQ9 Speed XL Replacement Heads, which fit my razor come complete with new heads and new cutting blades.</li>
            <li> The Norelco blades that I replaced were three-years old and the new ones that I purchased a few weeks ago gave a rougher shave than the old ones, leaving my face sore.  </li>
            <li> You have to take the heads out and clean the build up out at least once a month..</li>
            <li> Ad shows a complete head assembly but only three rotating cutters are actually included.</li>
            <li> The inner rings have a slower surface speed than the old, larger area, outer ring.  </li>
            <li> After using the Norelco shaver for several months after the recommended replacement date, I expected a much batter shave.  </li>
            <li> This is the third head for my razor which is several years old.</li>
            <li> He had to change his old blades so no different, didn&#x27;t have at our local store.</li>
            <li> Shaver is several years old... finally decided to order a replacement head.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend purchasing this item as it is a direct replacement for what I previously owned.</li>
            <li> I plan on using these new heads for as long as the shaver will last.  </li>
            <li> I had my original heads for about a year and a half (using about every other day)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do much about these average replacement shaving heads.  </li>
            <li> They recommend replacement after one year, but they&#x27;re built extremely well using the finest materials and will last much longer then one year.</li>
            <li> The Norelco cutter heads you sell are the same as sold by other vendors but you always have them, price them reasonably and ship them speedily.</li>
            <li> Ladies, will love them for their legs and other delicate areas instead of razor blades.</li>
            <li> Wow what a difference with the Panasonic I would have to scrape away for a long time and still end up with a stubble.</li>
            <li> I was long overdue on replacing my razor heads, so the difference was considerable.</li>
            <li> The old blades served well for three years,which I thought was a long time.</li>
            <li> The stores around me charged over $35, so I came here and saved myself a few dollars with the exact model required for replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> The previous one lasted more than a year, but not sure this one is going to serve the same.</li>
            <li> Get dull too quick and won&#x27;t give a close shave like I like.</li>
            <li> Now I just barely glide the razor across my face with the new and sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> However, for loose skin like mine, this is the best on the market for me ... and no more cutting of the face by the blade.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I expected IE makes a new razor out of existing one.</li>
            <li> They work fine but are expensive give the cost of a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice the difference my previous time, which was almost two years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I find they work very well for about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> Shave seems much closer and in slightly less</li>
            <li> When I bought my [first] shaver last year I never thought about having trouble getting replacement heads, but what I time I had.</li>
            <li> This method works for me, at least, and results in much less irritation because there is then far less chance of me catching or tugging the longer hairs with my manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got about 3 years out of the old ones (I only shave about 3 or 4 days a week), hope these last as long.</li>
            <li> I have used the HQ9 heads for last two years, and they cut very well and have longer life than any previous Norelco heads.</li>
            <li> the installation was fairly easy, although you should take a close look at how the old cutters are placed and locked in the holder before you casually dismantle things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are quieter, faster and shave much better.&lt;br /&gt;A little clearer instructions would help, but I figures it out</li>
            <li> Disappointing performance from Norelco, nonetheless, and at a head replacement cost that is higher than most other models.</li>
            <li> a sharp (feels like new) electric razor without the hassle of going to a store.  </li>
            <li> When I bought my SpeedXL the brand new blades were so sharp that one pass would do the trick.</li>
            <li> Needed new sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviews state, you will notice an improvement in the quality of your shave and decrease in shaving time once you replace the blades, IF you need new blades.</li>
            <li> The shaving heads work fine and were badly needed because the ones on the razor were not cutting close.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> If these are as well-made as the heads they replaced, it will be years before I need replacements - especially since the other&#x27;s were self-sharpening and were functioning as well as new ones.</li>
            <li> When the older one gets dull, you need the new one.</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than replacing your old, worn out blades can make your Norelco Razor perform like new.</li>
            <li> The old ones were so dull that I would really press deep into my skin to get them to shave.  </li>
            <li> After installing the new heads shaving took less than half the time and resulted in a much smoother shave.  </li>
            <li> Good blades, bad price.</li>
            <li> They seem to be cutting ok so far.  </li>
            <li> Many of the newer Norelco shavers and likely cutting heads are made in Far East countries like China, etc.</li>
            <li> I now get fast and close shaves in half the time!</li>
            <li> The only negative I give is that it was shipped USPS in an envelope and the original Norelco box arrived crushed.</li>
            <li> Not worth to buy a brand new shaver at the store.</li>
            <li> Manufactured by Philips Norelco and close to 40% less than normal retail.</li>
            <li> I searched razors direct and other sites, and only Amazon had them in stock, at the lowest price.</li>
            <li> the new blades cut down on shave time as well.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can replace the blades, the replacement is exactly like the original one it came with; but it could be less expensive.</li>
            <li> , I would have ordered the sharpner and resharpin the old blades as well as the three other Norelco shavers that I have.</li>
            <li> I ordered this replacement and it is way way worse than the original 5-year-old blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once a month, sit down and remove the cutters and clean them thoroughly with the small brush they gave you.  </li>
            <li> I bought a less expensive (backup) Norelco razor recently and it is far better.  </li>
            <li> They are a marked improvement over the dull blades they replaced, but don&#x27;t expect a total new shaver feel.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in the local stores around me and the ones I did find were at a much higher price than on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I had an old Norelco triple head razor that lasted ten years and never required cutter/screen replacement - cannot get six months out of these without cutter wearing thru screens and locking up razor - unfortunately I&#x27;m hooked on great shave - just expensive to keep buying so often - don&#x27;t know what materials they used earlier but wish they would go back to them -</li>
            <li> had given 4 star before but on my subsequent buy, the box was HQ9 but the cutter inside is single tracked only unlike HQ9 that is tripple tracked, so its cheating and the packaging said Made in China so wonder China always comes with such cheating business only, going to return to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I buy new heads every two years or so, since they are each used half time.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, and that the price is steep, I noticed a slight improvement in performance when I put in the new blades.  </li>
            <li> These cost me a $100 less than the new razor</li>
            <li> I use mine longer than the recommended replacement time and it still works well, but when I did want a new head I bought this one here for less money than the retail stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replacing the heads every 12-18 months is like getting a new shaver for less than $40.  .  .  .  .  </li>
            <li> much less money than buying a new razor, closer and faster to shave.</li>
            <li> I had thought of replacing my Norelco at one point, but after reading all the negative reviews about the new Norelco shavers (and their lack of an LED that indicates the current battery charge level), I thought I&#x27;d try another set of replacement heads and keep using my old one.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight difference only; but not enough to say wow what a difference.</li>
            <li> however I do not expect it to last as long which may be the reason it was a lot cheaper than those in my local stores.</li>
            <li> I only hope that the blades last for a long time also.</li>
            <li> After about 18 months of daily use on my face, it takes 3 times as long to get the same close shave.  </li>
            <li> Some of the holes are round while others are rectangular like the older designs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old blades had gotten til I installed these new ones.</li>
            <li> Also, there are at least two different packages for the HQ9 heads, with different pictures that make it even more confusing.  </li>
            <li> I got exactly what I was after for a hard to find item.</li>
            <li> came in as expected and worked like I expected they should work for a new set of replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> It cuts very well and I usually replace the head once a year..</li>
            <li> It worked very well, just like others I bought in the past did.</li>
            <li> These heads last a long time.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to do so as long as I have my present razor.</li>
            <li> I always use mine as long as possible and had the razor for 2 years before replacing them so it was quite an improvement.</li>
            <li> Though I have a relatively whimpy beard my shave time had been getting extremely long.  </li>
            <li> Will not wait so long to replace blades next time.</li>
            <li> hope tyhe blades in the razor last a long time.</li>
            <li> The razors seem to last for a long time, but the heads eventually hneed replacement.</li>
            <li> No data on how long they will last.</li>
            <li> I hope they last as long as the originals did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can get away with cleaning the existing blades for only so long because you notice the sharpness starts to decline.</li>
            <li> What a miracle to ease of use and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I hope these last as long as the originals did.</li>
            <li> The heads last a long time</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> My big complaint is the blades last just a few months and at around $30 is priced about a 1/3 the cost of a new shaver just low enough for me not to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Suddenly, all the little complaints I had about the performance of my old Norelco disappeared.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find them at a   reasonable price locally, so I turned to Amazon.</li>
            <li> With the electric razor, its not as obvious when the blades go dull as with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> , none compete with Norelco but that isn&#x27;t saying much ,it&#x27;s just Norelco is better than the other two bad shavers</li>
            <li> These replacement heads do not seem to be very sharp, even compared to the old ones that i am replacing</li>
            <li> bought hubby a Norelco a few years ago and decided to get him some new blades.</li>
            <li> Since the performance of the blades is gradual and imperceptible on a day to day basis, I did not realize how the shaver performance would improve with new blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they do not last very long.  </li>
            <li> cleaned the blades every one or two months during the first two years,but failed to clean them this past year, somehow forgetting the importance of doing so.</li>
            <li> The shaver is now working as a shaver should, removing wiskers in half trhe time as did the old heads and blades.  </li>
            <li> Second, the additional row of blades creates a larger area of drag for the motor.</li>
            <li> I had earlier tried to sharpen blades with not great success.  </li>
            <li> Unless you happen to have a spare set of these new replacement heads on hand or perhaps even a single leftover one from previous set, this can be problematic, since your razor will be rendered inoperable.</li>
            <li> I think I will go back to the single cutter head should be a lot easier.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but I use it daily and they really do last a full year.  </li>
            <li> As such, don&#x27;t be disappointed if the first few shave with new blades do not seem as close and smooth as you expected.  </li>
            <li> Several bills cheaper than Target and other big retailers, so can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s service and pricing!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, especially after reading some of the other reviews but found this product to be better than expected.  </li>
            <li> The new heads brought the shaver back to like new cutting action.</li>
            <li> If you really look hard, you can find ones made in Germany or Switzerland.</li>
            <li> durability they are starting to show a little wear, but hubby says he expects the replacement shaving head to last as long as the last shaving head purchased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems a bit crazy that the new &#x27;heads&#x27; cost about half as much as a new razor, but these really extend the life of his razor!</li>
            <li> I hope I have received some kind of reject, because I feel bad for everyone else who gets one.</li>
            <li> Why did he wait this long?  </li>
            <li> I recommend you don&#x27;t wait as long as I did .</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s something minor that you won&#x27;t notice.</li>
            <li> I should have bought these a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> Should have changed heads a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> and they seem to last longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Been using these razors a long while.</li>
            <li> Wish I had Amazon a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I will not let my razor heads go that long again without replaceing them.</li>
            <li> I have had it so long that I have replaced the batteries about 4 times</li>
            <li> The HQ9 shaver actually has to work harder to turn the HQ9 heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went 2 years and that&#x27;s too long.</li>
            <li> And then you do, and you can&#x27;t believe you waited so long.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder why I waited so long to buy the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently I bought a Braun shaver which handles long whiskers better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a long time and it works well</li>
            <li> Wish I had not waited so long to do it.</li>
            <li> I waited too long before replacing the heads.</li>
            <li> I had put off reordering these for a long time.</li>
            <li> Life long Norelco user.  </li>
            <li> I had forgotten how well my razor works since I had not replaced the heads in so long</li>
            <li> I have used these for a few months now and so far they cut well.  </li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d purchased long before this.  </li>
            <li> I tend to go long on usage, not replace every six months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recommended not to wait too long to replace as I did.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described and what I ordered, however I am surprised at h expensive</li>
            <li> Norelco recommends changing heads once a year, if you have a tough beard I think 9 months is about right.  </li>
            <li> not sure how long they should last and could never really tell when i should get new blades, but they lasted me about a year with shaving about once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Just not smart enough to replace them in my razor by the dierections on box.</li>
            <li> Since the sharpness of the blades decreases at such a slow rate, I hardly noticed that the quality of my shave dropped so significantly over the course of a year.  </li>
            <li> it would be difficult to change blades,but it was very easy.like brand new shaver</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didnt notice much of a difference in look or feel with the new blades.  </li>
            <li> , the new heads were worse than my old one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> That previous set endured daily use on my semi-heavy facial hair growth.</li>
            <li> I usually just buy a new razor but thought I would buy the replacement blades instead.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a return to this, but the new blades were not much better than the ones that I disposed of.</li>
            <li> So I replaced them with a new \\&quot;head holder\\&quot; and my shaver looks and feels like brand new no thanks to the new cutting heads.</li>
            <li> Plus, a slight slip and a bad cut may have occurred (I think everyone has experienced trying to open one of these newer hard-plastic wrapped items and knows just how difficult it can really be to get at the product</li>
            <li> Putting new blades in cut down on irritation since it takes less time to cut.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference, even after several months of use (in other words, there&#x27;s no \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period).</li>
            <li> Been long time since I changed the blades out on my XL 8260, and was hoping they still made blades for it!</li>
            <li> Unable to get a close shave as with original blades.  </li>
            <li> My other shaver has been going for 12+ years with regular battery changes.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stay sharp after using several times .</li>
            <li> It is built to last and is efficient as it out performs all other products like it.  </li>
            <li> I also find myself going over the same spot multiple times to get all the hairs, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the blades or the overall razer&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> My current shaver heads were dull ( 3 years old )</li>
            <li> We had been searching for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Being a dual cutter head it was extremely difficult to clean around the cutters.</li>
            <li> Being a dual cutter head it was extremely difficult to clean around the cutters.</li>
            <li> Since cordless shavers are relatively expensive, finding the replacement heads are a necessity if you want a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I prefer dry shaves.</li>
            <li> Not only did it not fit my razor properly.</li>
            <li> Was expensive, but if it put the shavor back in \\&quot;new\\&quot; condition, it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> is in the box is only 3 each individual round heads without the assembly that they sit in.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why these heads should only last a few months.  </li>
            <li> Installation was very simple and took only a few minutes to do.</li>
            <li> I believe the  heads i received were not new,</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend replacing the heads on your shaver at least once a year.</li>
            <li> Hard to find and much more expensive to find locally!</li>
            <li> I always seem to forget how much replacement heads improve my shaver, but then I replace the heads only every two or so years, so it&#x27;s easy to not notice how bad my shaver is getting, little by little.</li>
            <li> They do a very good job of cutting the beard and much easier and less painful, with less scars than regular razors.</li>
            <li> years ago I bought replacement blades and they were no better than old blades.</li>
            <li> go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that there are several others here who have left negative reviews for the same problem.</li>
            <li> Not sure why Amazon offers delivery subscriptions from 1 to 6 months when the factory recommendation is to replace annually.  </li>
            <li> and it was broken the first time I dropped it.  </li>
            <li> I will say that I have set it up so that I get new ones every six months so that I don&#x27;t have to wait until my face bursts into flames with dull blades.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull they had gotten until I replaced them with the new ones.  </li>
            <li> his elec razor was dull, he said he needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t know how dull your blades are until you put a set of new ones in the razor.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize how hard you work at getting a close shave until you get new shaving heads.&lt;br /&gt;Wow</li>
            <li> When new, you could hardly feel the razor on your face as it glided over and removed hair rapidly.</li>
            <li> The price on them has actually gone down.  </li>
            <li> My Shaver was getting a bit biting as the blades were worn down from 2 years of daily use.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if i should blame the razor or the blades, but it was very difficult for me to get a complete shave with this in an appreciable amount of time, a lot of little hairs would lay flat against my face and would only be trimmed if i got JUST the right angle.  </li>
            <li> They are very sharp and last a year in my Norelco Shaver.  </li>
            <li> duh it&#x27;s got new blades.</li>
            <li> Much easier and less expensive than purchasing a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;Also.</li>
            <li> Open the razor with the button, turn the black triangular plastic piece, pull it and the attached gray plastic piece off.  </li>
            <li> Replaced my old cutting heads exactly.  </li>
            <li> It has been long enough that I was having trouble finding replacement blades.</li>
            <li> My previous shaver heads had lots of tiny hairs on it, even though I always cleaned the heads as directed on my shaver manual (see #1 above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull the old ones were until I put these on!</li>
            <li> it did a passable job, blades don&#x27;t stay sharp long, I would not buy Norelco products again if I has my choice</li>
            <li> But these seem to feel the same, maybe a little improvement.</li>
            <li> The photo is a little mis-leading as the outside plastic part is not supplied.</li>
            <li> so they last a little longer than is suggested.</li>
            <li> I only noticed a little difference.</li>
            <li> There are three separate little heads to replace, but it is simple enough.&lt;br /&gt;Razor</li>
            <li> Since these heads are very expensive, now I am resorting to buying old model shavers that come on offer that have these heads so we can use these Heads and other spares as needed at a much lower total cost of ownership</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how dull the two year old heads had become.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even realize how dull your old ones are until you replace the blade</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize my old blades were so dull.  </li>
            <li> but the old ones were getting dull.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how dull my old heads were until replacing them.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting them, and maybe having an extra pair around if your current heads break or become dull.  </li>
            <li> Makes the razor like new again and are less expensive that purchasing a new razor.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for your bad advice.</li>
            <li> They give me a closer shave than the old ones, but wow are they expensive, even on Amazon.</li>
            <li> They probably will last as long as the originals, that is, a few years!</li>
            <li> Not really much to say about this, they&#x27;re replacement blades for the razor.  </li>
            <li> and then they were delivered a few days later.  </li>
            <li> few days later I decided to take the heads apart ,I had been rinsing after each shave under faucet.</li>
            <li> But there are no written instructions on how to make the replacement--to get the pieces in the proper orientation--only a few pictures which I found inscrutable.  </li>
            <li> If you pay careful attention to the pieces as you remove them from the shaver you&#x27;ll do</li>
            <li> these are just what I expected them to be</li>
            <li> I thought I would do that with this electric razor, but have had no reason to upgrade in the last few years.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.....</li>
            <li> Shipping was prompt and product has performed as expected.</li>

            <li> It was as expected.  </li>
            <li> I was complaining all the time about my Norelco razor how it pulls instead of cuts, especially if I haven&#x27;t shaved in a few days.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I had expected a faster shave, but the performance is satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Works as expected to give a close shave.</li>
            <li> Harder to get them out of the packing than it is to insall them.</li>

            <li> Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads  is what I expected</li>
            <li> Just as ordered and expected.</li>
            <li> Not much inclination to buy.</li>
            <li> were not available in the regular places (drugstores, Target, Walmart.)  </li>
            <li> Items delivered within estimated timescale an as expected.</li>
            <li> Work just as I expected I&#x27;m Norelco razors</li>

            <li> Did not fit properly.</li>
            <li> On days that I choose to wet shave, I use Poraso pre-post shave with menthol.</li>
            <li> Comparing pictures on website with paperwork, wife tries repair of razor.  </li>
            <li> The only trouble I had was figuring how to install them.  </li>
            <li> I have never really understood the Norelco&#x27;s floating head assembly.  </li>
            <li> they do the job as expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> They work just as expected.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful and get used to it.  </li>
            <li> Received within 4 days, installed, and they worked as described in advertisement as expected.  </li>
            <li> The installation was straight-forward only taking a few moments to compare the before and after setups.  </li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> (one ring of holes on the periphery, none in center)</li>
            <li> Yes they are expensive but it is worth it not to have your beard pulled by an electric shaver</li>
            <li> Not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected....</li>
            <li> It works exactly as expected</li>
            <li> My advice in this case is to spend the extra few dollars and order from Norelco.</li>
            <li> No complaints since it works just as expected.  </li>
            <li> Does what&#x27;s expected to do.  </li>
            <li> The replacement Heads were as expected, that is to say that they work well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no problems with this order.</li>
            <li> Item received as expected.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t help but thinking about someone who may have perhaps broken the plastic frame and was expecting to get the whole unit.</li>
            <li> After using another brand electric and a blade razor for a few weeks, I had to go back to my Norelco.</li>
            <li> It should be noted that I do not have heavy facial hair, so your replacement needs could differ.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> As advertized and expected.</li>
            <li> It worked as I expected.</li>
            <li> I thought why not look on amazon and not much to my surprise they had it,thanks amazon for saving us from having to buy another electric razor</li>
            <li> Will order again from same firm.</li>
            <li> Somehow Norelco actually made the HQ9 SpeedXL heads worse than the old lift-and-Cut heads.  </li>
            <li> They are worse than the ones I took out of the razor that are several years old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive and they show up at my doorstep at the right times!</li>
            <li> I wish I could exchange this new expensive rasor for an old type with the head that went up and down and had 9 levels...  </li>
            <li> Some of the reviews stated the package was difficult to get into (just use a sissor close to the blades and cut accross and they will slide right out.</li>
            <li> Using new heads made me realize just how dull the previous ones were, but I still needed to find something to prep with before I started.</li>
            <li> In fact, the old heads seemed to be holding their cutting edge just fine and seemed just as sharp as the new heads and just slightly worn down but still had plenty of cutting edge left.  </li>
            <li> My analysis is that Norelco shavers slow down over the years due to battery deterioration, and new heads aren&#x27;t going to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I think I am going to start changing the blades once a year now, because you really don&#x27;t know how bad and dull your old blades are until you replace them with new blades.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite as sharp as expected.</li>
            <li> Fits loosely, and vibrates in socket,it is so poor that i purchased a new Panasonic (from amazon)</li>
            <li> I now live in the Philippines and I often need outdated items not available on line or in retail stores in this country but only found in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As advertised, but $10 bucks a head is ridiculous for this old a product.</li>
            <li> Pops on in a snap, just wish they&#x27;d last a little longer!</li>
            <li> At least I don&#x27;t find a major difference.</li>
            <li> Was everything I expected!</li>
            <li> It does what is suppose to due</li>
            <li> I usually use my electric three to four times a week and shave with regular blades (in the shower) two or three times a week.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine buying any other brand.</li>
            <li> They stay useably sharp well beyond the \\&quot;expiration</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing these blades from other sources, but found them for $10 cheaper through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They could give us consumers a break on keeping the razor sharp, but they don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products and found them wanting (a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> Blades have always been sharp, not like the replacement RQ blades for the follow-on razor.</li>
            <li> Other stores were way out of line pricewise.</li>
            <li> These are junk, stayed sharp a 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Seems to me these heads are not as sharp as the originals.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps</li>
            <li> Like everthing nowdays, the head came in \\&quot;adult-proof\\&quot; plastic packaging and took a sharp knife to get into.  </li>
            <li> Besides some small drawings on the box itself there are no specific instructions on how to do it</li>
            <li> Be careful to not mix-up the combs and cutters!  </li>
            <li> I found no fault with the head, and I am considering another replcement for my other razor.</li>
            <li> They were priced well compared to other options out there.</li>
            <li> change the heads on my razor annually and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> They are such a bother to find anywhere around here in our small area.  </li>
            <li> These do not appear to be as sharp.</li>
            <li> Based on what other reviewers said, I also got the replacement retainer plate.</li>
            <li> Pleasure to have sharp blades.</li>
            <li> the razor is sharp now.  </li>
            <li> I have shopped around on other sites but the prices could not be beat.</li>
            <li> I have always used this blade for the past 3 years daily.</li>
            <li> Purchased similar in past and this i</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews on the replacement heads</li>
            <li> you should; making the total cost of ownership excessively unreasonable.</li>
            <li> I searched for replacement heads at the usual places I could visit personally, but found nothing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a problem judging these blades because I have not used any other make of shaver.</li>
            <li> but at times I think I should try some other make just for comparison.</li>
            <li> I would recomand this to other.</li>
            <li> Amazingly sharp, my shave time was shortened by 3/4.</li>
            <li> Blades don&#x27;t seem as sharp as they were years ago.</li>
            <li> I just replaced the blades and the shave has improved, but I&#x27;m thinking of going back to blade to see if my impressions are just romanticizing my past use of a razor.  </li>
            <li> Sharp blades.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and the powder is all that I will use.</li>
            <li> This has been apparently an issue with all Philips Norelco replacement heads lately.  </li>
            <li> EXTREMELY</li>
            <li> Tried the recommended HQ8 replacements one month prior and was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> My old XL razor was cutting pretty slow and rough.</li>
            <li> To make them last longer I soak them in and run rubbing alcohol very few months.  </li>
            <li> If you do this, be very careful of the heads themselves and their plastic retainer plate;</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very sharp as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, whenever I have had to replace these heads, it has has been because a tiny blade of one of the cutters has broken off which subsequently prevents that damaged cutter, as well as the other undamaged two, from spinning.</li>
            <li> Does good job cutting just to expensive</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised and was less expensive than the equivalent product I was bidding on at ebay.</li>
            <li> It took a few minutes to remove the old cutting heads and replace them with the new HO9 set.</li>
            <li> I also found it easier, and less frustrating, to remove the entire flip head part, make the change, and then put the flip piece back on the body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Replacing it took less than 5 minutes (most of it - spent opening the annoying plastic package).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is they stay sharp for me for about six months.</li>
            <li> They take 5-10 shaves to seat well, until then they are a little rough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also recommend this item to anyone that needs a replacement head - which is hard to find in numerous outlets.</li>
            <li> These cut no better than those old dull ones.  </li>
            <li> .First let me say I have been shaving with Norelco for 60 years and started in the late 1940&#x27;s when they were called Philishave and had one head ,however they were the only kid on the block</li>
            <li> I was not thrilled dealing with DHL Global as I had challenges setting up deliver of the product to my door.</li>
            <li> I must have been living in the dark ages, I haven&#x27;t replaced my blades in 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I have used the same razor for at least 10 years because of the execellant shaving heads.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully will last at least a year.</li>
            <li> As goes the average</li>
            <li> After installation, I could detect no difference so the expense was not worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tie up the bathroom nearly as long as in the past.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I used lift and cut blades, so I&#x27;m not sure if these are faster or slower than those.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to put the heads in so that they were snug as one or another would move around.  </li>
            <li> Almost seems like they sharpened and recycled old blades and did a poor job.  </li>
            <li> I didnt realize just how bad the old shaver heads were until I tried the new ones.  </li>
            <li> The price was at least $10 less than what I would have had to pay at the local retail store.  </li>
            <li> For me, they usually last at least a year and a half, sometimes two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the blade doesn&#x27;t seem to sit correctly, turn them until they drop down.      </li>
            <li> It causes irritation and ingrown hairs, and about once a week I raise my arm preparing to throw it at the wall before calming down.</li>
            <li> I replace when the shave quality goes down, which seems to be about 10-12 months.</li>
            <li> But then quickly go down hill.  </li>
            <li> Anyone that buys a shaver and expects the blades to last past the 1 year mark, as directed in the manual is just fooling themselves!    </li>
            <li> Appears to be very sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely dismayed when I saw the childish diagram for instructions on replacing the blades.  </li>
            <li> If you shave everyday, like I do, you need to keep sharp blades in your razor.</li>
            <li> I misplaced my other Ped egg so had to order another.  </li>
            <li> No need to buy expensive new shaver!  </li>
            <li> Typical replacement heads.</li>
            <li> These were OEM parts and at a much less price.</li>
            <li> but it does not cut as close as some previous electric shavers that I have had from Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Cost less with postage than I would have paid at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Insert the gray and black plastic parts, turn them to lock them into place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from NZ and these were half the price we pay for them (after conversion)</li>
            <li> Much less hair-tugging results in a faster shave.</li>
            <li> ABOUT $10.00 LESS THAN THE DRUG STORES AND BOX STORES.</li>
            <li> I find electric razors cause less irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li> Got two years out of the previous ones.  </li>
            <li> The razor model for these heads is a step forward from previous models, and the replacement heads are easier to install and produce a noticeably improved shave compared to the used heads.</li>
            <li> Yes, the boxes were slightly bent, but no damage to the heads, as they were blister packed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Changing the heads took less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The written comments I have previously read says this product does not need replacement for about 12 months.  </li>
            <li> Some might think that they are on the expensive side, but stop and think how much regular cartridges would cost you for the same amount of time that you have used your electric razor.</li>
            <li> LESS THAN A MINUTE.  </li>
            <li> page was indicating reordering same blades I had purchased last year, but wrong ones for my razor.</li>
            <li> had previous model and bought it again.</li>
            <li> Shave in half the time after install.</li>
            <li> and it was also less</li>
            <li> My previous blades were used for about 5 years without changing.  </li>
            <li> bought open box it was sealed properly but upon after instalation two of the three heads failed.</li>
            <li> MY PREVIOUS NORELCO LASTED FOR 5 YEARS.</li>
            <li> And the price was $5 less than  Walmart.</li>
            <li> One of the three head covers was slightly bent</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my husband&#x27;s previous razor.</li>
            <li> I found some knockoff blades for half the price of retail and decided to try them.  </li>
            <li> These replacements heads cost less through Amazon then even those on Ebay.  </li>
            <li> In this age of &#x27;durable goods&#x27; meaning things, even big expensive things, meant to last maybe 3 years, a razor going string at 14+ is a thing of beauty.</li>
            <li> They work, but this time there is an odd noise almost like one of the cutters or the head</li>
            <li> Almost half the cost of the shaver.</li>
            <li> Would you expect anything less from Phillips Norelco when you have to use their heads for their razor.</li>
            <li> these parts are; it is approximately half the cost of replacing the shaver all together.</li>
            <li> This unit is supposedly faster than previous designs.</li>
            <li> Then, I upgrade a little bit down the road if I stick with it.</li>
            <li> It just creates a mess and causes the hair to stick and clump.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the blades are no where near as sharp as the originals</li>
            <li> This option of replacement heads is much less expensive than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than a new razor.</li>
            <li> The replacement  heads  were  so tightly  packaged,</li>
            <li> My shaver head cover does&#x27;t sit tight as it once did</li>
            <li> The new blades are expensive, and I can&#x27;t tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending the money on these new blades, but they returned my razor to like-new condition.</li>
            <li> Difficult to install new heads.</li>
            <li> These allowed my razor to work like new again, but I think they are on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> It was badly needed, came quickly, and relieved shaving problems I had been encountering.</li>
            <li> These are somewhat expensive, but they do last a long time.</li>
            <li> This might be due to my ignorance of the world of shavers, but it went past me.</li>
            <li> They do get a little rusty on the inside</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too close, there is a little skin burn.</li>
            <li> but I frankly saw little improvement in the performance of the razor after the replacement.</li>
            <li> A little pricey though.</li>
            <li> A little pricey in my opinion.</li>
            <li> so I am a little disapointed.</li>
            <li> I replaced the heads after a couple years and the little circle thing fell out of a couple of the heads.</li>
            <li> It is also less expensive then buying directly from the maker, even with their coupon.</li>
            <li> Simply to install, makes shaving quicker and less irritating.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of other reviewers, I was getting annoyed with how long it was taking to shave.  </li>
            <li> My boss asked me to purchase this item because he had a tough time finding it locally.  </li>
            <li> They are getting hard to find in stores lately, I guess not enough sales to warrant the space on shelves.</li>
            <li> I bought the razor heads thinking my old heads were dull &amp; causing a poor shave.</li>
            <li> The cutting heads were so completely jammed with debris from snagging longer hairs that I was surprised that the shaver motor could still turn them.</li>
            <li> Next time I think it might be cheaper to buy a low cost razor instead of a $100 razor and just throw it away when the cutting part(s) is/are worn out.</li>
            <li> Once I replaced them I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my husband who is disabled.  </li>
            <li> but I found them in a few minutes on Amazon</li>
            <li> In fact, what you get is just the 3 round rotating blades.  </li>
            <li> Also nicked me a few</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how uncomfortable it had gotten to shave with old heads.  </li>
            <li> I had gotten used to shaving once, then twice, then three times to catch stragglers, getting annoyed by hairs left on my face</li>
            <li> I do not have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> If your shaver is missing spots, maybe you have gone longer than a year to replace the heads.</li>
            <li> Would you like me to return the blades that I received a from you a few weeks ago??</li>
            <li> Buy these every few years for my husband.</li>
            <li> I had some trouble getting it to stay in the shaver until I figured out how to install it.</li>
            <li> I purchased my husband a Philips Norelco Razor a few years ago for his birthday.</li>
            <li> and I received the item in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Did not fit the razor, so could not use.</li>
            <li> Now I get through the shave in no time - even when I have a few days growth.  </li>
            <li> Arrived in just a few days.</li>
            <li> The item was shipped to me in a few days from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Although I have a heavy beard, I shave every two days since I am retired and no longer go to business.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> The norelco replacement shaver head blades arrived as promised  within a few days</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave everyday so they have lasted for some time.  </li>
            <li> Been using for a few weeks now and no problem.</li>
            <li> I works well and without too much trouble.  </li>
            <li> I think you just need to change shaver brands every few years as buying these did not help at all.</li>
            <li> After a couple of years of heavy growth shaving my Norelco razor was working, but not on the finer stuff.</li>
            <li> The blades or heads or whatever are packaged in firm plastic</li>
            <li> Philips knows they are the only game in town</li>
            <li> Looked around a few places, but botta bing.  </li>
            <li> My husband has his Philips shaver since 7 years ago and he use the replacements after few years.</li>
            <li> Small parts can go down the drain.</li>
            <li> The shaving head is a little weak for getting long beard hairs, according to my husband, who admits to having a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> &quot; again for half the price!</li>
            <li> Have had trouble in the past locating the correct replacements, not true now.</li>
            <li> After you change you can&#x27;t believe how dull your other heads were.  </li>
            <li> Chances are it is just plain worn out.  </li>
            <li> replacement heads are always expensive but paying over a hundred for newer tech or that much in disposables a year seems not wise.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, his biting down on the razor caused the head to open and the razor fell out of his mouth.  </li>
            <li> Definitely get these over purchasing a new razor if the base unit is still operating well.</li>
            <li> Work like the ones from a local store, and slightly less expensive.</li>
            <li> THE PRICE FOR THIS ITEM IS ACTUALLY LESS EXPENSIVE THAN MY LOCAL STORES.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these replacement heads for my Philips Norelco Model 8240XL, after having previously purchased them on Amazon just shy of two years ago.</li>
            <li> I hate to see this shaver getting poor ratings, but I suppose if you are used to an older shaver any new shaver would be \\&quot;Don&#x27;t make them like they used to!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I probably should have remembered to replace them yearly as suggested; I waited almost 2 years and the shave was getting pretty bad.</li>
            <li> In the past, I would replace the heads every few years, but with this razor after 6 months the heads needed replacing.</li>
            <li> I have had the Philips Norelco electric shaver for a few years and the blades were getting a little dull.  </li>
            <li> Packaging seemed a little excessive for the small size of the product.</li>
            <li> He was afraid he was going to have to get a new razer.</li>
            <li> I needed new cutting blades for my electric razor.</li>
            <li> Not much else to add, old blades &#x3D; bad shave experience.</li>
            <li> Your somewhat stupid and simplistic offers really STINK!  </li>
            <li> Tough beard and these bad boys mows it right down.</li>
            <li> My parents were not able to find the replacement heads</li>
            <li> Amazon needs to ship in small boxes so this doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t purchase brand name replacements but did this time.</li>
            <li> Only catch the courier was lousy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco Razors fro the past 40 years   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unable to find the replacement heads locally.  </li>
            <li> Just wish these seemingly simple replacements weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I do not replace at 1 year per Norelco&#x27;s recommendation, I usually go 2 years.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if its the shaver or the heads.</li>
            <li> not satisfied and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The replacement blade were embodied in a package that made it extremely difficult to actually get at the blades.</li>
            <li> In the past I always had to take razor to supplier to match up heads</li>
            <li> No more pulling and 20 minute shaves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon got them to me the same day I was told I would get them after they sent me the wrong ones to begin with.</li>
            <li> Not much more I can say.</li>
            <li> Why waste time and your skin!</li>
            <li> The replacement blades were no better than the worn out ones on my razor.</li>
            <li> but I have gone years and years without changing heads in the past.</li>
            <li> I usually have one for 5-7 years and during that time I replace the battery once and the heads a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> Not sure as my orginal blades were not complety worn out.  </li>
            <li> Delivery on time as usual</li>
            <li> This just contains the 3 small blades and does not include the blade holder as pictured.</li>
            <li> My Dad is eldery and unable to shave himself with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I installed the replacement heads with no problem which in its self is saying something because I usually screw things up.</li>
            <li> While they recommend changing the heads once a year, I usually stretch mine for 18-24 months (admittedly, the closeness of the shave declines toward the end of life).  </li>
            <li> onto your old cutting heads in any case, just so you&#x27;ll have a spare should you drop or bang your razor into something and damage one of the foils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No more sores, no more cuts, no more ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> No more \\&quot;pulling\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but this unit does not seem to cut as well as in the past</li>
            <li> I use my electric shaver usually 4 days a week.</li>
            <li> I replace the electric blades whenever I think to do so, probably about every 3 years or so and usually go through a couple of sets before the shaver itself no longer holds a charge.  </li>
            <li> Raised rating to 4 stars not five because of semi-deceptive advertising and excessive price...not product quality.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find these in local stores.</li>
            <li> When he picked it up again, he bit down harder, and his teeth pierced two of the rotary heads, rendering them useless.  </li>
            <li> Phillips recommends buying new heads every year, but I find that too expensive and, quite frankly, unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by those other Norelco&#x27;s with the pivoting thin joint (flimsy).</li>
            <li> Hard to give the wrong thing when that is the only thing ordered</li>
            <li> However, I believe they are too expensive as far as I&#x27;m concerned, and should be less expensive.</li>
            <li> I am not very good with my hands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to have waited so long to get these replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> I will buy these as long as the shaver keeps on churning.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors for at least 25 years and their improvements have been bunk for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize just how badly in need I was for new blades on my electric razor till I bought these</li>
            <li> Very strange and not impressed!</li>
            <li> I tried to wait until two years past before replacing the blades, but I got frustrated with the shaves of my old blades.</li>
            <li> But actually I only got three small cutting heads.</li>
            <li> I will be replacing the heads yearly before they get dull.</li>
            <li> I figured that after that period of use the blades were probably dull, but I just never noticed because it happened so gradually.</li>
            <li> will replace these blades when they dull.</li>
            <li> They perform well until they wear out and become dull at the two year mark.</li>
            <li> and he stopped using it because the blades got dull.  </li>
            <li> Plus, hard to install the blades.  </li>
            <li> and I thought the blades are too dull too shave well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used another Philips Norelco shaver &amp; realized mine must be dull.</li>
            <li> the flap.&lt;br /&gt;Not the hard plastic / blister type package.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I wait till they are dull.</li>
            <li> These are a hard to find model in my area.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t push hard against the skin.  </li>
            <li> This new norelco is bad news, I mean the blades, the machine charges in one hour, can be washed etc...</li>
            <li> To say the least my blades were dull as a butter knife .</li>
            <li> After using my Philips-Norelco shaver for several years the cutting blades were quite dull.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old blades were until I replaced the heads.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old blades had gotten.</li>
            <li> Its so late , but I will have alesson .&lt;br</li>
            <li> The part names used by the Manufacturer is confusing.</li>
            <li> I had my shaver for 3-4 years and used it at least 5 days a week.</li>
            <li> There are no effective aftermarket cutters.</li>
            <li> but, I thought I will receive in the package not only the 3 cutting heads</li>
            <li> I order the blades at least once a year for my shaver.</li>
            <li> It took me about an hour to open the damn package, cutting threw all the plastic.</li>
            <li> Suppose to replace at least once a year.</li>
            <li> one complaint; the packaging.</li>
            <li> Not much to add, just trying to fill out the required number of words, which I think is rather silly, given the article.</li>
            <li> /&gt;manufacturer would at least extend the&lt;br /&gt;life of the product beyond a year.</li>
            <li> The HQ9 heads are supposed to provide a faster shave over the HQ8 because of the larger cutting surface area.</li>
            <li> Therefore, the design of the HQ9 head actually reduces the surface area of the highest speed cutting area.</li>
            <li> Recommend changing heads at least every 2 years.  </li>
            <li> and I expect at least a two year life.</li>
            <li> AT LEAST.</li>
            <li> I thought I was careful in my selection, but found out I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was getting to the point where I was having to continually pass over the same areas of my face with difficulty in cutting the hairs.</li>
            <li> My Norelco shaver is at least two years, and I have never changed the heads.</li>
            <li> This product is as advertised but the photo was just a bit confusing.  </li>
            <li> Recommend you replace the blades at least once a year.  </li>
            <li> I recommend keeping at least one spare on hand in case of accidental damage to the heads in the razor.</li>
            <li> Too late to return.  </li>
            <li> My husband is always slow to admit something needs replacing.</li>
            <li> I always hated going to the store and digging thru all the heads to find the right one.</li>
            <li> and I was getting small cuts from them!</li>
            <li> The HQ8 heads provide identical (if not better!)</li>
            <li> The heads were very expensive &amp; I should of just bought a brand new different brand of electric razor for the price I paid :(</li>
            <li> Not happy with the excessive wait for delivery.</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed since I was expecting the complete head assembly.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s time to quit fighting a slow shave due to dull cutting heads, this was the easiest and cheapest way to go.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than Wal Mart.</li>
            <li> less expensive than any store in town.  </li>
            <li> this time everything went well after I ordered a less expensive one and was told at the end of the order that this supplier was no longer offering the product.</li>
            <li> Not to quibble over semantics but the price is quite extravagant for such a meager product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just received them today and even though listed as &#x27;Prime&#x27; received them in seven days (4 business days) in USPS and the packaging was a thin packaging envelope which was promptly destroyed by every USPS handler between the shipping point and my mail box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit expensive</li>
            <li> The heads are not under warrantee, but it seemed obvious that they were bad from the get</li>
            <li> maybe 2 is not so bad giving a bigger return on investment.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco razors for 40+ years, and the secret to satisfaction is to replace the blades like they tell you to, at least once a year.</li>
            <li> A few years ago this model was quite expensive ($200 purchased at Macy&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> Not particularly good shave.</li>
            <li> The wrong ones will not fit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used the replacement heads for 3 months and they have already grown dull!  </li>
            <li> Hard to grasp  concept, I know ,but ya gotta trust somebody!</li>
            <li> I have shaky hands, moor vision, and other ols age problems which makes Norelco replacements impossible.</li>
            <li> The packaging appears to be new,but the blades are very dull.</li>
            <li> I knew that it had gotten old and wasn&#x27;t cutting too well, but I didn&#x27;t realize how bad it was.  </li>
            <li> If I skip a day without shaving then it is even worse.  </li>
            <li> My blade holder happened to be broken in one place</li>
            <li> Having done so, the difference is not great.</li>
            <li> After researching, this was the least expensive way to go for these replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I was never happy with the shave of the HQ9.</li>
            <li> I ended up having another set of blades and no place to put them into because the housing is still broken...</li>
            <li> and I change the heads approximately every six months or so</li>
            <li> They were worse that the ones I had thew away.</li>
            <li> It confused me with the picture.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality.  </li>
            <li> This should be false advertising.</li>
            <li> Because it wrong parts .</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads can be expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say.</li>
            <li> Expensive at $30.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with these</li>
            <li> To the person who said they couldn&#x27;t figure out how to change the heads out - I&#x27;m sorry, but I don&#x27;t think they could have made it easier.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong per se with the product but the replacement heads cost $30.  </li>
            <li> Being that they are a somewhat expensive purchase, I tried to price them out before hand.  </li>
            <li> Stars for the product itself, with 1 or 2 Stars off for the needless obstructive</li>
            <li> Somewhat expensive for what it is.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed -</li>
            <li> Wrong model</li>
            <li> They are difficult to find retail in our stores.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> , the packaging was correct but the product in the package was the wrong one for my razor.  </li>
            <li> but the product is the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> expensive.</li>
            <li> I think they are still too expensive</li>
            <li> I prefere Norelco electric razors; replacement heads (cutters) are expensive.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have been unable to use the heads since they turned out not be the correct model for my shaver.  </li>
            <li> These Norelco HQ9 replacement heads were difficult for my husband to find in our area.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I put off replacing them because they were so dang expensive.  </li>
            <li> These are too expensive but what&#x27;s the alternative ?</li>
            <li> Sorry I waited</li>
            <li> I have two raisers that this item fits and at the price can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews of this product, I was skeptical about buying it.&lt;br /&gt;However, on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I thought that buy buying from the manufacturer I would be getting a quality replacement, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> The bar code sticker shows HQ9, wrong box.  </li>
            <li> Also, the cost of these heads seems borderline outrageous when you consider what you are actually getting for the price.</li>
            <li> There was an improvement in the performance of the cutting head, but I am very disappointed that it is going to cost me 1/3 the value of the entire shaver to replace the head when needed.  </li>
            <li> just heads not the housing unlike the photo  for the item,  very confusing :(</li>
            <li> Received on August 20,2014 and had to buy a replacement set of shaver heads today 12/9/14 lacally because the blades were no longer cutting my whiskers.  </li>
            <li> WHEN IT QUIT CUTTING WELL.</li>
            <li> The product just stinks.</li>
            <li> Each head has three blades cutting...</li>
            <li> I find that if I wash off the cutting heads after each shave</li>
            <li> Also, I tried oiling the cutting heads as the manufacturer suggests, and never did it again.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid of stabbing myself with the scissors.  </li>
            <li> I decided to replace the 3 shaver cutting \\&quot;heads\\&quot; as I haven&#x27;t done that since I bought the shaver almost 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> After using my Norelco razor for a couple years, I replaced the blade heads thinking that I should see a noticeable improvement in the cutting quality.  </li>
            <li> Well-crafted replacements for cutting heads on some electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> If you are unhappy with your electric shaver maybe it&#x27;s time to replace the heads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that they have since stopped making this model and these 3 in 1 blades.</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to instal the replacement heads into the holder the correct way.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> I just got a bad set.  </li>
            <li> Needed these badly.</li>
            <li> and i have never found a bad set.</li>
            <li> bad for under $40 in cost.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the bad head as it somehow was thrown away.</li>
            <li> I did not realize just haw bad my blades were until I replaced them.</li>
            <li> have never had a bad experience with amazon</li>
            <li> I picked up a replacement set at a national pharmacy that starts with &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; and I got a bad set.</li>
            <li> Nothing will ruin your day like a bad shave.</li>
            <li> Bad for the environment, wasteful, and bad for the wallet.</li>
            <li> It was painful as hairs were pulled from my face (not cut off).</li>
            <li> I was bought the shaver as a gift from costco, from day 1 it has been painful.</li>
            <li> At times it is actually painful to shave.</li>
            <li> I  have tried replacement for Norelco shavers twice with disastrous results.</li>
            <li> These where not the correct HQ.9 replacement heads...very disappointed .</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in blade sharpness.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the ability to give a close shave.</li>
            <li> , you will be gravely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing this for 50 or so years and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> , It doesn&#x27;t cut my Beard well :(</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say that I personally am disappointed with Norelco for taking extravagant profits on this replacement trio.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years now and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but it is required if you rate it a 5 starwhich is stupid, why can&#x27;t you just like a product and have nothing else to say?</li>
            <li> I hate this business model but what can you do?</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that I cannot get a close shave.</li>
            <li> very difficult to put in!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> different with the picture,only have razor and the top cover, no basecover</li>
            <li> Excellent, excellent service from seller!  A++++++</li>
            <li> Was everything I expected!</li>
            <li> Norelco, speaks for its self, a great product.</li>
            <li> good price and product</li>
            <li> Good to have a great shave again without the tugging and pulling.</li>
            <li> Completely met my expectations and delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> Typical replacement heads. Ad shows a complete head assembly but only three rotating cutters are actually included.</li>
            <li> Perfect, Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Replaced the four year old heads on my razor with one of these and found only a marginal improvement in my shaving experience. Had I known, I would have used the originals &#x27;till the screen wore through.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same razor heads that came with the machine for 7+ years.  Once I replaced them I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing.</li>
            <li> This is not identical to the original. As there are fewer slots for the whiskers, I certainly hope that it works as well.</li>
            <li> These where not the correct HQ.9 replacement heads...very disappointed .</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s best idea ever!  Every so often, I automatically get new heads for my electric shaver.  No need to buy expensive new shaver!  Shaves me clean and close!  Plus, just when that super-close shave starts to dwindle a bit... Kaboom!  New shaver heads show up, takes about 1 minute to pop them into the shaver, and Bob&#x27;s your uncle!</li>
            <li> Excellent, just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Using new heads made me realize just how dull the previous ones were, but I still needed to find something to prep with before I started. You probably won&#x27;t get as close a shave  as you would like without it.</li>
            <li> Would have given five Stars but thought the price would be better.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re blades.  They work.  :D</li>
            <li> I bouth this product on november 3 2012. Its so late , but I will have alesson .&lt;br /&gt;It was HQ9 , but when I install it do not work . Because it wrong parts . On the box it say HQ9&lt;br /&gt;so guys you just cheet the people and dont buy from this side. Its reep of site.&lt;br /&gt;I never buy from them if they not change for me HQ9. I have your blades - never use.&lt;br /&gt;Best regards , Sam</li>
            <li> Manufactured by Philips Norelco and close to 40% less than normal retail. NO complaints.</li>
            <li> Wow, yes I know I sound like everyone else but I should have changed these long ago, what a change, smooth as a blade again.</li>
            <li> This product is a very satisfactory replacement for a wet razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation is easy and results are good and fast.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a sharp (feels like new) electric razor without the hassle of going to a store.  Love the subscription service!</li>
            <li> Very good heads for one of the few good razors left.</li>
            <li> Shaving has never been closer</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Smooth shaves again!&lt;br /&gt;BUT - Even though the picture shows 3 shaver heads in a plastic mount, theycome as 3 heads with NO MOUNT.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t toss your old mount away.</li>
            <li> what I needed works ok never cut good to begin with and still  wont do a good job finish the job with other razor</li>
            <li> I used the Norelco website to make sure I was buying the right blades and even that resource wasn&#x27;t perfectly helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new blades fit my machine (thankfully) and it is like shaving with a brand new shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swapping out the blades was a relatively simple process, everything but the actual blades is reused from the old ones, so don&#x27;t throw anything out!</li>
            <li> This item did meet my expectations fully...but I wish you would ship directly to Puerto Rico to end the hassle and burden of using my son&#x27;s Florida address...</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my husband who is disabled.  I removed the old heads from his shaver and cleaned his unit and then inserted the new heads.  It took me a few tries to put the heads in so that they were snug as one or another would move around.  I then went to the computer and found a uTube on how to do it and it was very easy.  One suggestion is that the manufacturer could give more detailed instructions instead of just printing a small section on the packaging.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Might as well buy another shaver instead of replacing the heads.  The cost is not  much different.</li>
            <li> Great product. Worked like brand new. Only had to make one pass to shave closely rather than having to go back and forth over the same spot.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to toss my razor, but the new heads did wonders. Reasonably priced, fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Although I did think the entre top of the razor, not just the 3 heads would come with it. Perhaps a better description and photo of exactly what you get.</li>
            <li> Always replace your Heads on your razor, I have had the same razor for over 10 years and this product is the reason why it has not ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li> I have had to replace thee blades on my razor several time and always purchase them locally, paying way too much. These were OEM parts and at a much less price.</li>
            <li> Nice to have new blades</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Thank you</li>
            <li> Made a new razor out of it - Great</li>
            <li> Little bit tricky determining which razor heads to buy, but I did figure properly after close examination and they work fine.</li>
            <li> norelco is always top of the line.  No other razor is as dependable as Norelco. They outlast alll others.I&#x27;ve used for years..</li>
            <li> The product was easy to find. The vendor provided the product in a timely manner and at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Great product and speedy mailing Thanks</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can replace the blades, the replacement is exactly like the original one it came with; but it could be less expensive. One thing you might want to conseder to prolong the life of your blades is to purchase the Norelco liquid wash for the blades, it is inexpensive and does a good job in cleaning the blades; they feel fresh once cleaned. You can get the most out of the liquid wash by mixing the liquid with filtered water in the container that you are going to use for your razor. I have the Norelco cleaning machine, but if you dont have one you can use any container, mix the water with the wash in the container, then dip your razor machine on into the container several times until it is thourally clean. Then rinse you razor with freash water to get the soap out.</li>
            <li> Amazon made it easy to find replacement heads for my 3 hear old shaver, which are no longer carried at the store where I bought the shaver!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a new shaver. No more pressing the shaver to your face hoping to get a better and quicker shave. Installing is no problem at all.</li>
            <li> Great Price and if you need the replacement heads I can not find better price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these heads before. They rejuvenate your electric razor so that it cuts like it did when it was new. That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re supposed to do and they deliver.</li>
            <li> These are difficult to find locally and so being able to buy them here is really nice.  You should change these twice yearly to keep getting the close shave that the shaver is capable of providing.</li>
            <li> Norelco says to replace heads once a year.  After owning several Norelco razors, including this one, my experience has shown that they are really good for about  2 years before you&#x27;ll note a degradation in the quality of the shave.      The instructions they provide consist of a couple of pictures on the package.   However, these are very easy to replace. Just remember to orient the blade correctly when you drop them in.  There are two little tabs on each blade that have to be oriented right. If the blade doesn&#x27;t seem to sit correctly, turn them until they drop down.      When you get a new Norelco razor or replace the blades on your current one you may not get the best shave for a week or two.  It takes a while for the blades to \\&quot;break-in. \\&quot;  As such, don&#x27;t be disappointed if the first few shave with new blades do not seem as close and smooth as you expected.  Give them a couple of weeks, they will improve.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wait to replace your blades. i was not getting as good of a shave with my norelco for quite some time. replaced the blades and it is like a brand new razor.</li>
            <li> The shipping was rapidly and the item is very well.</li>
            <li> Product works well. I concur with previous reviewers that the particular model Norelco shaver is not as good as previous models. This new set of cutters,however,  made a very noticeable improvement in the shavers performance.</li>
            <li> keeping my face smooth</li>
            <li> When the older one gets dull, you need the new one.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Product was as advertised.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads work very well in my electric razor!</li>
            <li> Received on August 20,2014 and had to buy a replacement set of shaver heads today 12/9/14 lacally because the blades were no longer cutting my whiskers.  Could not get a good shave.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.  It is fairly quiet and works really great without pulling slightly too long facial hairs.</li>
            <li> I ordered new replacement heads for my husbands shaver.  Amazon has the best prices that I could find.  My husband says that this shaver does a real good job on his beard and I will continue to order these heads for his shaver.</li>
            <li> Item was just as described.  Box was a little bashed up as the discription said it would be, but the product was in perfect condition. Would use again, and would and already have reccomended the site to others.</li>
            <li> Fine, not as sharp as others</li>
            <li> The shaving heads are working well.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  Fit perfectly and work well.</li>
            <li> These fit an older razor.  It is great that I can find them at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Worth getting, comes with 3 blades and 3 disks. Do it with Amazon Prime with 2 day shipping.  Makes your razer shave like new. Brings on new vigor.  mm</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement Norelco head, I looked to Amazon, they had it, I ordered it, it arrived, I installed it and it works.  Simple as that.</li>
            <li> No problem with the cutter and screen, but be aware: the replacement heads are just that:  the blades and screens.It does NOT include the entire top portion of the shaver that holds the cutters and screens, which is what broke on mine and the reason I bought the heads in the first place. This might be due to my ignorance of the world of shavers, but it went past me. In hindsight, given the cost, I would buy a new shaver rather than fiddle with an old one. Delivery from Amazon was speedy, as always.</li>
            <li> what can you say about shaver heads, they work great</li>
            <li> Wow!  My husband&#x27;s cheeks are so much smoother now with these sharper blades.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like new blades on your razor. These replacement heads fit perfectly my SpeedXL, which has 3 years.  Just like new!</li>
            <li> Change them once a year. If they would only make them last longer.</li>
            <li> Not really much to say about this, they&#x27;re replacement blades for the razor.  I don&#x27;t know if i should blame the razor or the blades, but it was very difficult for me to get a complete shave with this in an appreciable amount of time, a lot of little hairs would lay flat against my face and would only be trimmed if i got JUST the right angle.  Also, if i let some time pass between shaves these blades always tugged, i would&#x27;ve thought they would cut faster than they could pinch but i guess not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how long they should last and could never really tell when i should get new blades, but they lasted me about a year with shaving about once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> In replacing the heads on an older (Top of the line) shavers I have to say these heads are ok. I don&#x27;t know if its me but based on some reviews that I have seen I have to agree that it seems like the older heads were just as good (being at least 11yrs old). But alternate between the electric and  razor blades . Heard the new Norelco electric razors and so so also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over 6 years and its great. I love getting the blades and fluid through subscribe &amp; save. It&#x27;s less expensive and they show up at my doorstep at the right times!</li>
            <li> Although the price was nearly half of the cost of the shaver, they made my shaver as good as new. Excellant product.  Harvey Bragg</li>
            <li> Amazon was great.  My parents were not able to find the replacement heads but I found them in a few minutes on Amazon and then they were delivered a few days later.  This was great.</li>
            <li> Changing the shaving heads realy makes a diference, it feels more like a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this before and it works well.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco HQ9 Speed XL Replacement Head  Item was delivered in time allotted. Item was in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much.  They worked great.</li>
            <li> I searched the web for the best price on OEM replacement heads for my Norelco Razor.  Some heads were not made by Philips Norelco but Amazon had the proper heads and at  the best price.  Also with free shipping.  They are working just like the ones that  came with my razor.  I plan to replace my heads every two years.  Good job Amazon!  Bill Douglas</li>
            <li> Dependable blades and a great shaver too.  Can be immersed into water.  Nice feature</li>
            <li> For some reason, Norelco has decided that these particular shaver heads should cost more than many shavers. It is hard to find them at a   reasonable price locally, so I turned to Amazon. These are the actual factory heads in the same package, so I know that they will be of the  same quality as any others found at Walgreens, Target, Walmart, etc. Just at a far better price, in many cases as much as $10 cheaper!</li>
            <li> These electric shaver heads worked great and were very much less expensive than those sold at stores and were delivered very quickly.  Look into replacing yours with this on-line purchase.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised.  This makes the razor just like new.  Shipping was fast and trouble free.</li>
            <li> The difference of having new blades and the previous set is like getting a new face; go for it!</li>
            <li> Made my shaver good as new!</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> If anyone has an electric shaver, you already know that you have to replace the heads yearly. It keeps your shaver providing the best shave. Amazon has the best price for replacement heada. Make sure that you have the right model  number.You cannot beat the price any where, I know I shopped around.</li>
            <li> Unit worked as promised and the price was a lot cheaper than getting it in the store.  It was retail packaging.  My only issue - which was really my fault - was assuming that the assembly inside the watch (which holds the blades) was included.  In fact, what you get is just the 3 round rotating blades.  What happened to my razor was that the internal assembly that holds the blades in place broke, so I decided to replace the entire unit.  Again, likely my fault for not making sure I was getting what I needed (the internal assembly and the blades).  But, I continued to use the broken assembly and the blades worked very nicely and gave a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li> Perfit fit and great shave</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like about an original manufacturer&#x27;s replacement part at a price cheaper than the big box discount store, ordered and received without driving, parking, or walking?</li>
            <li> It works good and received fast.</li>
            <li> Product is fine and works great.  Not happy with the excessive wait for delivery.</li>
            <li> I prebought the replacement heads prior to actually needing them.  I got a good price so I will not have to be in a lurch when they are needed.  The razor works great and these will keep it doing so.</li>
            <li> Replacing the blades helped with my shave. I tried to wait until two years past before replacing the blades, but I got frustrated with the shaves of my old blades. So I&#x27;ll be replacing every year...like Norelco recommends.    Aloha,  Rudy</li>
            <li> If you have a shaver, you will eventually have to replace the heads. My original heads lasted a year and a half. The manufacturer recommends replacing the heads every six months. If these last a year and a half or more, I will say they are worth the price. If they need to be replaced more often, I will not be happy.</li>
            <li> I ordered replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s shaver and they are exactly what they said they were. He now gets a much closer shave and it doesn&#x27;t take him 15 minutes to shave. Thanks.</li>
            <li> bought hubby a Norelco a few years ago and decided to get him some new blades. He feels that the new blades have made shaving enjoyable...again.   Very happy</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my guy when he dropped his brand new razor on the floor and bent a head.  The razor and blades are really quiet and give him a really smooth face.  I highly reccommend these.</li>
            <li> The product was alright, but when you charge $5.00 for shipping &amp; then add sals tax to shipping. I do not think that is legal,also $5.00  for shipping is high for a 3 oz item.     I do not think I will do any more business with you because of shipping &amp; tax on shipping.    Bob Hotaling</li>
            <li> Amazon had the best price and the shipping was fast. Original replacements for a lot less and free shipping! The only negative I give is that it was shipped USPS in an envelope and the original Norelco box arrived crushed. Thank goodness the blades are also enclosed in a plastic blister pack that protected them. Amazon needs to ship in small boxes so this doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> New product as descirbed.  Why buy a new shaver when you can replace the heads and it is like new.</li>
            <li> I replace my heads every year.  Amazon has been the best source for these heads.</li>
            <li> The provider did a great job shipping the shaving head and the price was far below the cost in the stores. The shaver is okay but it does not cut as close as some previous electric shavers that I have had from Norelco.  The shaving head is the same as the original head that comes with the razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...gave new life to my electric shaver</li>
            <li> Work perfectly!  Super sharp blades give a very close shave with less irritation than a normal razor.  I will continue to buy these replacement blades in the future.  Well, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Now I get a clean shave just like when I first purchased the shaver. What a difference the replacement heads made! I will be replacing the heads yearly before they get dull. A worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do a lot of online buying, I typically prefer to touch &amp; inspect before I buy, even though I frequently go online to check specs and prices first. This purchase was a good buy, priced right and delivered quicker than I expected - and the quality/value was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and fit the razor.  Cost less with postage than I would have paid at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I attempted to review this item earlier, but couldn&#x27;t find the exact price I paid.  I guess I paid about a buck or so,  more than I needed.  No problem.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I had the correct heads because the writing on the back of my shaver was soooo small for these old eyes.  I got the right heads and I figure I&#x27;ve saved $70 or so in place of buying a new razor of this quality, while discounted at Costco.  Be sure and LOOK CAREFULLY as you disassemble the heads.  It takes a bit of doing to get the new ones in place properly.  I figure my purchase was well worth the effort.  I hadn&#x27;t realized how dull the two year old heads had become.  They may have been older, because I don&#x27;t recall how long I have had this razor.  Amazon has been very good for my buying needs.  I live in a very car congested area and it is a pleasure to buy on line with quick service.</li>
            <li> Although very good they do not last the 12 month  life, it&#x27;s more like 6 months. I think that the short life is deliberately designed into the product.  At least the price at Amazon is good.</li>
            <li> These replacements perform just like the originals.  The price was good, and I would do business with again.</li>
            <li> I have always loved my Norelco because it does a better job shaving than anything else. However, the quality of shaves I had been getting were deteriorating over the last few months despite keeping the head really clean. So I thought a new head was in order. Once changed to the new head I was disappointed. The shaves were better but not what they were when the razor was new. This may not be the fault of the razor. Things change and the condition of my face and beard may be at fault. I cannot be certain.   The price of this sale was good but for about the same price and without the price of shipping I could have purchased this product at a local store and not had to wait three weeks for it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to revive my old Norelco Speed XL.  These new blades did not improve its function. Spare yourself the bother and get a new shaver if yours is over 5 years old. Chances are it is just plain worn out.  If you DO get these replacement blades, be prepared for a devilish time opening the plastic that encases the 3 heads.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good price.</li>
            <li> Received the replacement heads for my Norelco razor.  There was nothing on the packaging to indicate they were genuine Norelco blades.  They seemed no sharper than the used head they replaced.</li>
            <li> It does what is suppose to due</li>
            <li> thank you very much....</li>
            <li> Ever bit as good as ordering a new razor. Nice close shave just like the shaver was new!</li>
            <li> I love products that work as advertised. Take them out of the box, drop them in, turn the power on and shave away. Couldn&#x27;t be simpler than that. I waited a couple of years to replace the heads but at this price you can afford to replace the heads every year.</li>
            <li> THese were very easy to install and work great.  If you like the performance of the norelco razor then these blades will be a great fit for you.</li>
            <li> My razor works like new now that I have replaced the razor heads.  After about a year&#x27;s worth of shaving you would be surprised how much better a shave you will receive by purchasing new heads.  You may think that you purchased a new razor!</li>
            <li> OEM Replacement from Norelco...  What can you say, other than they&#x27;ve  been making rotatory head shavers for 40+ years so they must be doing something right.</li>
            <li> When your Norelco shaving system is too used and your shaving experience isnÂ´t perfect, you can replace their heads and VOILA, perfect shave again. Very good product!</li>
            <li> These were as good as they always are.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought these new replacement razors after owning a Norelco speedXL series for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These replacements were very easy to install and make for a much better shave than the dull old blades I replaced which were beginning to &#x27;yank&#x27; the hairs out instead of cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was kinda hoping owning new blades would alleviate the razor burn, however it did not. Also nicked me a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully they will make a much easier way to shave in the future....sigh.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t purchase brand name replacements but did this time. The improvement over the knock-off razors is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I had not changed my blades in well over a year and was no longer getting a close shave. I was amazed at how much better my shave became with these new blades. Its like having a new razor again. The replacement blades are expensive considering the cost of the whole razor but are well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.  Works like a new one.</li>
            <li> Great replacement parts</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0009MFUPO Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads]]&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Norelco rotary electric shavers all my life and this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased replacement heads. What a surprise to find out it&#x27;s just like getting a brand new shaver! My old Norelco was not performing as well as it used to and I wondered if it was time to upgrade to something \\&quot;better\\&quot; - whatever that might be. I decided just to save some bucks and try replacing the heads (just like they advise). Suddenly, all the little complaints I had about the performance of my old Norelco disappeared. I had a new shaver with the top notch performance I used to get. Try replacing the heads before you fork out big bucks for all the fancy, non-esssential \\&quot;features\\&quot; they now build into high priced electric shavers.</li>
            <li> HQ9 SpeedXL razor heads are excellent and product received quickly. However, I was disappointed since I was expecting the complete head assembly. The part names used by the Manufacturer is confusing. I couldn&#x27;t obtain a straight answer when I called Philips!</li>
            <li> No instructions how to install I had to go to norelco web site this is the fault of norelco for not putting instructions  in with the replacements.</li>
            <li> I shave about every day and have only gone through one set of blades in the last six years. They recommend replacement after one year, but they&#x27;re built extremely well using the finest materials and will last much longer then one year. See you in six years. (hopefully they still make them, I&#x27;d better buy more...)</li>
            <li> Since this is the only replacement heads with screens that fits my razor it is not like I can buy another brand. I will say that I have set it up so that I get new ones every six months so that I don&#x27;t have to wait until my face bursts into flames with dull blades. Thanks Amazon for providing that service.</li>
            <li> These replacements blades were exactly what I needed.  I have been getting a much better shave with my razor since replacing the old blades with these new ones.</li>
            <li> I was ready to buy a new razor when I bought the replacement heads.  While it isn&#x27;t the best razor I have had, it works as well now as when it was new.</li>
            <li> Just not smart enough to replace them in my razor by the dierections on box. Too old at 75 I guess. They fit back in and run but do not shave.</li>
            <li> Replaced a similar set of HQ9&#x27;s which lasted about 18 months (both sets ordered from Amazon for same Phillips Norelco shaver).  Like all Norelco shaver heads, they work well at first then gradually wear out.  18 months is actually a pretty good lifetime for a consumable wear item like these HQ9&#x27;s. But hey, do you expect your tires to last forever either?</li>
            <li> What a world of difference to get these fresh blades.  You don&#x27;t even realize how dull your old ones are until you replace the blade and then you get such a cleaner and faster shave.  I would replace them more often but they are just so expensive in my opinion.  enjoy.</li>
            <li> This is my second pair of replacement blades on my 9160XL.One thing I have learned, all shavers shave great when they are new.I have tried Braun ,Remington, none compete with Norelco but that isn&#x27;t saying much ,it&#x27;s just Norelco is better than the other two bad shavers .First let me say I have been shaving with Norelco for 60 years and started in the late 1940&#x27;s when they were called Philishave and had one head ,however they were the only kid on the block so we marvelled at this shaver although it took forever to shave .Then came the 2 headed shaver ,an improvement and then the 3 headed one .Fifteen years or so you could take your shaver for a cleaning and a motor tune up in a Norelco store after a year but you never changed the blades because after the tune up the shaver seemed to shave great.Not today if you get 6 months from your heads your&#x27;e lucky .It seems that the shaver does not shave well under your chin and I keep going over and over on my neck.Also over your lip ,I don&#x27;t see a close shave there either ,however it shaves my cheeks fine.So I have found a solution ,I received a Braun 2 years ago which I stopped using after a month.I shave with the Braun first then clean up whats left with my Norelco.I also use Williams preshave which I bought a ton of years ago ,don&#x27;t know if they are still around.That and the Braun &amp; Norelco seems to give me as good a shave as I can get.My big complaint is the blades last just a few months and at around $30 is priced about a 1/3 the cost of a new shaver just low enough for me not to buy a new one.Norelco has gotten to be like the printers you buy for $60-$80 dollars but you wind up spending hundreds for ink .With Norelco its blades.great merchandizing gimmick.I wish there was a 3rd party for blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days later I decided to take the heads apart ,I had been rinsing after each shave under faucet.Taking the head apart cleaning with the brush ,a I worked on it for 35 mins using spray can of cleaner &amp; blowing I took out so much gunk.Being a dual cutter head it was extremely difficult to clean around the cutters.I worked on it for over 35 mins reassembling was very tricky lot of trouble there.When finished I went in bathroom and started to shave a 2 day stubble .The shaver shaved like new ,had not had a shave like this for months.The blades were now sharp but what a chore ,I had thought running water through the head would keep it clean ,but no not that easy.If you want a good shave you need to clean often.I think I will go back to the single cutter head should be a lot easier.o much gunk.Being a dual cutter head it was extremely difficult to clean around the cutters.I worked on it for over 35 mins reassembling was very tricky lot of trouble there.When finished I went in bathroom and started to shave a 2 day stubble .The shaver shaved like new ,had not had a shave like this for months.The blades were now sharp but what a chore ,I had thought running water through the head would keep it clean ,but no not that easy.If you want a good shave you need to clean often.I think I will go back to the single cutter head should be a lot easier.</li>
            <li> Shaving is so much better when you have clean, sharp blades.  These are about $5 cheaper than the same product at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> The first set is great.</li>
            <li> Much needed item. Went to many stores in the Boston area but unable to find. I now live in the Philippines and I often need outdated items not available on line or in retail stores in this country but only found in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the shipping &amp; packing. A 5 star!  Is there anyway to buy my Electronics on line here in the Philippines?</li>
            <li> It has been quite some time since I replaced the heads on my Norelco Shaver.  I realized the old ones were no functioning as well as I remember and chose to replace the heads, the holder and retainer.  I cannot believe the difference the new heads made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were original Norelco replacement heads, exactly as advertised and at a good price.  I received them very quickly and in good order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a AAA-1 seller</li>
            <li> I just replaced the OEM HQ8 heads from my 7110x with this HQ9 (although they aren&#x27;t recommended from Philips Norelco) and it was a completely different story from \\&quot;before &amp; after\\&quot;.  The HQ9 has 2 more set of fins per head compared to the original HQ8... and what a difference!    It&#x27;s not just me, but your skin... that will appreciate this upgrade for your shaver!</li>
            <li> I got this for a Norelco XL razor my father owns.  It works just like they would if you bought it at a department store.  Shipping was fast and free.  I recommend buying this item to anyone wanting to save money.  Every 4-5 dollars saved helps.</li>
            <li> Solved my problem. Thanks</li>
            <li> My razor had become less effective than when it was new, and these heads restored it to its new condition.</li>
            <li> I had my shaver for 3-4 years and used it at least 5 days a week. I figured that after that period of use the blades were probably dull, but I just never noticed because it happened so gradually. These replacement blades are pricey, but I figured that it would be worth it if it meant I&#x27;d get better performance out of my shaver. I was wrong. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference, even after several months of use (in other words, there&#x27;s no \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period). My advice is to only replace the heads in your shaver if there&#x27;s an obvious problem or degradation in performance. It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> This shaving heads arrived timely and as advertised.  I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Before ordering, you need to know the model of your razor as Philips Norelco makes several different replacement blades.  Pay attention to the positioning of the blades as you remove them from the razor, as replacement is not difficult, but the blades will only go into the razor head one way.  If you only replace your blades once a year, you will definitely notice a difference on the first use after blade replacement.</li>
            <li> Had been looking for replacement blades for my Norelco.  These were the exact replacements I needed.  Price was fair and exactly as advertised. Blades were simple to replace and work as advertised.  Excellent deal.</li>
            <li> Replaced with these blades after a year of daily use. Should have done this a lot sooner. Hope these wear as well as the originals. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Quality as advertised.</li>
            <li> The total value of this purchase (price + shipping) was great!  This ttook my old Norelco shaver back to new.</li>
            <li> New razor heads - ahhh!  I hadn&#x27;t realized how uncomfortable it had gotten to shave with old heads.  Easy to install, too.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for, and $10 cheaper than WalMart.</li>
            <li> Have to have new blades every couple of months for my close clean shaves.  and the blades are the real item.</li>
            <li> Shaver works like new for one third of new price,  made a huge difference I  the shave.  Came quickly, very well packed</li>
            <li> These are blades only. I needed the rest if the head as in the photo.</li>
            <li> Good Product, good price.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I expected IE makes a new razor out of existing one. I heartily recommend changing the heads yearly.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, especially after reading some of the other reviews but found this product to be better than expected.  It was easy to install and I&#x27;m all thumbs.  It works so well, I&#x27;ve switched back to my electric.  The price was at least $10 less than what I would have had to pay at the local retail store.  Would recommend and will buy again when needed.  The original blades lasted nearly 3 years and I have a pretty heavy beard.  I usually use my electric three to four times a week and shave with regular blades (in the shower) two or three times a week.  These replacements feel every bit as good as the originals did.</li>
            <li> My razor is over 5 years old, but I keep fresh rotary blades in it, and expect it to outlive me !!    Everything I have ordered  thru Amazon has been first-class!!</li>
            <li> Changing the heads made a huge difference in the effectiveness of the razor. Will be doing this again on the sooner side as the effectiveness was noticeable instantly.</li>
            <li> THESE WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU SHAVE... CLOSE IS NOT THE WORD TO DISCRIBE THE FEEL THAT YOU GET WITH THESE NEW BLADES...</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price - shipping included - for this replacement head, which is super-easy to install.</li>
            <li> I have used the replacement heads for two weeks now. They are a good replacement and significantly improve the shaving experience compared to my 18 month old heads. I would strongly recommend to follow the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions and replace your heads every 12 months. I always use an electric pre-shave lotion and that makes my shaving easier.</li>
            <li> good price and product as described</li>
            <li> My razor hadn&#x27;t been cuttign as smoothly, leaving lots of irritation and red bumps. Replaced the heads with these and the razor shaved like new.</li>
            <li> These shaver heads were easy to install and made a big difference in the closeness of the shave I&#x27;ve been getting.  I&#x27;ve gone from a just OK shave to a great shave.  I wish I had ordered these months ago!</li>
            <li> I use a Philips Norelco model 8240XL, which I&#x27;ve had for the last 5 or 6 years. Changing these cutter heads roughly once a year always makes it shave as if it were new!</li>
            <li> DIDN&#x27;T NOTICE MUCH DIFFERENCE IN SHARPNESS BETWEEN OLD &amp; NEW  BLADES</li>
            <li> The product arrived within the specified time frame and the heads are exactly as described.  No problem replacing old heads, totally satisfied with this ordering experience.</li>
            <li> Work great and cheaper than replacing the razor.</li>
            <li> The product is fine--an appropriate replacement for the heads on my husband&#x27;s shaver.  But there are no written instructions on how to make the replacement--to get the pieces in the proper orientation--only a few pictures which I found inscrutable.  If you pay careful attention to the pieces as you remove them from the shaver you&#x27;ll do okay.  I thought I did, but it wasn&#x27;t enough. I also found it easier, and less frustrating, to remove the entire flip head part, make the change, and then put the flip piece back on the body.</li>
            <li> Works great, worth the money.</li>
            <li> First time I ever ordered these for my son. They work like a charm--just great. Couldn&#x27;t ask anything more of electric shaver blades.</li>
            <li> Good price but I have had problems installing them. They are the correct heads for my razor but I still have had problems.</li>
            <li> It was an excellent price for this product. I really like my Norelco 1851 XL electric shaver. Replacement heads can be expensive.</li>
            <li> Norelco quality is not what it was 10 or 20 years ago, neither in their razors nor their replacement parts.  Having said that, these are as good as you will find anywhere and the price is right.  If you need them, this is where to get them.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this shaver and he really likes this product. He says that he can get a really close shave using this Philips Norelco shaver. That is way I always try to keep an extra set of heads around.</li>
            <li> Great product; have used for years.</li>
            <li> If you have an associated razor,and need blades, this is the only product to get, but if you already like the razor, it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, happy</li>
            <li> No problem with shipment or installation of the head, works better now with new head but not as good as when I first purchased the razor.</li>
            <li> Razor works great since replacing the heads.  We tried looking at three different stores but none of them carried the HQ9.  Signed on to amazon.com and there they were.</li>
            <li> I made it 3 years on original blades. Not sure why anyone would change them every 6 months as recommended unless you own stock in norelco. Kills me how these cost 1/3 the price of the entire razor.</li>
            <li> Norelco replacement heads arrived in a timely manner. They have improved the quality of my shaving noticeably.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper to buy off the net!  Same product as shops but just a lot cheaper - I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
            <li> these are just what I expected them to be</li>
            <li> always use the hq9 replacement heads &amp; as usual they do a good smooth shave</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND HAD BEEN IN HABIT OF JUST BUYING A NEW RAZOR WHEN IT QUIT CUTTING WELL. I ORDERED THESE AND PUT THEM IN IT AND HE IS AMAZED!! SAYS \\&quot;IT IS JUST LIKE A NEW RAZOR\\&quot;. THANKS AMAZON FOR SHOWING US THIS!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0009MFUPO Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads]]    Found these replacement heads purchased at amazon.com met all my expectations in giving a close shave quickly. The heads are used on my 9160XL smart touch shaver.</li>
            <li> Good product, perfect fit, arrived quickly and as described.  Be careful to read the fit of your norelco to make sure you buy the right ones.</li>
            <li> Use every day thanks for making it affordable</li>
            <li> Very good product, shipping was fast and accurate</li>
            <li> Work like the ones from a local store, and slightly less expensive.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to replace the old blades with these new ones, leading to distinctly more comfortable and closer shaves. No need to replace the whole shaver.</li>
            <li> Same product you would find in the stores but at a better price. I will definately order this product online again.</li>
            <li> as described, made the old shaver just like new.</li>
            <li> For some reason these blades are not cutting as well as previous blade replacements.  Maybe my shaver is getting old.</li>
            <li> The packaging appears to be new,but the blades are very dull. I had to put my old blades back in the razor and it&#x27;s much better</li>
            <li> My husband is always slow to admit something needs replacing.That said, when he finally asked me to order new blades, I did and he couldn&#x27;t be happier. Norelco suggests changing them once a year but again, my better half waits until his face looks like a broom. He even asked me to order another set of blades, which I&#x27;ll happily do.&lt;br /&gt;Growing up, my Dad used this brand when it was just a double electric razor and I can&#x27;t imagine buying any other brand.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased replacement blades. My razor still works well, holds a charge for about two weeks, and the replacement heads keep it up to par. This is the beginning of my third year using my Norelco and am impressed that it is still working so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually when I try something new, I just get a cheaper version to see if I like it. Then, I upgrade a little bit down the road if I stick with it. I thought I would do that with this electric razor, but have had no reason to upgrade in the last few years. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this model head in any store. If I did, I know it wouldn&#x27;t have been this resonably priced. Would definatly buy again.</li>
            <li> What a difference new cutters make. They cut quickly cut and don&#x27;t Knick like old heads do. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco razor for over 20 years, however the replacement heads are expensivey. It was nice to find a reasonable priced set. I always hated going to the store and digging thru all the heads to find the right one. This was easy and a convenant way to shop for them. They fit just fine and work great.</li>
            <li> These bigger blades do not cut as well as the smaller blades in quatro  I wish I could exchange this new expensive rasor for an old type with the head that went up and down and had 9 levels...  or maybe I&#x27;ll try the Remingtons  This new norelco is bad news, I mean the blades, the machine charges in one hour, can be washed etc...the blades dont really shave well!</li>
            <li> Brand new sealed package. Good value</li>
            <li> Everything I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Received my order as requested with Prompt shipping ! I change my shaver heads yearly and depend on Philips for my replacements !!</li>
            <li> You have to take the heads out and clean the build up out at least once a month.. even if the blades are old it will work almost like new I promise. I do it all the time, it&#x27;s a bit of a pain but makes a huge difference. Just try it, what do you have to lose but 2 minutes of your time. I hope this helps!! I can&#x27;t coment on the replacement heads as I have yet to get them..This does how ever work for the heads that came with the razor.</li>
            <li> Just what my husband needed!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace the heads on my Philips Norelco 8160XLCC.  It was the cheaper of the two replacement blade sets listed at Amazon.    There were complaints about the packaging in prior reviews.  I found no issues with the packaging here.  It is in a plastic container that is easily cut at the ends with scissors.  The heads easily came right out.    The packaging was exactly as shown on the Amazon web site (others said their packaging was different).    Installing was a cinch.  Open the razor with the button, turn the black triangular plastic piece, pull it and the attached gray plastic piece off.  Discard the three old razor discs.  Insert the new ones (they only fit one way due to the little wings on the edge).  Insert the gray and black plastic parts, turn them to lock them into place.  And that&#x27;s it - your done.    I hadn&#x27;t changed my razor components for several years.  I didn&#x27;t realize how dull they had gotten until I replaced them with the new ones.  Great shave now with less effort and time.    Jim</li>
            <li> It works well.  I thought that the blades would be sharper. but it still has brought life to replace the last blades.  Still cheaper than buying new shaver</li>
            <li> I think we are supposed to replace the heads once a year. It might have been 4 years since I last replaced my heads, so I could definitely tell a difference. My skin is much happier.</li>
            <li> Great blades at a good price (I bought with the subscription price.).  I have consistently liked these blades for a while now.  They stay useably sharp well beyond the \\&quot;expiration date.\\&quot;  I know this since I realized recently that I&#x27;ve had the blades I just replaced in my razor for about a year.</li>
            <li> This is what my razor needed! It fit perfectly and my shave is like when the razor was new.It arrived as represented quickly.</li>
            <li> GREAT replacement products, my hubby&#x27;s electric razor is like new! It got here in 1 day and we were very happy with the cost of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many razor types over the year from regular blades to electric.  Most recently, I&#x27;m fond of Norelco electric razors, and these replacement heads are just great.  These replacement heads are easy to install and clean, and they do a find job of shaving for me.  I&#x27;m a daily shaver, and these seem to last me about one year, before it feels like the razor is pulling more than slicing.  I&#x27;d buy this again and again, works great and feels like a mid-life extender for my razor.</li>
            <li> perfectly do you have replacement  Philips 6890 Philishave?</li>
            <li> Good product. The only difference is the package received from the one in the picture...</li>
            <li> Once a year I replace my replacement heads and it really makes a difference. It is tough to find the correct heads since there are so many Philips shavers. I always buy the Philips product since they giove me a smooth shave</li>
            <li> Thank you very much all working well</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing these blades from other sources, but found them for $10 cheaper through Amazon.  They have performed exactly as they should.</li>
            <li> This Is The Third Time I Have Ordered This Product. Excellent! Will Purchase Again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Philips Norelco razor for three years and it truly lives up to its name and always gives me a great shave as long as I keep it cleaned and change the blades at least once a year. Also I spray Remington oil into the blades daily. I stongly recommend this product. Ron Bower</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement part</li>
            <li> Was Very happy how quickly , Item was shipped and received .  Fit perfectly  and was exactly as described , and very reasonably priced</li>
            <li> When you buy original equipment replacement parts at a fair price - you get the proper performance. The Norelco original cutters give the long and accurate performance that you expect. Accept no substitute. There are no effective aftermarket cutters. Just buy originals and buy them right. Keep a spare set around because prices don&#x27;t go down and genuine Norelco stainless cutters are worth the difference and give you your moneysworth.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.....his elec razor was dull, he said he needed a new one.  I said, \\&quot;Why not replace the heads?\\&quot;.  Amazon to the rescue.  He&#x27;s in shock...says like a whole new razor.  Why did he wait this long?  I guess it&#x27;s a \\&quot;Guy thing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads made all the difference. My razor now shaves like a brand new one. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I waited far too long to replace my old shaver head. it was well handled and shipped on time as promised.</li>
            <li> These were cheap, fast and original. I was very impressed with how soon these arrived. I&#x27;m from NZ and these were half the price we pay for them (after conversion) so a great deal.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly, only 3 days after I placed the order I think. I fitted it easily, it was the correct one.    It did definitely improve the shaver however not as much as I&#x27;d hoped, that may not be the fault of this product though, it may be getting near the time to invest in a new one.    Also the packaging was way to big, they used a box for this tiny thing, a padded envelope would have easily done. Wasteful.</li>
            <li> Ahh, what a difference new blades make. They are quieter, faster and shave much better.&lt;br /&gt;A little clearer instructions would help, but I figures it out</li>
            <li> Good deal, thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. One just does not see how the cutters degrade over time. Delivered before the scheduled date. Only catch the courier was lousy. Just dumped the packet in the driveway and left.</li>
            <li> After using the same razor heads for about 3 years, the quality of my shave was noticeably sub-par.  The new blades certainly improve the quality of the shave, but I&#x27;m not as \\&quot;wowed\\&quot; as I expected to be (probably based on the number of glowing reviews on this site).  That being said, I don&#x27;t regret this $30 purchase.</li>
            <li> I have 2 Norelco SpeedXL shavers.  I regularly replace the heads and the shavers continue to provide good service.  Shipping was prompt and product has performed as expected.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull the old ones were until I put these on!</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and the install only took a minute</li>
            <li> Love These RePlaceMent Heads For My ElecTric RaZor. My RaZor Shaves Like The 1st Day I Bought It..My Face Couldn&#x27;t Bee Any HAPPIER.  :-) Thxs Too Amazon And NoreLco.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find the replacment heads not only available on Amazon, but at a very fair price... thank you!</li>
            <li> I change heads once a year. It&#x27;s like getting a new shaver each time.</li>
            <li> Item received and new product fit perfectly  . It was nice do do business with this company. Certainly beats going to a store trying to fine what you want only to find out that the item was out out stock or they didn&#x27;t carry that model. This saves my time and gas .</li>
            <li> great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> My old XL razor was cutting pretty slow and rough. So I ordered the HO9 Replacement Head Set. It took a few minutes to remove the old cutting heads and replace them with the new HO9 set. Viola&#x27;, it&#x27;s shaving like it did when it was new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought replacement heads for my Norelco razors for years. It seems some work better than others but it&#x27;s better than buying a new razor. The selling company was very good and it came on time.</li>
            <li> As always these norelco heads are top of the line products, I have used other shaving products, and they can&#x27;t come near the close shave a norelco does.</li>
            <li> This is my second replacement set.  The price was good and the shipping was as promised.  The close examination of the packaging convinced me that they are not counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The switch to the new set was not a problem and the head was cleaned thoroughly prior to putting in the new set of cutters.  They operated and cut without difficulty.  As with most cutters there is a 10-12 time use for them to sit and adjust, i.e. &amp;#34;breaking them in&amp;#34;, so that the shave is quick and clean.  If there are problems or deficiencies then I will update in two weeks. Otherwise I am a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Replacing the heads/blades made a significant difference in the shave I receive.  Since the performance of the blades is gradual and imperceptible on a day to day basis, I did not realize how the shaver performance would improve with new blades.</li>
            <li> Parts delivered on time and fit shaver like new. I would recommend purchasing these parts for shaver if required and should be replaced annually.  The name is a bit misleading, I originally thought when ordering the part it included the holder as well and discovered that it did not only after receiving the pars.  I had to later go back and order the head holder, I got hung up on the terminology, I thought the replacement head included the rotating blades as well.  However, I fould to my dissappointment that head was the term used for the rotating blades (3) only.</li>
            <li> made my ten year old razor work like new.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement; much less expensive than replacing my razor.</li>
            <li> Everything OK but, I thought I will receive in the package not only the 3 cutting heads but, the whole set with the frame. Also I need the trimer replacement, it is not included and I do not find it in Amazon to buy it. Description of the product should be more specific.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed but couldn&#x27;the find locally.</li>
            <li> This was a well needed purchase . It had been 6 yrs since I bought my electric razor . To say the least my blades were dull as a butter knife . I could not believe the difference the new blades made! I am back to being smooth again ! I recommend you don&#x27;t wait as long as I did . I won&#x27;t either next time !</li>
            <li> Easy installation, I feel like I have a new razor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about the 18 months rule but you do need to replace it.  It helps.</li>
            <li> The product is just fine.  I wouldn&#x27;t use another type of razor system.  I want to gripe about how much is charged.  They could give us consumers a break on keeping the razor sharp, but they don&#x27;t.  Don&#x27;t know if there is a system that does.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son. He told me that it fit and worked fine in his shaver. Thank You.</li>
            <li> This replacement head set fit perfectly and was a direct drop-in replacement for my existing shaver.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product and should purchase another one to ensure that I have a spare.  Works great!</li>
            <li> The new blades help assure I have a close shave.  I wish I had bought them sooner.</li>
            <li> The shaver replacement blades were as described. Original equipment at a great price. There isn&#x27;t any reason to buy any place else and pay more for the same product</li>
            <li> The quality of these blades is outstanding! It is very simple to order and the service was superfast! I will definitely order again from Amazon when I need replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Great product, have used this shaver for years.</li>
            <li> Anyone that buys a shaver and expects the blades to last past the 1 year mark, as directed in the manual is just fooling themselves!    If the blades are replaced every year, as directed, the shaver works like a charm!     This price cannot be beat!    Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I replace the heads of my Norelco Shaver yearly and it was nice to have a reminder from Norelco that I was due to change the cutters and then Amazon had a nice price plus Norelco had a $5.00 Coupon for my next purchase.  Very satisfying experience  Thanks  john d</li>
            <li> I have been using this line of shavers for a lot of years. but recently bought a Panasonic brand for a change.      Wow what a difference with the Panasonic I would have to scrape away for a long time and still end up with a stubble. So New heads where in order for my old Phillips.  I have a happy face again and can once again snuggle my wife without getting the door slammed in my face.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my electric Philips 3 tilt head with 3 blades each for about 7 years now and I replace the blades every year or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I shave every 5 days and it keeps getting the same quality as I had on my original razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly amazing quality and product you can count on. They do get a little rusty on the inside but it&#x27;s something minor that you won&#x27;t notice. Probably could use a better galvanized process so it wouldn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave, need to go for a different brand of shaver altogether.  The product just stinks. Sorry to say.</li>
            <li> I like the triple bladed heads. Each head has three blades cutting... times three heads.&lt;br /&gt; For some reason, I cannot use floating head type razors. I have one but it won&#x27;t cut even with brand new heads.( maybe my whiskers &amp;#34;lay over&amp;#34; and  point in different directions)  So I use these heads in the old style, non-floating head razors and they work faster and cut closer then the old original heads.</li>
            <li> My old heads were 5 years old. Figured I needed news ones. But these seem to feel the same, maybe a little improvement.</li>
            <li> Shaver was 5+ years old with original heads.  Prompted by email from Norelco email, I bought replacement heads.  Price was good and delivery was fast.  Couldn&#x27;t believe the improvement with the new heads.  I had forgotten how good the Norelco shaver was until the new heads were installed.  Recommend a very thorough cleaning of the part that holds the heads and be careful that each rotating blade stays with the head it came in since they are a matched set.  Like getting a brand new shaver for under $30!!  Go for it.</li>
            <li> Received the Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads for my 7310 shaver in great time.  Quickly read the instructions and within five minutes was getting a great close shave.</li>
            <li> Since the sharpness of the blades decreases at such a slow rate, I hardly noticed that the quality of my shave dropped so significantly over the course of a year.  I popped in the replacement blades and was amazed by the difference.  Much less hair-tugging results in a faster shave.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Made my shaver feel like new.  Shaving is a lot closer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Even though my razor came with replacement heads, to be changed every year.  I wanted to keep a spare set just in case.  They are as I ordered and received.  VVC</li>
            <li> When the shaver takes longer to achieve a clean shave, simply replace the heads and it works like new! Simple and cost-effective.</li>
            <li> In short, great price, and now my razor is about twice as fast, and charge lasts almost two weeks. Well worth the investment if you like your razor.</li>
            <li> Genuine replacement heads $13 cheaper than Walmart or Target stores with free shipping - what more needs to be said?!    When it&#x27;s time to quit fighting a slow shave due to dull cutting heads, this was the easiest and cheapest way to go.</li>
            <li> Great improvement. Perform great.</li>
            <li> I couldnt tell a difference between the new head and old head.  Expensive at $30.</li>
            <li> I used to just buy a new razor when it no longer cut well because years ago I bought replacement blades and they were no better than old blades. These new blades are just like when razor was new. Happy shaver!</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT WITH A MOST FAIR PRICE. ABOUT $10.00 LESS THAN THE DRUG STORES AND BOX STORES. QUICK SHIPPING - NO PROBLEMS.</li>
            <li> My husband was very very pleased with the replacement blades he received.  We were pleased with the time of delivery.</li>
            <li> Product was just as advertised and arrived in VERY quick time! &lt;br /&gt;Great!  Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> Fair price, new product packaged well, very courteous dialog, received goods quickley and in excellent condition.  Excellent seller, very pleased!</li>
            <li> Just like when my razor was new, it took 3 or 4 shaves for my face/beard to get used to the new blades. But now it is great! I can shave in the morning quickly and efficiently. Before I replaced the heads I was having to go over and over and over the same areas just to cut everything.</li>
            <li> I will preface by saying that use an electric razor because I have to, not because I like them. I believe that a real razor delivers a closer and better shave. However, with that disclosed, these replacement heads are a good quality product. I changed out my first set at six months, but I&#x27;m still on my second set nearly one year since. I find that if I wash off the cutting heads after each shave I get a faster and better shave than if I do it less frequently (as the manufacturer suggests). Also, I tried oiling the cutting heads as the manufacturer suggests, and never did it again. It just creates a mess and causes the hair to stick and clump. I may have shortened their life, but I doubt it. In any case paying $25-$30 once a year is better than spending that much every three months or so for Mach 3 heads.</li>
            <li> good quality, fast service. Very pleased</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, delivery was about 7 or 8 days after placing my order.</li>
            <li> Simple to replace.  Had forgotten what a pleasure it was to have an easy, smooth shave!!</li>
            <li> This is the second set of replacment heads I have purchased for my Norelco shaver. It definitely helps extend the life of the shaver. There&#x27;s no need to replace the whole shaver if the motor, battery and trimmer are working well. I also feel this is environmentally more responsible.</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than replacing your old, worn out blades can make your Norelco Razor perform like new. Norelco recommends you replace them every year, but I get a good two years out of them before there&#x27;s a big drop off in performance. Another thing to consider is that if your razor is several years old, the rechargeable battery doesn&#x27;t last forever, and isn&#x27;t easily or cheaply replaced. A whole new razor might be a better solution.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, will recommend</li>
            <li> When I bought my hubby the new shaver for Christmas on Amazon, the offer of &lt;br /&gt;a good price on the replacement heads made it very worthwhile. Now &lt;br /&gt;my husband will have the new head on hand when he needs it and not &lt;br /&gt;have to search them out. &lt;br /&gt;He was very pleased to have the replacement head along with the  &lt;br /&gt;Shaver I bought him on Amazon, as he really LOVES the shaver!</li>
            <li> Having been a Norelco owner and user for over 30 years, I&#x27;m a raving fan of their product.  When they upgrade their razors, I buy the latest and greatest version.  I replace the heads annually, cleaning them weekly.  I not only recommend this wonderful product by Phillips Sonicare Toothbrush which I just discovered and am now using.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Arrived very quickly.  Easy to remove old heads and replace with the new heads.  Would highly recommend this product instead of buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Perfect, as described</li>
            <li> I have been saying that I will replace the blades for over 2 years in my Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL. If I didn&#x27;t like the shaver so much I would have bought a new one. The new blades are excellent, but expensive, you probably could get a new shaver for a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> shaves better, less catch when long stuble is present.  I bought the shaver about 7 years ago, and never replaced before.  the new blades cut down on shave time as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco Razors fro the past 40 years   I have used these replacement heads for some time with never a dull shave  Thanks</li>
            <li> This works well, with my Norelco electrical razor. Gets a nice clean shave, with no problem. Will buy again, when I need blades. I did have some problems, trying to find them locally.</li>
            <li> Work like they should.</li>
            <li> This was a straightforward and mundane purchase; just replacement cutters for my two year-old Norelco but it, of course, represents an improvement of performance for a worn product.  As long as the main machine keeps functioning this is always a welcome alternative to the ever-increasing prices of new shavers.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, I just need to remember to change them out more than once a year</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are very good on my tough beard and sensitive skin. When the heads need replacment, I will order another set. I expect to get 6-12 months of use from the heads. I like a close shave. If I have not shaved for 3 days, it takes 15+ minutes for me to get a close shave. If it&#x27;s too close, there is a little skin burn. After shaving, I rub in moisturizing skin cream on my face and neck. After a couple of hours, sign of any skin burn is almost gone.</li>
            <li> The Norelco HQ9 replacement heads for my shaver made the shaver as good as new.</li>
            <li> I had them for a while, but now I finally put them in a BLAMMO!  The razor cuts as if it were brand new!</li>
            <li> These heads last a long time. But a new head will give you an extra close shave.</li>
            <li> Been using them for years and found them to be very good.</li>
            <li> The humor of being human is that we will revolt against any &#x27;snap&#x27; changes but will tolerate incremental progression to something with no complaint. I had gotten used to shaving once, then twice, then three times to catch stragglers, getting annoyed by hairs left on my face the shaver didn&#x27;t catch. I went from purchasing this shaver in mid 2006 to replacing the heads Dec 2009. WOW. Well, I dun did it again, and looked on my purchase history to see that my waiting 20 months is what caused the problem. Maybe a color change inside the blade hear like a brush head would be a welcome addition?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  It  was fit to the shaver and working well. Installation was easy. It is inexpensive compared to purchasing a new shaver.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Product just what I needed and at a great price, speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Amazing what a difference new shaving heads make. I hadn&#x27;t noticed the gradual degradation in ease of shaving, and thought the problem was with the humidity.  Got the new blades and my shaving time was cut by two thirds. Applied the cost savings over getting it in a store to overnight shipping.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and in good condition. Replacing the old heads was easy.</li>
            <li> Replacing the heads makes for a nicer shave.  Does it make shaving a pleasure?  No.  But the shave is nicer with sharper blades.</li>
            <li> I neglected to replace the cutters on my 9160XL for about two years.  I was actually thinking about purchasing a new razor and looking at razor reviews on Amazon when the cutters came up as a suggested purchase.  After replacing the cutters, it really restored the effectiveness of the razor.  Well worth the price, and I am going to try and remember to replace my cutters on an annual basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an upgraded design and IS compatible and works as OEM.&lt;br /&gt;This unit has saved me from prematurely having to get a newer razor.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Having a 3 track head should be a must for everry shaver. I have an 8240 with this razor (3 track) and an SensoTouch 2d which has only one shaving track. I&#x27;m pretty sure the 8240XL is much better than the SensoTouch, although with the SensoTouch you can use it for a wet shave.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old cutting heads exactly.  Appears to be very sharp blades.  Should have done this years ago.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my Norelco shaver.  It&#x27;s like owning a new shaver!</li>
            <li> husband very impressed</li>
            <li> Great replacement blades</li>
            <li> They fit. They give me a closer shave than the old ones, but wow are they expensive, even on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Norelco products are great.  I order the blades at least once a year for my shaver. I ordered the hair nose trimmer , which I have yet to use but am sure it will work out ok...  One thing if I may make a comment.  It took me about an hour to open the damn package, cutting threw all the plastic. I am seventy two years old and my hands dont work that well and I was afraid of stabbing myself with the scissors.  I finally had to ask a neighbor to help me out.  Other than that the products are real great and I thank you.       Anton Metzger,  Bradenton, Florida</li>
            <li> I replace my Phillips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL replacement heads every year.  Doing so keeps my shaver working like new.  I&#x27;m unable to find the replacement heads locally.  But it&#x27;s a snap to order them from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Purchase ~8/1/13. I had resharpended my old heads and found that this helped but durabilty was not as good as the original. Received the new heads and installed them. I an confident the installation was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaved. Ouch. I do not have a heavy beard. Anyway, the shaver sounded like a rock rattling around in a soup can. It was painful as hairs were pulled from my face (not cut off). If I skipped a day, oooh, much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted PhillipsNorelco via their chat function on their website help page and described the problem. My helper did ask a bunch of questions - probably following some kind of decision tree approach. But if arrived at the same conclusion I had - the heads were either defective or possibley repackaged or counterfeit. He never explored that with me, but did offer to send me a new set of heads direct from PhillipsNorelco. Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my calm approach to the chat was important. The heads are not under warrantee, but it seemed obvious that they were bad from the get go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that there are several others here who have left negative reviews for the same problem. I kinda wonder if this is a QC problem. But I give them three stars for standing up and offering a replacement set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Norelco Shaver for 10 years and replace the cutter heads annually. The Norelco cutter heads you sell are the same as sold by other vendors but you always have them, price them reasonably and ship them speedily. They&#x27;re essential for a close shave.</li>
            <li> As expected.  FAST shipment.</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with the product and the speed with which it arrived at my home.</li>
            <li> Came packaged well. Just wish these seemingly simple replacements weren&#x27;t so expensive. Might feel better if the head holder was included.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and her when said...</li>
            <li> Although this what not the first time I have replaced the heads, this was the easiest time I have had purchasing the heads. The description was enough for me to get the right heads on the first try and the shipping was done in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> The speed of delivery was impressive. On at least two occasions of purchasing this product, we have experienced a problem of dropping its contents and thus not being sure that we had rematched each blade with its tailored nascele. Philips should resolve the problem, say by color coding the two.</li>
            <li> I have been using the old heads for three years without changing it.  It was a huge difference after I changed a new heads.  I now realized that the heads should be replaced regularly for your own convenience.</li>
            <li> Great!  Easy to install and what a difference new blades make! Have had trouble in the past locating the correct replacements, not true now.</li>
            <li> I did not realize that I did not have to endure pulled whiskers and multiple passes to get a clean shave.  New blades made a HUGE difference.  I will get replacements sooner next time.  By the way, very easy to install!</li>
            <li> Ordered two sets of them but only received one. Except for that Norelco items are first quality.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed&lt;br /&gt;arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old blades had gotten til I installed these new ones. Made a big and comfortable difference.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user (30 years) of Norelco heads and am generally satisfied.  I have tried other products and found them wanting (a closer shave.  I buy replacement heads anywhere that I can obtain a discount of the regular over priced product.  The shaving results are primary and Philips Norelco heads do the job best.</li>
            <li> The Norelco HQ9 replacement heads were as described - new in original packaging.  Shipping was fast and the item was received in excellent condition.  Very satisfactory transaction.</li>
            <li> Fit the razor perfectly. Just what we were looking for  Price was also a factor for us. Shopping was prompt</li>
            <li> I have been ordering this product for years and I will continue to do so as long as I have my present razor.</li>
            <li> Yes I am satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I have not replaced my heads for over 10 years. This tends to give one and idea of the quality of the product. I replaced them as the old ones seem to be nicking me. It was time and the new ones make my face smooth. I did not realize the old ones needed replacement. Quality is perfect. This certainly beats buying a new razor as I one I was reviewing was $80. Also the new shavors do not seem to allow you to shave while it is plugged in. So I now have a new shaver for the cost of the new heads. Yah!</li>
            <li> get them every year never a problem</li>
            <li> Great product, big difference when with new blades. I do not replace at 1 year per Norelco&#x27;s recommendation, I usually go 2 years.  I think they are way over priced (about 1/3 the cost of the shaver) but what are you going to do?  They are the only replacement heads that will work in the shaver.</li>
            <li> Replacing my shaver heads made a huge difference in the speed and quality of a shave.  I didnt realize just how bad the old shaver heads were until I tried the new ones.  They are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, thank you!</li>
            <li> I rated it a 4 because it works fine and shaves my face as expected.  However, I personally did not view a large difference between the new blades and the old blades I had in my razor, which were several years old.  Probably needed replacing anyway.</li>
            <li> My husband has owned his Norelco shaver for ten years and had never replaced the blades. Finally, he thought his shaver was dying. I logged on to Amazon to find the replacement heads, and behold, it is just like a brand new shaver. Who knew you were supposed to replace those heads every year? Guess it helps to read the owner&#x27;s manual! At any rate, I got my order superfast, in just a couple of days! I am extremely happy with the outstanding customer service that I have received, and my husband is thrilled to have his favorite shaver back in working order.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item before and am satisfied with its performance.  I saved  several dollars over what retail stores charge for the same product.</li>
            <li> The replacement head for my Norelco did a great job.  My Norelco shaves as well now as it did when it was new.  However, had I done a little more research, I would have ordered the sharpner and resharpin the old blades as well as the three other Norelco shavers that I have.</li>
            <li> I have had a Norelco 8171XL electric shaver for almost 5 years and love it.  I decided to replace the 3 shaver cutting \\&quot;heads\\&quot; as I haven&#x27;t done that since I bought the shaver almost 5 years ago.  So I did replace the heads and didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the \\&quot;old\\&quot; heads verses the new heads.  The instruction manual says to replace the heads every year.  In my opinion, that is not needed.  In fact, the old heads seemed to be holding their cutting edge just fine and seemed just as sharp as the new heads and just slightly worn down but still had plenty of cutting edge left.  So save yourself the money on getting new heads every year.  I think its just a ploy to get more money from us.  I plan on using these new heads for as long as the shaver will last.  Oh, by the way, I decided to clean the \\&quot;head holder\\&quot; really good during this switch and my \\&quot;head holder\\&quot; got loose and wobbly so that it wasn&#x27;t staying in place like it used to (the 3 plastic holders were getting out of place rather easily).  So I replaced them with a new \\&quot;head holder\\&quot; and my shaver looks and feels like brand new no thanks to the new cutting heads.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t changed my Norelco blades in over two years.  What a difference new blades make.  Very good price and fast shipping.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say I haven&#x27;t used the product yet. This is just a review of what I ordered vs. what I received.    The original shaving heads had three circles of blades, 12 around the outside and 9 more arranged on the inner two circles. A picture of the original heads are on the box of replacements and look exactly what I took out of my razor. This HQ9 is also what is listed as the correct replacement #.    But what you get is different - a shaving head with ONE outer circle (no others) and only NINE blades. It still says &#x27;Triple Track Heads&#x27; on the box, which doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.    I&#x27;ve been totally ripped off.</li>
            <li> Prior to the replacment, I had to run my razor over the same area of my face several times to remove all of the wiskers.  Since replacing the heads, one pass is all it takes for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> cutter blades made my Norelco the same as new.  Amazon price was better than anyplace I know.  will replace these blades when they dull.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good quality, original.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original, but very close.</li>
            <li> Put new life in the old shaver.</li>
            <li> Somehow Norelco actually made the HQ9 SpeedXL heads worse than the old lift-and-Cut heads.  To make it look like the heads will produce a faster shave, they reduced the area of the outer ring to make room for two additional cutter rings inside the outer ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem?  The inner rings have a slower surface speed than the old, larger area, outer ring.  So you actually have a smaller high speed cutter area while the inner rings end up pulling your beard hairs when you try to shave as fast as your old Lift-and-Cut shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why can&#x27;t you buy the old lift-and-cut heads to fit you new Smart-Touch shaver?  Like all Norelco rotary rasors, each model uses a slightly different drive pin to make you buy the newer, more expensive, heads.  Philips knows how to make their old products obselete so you will buy the new \\&quot;better\\&quot; stuff.</li>
            <li> Although a little bit pricey, it is still much cheaper to replace the heads than buy a new razor. Good buy.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say.  These heads fit my razor, the price was almost tolerable, and the shave was close and smooth, without nicks.  I recommend these.</li>
            <li> i got the product and it does the job</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Always dependable&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend</li>
            <li> I have an 8251 XL razor.  It is probably 10+ years old, and was still using the original blades.  I use it probably 3 -5 times a week;  I do blade shave some days depending on my schedule and my ambition.  These replacements were delivered in a couple of days.  It took literally, like a minute to replace in the razor.  Once you see what is shipped, it&#x27;s pretty intuitive how to replace.  You just twist the clip holding the 3 heads in place counter clockwise... replace the heads... put the clip back in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely getting a closer shave in probably 2/3 the time and with more comfort.  Would have - should have replaced these sooner if I  had known it would be that painless.  Don&#x27;t hesitate.  I&#x27;m good for another several years, now.</li>
            <li> Good replacement for the original blades. Installation is easy and they work fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a while and am very pleased with these replacement blades - they should be replaced annually.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve replaced the heads on my razor and each time its like having a new razor</li>
            <li> quick delivery.  work grat</li>
            <li> Package just arrived. Within 10 minutes I had the new blades installed and my first shave with them completed. Just as good as the first shave with a brand new razor. Some of the reviews stated the package was difficult to get into (just use a sissor close to the blades and cut accross and they will slide right out. Remove the old ones noting the posistion they go in and just put the new ones in the same posistion, close the top and you are ready for a brand new shave. Well worth the $25. including a $5.00 discount coupon and free shipping. I should have purchased an extra set for next year.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that it is like a new shaver.  I don&#x27;t get 5:00 shadow any more!</li>
            <li> Norelco recommends changing heads once a year, if you have a tough beard I think 9 months is about right.  After you change you can&#x27;t believe how dull your other heads were.  Like night and day.  Norelco shavers are reliable and a great product.  Will never switch back to the blade again.  It&#x27;s like paying 25 dollars a year for a daily shave.</li>
            <li> needed new heads and it was a whole lot cheaper than I could find in any of the stores in our town.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes these.  We&#x27;ve been looking for them but they are not on the store shelves where we shop.</li>
            <li> Turns out I could have bought the same heads for the same price at the local discount Big Box store.  Nothing wrong with these - I just mistook that I was getting the entire shave head, rather than the three replacement cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No biggie, but this was on time I&#x27;d have done just as well to purchase locally.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A GREAT COMPANY LIKE PHILIPS NORELCO.  I got over a year out of my last ones.  Hope to do the same.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding replacement heads, so I finally found these, and they are working just great.</li>
            <li> I have two Norelcos, one for home and one for travel.  I buy new heads every two years or so, since they are each used half time.  I shave both my face and head, so I&#x27;m very satisfied with the length they last.  They perform well until they wear out and become dull at the two year mark.</li>
            <li> Do what it&#x27;s expected to do. Delivered on time and meets all its specs.</li>
            <li> I change these heads once a year and my razor is like new. Great product.</li>
            <li> It was as expected.  The delivery was timely and the product has preformed as advertised</li>
            <li> This product arrived very quickly and was very easy to install (less than 30 seconds to replace heads) -- everything works as advertised!</li>
            <li> Shaver heads needed replacement and this was an easy and smooth way to do it.</li>
            <li> should replace the heads once a year.  What a difference the replacements make.  And thru Amazon, you buy the replacement blades cheaper, then the complete head assembly.  Great deal.</li>
            <li> I received the product as promised quickly and packaged appropriately. Overall a very good transaction</li>
            <li> We live in a rural area about 20 minutes from nearest big box store and i kept forgetting to buy them when i was out shopping.  Thought about it while watching tv show so searched on amazon and ordered during a commercial break.  Exactly the model needed and works great.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but I use it daily and they really do last a full year.  I find electric razors cause less irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are like getting a new razor.  Easy to install, as long as you don&#x27;t drop one of the 3 heads and watch it roll under the bed.</li>
            <li> When I bought my [first] shaver last year I never thought about having trouble getting replacement heads, but what I time I had. I don&#x27;t know if it was because there are a lot of guys using this model, a lot of folks bought these during the holidays or what, but stores in my area, IF they had a spot on the shelves for it, didn&#x27;t have it in stock AND wanted up to $10 more than I paid here.</li>
            <li> My kids bought me this shaver for Christmas two years ago. I just had to buy new heads now.  It has done a great job.  Easy to use, gives a close shave, charge holds for a long time, easy to clean, light weight and good feel to the handle.  The floating heads contour well to your face.  I hate to see this shaver getting poor ratings, but I suppose if you are used to an older shaver any new shaver would be \\&quot;Don&#x27;t make them like they used to!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I get a really smooth shave when I buzz.  The replacement heads pop in easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before to replace the old cutters from my electric shaver. They work perfectly, and it&#x27;s always a relief to get rid of old dull cutters and then rediscover that new ones really do make a difference!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with purchase. Quick delivery and product as described.</li>
            <li> After a couple years I thought I would be replacing Hubby&#x27;s. shaver. Ordered these &amp; it is like new. Great purchase</li>
            <li> My Norelco is shaving like it was brand new.  I would advise getting new blades before buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Your packaging  was squashed, but the shaving heads were fine.</li>
            <li> These new heads are working fine.  Got two years out of the previous ones.  Easy purchase.</li>
            <li> These cutters are a vast improvement from the older HQ types. These lasted me over a year as opposed to the 8 months which was the best that I could get out of the older type cutters. The shaver that takes these cutters is also a surprise. It only needs to be recharged about every 3 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> Husband says it works great! No complaints.</li>
            <li> Got it.. Works great and installed easy.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than Wal Mart. Good value.</li>
            <li> Replacing the heads is like getting a new razor!  I was impressed!</li>
            <li> Replacement give new life to my old razor.</li>
            <li> I read a number of reviews from others on this site before buying.  To the person who said they couldn&#x27;t figure out how to change the heads out - I&#x27;m sorry, but I don&#x27;t think they could have made it easier.  It was intuitive and simple, and even though they did have basic instructions on the package, I didn&#x27;t need them.  Unlock the holder, remove the holding device, replace heads, put back together.     Simple!  And it&#x27;s nice to be back to original quality as well.</li>
            <li> It does the job as replacement heads but my shave didn&#x27;t improve much since I swapped them. Not sure if its the shaver or the heads.</li>
            <li> Not a lot to say about them. If your razor isn&#x27;t shaving as well as it used to it might be time for it. Very easy installation. I always use mine as long as possible and had the razor for 2 years before replacing them so it was quite an improvement. Just make sure you get the ones for your razor!</li>
            <li> Really fast order to delivery time.  My husband loves his razor so much, he will continue to replace these blades on his Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL razor as long as they are available.  Replacement heads make it feel like a new razor everytime.[[ASIN:B0009MFUPO Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads]]</li>
            <li> Although it is easy to replace these new heads, the shaving outcome was not what I expect it like the original heads did, i.e., not as sharp.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of other reviewers, I was getting annoyed with how long it was taking to shave.  Long whiskers around the larynx were a real pain.  I was shopping for a new shaver when I started reading the reviews on these heads.  I checked my purchase records and realized that I had been shaving with the same heads for five years!  No wonder they weren&#x27;t working well.    After installing the new heads shaving took less than half the time and resulted in a much smoother shave.  Spend the money.  Is is worth it!</li>
            <li> Got it in plenty of time.  Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
            <li> Hit the wrong star item purchase was great.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades did the job for me. The shaver feels like new. At the price I paid, I would buy again next year.</li>
            <li> I have been using the HQ9 for a number of years now. Blades have always been sharp, not like the replacement RQ blades for the follow-on razor.</li>
            <li> repeat buyer, product has always met my expectations</li>
            <li> Excelente producto recomendado.. lo recomiendo! funciona excelente y llego a tiempo, excelente envoltura y tal cual lo describio el vendedor</li>
            <li> This Norelco Razor Head Replacement works great and the price was, well definitely appealing!  I would highly recommend this replacement when the original one gets dull!</li>
            <li> I was complaining all the time about my Norelco razor how it pulls instead of cuts, especially if I haven&#x27;t shaved in a few days.  I should have bought these a long time ago.  My razor is around 3 years old and I had never replaced the heads.  I was ready to throw it away, even though my wife paid over $200 for it.  I bought these as a last ditch effort and WOW do they make a difference.  Comfortable close shave the way it should be.  Pulls are minimal and the shave is much quicker and nicer.  Small price to pay for a great shave.  From now on I will keep these things updated.</li>
            <li> I can not speak for other models, but this one makes the heads really easy to replace.  Once you open the top, flip the mechanism that holds the blades, you just take the old ones out and replace with the new ones.  Ready to go for a nice, clean  shave.</li>
            <li> The razor model for these heads is a step forward from previous models, and the replacement heads are easier to install and produce a noticeably improved shave compared to the used heads.</li>
            <li> The product was suitable for it&#x27;s stated use but I frankly saw little improvement in the performance of the razor after the replacement.</li>
            <li> the Phillips Norelco HQ9 replacement heads gave my razor new life, like when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;They are very sharp as expected.</li>
            <li> Why replace the razor, when you can just order replacement heads for his favorite razor?  So that&#x27;s exactly what I did, and I have a very happy camper.  Great idea, great price, and arrives quickly!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was very upset. I typed in my razor model in the search area. This razor head came up as a reccomendation. Not only did it not fit my razor properly. It ruined it. I had to buy a new razor. Thanks so much for your bad advice.</li>
            <li> New blades bring new life to a good razor, smoother, closer and quicker.  Amazon also had the best price, even lower then the WM and they had it stock while WM never had it at two stores and 6 different trys.  Other stores were way out of line pricewise.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my razor needed to make it function new again.</li>
            <li> These are junk, stayed sharp a 6 weeks.  Now I have to shave twice a day.</li>
            <li> Why buy a new shaver when your old one does the job with new replacement heads. It works just like new now.</li>
            <li> Replacing the shaver heads is like buying a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;I should have done this before now.&lt;br /&gt;Product is right. Right price. Right delivery</li>
            <li> Its like getting a new shaver! I don&#x27;t know what the MFG recommends, but you should replace these as soon as a cleaning and recharge no longer results in a good shave. Much cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT PHILIPS NORELCO HQ9 SPEEDXL REPLACEMENT HEADS IS PERFECT. I STRONGLY RECOMEND IT TO ANY ONE LOOKING FOR A CONFORTABLE AND SAFE SHAVING.</li>
            <li> Nothing better then a nice close shave.  I use my Norelco every three days so my HQ9 lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one year of daily use the cutters travel the height of Mt Everest, 29,029 feet or 5.4 miles!</li>
            <li> Made the machine good as new.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> the spare parts are working fine and fits perfect on the shaver, still in use after a year with no problems. the item arrived fast and well packed.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than a new razor.  This head was a perfect fit and continued the ability of the best razor that I have ever had to give me a close shave.</li>
            <li> These Norelco replacement heads are a good price and it&#x27;s nice to have a clean shave again. Order was processed and received really quickly.</li>
            <li> Works well,.fit the razor fine .Good product...</li>
            <li> A perfect fit and were very east to install.  Razor cuts like new again</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  It cuts all of my hair, even on my bald head in a couple of passes.  It doesn&#x27;t chaf the back of my neck like the old heads.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product for my Dad. He says that his electric razor works like it is brand new, again! Woohoo!</li>
            <li> I get a new set of heads every 12-18 months. Never had any problems and they worked as designed.</li>
            <li> Returned the razor to like new condition.  Heads took about a week to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; (or for my face to adjust).</li>
            <li> I was ready to buy a new shaver but the reviews on Norelco&#x27;s top tier offerings did not impress me.  So, I ordered one of these kits and my current shaver really as good as new.  In fact, I&#x27;m not sure anything new would have been an improvement, so for this small investment I&#x27;m pretty sure I made the best choice possible.  Now, in 2011 I&#x27;ll have to check all the offerings/reviews again, but until then I&#x27;m quite happy.</li>
            <li> After using the Norelco shaver for several months after the recommended replacement date, I expected a much batter shave.  However, I was disappointed.  The new blades are expensive, and I can&#x27;t tell a difference.</li>
            <li> These arrived promptly, new as described. Yes, the boxes were slightly bent, but no damage to the heads, as they were blister packed.</li>
            <li> They are replaced every year and they pop right into the shaver with no problem.  Excellent quality and very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Work perfectly if you have the right model. Check model number on back of unit.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price for these heads. Makes my razor purr like a kitten and I get a great shave without having to keep going over and over my beard.</li>
            <li> They should state the real feature of the 2 blade system as \\&quot;The first blade lifts up the hair, and the second blade rips out the hair\\&quot;  I was bought the shaver as a gift from costco, from day 1 it has been painful. It causes irritation and ingrown hairs, and about once a week I raise my arm preparing to throw it at the wall before calming down. If I skip a day without shaving then it is even worse.  I hope I have received some kind of reject, because I feel bad for everyone else who gets one.</li>
            <li> Time to change the heads ... This was a good price (when compared to others). If your shaver is missing spots, maybe you have gone longer than a year to replace the heads.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads fit as described and get the job done.</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with these replacement heads for his electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just said in effect ,&amp;#34;keep them coming&amp;#34;. I guess that says it all. Very convenient!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor replacement head to friends and family.  I did not have to spend more to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> The new razor heads really make a difference. I have had this electric razor for overs 6 years and just now had to buy new razor heads. Good price too.</li>
            <li> The Norelco blades that I replaced were three-years old and the new ones that I purchased a few weeks ago gave a rougher shave than the old ones, leaving my face sore.  I gave myself five shaves with it and I am now about ready to go to a manual razor, which I have used once with good success.  Would you like me to return the blades that I received a from you a few weeks ago??</li>
            <li> The new heads made my shaver work like new.  They are easy to install. I am very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending the money on these new blades, but they returned my razor to like-new condition. I wish they were $5-10 cheaper, but what are you going to do. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> SERVICE AND PRODUCTS 5 STARS</li>
            <li> As usual, the new blades made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> They always work GREAT &amp; THE Price is right!</li>
            <li> Original equipment heads.</li>
            <li> Norelco recommends head replacement every year or 2 years, depending on which brochure you read.  After 5 years it was time.  Heads are easy to replace, and seemed to do a somewhat better job at daily chore of shaving.  I had expected a faster shave, but the performance is satisfactory.</li>
            <li> My razor must be four or five years old.  Should have changed heads a long time ago.  It did make a difference in the shave and the time it takes.</li>
            <li> Made such a difference to my razor, why did I not change them sooner.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed as a replacement for the old shaver heads. Works as expected to give a close shave.</li>
            <li> I like Norelco razors and heads.  They provide a close shave with no nicks and cuts associated with traditional blades.  Just give your face a good chance to adjust the electric razor and blades.  You&#x27;ll need 3 - 4 weeks to adjust.  Blades last about a year if used daily.</li>
            <li> Seems to work better than the originals</li>
            <li> They work.  Original equipment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used  Phillips Norelco products for years. The parts are resonable priced and and easy to replace and they seem to last longer than expected. Suppose to replace at least once a year. I rerplace mine once very two years.</li>
            <li> It is best to change your blades every 6-9 mos. I used to stretch this because of the high cost locally $44....at $29.95 its da bomb!</li>
            <li> I feel like the heads that originally came with it were better but that&#x27;s just my opinion. I had my original heads for about a year and a half (using about every other day) before I had to swap out. With these I feel like I have to go over certain spots more than others.</li>
            <li> Great cut.  Easy to insert in razor.  Fits perfectly into my razor.  Will buy again when I more replacements. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> When I installed my new blades it was like having a new razor again. After a year you gradually forget what a new razor is like! One hint: Just before I bought the replacement blades Amazon ran a Deal of the Day that would have let me buy a new razor for the price of the replacement blades; but I hesitated and lost out. Keep your eyes open for these types of deals and for Amazon coupons that may reduce your cost of blades or make it worthwhile to buy a whole new razor for the cost of replacement blades.</li>
            <li> the price was the cheapest anywhere.  plus you had free shipping they are good quality and do a great job of shaving.  thanks for having choices to buy at a savings to customers.</li>
            <li> I buy these every year and it really helps to prevent the razor burn on the neck.  If you have it from and electric razor, time to change the blades.</li>
            <li> Wondering if these shaver heads are new. They don&#x27;t seen to cut that well. At times it is actually painful to shave.</li>
            <li> After using my Norelco razor for a couple years, I replaced the blade heads thinking that I should see a noticeable improvement in the cutting quality.  Sadly, I can&#x27;t really tell a discernible difference between the cut of the old heads and the new ones.  I can only think that this means a) old heads were holding up as well as when new and it was only my impression of the passage of time that made me think they were dulling, or b) the sharpness of the new heads was not manufactured with a quality standard that would have shown a vast improvement over 2 year old blades.  Disappointing performance from Norelco, nonetheless, and at a head replacement cost that is higher than most other models.</li>
            <li> Makes my old razor new again - and Amazon had it a lot cheaper than the local retailers. Very easy to install, just open and put in razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent piece of technology.  Works much better than a manual razor or electronic razor made for the face.  These blades are designed to go smoothly over any area of the body from which you&#x27;d like to remove hair.  I use it on my chest,abs, to trim my legs, arms, and even the nether regions.  Works like a charm every time.  Non-abrasive, smooth, stays sharp for about a year.</li>
            <li> My Norelco shaver was taking noticeably longer and far more passovers to complete my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew that it had been 2 years since I switched blades and it was a time for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I switched my blades to this replacement head, my shave was noticeably faster and took far fewer passovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, Norelco makes the best shavers in the market right now. Although their blades do an adequate job, their shavers are not quite as clean as the Gillette or Schick blades. Nevertheless, one cannot beat convenience of electric shavers and the quality of the Norelco shave is very close to the blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco recommends the users to replace the head once every year. That would be true if you have a lot of beard. If you are a moderate beard grower, then replacing it every 1.5 to 2 years should suffice. Either way, you will see a significant improvement in your shave after replacing your Norelco shaving head.</li>
            <li> after switching out to the replacement heads its doesnt appear to be an upgrade at all. not satisfied and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Getting new heads is like getting a new razor without, but for a lot less money. I have the feel I had when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li> Very nice replacement heads. I ordered these for my boyfriends Norelco Razor and he loves this brand. I would suggest to get the norelco blade cleaner and lubricant as well to make your blades last longer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on-line for my husband and he was very happy with the product and the price was reasonable and much cheaper then the stores around us and the products came very fast and on time in the mail.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is not as good as the original.The metal is much thinner. There may be two items for this number however Amazon does not describe the differences. It is working ok for now however I do not expect it to last as long which may be the reason it was a lot cheaper than those in my local stores.</li>
            <li> They seem to work OK as a replacement, but it seems all replacement parts are a rip, be it blades like this or brushes for power toothbrushes.  A couple of replacement blade sets costs almost as much as the razor.  Problem is that you have to have them and the manufacturers know this, and rip you accordingly.</li>
            <li> these replacement blades don&#x60;t give a good shave. very disappointed. wouldn&#x60;t ever  order again !</li>
            <li> just a yearly replacement.</li>
            <li> it is very good. yes, it is very good~&lt;br /&gt;it is very good. yes, it is very good~&lt;br /&gt;it is very good. yes, it is very good~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the cheap Chinese blades and they aren&#x27;t worth a flip....these work great and last about a year on my tough beard...</li>
            <li> Replacement heads make for a close shave.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Been using these razors a long while. Seems to me these heads are not as sharp as the originals.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I just got a bad set.  Quality otherwise is usuall high grade, neatly done. Harder to get them out of the packing than it is to insall them.I would reccomend.</li>
            <li> Buy these every few years for my husband.</li>
            <li> I live in Alberta, Canada.  I ordered the Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Head for my shaver. It was shipped from the U.S. to Canada.  I received the item in perfect condition and it works just like a new product should work.  So I would say I&#x27;m totally happy with the purchase.  DHL Global is the company that handled the shipping of the product to me. I was not thrilled dealing with DHL Global as I had challenges setting up deliver of the product to my door. They forgot once or twice to deliver it when they said they would.  They only deliver from about 8 AM to 4:30 PM.  I should have just picked the product up from DHL Global Edmonton myself.</li>
            <li> I needed to have a spare set of replacement blades for my Norelco shaver.  These are brand name at a good price with immediate shipment.  Saved me time from having to shop locally.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were as promised, new in sealed package and they work fine.  Verry happy with the transaction</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  The company I bought it from was friendly, prompt and provided great customer service.  A+++</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000050B6D Philips Norelco HQ6 Quadra Action Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]  First replacement I have done since having the razor for a year.  What a difference.</li>
            <li> Easy to install...better blades &#x3D; better shave!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Norelco razors for several years and am quite satisfied with the products.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong per se with the product but the replacement heads cost $30.  You&#x27;re much better off buying a reconditioned speedshaver razor for around $42, which will include new heads.</li>
            <li> It was really hard to find this item, let alone at a good price.  Amazon had it the cheapest.  It was for my husbands razor and he had it for about a year and he stopped using it because the blades got dull.  But since he replaced the blades he uses it regularly again!  He has the SpeedXL razor with is great!</li>
            <li> The product was everything I expected it to be.  It arrived in a timely fashion, was a Norelco original product in its packaging and works well.</li>
            <li> Replacing the heads definitely makes a difference.  It&#x27;s easy to ignore on an electric razor but it&#x27;s important to do.  Putting new blades in cut down on irritation since it takes less time to cut.  Norelco recommends doing it yearly, which sounds about right but you can wait until you notice it starts taking you longer to shave.  Then it&#x27;s time for new blades.</li>
            <li> There was an improvement in the performance of the cutting head, but I am very disappointed that it is going to cost me 1/3 the value of the entire shaver to replace the head when needed.  I will probably stop using the Norelco after this head wears out.</li>
            <li> They were the right thing and a great buy but when my husband took apart his razor to change the heads he found a problem with the razor that could not be fixed so we returned the heads. I was amazed how wonderful Amazon is to return items, I never had to return anything before this.</li>
            <li> After using my Philips-Norelco shaver for several years the cutting blades were quite dull.  Installing the replacement shaver head was simple and now the shaver works like new. This is a much more economical solution than buying a new shaver.  HN</li>
            <li> I was able to get these Norelco replacement heads cheaper on Amazon.com than any of my local stores.  Being that they are a somewhat expensive purchase, I tried to price them out before hand.  And now that I have gotten them, it was worth the investment as my razor is like brand new and is shaving better.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about changing blades, I&#x27;m the normal throw it out and get a new one guy.  I was extremely dismayed when I saw the childish diagram for instructions on replacing the blades.  I now know why they used such a simple diagram, because it&#x27;s that easy.  Within a minute or so I have the blades replaced.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but there it was done and shaving beautifully.  Don&#x27;t hesitate about buying replacement blades, you&#x27;ll end up with a shaver that&#x27;s like new.</li>
            <li> The replacement head for my Philips/Norelco razor arrived on time.  Like everthing nowdays, the head came in \\&quot;adult-proof\\&quot; plastic packaging and took a sharp knife to get into.  But other than that, the new head feels great and is like having a new razor again.</li>
            <li> This is a product you can buy any where, but saving money on Amazon is all ways the best way to go.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and without problems. I will do business with this supplier again. Thanks for the great service. NT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisifed with both the Norelco razor and the HQ9 replacement blades.  I&#x27;ve has my Norelco about three years, and I replace the blades once per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per instructions it does take a couple of days for the new blades to \\&quot;set\\&quot; in.  I also reccoemnd that you utilize the spreay lubricant, it makes the change-out process much smoother and use it to freshen up your razor.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my husband and was exactly what he wanted. Speedy delivery too.</li>
            <li> Product is just what I needed for my son&#x27;s Norelco shaver. It works just fine.</li>
            <li> Yes ....it&#x27;s necessary to change the blades ....it was easy to buy thru Amazon!!</li>
            <li> My husband really likes his Norelco Shaver and he found this Replacement Head to be the best priced replacement head. He says it&#x27;s a great shave and I like the way it feels, too!</li>
            <li> Been long time since I changed the blades out on my XL 8260, and was hoping they still made blades for it! There they are and they work great, thanks!</li>
            <li> i have been ordering these replacement heads once a year since i got my razor.always very satisfied.will order again in a year.</li>
            <li> It was time to replace them aftet 3 years or so. They are fine shave heads that fit perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Blades cut good but they also pulls</li>
            <li> New blades make a real difference after almost 3 years.</li>
            <li> Look carefully before you buy.  I needed the entire head assembly, placed the order and I received the blades, nothing more.</li>
            <li> the replacement heads work fine.</li>
            <li> package was smashed by the post office but blades r ok i think so far</li>
            <li> My razor works like new.</li>
            <li> The replacement Norelco heads for my Philishave shaver met my all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Heads were made in the Netherlands (surprise, surprise - I fully expected China).&lt;br /&gt;Replacement heads arrived on time, undamaged, in a well packaged parcel.&lt;br /&gt;I saved a substantial sum, as compared to local purchase, by purchasing from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to recommend Amazon as a purchase point to anyone who asks.</li>
            <li> ensure that you note how the old blades fit in the head before you remove them.  there were no instructions.</li>
            <li> This product contains three replacement heads for the Norelco 9160XL electric razor. After 1 1/2 years of continuous daily usage the original cutting heads were no longer giving a good shave. I decided to replace the original blades with this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)Easy to following instruction for replacement on the package, and the actual replacement process was incredibly simple and easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.)The new blades functioned perfectly; because the decline in performance of the original blades was so gradual, it was difficult to believe how much of an improvement these replacement blades provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not so good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one complaint; the packaging. The replacement blade were embodied in a package that made it extremely difficult to actually get at the blades. There were a series of 6 grommet eyelets surrounding the entire package making it very secure. I literally had to force scissors between the layers of cardboard to get around the grommets to eventually get to the blades inside. In a word...frustrating. Plus, a slight slip and a bad cut may have occurred (I think everyone has experienced trying to open one of these newer hard-plastic wrapped items and knows just how difficult it can really be to get at the product inside).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;An excellent set of replacement blades. (I just hope they&#x27;ll last longer than the 3 months it took for the original blades to start to lose their sharpness). Time will tell; but up to now, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;However, getting the blades out of this package could be considered a potential hazard.&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars for the product itself, with 1 or 2 Stars off for the needless obstructive packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum Feb 24/08:&lt;br /&gt;Interesting to note that they&#x27;ve changed the packaging on this product (since my original review) making it appear that it&#x27;s less hazardous to access. However, as I haven&#x27;t purchase this specific product package, I can&#x27;t comment on the ease of access (or safety) of the new packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R.Nicholson</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads. The product was reasonably priced and made the shaver same as a new product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> After 38 months of service, I thought my trusted &#x27;Philips Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL&#x27; (no longer on sale at Amazon) deserved a new set of blades, therefore I ordered the replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to complain about the new heads, once installed. The old ones while still giving me a good shave would sometimes pull instead of cutting and the skin on my neck would often get irritated. With the new heads in, both problems went away and I am therefore a happier, better shaved man now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the installation was everything BUT easy. Besides some small drawings on the box itself there are no specific instructions on how to do it and I simply couldn&#x27;t. All is fine now, thanks to my wife&#x27;s dexterity and patience but it didn&#x27;t have to be that hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, I am happy that I can continue to use my one and favorite shaver but the replacement process was &#x27;mission impossible&#x27; for me and &#x27;mission hard&#x27; for my wife.</li>
            <li> Every time I switch shaving heads I&#x27;m reminded of how great it is to have new heads.  It almost makes one want to change heads every month (obviously not cost effective).  Really, it&#x27;s a lot like changing tires on a car which I only do every several years.  By then one has forgotten just how smooth the road can feel when gliding along on brand new ones.    These new heads were extremely easy to install.  I actually waited for months after I bought them to install them.  It was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I searched razors direct and other sites, and only Amazon had them in stock, at the lowest price. As usual the order arrived quickly and all worked out, it&#x27;s the exact product you get from Norelco.</li>
            <li> My razor works like new again.</li>
            <li> My razor is like new again!</li>
            <li> Great buy. And easy to install. Does a good job off mowing whiskers. Just ask my wife !!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, and GREAT SERVICE.....I&#x27;ll recommend to my Friends to get in touch with Your website......</li>
            <li> Easy to install.  Just like having a new razor again.</li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d come up with a cheaper way to offer these things. They just cost too much. I end up using them way longer than I should just to avoid the expense. They work great though.</li>
            <li> my husband enjoys his new replacement head for his razor!</li>
            <li> These replacement HQ9 Norelco Shaver heads are rather pricey for sure, but they are still way cheaper than buying a brand new razor.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 5 stars because they work great, are an exact replacement and they were shipped sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves like new again!</li>
            <li> Boy it&#x27;s nice to have a smooth shave and this razor delivers just that.  It&#x27;s my 4th Norelco razor and each razor gets better and better with the technology that&#x27;s available now.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and now the shaver works just like new!  Wish I had replaced the heads much sooner - worth every penny for a cleaner, closer shave.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize what you&#x27;re missing until you finally get around to replacing your blades. Shaver works like new again.</li>
            <li> It took me a very long time to figure out that these were the replacement heads I needed for my shaver (there are many choices, and none of them matched the model number of the shaver).  Also, there are at least two different packages for the HQ9 heads, with different pictures that make it even more confusing.  Having said that, and that the price is steep, I noticed a slight improvement in performance when I put in the new blades.  Also, in my experience Philips products are always high quality.</li>
            <li> A necessary yearly expense.  It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> With the new blades, the razor works FANTASTICALLY.  Just like new.  Why did I wait two years to replace--suffer face burn.  GRRRRRRRR    A great buy; good price.    Thanks.    Jim    even better.  The service from Amazon was great, as usual.</li>
            <li> delivered as discribed</li>
            <li> Bought for my Father, He was happy. When received, box crushed in a bit but product was OK.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco is still running and I will not be replacing it until it absolutely gives up the ghost..&lt;br /&gt;Its much more sturdy than all the little flimsy ones out there now and I can get a pretty darn good close shave with this anytime..&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for still making replacement heads for this !</li>
            <li> Good product and arrived on time. Thank you!</li>
            <li> They fit perfect and worked great.  Saved me a lot of money as I did not need to get a new razor and got to keep my great Norelco razer.</li>
            <li> A great shave now and for the past 20 years!!! It needs about a week of use for the blades to set on...then hang on!!!</li>
            <li> Replacement heads made a heck of a difference in the shave, this is first time I replaced them and they were easy to install.</li>
            <li> My first replacement head on the razor for ~10 years. I use this shaver 2 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Easy to replace, not mess. What an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Mostly on me, I should have done this years before. Pricey, but Amazon was competitive.</li>
            <li> Good OEM blades that perform as expected.  Not sure why Amazon offers delivery subscriptions from 1 to 6 months when the factory recommendation is to replace annually.  I replace when the shave quality goes down, which seems to be about 10-12 months.</li>
            <li> I bought the new heads instead of a new shaver.  Immediate improvement.  Saved some money and am getting a much better shave.</li>
            <li> As advertised:  quality product, good price, and beat published delivery time.  Next time I will replace the heads sooner.  The new heads make for a great shave.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and was easy to install.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of the new Norelco&#x27;s that are made in China, I decided to keep my 15 year old Norelco Speed-XL 8140XL.  It still holds a charge for about 2-3 weeks of use.  It just needed new heads.  I had reservations about ordering these heads, but I was delighted to find that the heads are made in the Netherlands.  They fit perfectly.  This item includes only the 3 HQ9 heads, not the head assembly into which they mount.  I should be set for several years.  Thanks Norelco for not outsourcing everything to China.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco, If you were smart, you&#x27;d bring back all of your products manufacturing back to the Netherlands.  Your loyal customers will pay more if you don&#x27;t send it to China and cheapen the product.  Don&#x27;t follow the lemmings over the cliff of quick profits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for several years, and I notice that cleaning the cutters will extend their service life.  At some point the cutters have to be replaced, and these are the ones to get back to good shaves.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer stated, the China cost would be about $2. For about $40 you can buy a brand new Norelco shaver ie $10 more. So new heads are good, absurd pricing is not.</li>
            <li> I usually just buy a new razor but thought I would buy the replacement blades instead. I don&#x27;t think that they are as good as the original blades and these are supposed to be an upgrade. I guess they work but are just OK nothing special, I am glad I did not pay more than $26 for them.</li>
            <li> It was like having a new razor with the new heads.I wish I had not waited so long to order new heads.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I checked on the Norelco web site to verify I was buying the right head. To find the model number for the razor open the sideburn / mustache clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is like new again and the shipping was great.</li>
            <li> These did work for about a week and then were like i used them for a year....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Good!</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are exactly what we needed and the service provided by Amazon was terrific. The product arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with my electric razor and the replacement blades give me a new razor each time I change the blades.  Easy to change and gives a pretty good shave.</li>
            <li> Somewhat expensive for what it is.  Manufacturer recommends replacement every year.  While certainly that will keep things more fresh, I waited almost four years.  The difference warranted the price after that duration.  I didn&#x27;t really notice the difference my previous time, which was almost two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement is easy.  Packaging could be better.</li>
            <li> Received my new shaver replacement heads and the razor is performing like new. With the new replacement heads I&#x27;m getting a closer shave. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric razor for almost 20 years.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands but Norelco has always been my favorite.  I never got into the $250 electric razors with built in lotion and all the extra self cleaning stuff.  The good old HQ9 heads cut well and can run for a while before they need a cleaning or replacement.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads for my shaver! I have bought them over and over again and have been thoroughly satisfied every time!</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly and received in great time frame by usps. Razor heads work great perfect fit. In the past I always had to take razor to supplier to match up heads this was great just type in model and pick it up at my front door.</li>
            <li> My current shaver heads were dull ( 3 years old ) so I bought Norelco HQ9 replacement  heads, to my complete surprise, the new heads were worse than my old one&#x27;s. Would never  use this source again!</li>
            <li> I needed new heads for my Philips Speed Touch XL. Found these : genuine Philips product, delivered fast, GREAT pricing. They probably will last as long as the originals, that is, a few years!</li>
            <li> These blades should work great as they are made for this razor and they do work good but their cost is way too high given the price of the razor. It is a total rip off by the company.</li>
            <li> Works fine and easily installed.</li>
            <li> I ONLY PURCHASE TRUE NORELCO HEAD REPLACEMENTS BECAUSE THEY STAY SHARP A LONG TIME AND THE COMBS DO NOT WEAR OUT.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver product is the most economical means to continue my &amp;#34;closeness&amp;#34; shaving outcome. The phillips norelco body is an excellent shaver.</li>
            <li> I gave the shaving heads 5 stars because they came on time, they fit my razor.  And my wife loves my now smooth face.  What more can you say about 3 shaving heads.  Probably a lot but not from me.  M</li>
            <li> These replacement heads in the store were almost twice the price.  So glad I looked on the internet and found just the right ones for my husbands razor.  Works great.</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with his replacement blades!</li>
            <li> Works as well as expected, good replacement for original equipment.</li>
            <li> Should have purchased more.....and will</li>
            <li> the Norelco replacement heads work OK.  Not much to add, just trying to fill out the required number of words, which I think is rather silly, given the article.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, perfect fit, works great. Replace heads once a year to keep a close shave!  What else can you say!?</li>
            <li> I was amazed how enjoyable my morning shaves have changed, since purchasing this Philips Norelco replacement heads, they work really fine.</li>
            <li> Have bought a couple of times. Replacements work great for my husband&#x27;s shaver. Very satisfied. Would purchase again without concern.</li>
            <li> Could not obtain Heads in Australia at a simular price as you supplied. When I am looking for a new shaver I will for sure contact you again. Very  happy with service. Albert</li>
            <li> I would recommend replacement of the head every year as it makes a huge difference in how close the shave is.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using the same heads for more than five years before I replaced them for the first time with these. Installation was fairly straightforward, and I see some improvement in my shave.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in blade sharpness.  Unable to get a close shave as with original blades.  otherwise razor is satisfactory and reliable.</li>
            <li> The replacement  heads  were  so tightly  packaged, the most  difficult part  was  getting them out of  the  package.  After  that, installation was simple.  A  fine  product to fit a  fine Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are easy to install and work just as well as the heads that are packaged with the product.  This razor is passable, but is really more of a \\&quot;first\\&quot; electric razor.  I don&#x27;t plan on buying more replacement heads when this set runs its course; I&#x27;m going to upgrade to a razor with more flexibility and precision.</li>
            <li> Worked perfect!  Exactly as described.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Much better price than I could find item for locally. If you shave everyday, like I do, you need to keep sharp blades in your razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Norelco 9160XL Smart Touch razor about a year or so ago. Bought these replacement heads as the original ones were worn out. Now the razor is working very well and I am back to enjoying my morning shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changing the heads took less than 5 minutes. One thing I would recommend is that you routinely take the heads out (every 45 days or so) and give it a good wash.</li>
            <li> The original heads lasted a little more than a year. Now that I have the replacement heads, it&#x27;s like a whole new razor!</li>
            <li> The Norelco razor is excellent and the replacement blades which I replace once a year are excellent.</li>
            <li> The head was fine but no instructions came with it. I had some trouble getting it to stay in the shaver until I figured out how to install it.</li>
            <li> Just what my husband needed, couldn&#x27;t find replacement in the store, he loves his shaver, so glad I could find replacement blades for him.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Those, of you, who have a tendency to get in-grown hairs, can forget that problem.  I have used Norelco products, for years.  This is the best, so far.</li>
            <li> I have a very soft beard and face. I still haven&#x27;t had to replace the original heads on my razor. And I get an incredible shave.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades we delivered promtly. The instruction sheet was very easy to follow and the blades work excellent.</li>
            <li> I purchased these replacement heads for my Norelco razor because the old ones were wearing out;  they no longer gave me a good shave.  The new heads work great and do an excellent job when I shave each day.  Plus, they were only around $24.50, which is a good $10 cheaper than they are in most stores.  (Even Walmart!)  All in all, I recommend them very highly.</li>
            <li> Easy to find the right ones, easy to install!  Cheaper than buying whole new razor, even my 8 year old model still works great.</li>
            <li> Makes Hubbys razor seem like a brand new one.  Speedy delivery and working great.  Great that you can buy heads for older models.</li>
            <li> I purchased my husband a Philips Norelco Razor a few years ago for his birthday. After using his Razor daily for years he said everything was still working great, but maybe new replacement heads would make it like \\&quot;NEW\\&quot; again. After replacing the heads, he said that it was working just like it did years ago! Why buy another razor, when you can have it \\&quot;NEW\\&quot; again for half the price!</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable, and the shaver works as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;Replacing it took less than 5 minutes (most of it - spent opening the annoying plastic package).</li>
            <li> These are good, inexpensive replacement blades for your Norelco cordless shaver.  They come with the blades only and not the holder that they fit in.  My blade holder happened to be broken in one place and I did not know it.  There is a little less support for one of the blades but it still shaves pretty good.  You might want to clean yours up real good and do a good close inspection before ordering your parts, just to be sure you order everything you need at one time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what the manufacturer recommends for replacement. Fast delivery. Not much else to say other than I am glad the replacement blades were available</li>
            <li> Were exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li> quick ship. as described. works great. whats not to like. you need a new one, order it. put it in, and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> I choose them as I had to replace mine. I noticed the difference once I put the one in. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This items is exactly what my husband needed to replace the heads on his Phillips Norelco Shaver.  They work perfectly and he would recommend them.</li>
            <li> I have had these for maybe six months now, and they seem to be just fine.  No issues at all.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is in need of them. I have bought many replacements before and these are by far the best ones yet.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for my husband SpeedXL razor; work perfectly.  They do last much longer than the box recommends.&lt;br /&gt;Filler words to take up space.</li>
            <li> Makes my old Norelco shaver work like new again just like it did when I first used it many years ago.</li>
            <li> Would recommend and easy to install. Always keep an extra set on hand and change once a year for a good shave</li>
            <li> Did they change materials or specifications?  These blades suck now and I went to disposable razors.</li>
            <li> This works great,; my Norelco is back to working like new.</li>
            <li> they function adequately the blades make a strange sound however they continue to function with out much of a problem.</li>
            <li> This replacement provides a good value for the price paid. The set of three blades provides an excellent shave as promised for my model.</li>
            <li> I buy these every November to refresh my Norelco razor. Always good quality, a good value, and easy to replace. Plus, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than buying blades!</li>
            <li> This is a quality product that was delivered as advertised.  I have used these shaver heads for about 3 years now and have been well pleased.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are easy to install and make shaving much more convenient again.  Much cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> My razor is just like it was when new. This was the best price that i could find any where.</li>
            <li> I like my razor but now I love it. No more pulling and 20 minute shaves. Fact it acts like it is brand new, duh it&#x27;s got new blades. Wish I had Amazon a long time ago. They wanted 49.99 plus tax for these where I went because they had them in stock it&#x27;s just for some reason they couldn&#x27;t tell me on the phone how much they were until I got there after my 2 hour and fifteen minutes on lightrail and buses and the 9 minute ride from the closest bus stop on my motorized wheel chair with my oxygen bottle on the back. I told them thanks for letting me see why I would never shop here and condem them to anyone that wanted to listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon got them to me the same day I was told I would get them after they sent me the wrong ones to begin with. Way to go Amazon and thanks again. Love this guy, gal, company, distributer, what- ev-er.</li>
            <li> This is the best way to go for great replacement heads... this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had, and I plan on using it and replacing heads until it dies.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads for my razor arrived the very next day (ordered on a Sunday), very convenient when you are waiting to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> I understand from all the hype that I must have needed a new set of heads for my shaver but frankly I have not seen an improvement worth talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really believe the shave I am getting is only marginly better.</li>
            <li> Received just fine and word well.  Exactly as ordered  Have replaced blades many times before and this seems to work well</li>
            <li> great blades.best electric shaver and blades that I&#x27;ve ever had.thought it would be difficult to change blades,but it was very easy.like brand new shaver</li>
            <li> Much better than my old blades.  These were easy to install and work great.  Good price too.  Not much more I can say.</li>
            <li> The written comments I have previously read says this product does not need replacement for about 12 months.  The prior set of blades I bought through Amazon lasted about 5 months.  I hope this new set, through Amazon, lasts longer or I will switch vendors/razors.</li>
            <li> It is always nice to be able to find the parts of mechanical items that you own. Since cordless shavers are relatively expensive, finding the replacement heads are a necessity if you want a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Solid quality original heads by the original manufacturer, came exactly as advertised. If your blades are older your skins will thank you .</li>
            <li> These replacement blades  made my old Norelco shave like new. They were easy to install. Beats replacing with new electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize my old blades were so dull.  Quick service, correct item and SHARP heads.  Why waste time and your skin!</li>
            <li> article is good. price ratio is very good, I am happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads  is what I expected, looks good and feels durable</li>
            <li> was going to replace my razor but didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for a new one. I decided to try the replacement of the blades and couldn&#x27;t be happier that I did.  It&#x27;s just like when I first bought it and couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> Great to have a a clean shave again. Perfect fit makes my razor as good as New !!!</li>
            <li> New heads working well. Good price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my razor for 10 years and it works great so long as I change blades every year.  These aer exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> ast delivery..product works fine</li>
            <li> They fit.  They worked.  That&#x27;s always great.</li>
            <li> SATISFACTORY.  DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO SHAVE ANY BETTER THAN THE OLD HEADS.</li>
            <li> could not find it in the store. and i got it at a good price</li>
            <li> They make the old razor stand up and act like it&#x27;s brand new and straight out of the box.  They are easy to install and have thus far given good, clean, close shaves without pulling whiskers.  Some might think that they are on the expensive side, but stop and think how much regular cartridges would cost you for the same amount of time that you have used your electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have a razor I have been using for several years. It has been long enough that I was having trouble finding replacement blades. These cost me a $100 less than the new razor I was looking at and now my old Norelco shaves better than it did when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these blades. The difference is like night and day from my old blades to the new ones. I was amazed at how much difference there was between th old blades and these. I will definatelly buy these again when needed</li>
            <li> Good price on these hard to find locally replacement heads</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement of original</li>
            <li> great price.  exactly what i needed.  quick service.  less expensive than any store in town.  would recommend to everyone.  just look at your razor and find the type you need.  should have changed these out months ago.</li>
            <li> very good product it works great product I started to have problems with the original that came with the shaver but I bought this one put it in and it was like brand new</li>
            <li> I have used my razor daily for about two years and I decided to buy new blades. Well, I installed the new blades and I do not notice a difference in my shave. I suppose the old blades were still OK because I am get the same shaving results.</li>
            <li> I purchased the HQ9 heads from Amazon.  Easy to find and order, package arrived in a week on the free shipping deal.  Outstanding!  Popped them into my shaver and was instantly rewarded with a close, comfortable shave.    But it turns out I didn&#x27;t need new cutter heads after all.  I had been neglecting to properly clean my 14 month old Speed-XL shaver.  What I thought was dulling cutters was actually a tremendous build-up of GUNK inside the cutter heads.  I wish I could show you the pile of gunk I just cleaned-out!  The triple track cutters have more sharp edges and corners in them that the earlier single track models (I&#x27;ve been a Norelco man for some 30 years now), and they trap and hold more gunk than ever before.  They need to be cleaned-out more often.  Once properly cleaned, my old cutter heads delivered a shave at like-new closeness and comfort.    So guys, RTFM and follow the directions!  Do a quick cleaning (hot tap water if you have a water cleanable model) about once a week.  Once a month, sit down and remove the cutters and clean them thoroughly with the small brush they gave you.  Be careful to not mix-up the combs and cutters!  You can most likely save yourself the thirty bucks on new heads for another year or so, and keep getting that satisfying Norelco shave :)</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000EI0IF0 Norelco HQ4PLUS Micro Action Plus Lift-and-Cut Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]    This ws an easy to use set of replacement blades that really do make a difference.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product a number of times.  The service was great. As for the product I think that the heads should last more that 2 years.  I have purchased Norelco before and the heads have lastede for up to 6 or 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Peterson</li>
            <li> Poduct is easy to use.  Replacement instructions are clear, concise.  No problems with performance.</li>
            <li> The product I ordered was at a very low price and it was delivered as and when promised.</li>
            <li> Better to buy two sets of these online and have a spare set handy, than to go to Target and pay way too much. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Was expensive, but if it put the shavor back in \\&quot;new\\&quot; condition, it would be worth it.  It didn&#x27;t.  Plus, hard to install the blades.  For the price, you should get a new head (cover), but you don&#x27;t.  So, never again.  Back to the old blade for me</li>
            <li> This is the third head for my razor which is several years old. The improvement in the quality of the shave is immediately available and it now takes less time for me to finish a shave (3-4 minutes versus 5-6 minutes) so I am getting more shaves per charge. I recommend getting this replacement head when your shaver indicates you should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors since I was 15, 48 years ago, but my next razor won&#x27;t be a Norelco.  I replaced my old razor with a newer model last Spring (the 8140XL).  In the past, I would replace the heads every few years, but with this razor after 6 months the heads needed replacing. I&#x27;ve now used the replacement heads for 3 months and they have already grown dull!  It&#x27;s obvious that Norelco has succumbed to the idea that their profits are really in selling the heads rather than the quality items they used to sell.  Buy something else.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the ability to give a close shave. I decided that the two year old razor blades I was using neded replacement but to be honest I&#x27;m not sure I am experiencing a difference with the new ones</li>
            <li> The product was easy to install and my husband is very happy we replaced the old head.  The recommendation is to replace annually incase one of you out there has been using yours for greater than one year.  You&#x27;ll really notice the difference!</li>
            <li> The new HQ9 SpeedXL replacement heads improved the speed and closeness of my shave.  It was like a new razor.</li>
            <li> These new heads were just what my razor nedded to bring it back to its original performance. I had forgotten how nice a shave I could get over the year and a half or two that I have the razor. My advice for the future: change blades once a year.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I saw the price of the Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads. Everywhere else I had checked was a lot more. The product I received was excellent. I was very satisfied with the seller. They did an excellent job and I received the item in just a few days. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Been using this style for years, always a great shave!!</li>
            <li> I always forget to get new shaving heads each year, just clean the ones I have and they seem ok.&lt;br /&gt;But every time I get a new set, its like having a new razor. Much cleaner/closer shave.</li>
            <li> Did not fit the razor, so could not use.</li>
            <li> Just as ordered and expected.</li>
            <li> fits like original, o wait it is original so it fts and works like a charm. don&#x27;t know if it is the chaepest bust i needed it so i bought it.</li>
            <li> I have two Norelco shavers. I needed replacements.. A  Good value for product not easily found locally. Nothing else to say except Amen....</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Norelco razors for several years, and this is their best shaving heads yet.  This product provides a fast, smooth shave...I would highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the old heads needed replaced until I installed these.  Sure makes a difference when shaving.</li>
            <li> Needed these badly. Phew!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time &amp; as described.</li>
            <li> Present - well received.</li>
            <li> I always use NORELCO. This was a replacement. This site gave a fair price and sent original heads promptly. I would use this site again in the future.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades are very good. They are sharp and fit my electric razor without any problems. However, I believe they are too expensive as far as I&#x27;m concerned, and should be less expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how long the Norelco shaver lasts, and how well it does.  New blades, same old battery inside, and just the usual excellent shave. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Good price and product.</li>
            <li> Received in great condition and exactly what my husband needed for his razor.</li>
            <li> Blades are not nearly as effective as original.  I bought a less expensive (backup) Norelco razor recently and it is far better.  Virtually no improvement over the blades i replaced.  Almost seems like they sharpened and recycled old blades and did a poor job.  Very strange and not impressed!</li>
            <li> Fit and work as advertised.</li>
            <li> better than buying a new razor</li>
            <li> nice replacement blades</li>
            <li> like a new shaver...significantly lower price than Walmart</li>
            <li> This is the exact replacement for the original equipment that came with the razor.  These have brought new life back to my electric razor.</li>
            <li> Fit my shaver perfectly, exact replacement</li>
            <li> Clean close shave just would like trim part attatchd in stead of changn head. Over all good shaver stays chargd long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased these new Philips Norelco HQ9 Speed XL Replacement Heads for my Norelco Razor that I have been using for about 10 years. These new blades will help me get closer to the perfect shave.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads came on time and the product was exactly what I ordered and needed. They were a lot more expensive at a store where I saw them.</li>
            <li> Fast, very fast service. Shaver always performs up to expectations. Would recommend this product to all who want a good shave and a fast one.</li>
            <li> Used a couple of times and all seems well. more time will tell if they work out as well as the original.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered and delivered when promised. It had good information and pictures of what I wanted</li>
            <li> These arrived in good condition and on time. I put them in immediately and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in the shave. My razor was still good and in the past threw them away and just bought a new razor, but thought I would try the new heads instead and am so satisfied I did. Cost was really high for replacements, but they work great.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day. It made my razor feel like new. Very easy to change. Love my Norelco Razor.</li>
            <li> Razor blades work well for the recipient of this gift, until the razor itself died.  (Not the fault of the blades as he&#x27;s gotten replacements before.)</li>
            <li> Excellent value. Been using these for years</li>
            <li> THE REPLACEMENT HEAD ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER,  AS DESCRIBED. THE PRICE FOR THIS ITEM IS ACTUALLY LESS EXPENSIVE THAN MY LOCAL STORES. VERY EASY TO INSTALL IN LESS THAN A MINUTE.  THANKS</li>
            <li> Makes the razor like new again and are less expensive that purchasing a new razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my shaver for nine years now and it still works like the day it was new.  These replacement heads are the same as the original ones that came with it new.  It&#x27;s amazing that they still make them after all these years and I hope they continue to do so.  I do a lot of online shopping at Amazon and Its always a pleasure when I do.  These people know what to have for most things out there.  I will continue to shop here for most of my needs.  They have everything from A to Z.  Thank you for being there.</li>
            <li> It works, nothing special about them, good replacement blades at a reasonable price and fit my Norelco as promised, easy to install</li>
            <li> Very good quality as expected from past purchases of same item.</li>
            <li> Received items (replacement razor heads) as promised thanks, would gladly do future business!</li>
            <li> Renewed my shaving experience back to close and comfortable.  I hadn&#x27;t noticed that my old heads had dulled after years of use.</li>
            <li> This came in the original, sealed manufacturer&#x27;s packaging and has worked flawlessly. It is also less expensive then buying directly from the maker, even with their coupon.</li>
            <li> Have ordered these for my hubby a couple of times.  He now changes heads on his razor every 6 months or so instead of buying a new razor every 12-18 months!  Seems a bit crazy that the new &#x27;heads&#x27; cost about half as much as a new razor, but these really extend the life of his razor!</li>
            <li> Good way to rejunvenate and old razor. It now works like new.</li>
            <li> Love this razor and the heads hold up well</li>
            <li> These replacement heads look like they will do the job and I am going to replace them in my razor soon.</li>
            <li> Excellent performance as expected from my prior purchase of replacement heads.  Will certainly reorder when needed.  Fine quality, fine price.</li>
            <li> I was way overdue to &amp;#34;tune up&amp;#34; my Norelco Shaver, and immediately noticed a significant difference. My Norelco is now like new, and is giving me a very smooth shave. My fiancÃ© is especially grateful.Hint: Easy installation, but YouTube has a good video.</li>
            <li> A necessary item to have -- what else can be said.  It meets my needs.</li>
            <li> OE product offered at fair price.....below retail store price.</li>
            <li> After replacing heads, I have a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; shaver. I now shave in 1 / 3 the time prior to head replacement.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell that the new blades were any sharper than my old ones!  Does this sound right?  You tell me.</li>
            <li> I received the new shave head and was able to pop it right on and start it up.  Works as good as when I bought the shaver new.  Very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carl</li>
            <li> Excellent,i use  Norelco electric shaver since 2004 and chance the heads each year.&lt;br /&gt;For me,the Norelco products are the better in this line.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize just how badly in need I was for new blades on my electric razor till I bought these Because now when I shave my razor feels like it was new out of the box!! Instead of waiting years to replace them I will be buying these once a year from now on! Highly recommend you do the same you&#x27;ll feel and notice a difference!</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t replaced the heads for several years and they made a big difference to how well the shaver worked. Will make sure I replace them sooner next time!</li>
            <li> I have had the Philips Norelco electric shaver for a few years and the blades were getting a little dull.  The stores around me charged over $35, so I came here and saved myself a few dollars with the exact model required for replacement blades.  Kudos to Amazon.com for saving me money.</li>
            <li> These shaver heads work great, and my ten-year-old Norelco works like new. I had thought of replacing my Norelco at one point, but after reading all the negative reviews about the new Norelco shavers (and their lack of an LED that indicates the current battery charge level), I thought I&#x27;d try another set of replacement heads and keep using my old one. I always seem to forget how much replacement heads improve my shaver, but then I replace the heads only every two or so years, so it&#x27;s easy to not notice how bad my shaver is getting, little by little.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to replace the heads on your electric razor each year.  I tend to go a bit longer, but it is nice to have a fresh set. Simply to install, makes shaving quicker and less irritating.</li>
            <li> These blades arrived very quickly.  I am asking myself why I didn&#x27;t replace my blades sooner.  What a difference they make.  What a time saver.  Though I have a relatively whimpy beard my shave time had been getting extremely long.  I was even considering changing to manual.  After about 10 years on the set that came with the razor I ordered these replacements.  Now I get through the shave in no time - even when I have a few days growth.  The old blades simply pulled my beard and it hurt.  I had to cut the beard back with my moustache trimmer before going in for the close shave.  If your sitting on the fence about getting new blades wait no longer!  You&#x27;ll be glad you did....</li>
            <li> Any time i need to replace razer heads they have been good quality and i have never found a bad set. This is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I like this product for the comfort of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;It is similar to the original but not as smooth as the original.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers since I started shaving some 55years ago.I have tried one  of their newer models and was&lt;br /&gt;Unimpressed the XL model is my fave rot .I changer the blades once a year and the machines keep rolling along</li>
            <li> They fit and work just fine.  My Norelco no longer tugs and pulls, however the cost is about 1/3 of a new razor.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my husband.  He said they are perfect and I saved $$.</li>
            <li> quick delivery and I really needed it guys. used it as soon as it came in (days) and got wind burn where it shaved me close. LOL. Wife likes that no beard burn anymore</li>
            <li> Works as they should.</li>
            <li> Quick service and excellent product...</li>
            <li> How do you rate brand name replacement heads?  Of course, they are good.  They are original brand replacements for the original heads.  Actually this is the second time I have replaced them and I am well satisfied with the product both times.  They were replaced because I wore them out.  It is recommended that they be replaced yearly.  I wait longer than that until I sense degraded operation.  They always last longer than the year!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference when changing out my years old blades.</li>
            <li> I must have been living in the dark ages, I haven&#x27;t replaced my blades in 10 years.  Wow, what a difference, it&#x27;s like a new razor.  Da!</li>
            <li> After using the original Philips blades that came with my shaver for around 6 years. I thought I should replace them.Having done so, the difference is not great. This shows that the quality of these blades must be high.</li>
            <li> These heads were no improvement over the ones I used for years.  The original heads worked much better.  These cut no better than those old dull ones.  My guess is they want me to buy a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this razor ,so I really can&#x27;t say how I liked them. I can say I haven&#x27;t heard my boyfriend complain at all.</li>
            <li> Great price for Norelco replacement heads!</li>
            <li> I like the replacement blades in the head. Extremely simple to replace in the shaver and the quality was good.</li>
            <li> Wanted this item and kept getting a differedt item of two heads</li>
            <li> This was my second order for these replacement heads. Sure beats having to replace the razor. I have a happy husband.</li>
            <li> Having these replacement blades on subscription has been terrific.  I used to use them until I could feel the think beginning to pull the whiskers, but now I never get to that point.  The price is nice and it&#x27;s like having a new razor every several months.</li>
            <li> My shaver was not shaving very good recently.  Although I could not see any problems with the shaving head, I decided to try replacing the head as a last resort prior to buying a new shaver.  To my surprise this worked!  Head was not packaged very well so that when I removed the 3 heads, the blades fell off so I did not know which went with which.  However, mismatching the blades does not seem to affect shaving.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my father.  He has 3 Norelcos and whether they need a new head or not, he wants replacements.  This is the cheapest venue that I have found.</li>
            <li> The heads were easy to replace and the shaver works like it is brand new now.&lt;br /&gt;And, the price was right.</li>
            <li> Dropped right in and worked perfectly, however I was expecting a closer shave...not much difference at all. That is just my expectation (probably should go back to manual shaving if I want a closer shave).</li>
            <li> Definitely brought new life to the old Norelco.  Easy to install and cut very close.  Cheaper than a new razor.</li>
            <li> My husband was going to buy a new razor, but I ordered these heads and they made the old razor like new again.  He said it has been a long time since he had such a good shave.  These are really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased these same replacement heads a year before from a local retail store at a higher price. I suddenly realized that Amazon might have them, and they did. Once received, i realized that this was exactly what i needed and they worked as desired.</li>
            <li> Not impressed - you show a $20.00 price in your ad - than it is over $30.00 when you go to the \\&quot;store\\&quot;.  Not much inclination to buy.</li>
            <li> My Norelco razor was not cutting my whiskers well until I received the replacement heads. What a difference. I will not let my razor heads go that long again without replaceing them.</li>
            <li> I had not replaced the last blades for a few years and was having problems getting a clean shave.  I wish had had purchased earlier as I am now getting a clean shave.  Only the screens and blades show up.  The photo is a little mis-leading as the outside plastic part is not supplied.</li>
            <li> They were easy to install.  My Norelco razor now shaves like it did when it was new. If your heads are more then one year old, this will greatly improve your shave.</li>
            <li> This is the second time we have order these. They have made his razer last alot longer..... Thanks for the great service.</li>
            <li> Clean Shave, easy to replace, smooth finish.  Husband Loves this razor and he uses the replacement heads for about a year before we replace.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades were no better than the worn out ones on my razor. I am using them any way.</li>
            <li> i do not know why i put off replacing my blades for my razor so long LOL ... ... ...</li>
            <li> Glad to have found these replacement blades for such a good price, especially for an expensive razor. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted but at a much better price</li>
            <li> I returned it.  Wrong model</li>
            <li> Shaves very nicely and I am very satisfied.  jpt</li>
            <li> I have used my Norelco razor for 10 years and the only maintenance is to change the heads annually.  Excellent shave</li>
            <li> My shaver works like new. My shaver shaves fast and is quiet. Would recommend to a friend. Will not wait so long to replace blades next time.</li>
            <li> good product-fair price</li>
            <li> Was a perfect fit and works just fine.</li>
            <li> I had my shaver for 5 years and I thought the blades are too dull too shave well.&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered this replacement and it is way way worse than the original 5-year-old blade.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps pulling my hair and my face actually bleeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might as well use the original blades.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly, great shave! I did not realize how worn out the old blades had gotten until I replaced them. Easy, close shave right out of the box. Go for it!!</li>
            <li> It is the easiest electric razor to maintain and produces a smooth shave every time</li>
            <li> After researching, this was the least expensive way to go for these replacement blades. They arrived quickly and work great.</li>
            <li> A must have. The best shaver will eventually need head replacement. Get the real thing, not a knock off.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, received in a very timely fashion.  Made a big difference for a shaver only 13 months in use.</li>
            <li> Been putting off getting replacement heads.  Now my razor is older and replacement heads for it were not available in the regular places (drugstores, Target, Walmart.)  These are exact replacement heads, which installed easily.  Arrived in just a few days.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had to usde them yet. hope tyhe blades in the razor last a long time.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads (for electric razor). Much cheaper than any real store, and cheaper than any other online source.</li>
            <li> A great way to keep your Norelco mowing those whiskers down is replacing the heads and blades.  Great value.</li>
            <li> One of the best shaves from an electric. Also like the fact the blade does&#x27;nt cost as much as the shaver.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of buying a Norelco Arctic Razor since my old speedshaver didn&#x27;t seem to be working as well as it did when it was new, four or five years ago. After reading the reviews on the Arctic Razors and people writing that the speedshaver was as good or better than the new product I decided to get a replacement head for my old speedshaver.  It does seem to be an improvement over the old head, and I saved quite a bit of money in the process. The item was shipped to me in a few days from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Made my old shaver work like new again. A little pricey though.</li>
            <li> Just what we wanted and received very quickly!</li>
            <li> The original lasted for about 2yrs, but once I replaced the heads, it&#x27;s back to being new again! Price on Amazon was way cheaper than any local stores I checked.</li>
            <li> The products were received on time and they are both excellent. The blades and lubricant have indeed enhanced the performance of the shaver !!!</li>
            <li> The heads improved my shaving experience. They are difficult to find retail in our stores.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS GREAT, BUT ONE OF THE OUTER ROUND BLADE COVERS HAD SEVERALSHARP JAGGED PIECES STICKINGOUT THAT SCRAPED MY FACE. I WAS ABLE TO USE ONE OF THE OLD ONES THAT I SAVED, IT GIVES A GREAT SHAVE NOW!  THANK&#x27;S</li>
            <li> Discarding a shaver when the battery is no longer good is a daunting prospect, but I have been using my shaver with a rechargeable battery for probably 10 years now, and it still holds a charge just fine. I am careful to run it down almost all the way before recharging it â something that is easy because the indicator lights inform me of the status of the charge. Every January, I quickly and easily install a replacement set of heads, even though the old ones were still working okay. The new ones always work noticeably better. Shaving is now quick, easy, effective, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Item appears to indicate that 3 complete heads are included in box.&lt;br /&gt;What is in the box is only 3 each individual round heads without the assembly that they sit in.&lt;br /&gt;The picture shows the three heads mounted in the assembly.  This is misleading &amp; incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;The individual heads were new and fit properly (and sharp for a close shave), but I expected the 3 outer&lt;br /&gt;mountings as well, as noted on the box &amp; on the Amazon picture.</li>
            <li> every thing was ok...&amp; i will probaly order again</li>
            <li> page was indicating reordering same blades I had purchased last year, but wrong ones for my razor.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have used the same razor for at least 10 years because of the execellant shaving heads.  Don&#x27;t stop making them!!!!!  Don Fallin</li>
            <li> Items delivered within estimated timescale an as expected.</li>
            <li> I have a Norelco razor that I bought about a year ago and it came with the HQ9 heads. I bought these so I would have a replacement when I needed it. Norelco recommends changing heads once a year but I have gone years and years without changing heads in the past. When I finally do, I realize how much better the shaver works with new heads. I also bought a razor with the HQ8 head and I like it very much but still prefer the one with the HQ9. I have used Norelco razors for about 60 years. I believe the HQ9 gives me the closest and most comfortable shave of all the heads I have used. I also have an old razor with the HQ56 head. I have had it so long that I have replaced the batteries about 4 times and I think the motor brushes are wearing out. It was an excellent razor. I have replaced the heads on it about three times but the current ones are so old that I can&#x27;t fairly compare them to the heads on the two newest razors. I do plan to put a new set of HQ56 heads on it to make a fair comparison.</li>
            <li> Tough beard and these bad boys mows it right down. Best performance from your Norellco shaver requires that these heads are replaced at least 2X/yr. depending on the amount and coarseness of your beard. Ladies, will love them for their legs and other delicate areas instead of razor blades. Much cheaper than continually buying of razor blades once you own a Norellco shaver and no more  knicks or toilet paper &amp;#34;patches&amp;#34; on your face. Make sure your Norellco is a Speed XL.</li>
            <li> At this price I can afford to change the heads yearly. Cheaper than buying blades and a closer more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Will order again. Very happy</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with Norelcos for 40 years.  They are great.  I usually have one for 5-7 years and during that time I replace the battery once and the heads a couple of times.  Very reliable and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> My Norelco is 8 years and I have never changed the blades so I thought maybe I would give it a try. I noticed a slight difference only; but not enough to say wow what a difference. I will most likely will not be buying another set of replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still get 3-4 weeks off from a charge on my Norelco and I think it is a great razor. Hopefully the replacement heads last until my razor dies . . . a few more years.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works perfect. Easy to order. My shaving time is drastically reduced and my shave is a smooth one each time.</li>
            <li> Best shavw I have had recently.</li>
            <li> there work great and cost all $10,00 less than the last set I bought</li>
            <li> I Love these replacement heads as they are good and give a clean shave.I plan on ordering more.As soon as I can.</li>
            <li> Bought these for hubby&#x27;s razor a couple of years ago. They worked well &amp; just replaced them for holiday gift.</li>
            <li> I love a smooth face on my husband! Using these replacement blades ensures and close shave without him making his face raw from having to go over it too many times with the razor.</li>
            <li> After more than 2 Year&#x27;s time shaving (male over 60) with prior set of Made In Holland HQ-9 blades in my old 7110X Norelco, just felt like new HQ-9 blades were in order. Oddly the old blades were still shaving OK, but after more than 2 years of use replacement seemed overdue. Price has increased, but quality worth paying the extra (Made in Holland).    2014:  I have used Norelco rotary shavers for over 30 years. I have used the HQ9 heads for last two years, and they cut very well and have longer life than any previous Norelco heads. I have kept my older model Norelco razor that used HQ8 heads and replaced with these HQ9 heads. Now this is my second HQ9 heads replacement on same razor. Was very happy to see the HQ9 heads I now received were made in Netherlands (Holland). Many of the newer Norelco shavers and likely cutting heads are made in Far East countries like China, etc. Price from Amazon was a major factor in where to purchase these HQ9 heads. Target&#x27;s 0n-line pricing was as good, but Amazon&#x27;s overall prices and service has been very good for me.</li>
            <li> I got three years out of my new Norelco shaver. Then I started to notice it was taking longer to get a smooth shave, and even then it was not as good. It was time for a new shaver. But wait the shaver still works great, it&#x27;s the blades that have become dull. I found these replacements took just a couple of minutes to replace the old blades. And now I am getting great close smooth shaves again. It&#x27;s like I have a brand new shaver for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> The replacement head met what I consider to be acceptable standards. I found no fault with the head, and I am considering another replcement for my other razor.</li>
            <li> had previous model and bought it again. Like the brand, good product. I never used the top of the line models, so can not compare the higher ends, but this is effective for me.</li>
            <li> The price is excellent  and the product is excellent and the service is first rate I don&#x27;t have to go and look for the bladea</li>
            <li> Glad to have been able to get replacement heads, instead of buying yet another electric razor to add to my collection.  No electric razor works that great, you have to go over and over and over the same area with any of them... but am used to and comfy with this one and wanted to keep it.  They are like new again, which for an electric razor, isn&#x27;t saying much.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time. Works and carries good. I would recommend it to every one. Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> So this was a good time to go ahead and replace the heads too.  Exact fit for my  shaver.  Propmt delivery.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> excellent value at this price. I have a more recent model Norelco but its price for new heads is more than twice the price of the new heads for the older razor I still own. So I bought them and am happy with the old razor again.</li>
            <li> They do precisely what they were intended to do.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that I cannot get a close shave. The quality of the product appears to have deteriorated</li>
            <li> May old shaver head was over a year old, and new blades always improve the shave and this set is no different</li>
            <li> If your shaver and battery are still in good condition this kit renews</li>
            <li> Works well.  Should be replaced annually for best use.</li>
            <li> Great service! Now my wife won&#x27;t hear me complain when she asks me to shave!</li>
            <li> Work just as I expected I&#x27;m Norelco razors</li>
            <li> I love my old shaver... but my old ruff face can wear it out. These replacement heads give my shaver a new life... I wish it were so easy to get the same new life out of this old face... but so far technology hasn&#x27;t come up with replacement heads for that yet.</li>
            <li> I replaced the heads on my SpeedXL shaver but the shave wasn&#x27;t noticeably better. My analysis is that Norelco shavers slow down over the years due to battery deterioration, and new heads aren&#x27;t going to make a difference. But if you damage your heads, these are great.</li>
            <li> Shave in half the time after install. Very easy to change out. Should have done it a whole lot sooner.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re new and sharp and drop right in as they should. They were priced well compared to other options out there.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give these heads a 5 because&lt;br /&gt;they do not last very long.  I wish the&lt;br /&gt;manufacturer would at least extend the&lt;br /&gt;life of the product beyond a year.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for the Norelco razor, makes it shave just like new.  easy to replace and allows the razor to continue being the best around.</li>
            <li> please change to 3 month service. the blades work fine . please continue to send me the blade but on a three period</li>
            <li> new blades make all the difference, in any razor. Not much else to add, old blades &#x3D; bad shave experience. New blades &#x3D; great&lt;br /&gt;shave experience. Hard to grasp  concept, I know ,but ya gotta trust somebody!</li>
            <li> change the heads on my razor annually and works extremely well. have been very pleased with these blades for closeness</li>
            <li> I upgraded to an HQ9 shaver a while ago from a lower end HQ8. I was never happy with the shave of the HQ9. It was supposed to be an upgrade over my cheaper HQ8 shaver with the HQ9 having a slightly faster, more powerful motor. The HQ9 heads are supposed to provide a faster shave over the HQ8 because of the larger cutting surface area. I did not find that be the case at all and it was also less comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally discovered that the older, more traditional HQ8 heads actually fit in the HQ9  shaver. Upon making this change, I finally have my upgraded shaver. The combination of the more powerful motor with the traditional type head is the best for my skin. It&#x27;s comfortable and shaves much faster. It&#x27;s faster than my old HQ8 shaver and faster than the HQ9 shaver with the original HQ9 heads. To top it off, the HQ8 heads are cheaper too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see two reasons for my experience. One is pointed out by a fellow reviewer. The use of additional rows reduces the surface area of the outermost row, which is the row that has the highest speed. Therefore, the design of the HQ9 head actually reduces the surface area of the highest speed cutting area. Second, the additional row of blades creates a larger area of drag for the motor. The HQ9 shaver actually has to work harder to turn the HQ9 heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, try the HQ8 heads in your HQ9 razor the next time you need to replace them. I think you&#x27;ll find it becomes a better shaver.</li>
            <li> I used the original heads in my shaver for almost two years and the shave was getting tougher and tougher. I installed these new heads and it works like a new shaver.</li>
            <li> It is great to be able to get replacement parts that equal the original product.  Works just like the original.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the original, quick and easy to replace.  Pops on in a snap, just wish they&#x27;d last a little longer!</li>
            <li> I have purchased many products from Amazon and they have the best prices.  The Norelco heads work great and were delivered in a timely manner.  I highly recommend this company their contributing companies.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. It is easy to install. My worn out 3 year old shaver is now like brand new.</li>
            <li> Not much to say as this is a replacement set, but it was easy to install and the difference with the new blades was noticeable immediately.</li>
            <li> Replaced blade set, plugged it in, and it worked like  new.  No new face, but it was certainly a lot better than before.  Will order again when these &amp;#34;ware out&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have used the replacement head for about a month now and it seems to be very good. I do notice some slight differences from the original heads; they seem loser. The shave is as good as the original, but give me a few months and check back to see if they hold up.</li>
            <li> I procrastinated and did not change cutter heads for 3 years so I experienced a dramatic increase in the ease and closeness of the shave.  Recommend changing heads at least every 2 years.  Also recommend using an alcohol-based pre-shave.  This gives a closer shave and seems to lubricate the blades.  My rechargeable Norelco gives 5 to 6 additional days between charges when I use the pre-shave.</li>
            <li> I needed to return a part I ordered for my Norelco SX Speed shaver and it was handled promptly and with clear instructions.  I recommend this vendor without reservation.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads provide a good recharge for the cutting power of the shaving system.  Old blade cause a lot of pulling of hair, and these replacements take care of that problem.</li>
            <li> Fast, reliable seller, Product is and always has been great. Priced reasonable. Thank you for being a great seller.</li>
            <li> I almost threw our my razor before purchasing new blades. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because now my razor is like brand new.</li>
            <li> The Norelco blades came quickly.  They fit my razor.  Did I get a much better shave.  Not sure as my orginal blades were not complety worn out.  I do not get as close of shave with a razor versu an electric razor, but it is good enough on most days.    But if you like electric shavers, these replacement blades were just as they promised.  And I am now using my eletric shaver almost ever day.  It&#x27;s convenient and fast.  But most men probably already knew this information anyway.</li>
            <li> After research to find proper parts, I ordered these replacement heads for my razor.  They were delivered promptly and fit correctly.  Shave was closer and smoother.</li>
            <li> orgered the blades on mon am,rec.it on sat.very fast shipping,blades work extremely well and easy to install and remove old blades.</li>
            <li> Best Buy for the Price, with this being my 2nd replacement. Attempted to buy at Walmart, but was always out and cost more.</li>
            <li> This is an OEM product that is simple to install. I have a Norelco 1850 shaver. It was a lot cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> According to the information on this site, this was a replacement that would fit in my 8240xl.  Wrong!  They were placed in my razor according to the instructions and when I tried to shave, they made a sound like a coffee grinder.  No thanks to this replacement, my razor was not damaged.  I went to the local store and purchased HQ-8 heads.  When they were used, worked just like the originals.  I would have rated five stars because I have been using the Norelco for many years, but since the site had faulty information, you get 1 star.</li>
            <li> worked like a champ. made my razor like new again good deal would recomend to anyone who wants a new razor</li>
            <li> Store wanted to charge me like $30 for blades. Nonsense.</li>
            <li> Done with electric razors,,,,,they suck!  Just can&#x27;t get a decent shave!  Went back to a Merkur DE razor and Williams mug soap!  I&#x27;d forgotten how nice it is to get a decent shave again!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product and manufacturing company. Used a electric since I was a teen.  For a quick and easy each morning use Norelco.</li>
            <li> Needed them &amp; does fine to shave my beard</li>
            <li> These are the fourth replacement heads that I&#x27;ve purchase for my razor. Saves me the cost of buying a whole new unit and returns the old unit to factory sharpness. Very easy to install.</li>
            <li> works great, very happy with the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> perfect fit my husbands razor</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit my razor perfectly and work very well.  Much prefer replacing the heads than the entire razor.  Very happy with the product.  Manufacturer recommends yearly replacement of the heads.  We will see.  They are identical to the ones that came with my razor.</li>
            <li> Worked just like they are supposed to.  I have a light beard so they last a little longer than is suggested.</li>
            <li> These blades require replacing about every 6 months.  They do prolong the life the Norelco electric razor which I&#x27;ve had more than 5 years now.  Would buy these again from this merchant.</li>
            <li> I took the new heads out of the package, placed them in my Speed XL razor and began shaving. Great product.</li>
            <li> They rescued my shaver - what more can I say?</li>
            <li> installed in seconds and gives  a good shave</li>
            <li> makes the razor work like new</li>
            <li> Blades work great. Received them very quickly</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was just as described! Price was also reasonable.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution to getting your best shave back again. I used another Philips Norelco shaver &amp; realized mine must be dull. Once I installed the new replacement heads it was just like new. Big savings on a new one.</li>
            <li> Too early to make an assessment.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads... makes my Norelco shaver feel like new again..... what more can I say!</li>
            <li> very difficult to put in!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect and much less than expected to have to pay</li>
            <li> It did the trick and it saved me money!</li>
            <li> Web site said it would fit one of the razors, but it fit the other one</li>
            <li> These heads make the shaver work like new. My shaver is 7 years old and with new HQ9 heads works like brand new. I could not be happier!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the Phillips Norelco shaving products, but the heads are often difficult to obtain locally for me our here in De Kalb County. The razors seem to last for a long time, but the heads eventually hneed replacement. These heads made my razor ceel like a new one for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I am appreciative that Amazon has these Phillips Norelco HQ9 replacement heads.  They are such a bother to find anywhere around here in our small area.  Waiting till we go to a larger town is such a nuisance to not even find them for a better price than Amazon. Keep up the good prices Amazon.  The heads work well, easy to install and are name brand too. Finally he gets a close shave again!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to replace.  Works great and now the old razor has new life and meets my performance needs.</li>
            <li> Based on this picture I was expecting no just the blades but the blade holder as you can see, what I got was just the blades, then I had to buy the holder which is $18-25 more</li>
            <li> Works great and fits just like the previous heads</li>
            <li> I may have to use this for a little longer to be sure.  My previous blades were used for about 5 years without changing.  After installing the new ones, I wasn&#x27;t sure I could tell if there was an improvement.  Some manufacturers say there is a break-in period where your face accustoms itself to electric razors--perhaps that applies now with a change.  All in all, I have always liked my Norelco shaver and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this product, be sure to view one of the YouTube videos on how to replace the blades--much, much easier than the written instructions in the package.</li>
            <li> Always use the genuine replacement heads.  I love getting new heads because they cut so close.  I now have a subscription so I&#x27;ll get them at regular intervals.</li>
            <li> The original replacement heads where more efficient. These do not appear to be as sharp.</li>
            <li> Did not fit properly. Actually had metal burrs that were not machined smooth. Useless.</li>
            <li> Instructions say replace every year. I kept originals for over two years and see now that was a mistake. Again enjoying a quick close shave.</li>
            <li> Maybe its the unit itself that needs to be replaced but that smooth shave is not there even with this new replacement head.</li>
            <li> it meets my husband&#x27;s expectations.  He had to change his old blades so no different, didn&#x27;t have at our local store.</li>
            <li> excellent replacement</li>
            <li> Bought these for my dad.  He is very happy with the replacement heads.  Very quick and reliably delivery.  My dad is happy to not be nicking his face with the old shaver heads.</li>
            <li> Should have really ordered these sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Feels like new again and allows for smooth clean cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Allows you to extend the life of your shaver by just replacing the blades.</li>
            <li> These heads are perfect replacements for my electric razor, made it like new. The original blades were two years old.</li>
            <li> Worked great! A little pricey in my opinion. Maybe there is more to manufacturing than I realise. :)&lt;br /&gt;Yes! I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have had my Norelco razor for over 3 years and shaving for the last year was like using a weed eater on my face. These new rotary blades are great. My wife loves my newly smooth face and I no longer have stubble after 6 hours.</li>
            <li> The only place we could find the replacement heads and at a great price.  I hope I can find more when I need them.</li>
            <li> The new cutters were long overdue - they returned the shaver to &#x27;like new&#x27; performance.&lt;br /&gt;However, inside the padded envelope was only the cutters - NO PAPERWORK whatsoever.</li>
            <li> First this is the best blade head in the series because it gives best precision, its almost half the price at which it was available in walmart, thanks amazon.&lt;br /&gt;For all those who are alternate day shavers, just get rid of shaving razors move on to this with philips norelco shaver..very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for Norelco shaver</li>
            <li> Norelco says to replace rotary blades one a year. I replaced mine after three years. It made a difference. It&#x27;s as good as buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are as good as having a whole new shaver but, for a fraction of the cost.  The shave is as close and as comfortable as can be. It&#x27;s much more convenient than using a razor blade and it&#x27;s much cheaper per shave. I have been using Norelco shavers for over 40 years because I think they are a better quality than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok like the previous one from morel co!</li>
            <li> I have used these replacement blades for years and they work well and do the job.  I will continue to use them in the future.</li>
            <li> Works great. It&#x27;s so nice to have a nice comfortable, clean fast shave again without the heads hurting my face. I forgot what a great shave felt like until I finally got new heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the manufactured suggested replacement and get new heads every year. 18 months at the most. I went 2 years and that&#x27;s too long. Way too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get them, your face will thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> My dad uses these and I buy them every year. He loves his electric shaver, just needs the heads replaced occasionally.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads need to be continually lubricated to give a reasonably close shave.  I have to use the aerosol spray almost every day to get one!  Perhaps, it is time to move to a new shaver?</li>
            <li> Good service, easy to install, quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;You can get about 400 shaves out of one head.&lt;br /&gt;Not bad for under $40 in cost.  HCF</li>
            <li> My order arrived and it was the correct product for my husbands shaver. The heads were easy to change in less than 1 minute. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I found that these heads would NOT cut the beard of myseld who is a senior citizen.  I would NOT recommend the purchase of this item!</li>
            <li> Standard Norelco replacement blades, what else is there to say?  They fit just like they are supposed to.  o k</li>
            <li> just heads not the housing unlike the photo  for the item,  very confusing :(</li>
            <li> Made my shaver like new again, but pricey...</li>
            <li> Not as great as the one comes with original product.</li>
            <li> First replacement since I bought the razor. Seems smoother.</li>
            <li> These were perfect replacements for my 9160XL shaver. I tried buying these at Target, and they didn&#x27;t fit! I have a feeling they were mispacked, so I decided to order online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These replacements fit perfectly, and looked just like the ones I had replaced.</li>
            <li> Does what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> My face is as smoth as a babys @$$.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it is advertised to do.  It is easy to install, it brings performance back to high quality; and I realize I should replace my blades on a more regular basis.</li>
            <li> Just what it should have been.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco so long I cannot say enough nice things  I wish these were cheaper but over time pays for itself</li>
            <li> I  have tried replacement for Norelco shavers twice with disastrous results. I have shaky hands, moor vision, and other ols age problems which makes Norelco replacements impossible. Better to save aggravation and just buy new razor. This time a Remington.------------</li>
            <li> The new shaver heads were easy to install and have made my mornings a little less stressful. A clean shave and face with no cuts or pulls. I should replace the heads more often than once every few years.  A little more packaging than necessary, but no worse than other products.</li>
            <li> these worked very well</li>
            <li> First blade repurchase - no issues  Shipped undamaged.  Best price combined with item to make free shipping</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and works well. Thank you PN</li>
            <li> I should have change the shaver head a lot sooner, it made the world of a difference, in the time and quality of the shave. So I guess I can say that sometimes being frugal can come back to bite you, and this was one of those times. Let me explain, I wanted to be sure that I was not wasting money replacing the head of my shaver to soon. The only problem with this is that as the shaver head gradually wears down, it is hard to notice that it is taking longer and more passes to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt; I would give this shaver head a 5 star rating in quality, and I would definitely buy it again. I know that the cost of the head leaves one wondering if they should just bite the bullet and buy a new one for a little more than twice the cost, but I am glad that I only purchased the head. I have had this brand of shaver before and got many of years use from it, so I am happy that I made the correct choice and only purchased the head :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I hope this review has been of a help to you.  :)</li>
            <li> After more time than we would like to admit, we finally replaced the heads on our Norelco Razor. Even though we were way past due in doing this we had received excellent longevity from our original heads. The replacement was simple. About like disassembly for cleaning. Giving a lot better shaves and less burn. I use Nivea lotion with my Norelco and have no razor bumps or shaving rash/burn. On days that I choose to wet shave, I use Poraso pre-post shave with menthol. Both methods of shaving are giving excellent shaves and rely on my Norelco as we have done for many years. Just be sure to determine which replacement heads fit your razor model. Good service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Easily installed the heads and the shaver works like new.</li>
            <li> good product and good price</li>
            <li> I needed ne heads for my razor and these are as good as shown in ad and work perfectly in razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this model shaver in July 2009. Although I have a heavy beard, I shave every two days since I am retired and no longer go to business. I replaced the heads after two years of usage, but I was disappointed with the new blades as they didn&#x27;t come close to the clean shave I experienced when the shaver was new..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned the blades every one or two months during the first two years,but failed to clean them this past year, somehow forgetting the importance of doing so. Reading these reviews as I contemplated purchasing the replacement heads, I was reminded of the the need to clean  and oil the blades regularly, and as I did so, I found the heads impacted with stubble to such a degree that if is a wonder the blades were able to revolve at all. After the cleaning with the aid of a toothpick, brush and alcohol, I found I was able to shave with greater ease and satisfactory closeness. Not as good as new, but close enough to get another year&#x27;s use of the present blades..</li>
            <li> Easy to replace. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> OEM product shipped quickly at a good price</li>
            <li> Difficult to install new heads. Finally got it and the razor is like new.</li>
            <li> exact fix no problems cuts like brand new</li>
            <li> Why do replacement heads cost so much money, it&#x27;s probably 1/3 the price I paid for my shaver. I&#x27;d probably just get another shaver next time.</li>
            <li> so far so good. time will tell.</li>
            <li> the price was on point, thank you!!! will reorder when that time comes around again,especially with a coupon great offer!</li>
            <li> They work like the originals.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered these same replacement heads and they continue to work wonderfully.  My husband loves them and says no other brand shaves his head as smooth as these.  I&#x27;m sure we will be buying Norelco for years to come.</li>
            <li> I am very Happy with this Replacement Norelco Head Shaver.Very Easy to Change.Avery good Product I recommend it is very good</li>
            <li> Definitely a worthwhile purchase. My son&#x27;s and my Noreleco shavers work like they did when new. They are again providing nice close clean looking shaves.</li>
            <li> My husband had a razor that was exceptionally old. I started looking for a new one for him, since I figured that there was no way that they still made the razor blades for that old of a razor. However, I found these and they work perfectly. They allow him to shave much more quickly and they give him a really close shave. He did not have any breakouts after switching the blades either. I feel that it gives him a closer shave then an actual razor. I love his nicely shaven face!</li>
            <li> Irate husband needs new razor. Wife checks on Amazon discovering available replacement heads which arrive in 2 days.  Husband happy but quickly again irate because heads fall out each time he uses razor.  Wife remembers pictures of how to replace the replacements on the Amazon website, (a clue that the fix might be more than simple)  but husband will not use a computer complaining that the replacements are faulty and the paperwork from manufacturer makes no sense.  Comparing pictures on website with paperwork, wife tries repair of razor.  Result: happy husband with wife once again an Amazon fan.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given the product five stars if the manufacturer had included the large easy to see replacement directions from the Amazon web site in the package.  In this case five Stars to Amazon and 4 to Norelco.</li>
            <li> I had the shaving machine for 2-3 years, got itchy and it is smother, justified the replacement. very easy to install.</li>
            <li> These allowed my razor to work like new again, but I think they are on the expensive side. About 50% more than what I paid for replacement blades for other Norelco razors. They take 5-10 shaves to seat well, until then they are a little rough. After that they are great.</li>
            <li> The heads are as advertised and do the job.  The only trouble I had was figuring how to install them.  The pictoral instructions were not as clear as I thought they should be, so I had to take some time to figure it out.</li>
            <li> I attempted to order the first one through &amp;#34;One touch ordering&amp;#34;.  When that didn&#x27;t work, I ordered one through regular cart order.  I received (and paid for) two items and they came in the same box!  The product is good and I now have one for future use but I didn&#x27;t like the way this transaction went.</li>
            <li> Unless you own some top of the line foil razor that costs several hundred dollars and is made in Germany, these will have to do.  These heads are compatible with several different Norelco models.  These fit perfectly in my razor.  I have been using the original head/blades since I bought the razor over 3 years ago.  I have never been able to have ANY electric razor give me an extremely close/clean shave.  I use the electric razor to get the primary hair down to a light stubble and then I use a conventional razor to finish up and leave the face ultra smooth.  I don&#x27;t think any Norelco razor will give you a barber shop type shave.  I always make sure I maintain the head/blade assembly.  I clean them regularly with alcohol and add a drop of razor oil to each blade assembly.  I have never really understood the Norelco&#x27;s floating head assembly.  Why is the floating head concept supposed to be so great?  I find that a static or non-moving head does a much better job at shaving.  I&#x27;m sure that this head/blade assembly will last me until the razor batteries die.  They can be replaced but by then I will probably just buy a new razor.  Foil razors are the best, but they are expensive for the good ones and the replacement parts are expensive.  Most electric razors from any brand are made in Asia today.  If you really look hard, you can find ones made in Germany or Switzerland.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads to the job. They are easy to install and have new razor blades in seconds. They can be purchased at a reasonable price and have delivered every few months.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco razors for 40+ years, and the secret to satisfaction is to replace the blades like they tell you to, at least once a year.</li>
            <li> Improved shaving, worth changing heads.  Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> These are not like the original heads and blades.  Very noisy and vibrates shaver.  Does not cut as well.</li>
            <li> Works great, quick ship!</li>
            <li> After a year, you can tell you should get replacement heads.  Shaves like new again.</li>
            <li> Am a long-term user of product--and well satilfied.</li>
            <li> These blades are a bit expensive but they work great and last almost six months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that after a year or so, the blades on my electric razors need replacing. While they still might work, they are not as smooth and it takes longer to get a decent shave. I just replaced the blades on my current razor with these and it is like I have a new one! Rather than having to go over the same area time and time again to get all of the hairs, the new blades smoothly shear my whiskers in half the time and with even less effort. All the while not pulling or causing razor burn. Definitely get these over purchasing a new razor if the base unit is still operating well. You&#x27;ll be happy with the money saved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
            <li> Saved a good amount of money buying these via Amazon; a much better price than even Wal Mart. Wal Mart did not have stock on the correct replacement heads and had no idea when they might be restocked.</li>
            <li> While I find these very expensive, they made an incredible difference in the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Will replace them in 1 year.</li>
            <li> They work , very happy</li>
            <li> Direct replacemnt heads. Easy to just drop right in. Big difference in the quality of my shave.</li>
            <li> bought open box it was sealed properly but upon after instalation two of the three heads failed.</li>
            <li> These worked as well as the original blades. Norelco razors give a shave without pulls or pinches. I prefer dry shaves.</li>
            <li> My husbands Norelco had not been &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34; since he got it 9yrs ago. It was time. Checked prices (since its all the same product) and found the best deal on Amazon (prime). Delivery on time as usual (I love that they text me when it&#x27;s been delivered).</li>
            <li> The product worked fine. I only needed the razor blades not the whole head but no one offered them so I ended up with more then I felt like I needed.</li>
            <li> Rejuvenated my Dad&#x27;s razor with these replacement heads.  He says it works great.  No data on how long they will last.</li>
            <li> I replaced these heads after about three years of the old ones. I have soft beard so I don&#x27;t need to replace them every year but the old ones were getting dull. The new set are OK, they are not as sharp as I expected. When I bought my SpeedXL the brand new blades were so sharp that one pass would do the trick. With these replacement heads I still have to go over the same area couple of times. Not sure why a new machine would have better blades then replacement blades.</li>
            <li> replacement heads are always expensive but paying over a hundred for newer tech or that much in disposables a year seems not wise. non the less they cut my face pretty close but not that close but it get&#x27;s the job done and the women love it.</li>
            <li> The new head came quickly and made my old razor work like new. My face now passes the kissing test.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too expensive for what it is. What can I say? I needed to replace the heads as soon as possible, and Amazon had the cheapest prices, but I found the prices to be still too much.</li>
            <li> these work great they work the best thanks</li>
            <li> Not very sharp pulls too much</li>
            <li> Product received on time and as described.</li>
            <li> These are one of those things that you don&#x27;t replace until well after when you should. And then you do, and you can&#x27;t believe you waited so long. Just do it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Helps to switch blades regularly.</li>
            <li> Works well as replacement heads for your electric shaver.  They seem to be equivalent to a new razor but of course it&#x27;s much cheaper than buying an new razor when yours is functional.  I don&#x27;t use an electric often, but this made my old shaver much more usable.  Worth a try before buying a new one that probably won&#x27;t work any better than your old one which has been my experience.  Update your electric razor.</li>
            <li> Can not get over how different my razor sounds and feels.  Almost like new.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> REPLACEMENT HEADS DULLER THAN THE HEADS THAT CAME WITH ORIGINAL  RAZOR! I AM VERY UPSET I THREW AWAY OLD HEADS. THEY WERE BETTER THAN NEW ONES.</li>
            <li> Great blades at a pretty good price.</li>
            <li> Fit well, shaves well, priced well.</li>
            <li> Worked out like it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as advertised.  Shipped quickly and a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> This has been a great product.  The company suggests changing this item each year but I find they work very well for about a year and a half.  If they are kept clean they can be stretched to almost two years.  I like this product and have been using these razors for over 50 years.  Just one problem with this product, the packaging was correct but the product in the package was the wrong one for my razor.  I double checked the owners manual and this is the one it calls for but the product is the wrong product.  It won&#x27;t work in my razor.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my shaver, I was sent individual shaver replacements. Had to send back with full reimbursement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that i bought new heads for my razor instead of buying a new one. Easy to install and does the job.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I have found a replacement heads that actually work on my razor.&lt;br /&gt;I love this razor and did not want to purchase a new one. They fit exactly right.</li>
            <li> Used these replacement heads a couple of times, perfect replacement for the originals and makes a huge difference,</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery a plus.  Unfortunately the blades are no where near as sharp as the originals so I am a little disapointed.</li>
            <li> It was great to find replacement heads for something we thought was obsolete but still works fine and shoUld not be in a landfill. Came on time.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement heads for my razor.  They fit well, are easy to install and greatly improved the quality of the shave.  I probably should have remembered to replace them yearly as suggested; I waited almost 2 years and the shave was getting pretty bad.</li>
            <li> outstanding! these new heads work great and easy to replace! I guess they are good for a year before replacing again..</li>
            <li> So far,- - so good!  only replaced for about 2 weeks.  Shave seems much closer and in slightly less time.&lt;br /&gt;Unknown how longevity will be? Original  heads were about 26 months old. Used about 99 percent of the time .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacemewnts look identical to original and appear to be original mfg. parts.</li>
            <li> Replacement of old heads and they do the job as expected. Clean shave and I expect at least a two year life. I would have hoped for a cheaper price, but I guess that profit on replacements is part of the manufacturer&#x27;s plan.</li>
            <li> Easy replacement item, works as promised. Well worth the expense. Highly recommend the item.  Proceed with confidence a lot of confidence.</li>
            <li> Trivial to substitute. It&#x27;s an improvement over the original blades (who were 4 years old). A good purchase, I am glad</li>
            <li> I replaced the heads after a couple years and the little circle thing fell out of a couple of the heads. It still worked fine, but then I lost one of the heads - still can&#x27;t find it. The replacements are still working fine after a couple months.  Hopefully will last at least a year.</li>
            <li> MY PREVIOUS NORELCO LASTED FOR 5 YEARS. I REALLY SHOULD HAVE CHANGED THE BLADES EVERY 2 YEARS AT LEAST. WATCH THE PRICE ON THIS AND YOU CAN PICK ONE UP FOR $59.95.</li>
            <li> This is the exact replacement part for my shaver that needed this long ago.  Price was better than K-Mart, and it shipped quick.</li>
            <li> great value 1/2 the price of local dealer. Easy installation and instant gratification. Face is smooth as silk . Why did I wait 5 yrs? Cost, not any longer with amazon. Great pricing smooth shipping. Cant beat it.</li>
            <li> I replaced the three razor heads and the holder they sit in and my old razor became my new razor.  It works like new.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed, fit&#x27;s Philips shaver, easy to change heads.  Made the old shaver work like new.</li>
            <li> The blades arrived early with no problem.  The were new and what can you say but they worked great.  The best part is I saved money.  Next time I need replacement, I will be ordering again from this supplier.</li>
            <li> Prompt Delivery and product as promised.  Very satisfactory performance and easy installation made this a good  buy and an excellent value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco triple headers since 1969.  Since most new Norelco&#x27;s suck, you&#x27;re better off buying new heads once a year until somebody comes up with a better razor at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> finally a good shave after trying to shave with dull blades.... just ask my wife, now i am silky smooth...</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were a perfect fit for my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It brought back the close shave, I had with the original set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box of the heads is an easy open no fuss type.&lt;br /&gt;Just like a box of nasal decongestant tablets, with tape&lt;br /&gt;over the flap.&lt;br /&gt;Not the hard plastic / blister type package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received the shipment on time.</li>
            <li> I buy the relatively expensive replacement heads about every 18-24 months and can&#x27;t honestly tell whether they improve the shaving.  At least I don&#x27;t find a major difference.</li>
            <li> Good service and much needed product, thanks</li>
            <li> This is now my third set over the years.  Guess my shaver battery will give out first, but thus far these do give a good shave.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and cheaper than the store.</li>
            <li> Great improvment over heads replaced</li>
            <li> I was happy that they arrived in the mail so quickly--great service. The blades are as advertised, and they came with easy visual instructions on how to change them. I like my old Norelco shaver and didn&#x27;t want to fork over the money for a new one, so it was a nice surprise to find that this seller offered replacement heads at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard so I don&#x27;t change the heads every year. I can tell when they are getting close to needing replacement. I have replaced the heads several times and it is just like buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> They worked great. I think the new heads worked better than the original heads.  The old heads were so worn out that they started biting my facial skin.  It was time to replace the heads.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly, easy to install, makes my husband&#x27;s razor just like new!</li>
            <li> What a difference these replacement heads made. Based on what other reviewers said, I also got the replacement retainer plate. The resulting shave is the best I&#x27;ve had out of any electric razor.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for a while</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product don&#x27;t have any problem to recommend to anyone.  Thank you very much.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The shaving heads work fine and were badly needed because the ones on the razor were not cutting close.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly and was as described or better.</li>
            <li> Best price that I found for this item. Fast shipping/handling too.</li>
            <li> Still do not cut very well.???</li>
            <li> Just as good as new now as always with these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> expensive. but works great.</li>
            <li> these particular heads cut best of all they have three sets of cutting blades</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  Pleasure to have sharp blades.</li>
            <li> OEM and best price I could find.</li>
            <li> Renews your razor, and easy to change.</li>
            <li> They are as advertised.</li>
            <li> Very quick and easy to install at the correct price</li>
            <li> Best price I could find anywhere.  I think they are still too expensive but if you want your Norelco to shave closely, you need to replace the heads more frequently than you would like.</li>
            <li> Well-crafted replacements for cutting heads on some electric shavers.  (Check the listings to make sure you have the right one!)  Anyway, this is the type of product that you don&#x27;t realize you need until you buy it.  A shaver&#x27;s performance decreases so gradually that you won&#x27;t notice that your beard is &amp;#34;getting tougher&amp;#34; until the heads really need replacing.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need to buy these heads frequently enough to strike a balance between beauty and budget.  You&#x27;ll have to determine the interval for your needs but you can save some money using the subscription service offered here.&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck!</li>
            <li> It is a 5, worked great.&amp; yes you seem to be the only one i could fine for me to purchase from.So thanks again.</li>
            <li> Finally got around to replacing the heads after over 2 years. Was thinking that I needed to change the Norelco but thankfully decided to just change the head. The Norelco motor and battery have held up very well and the new replacement head makes it work like new. I hope I remember to replace it after about a year as opposed to 2 or maybe 2 is not so bad giving a bigger return on investment.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as well as it used to, even with fresh blades.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  If you haven&#x27;t replaced your heads in a year or so, worth getting.</li>
            <li> Good price, easy install.</li>
            <li> very fast and correct</li>
            <li> Razor working like a new one.</li>
            <li> item was as described and shipped quickly .</li>
            <li> worked very well, easy to install.</li>
            <li> New blades always make for a clean shave. Do this twice a year and your shaves will be close. Great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  VL</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product as described.</li>
            <li> Every time I get replacement heads for my husband he says &amp;#34;I wish I would have put these on sooner!&amp;#34; They are easy to replace and extends the life of your razor. The razor is almost 7 years old now, but with the new blades, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s brand new again!</li>
            <li> Norelco products are always first rate!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the original blades in the shaver since I bought it about 7 years ago.  Decided to try new blades and they make a difference.  Once every 7 years I can afford it.</li>
            <li> nothing could be better than original blades so don&#x60;t bother buying any cheap knock offs.noreleco has always stuck to a high standard</li>
            <li> These work great to revive my dependable Norelco razor. Makes me wonder why I waited so long to buy the replacement heads. With these replacement heads, the razor works like new. The motor still charges well and runs as strong as ever.</li>
            <li> bought these to replace my old heads. price was good and these are norelco factory brand</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work very well.  This option of replacement heads is much less expensive than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered the replacement instead of buying a new shaver.  It worked beautifully, his shaver is sharper.  It was easy to install.  Yes, this is a good idea.</li>
            <li> My old heads were getting to the point they weren&#x27;t effective, with new heads it takes half the time to shave. Did not realize they were supposed to be replaced every year!</li>
            <li> great product at great price.</li>
            <li> Return customer. Good as usual!</li>
            <li> The right replacement........happy.</li>
            <li> fit great, installed easily, weren&#x27;t as sharp as hoped for.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and they work like the originals.</li>
            <li> works great, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Nice sharp blades, what else can you say.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do much about these average replacement shaving heads.  Have to purchase the shaving heads which work with my electric shaver.  Original shaving heads seemed sharper.</li>
            <li> These heads worked wonderfully. It was just like getting a brand new razor. Will  now be definitely changing them regularly.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads were just what I needed to fix my razor and I could not beat this price anywhere and am glad I checked Amazon before I purchase any.thing</li>
            <li> Good replacement heads, fits ok.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  Arrived on time.  Good price.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what we wanted.  And delivered  on date promised..will order again when required...thank you amazon.I now don&#x27;t have to listen to my husband complaining about his blunt shaver..peace at last. He has had this shaver for years and won&#x27;t consider anything else..</li>
            <li> The old ones needed replacing a lot sooner than orher Phillips shavers I have used. Suspect newer technology is not a substantial as the older ones. This model gives a giid shave.</li>
            <li> I had an old Norelco triple head razor that lasted ten years and never required cutter/screen replacement - cannot get six months out of these without cutter wearing thru screens and locking up razor - unfortunately I&#x27;m hooked on great shave - just expensive to keep buying so often - don&#x27;t know what materials they used earlier but wish they would go back to them - but hey they make a lot more money with these sub par materials</li>
            <li> My husband loved the new razor head, he said it was just like having a new razor.  I bought the two pack because my son also uses the HQ9 and even though his beard isn&#x27;t as tuff as my husbands, he will need it at some point and it is a lot less expensive than buying a new razor (that is if the razor itself is still in good working order.</li>
            <li> And the price was $5 less than  Walmart. I will buy again when the time comes. A few years ago this model was quite expensive ($200 purchased at Macy&#x27;s) so I hope Philips keeps making those heads.</li>
            <li> Good buy and good price.  Nice and sharp :o)</li>
            <li> I have used these before and they are good orignal heads.  They are getting hard to find in stores lately, I guess not enough sales to warrant the space on shelves.</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This will provide a slightly better shave, at least in my case it did. What will also give you a better shave is pouring hot water on the shave heads right after use, and cleaning each shave head with hot water and alcohol every month. Also, put a drop of mineral oil on each head every month. These instructions are found in your shaver manual.&lt;br /&gt;2) I have noticed that these shaver heads hold up better to hair. My previous shaver heads had lots of tiny hairs on it, even though I always cleaned the heads as directed on my shaver manual (see #1 above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) If you regularly clean your shaver heads as directed on your shaver manual, do not expect a huge improvement in shaving. I only noticed a little difference.</li>
            <li> I prefere Norelco electric razors; replacement heads (cutters) are expensive.  So here we have a fair price and good service, adds up to a winner!</li>
            <li> quality Norelco product</li>
            <li> Heads were as advertised, new in package and fir razor perfectly. Delivered quickly through prime.</li>
            <li> Just as described, just service.</li>
            <li> These replacements for my Norelco shaver work fine.</li>
            <li> Ran across these and realized my blades were probably 2 years old. Glad I got them!</li>
            <li> Worked well, replaced my old blades</li>
            <li> The product came quickly, worked as it was meant to.  Everything about the purchase went well.  I would purchase here again.</li>
            <li> good deal and easy to replace if you watch youtube &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; videos</li>
            <li> The product is just like the original and the pricing is the lowest I could find.</li>
            <li> does as good as a electric razor can do and is faster than blade and shave cream</li>
            <li> Well what can I say.....they cut just fine.</li>
            <li> As always the best shaver heads in the busness.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected-came on time - easy to use timed delivery.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was going to receive the complete head not just the blades. Product picture is misleading. How can I obtain the complete head?</li>
            <li> Great price for these and ease in purchasing.  Hard to find and much more expensive to find locally!</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; accurate, very pleased, will reorder for my spair shaver soon. Bill D.</li>
            <li> Good product at a great price</li>
            <li> They are quick and easy to install and work great.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfies customer here.</li>
            <li> Makes the shaver perform like new instantly. Easy to install but don&#x27;t do it over a sink. Small parts can go down the drain.</li>
            <li> Renewed my razor now it works better than a new one I purchased to replace it with.</li>
            <li> The picture includes the housing, The only reason I purchased it was because a plastic part in my shaving machine&#x27;s housing broke.&lt;br /&gt;So I ended up having another set of blades and no place to put them into because the housing is still broken...</li>
            <li> Should have changed earlier, great</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy with the Replacement Heads and they were very easy to change.  They were delivered in record time.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit replacement for what I needed.</li>
            <li> Nice to be able to keep your razor in condition with out having to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> received as promised in promised condition</li>
            <li> Too expensive. You can replace the head and blades for about the same price as a new shaver. I&#x27;m now buying new shavers instead of new blades. What has this world come to!?</li>
            <li> I prefer the non-HQ heads from Norelco but the model I use calls for these.  Norelco is a wonder when it comes to longevity, they just run and run and run.  My other shaver has been going for 12+ years with regular battery changes.  Got a Remington shaver one Christmas and it was broken the first time I dropped it.  Norelco shavers have some really durable design.</li>
            <li> Great product as advertised.  Obviously a little pricey, but then all razor blade products worth their salt are.  Would definitely buy again, and wish I had purchased several refills instead of just one.</li>
            <li> Popped right in and got them quick. will order again.</li>
            <li> I had been using the electric shaver with the original heads for so long that it no longer gave me a good shave and I started using the old razor most of the time.  I even wondered why I liked the electric shaver in the first place. Then, presto-changeo, I got the new heads and I was in love again.  Now, I know why I liked that shaver.  If you are unhappy with your electric shaver maybe it&#x27;s time to replace the heads.  Lot cheaper than buying a new shaver and much convenient than the old razor. No problem to replace the heads either.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the shaver heads. I hope they last as long as the originals did. I will definitely recommend them to friends.</li>
            <li> These are the best shaver heads I&#x27;ve ever used. Notice how they have 3 concentric rings, giving you much more shaving area. Fastest and smoothest shave possible. They are more pricey and you hafta have a pricier shaver that uses them, but so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been using these for a while and then make the mistake of buying a cheaper electric shaver with single-ring heads (which I did), you will be gravely disappointed. Once you get used to them, nothing else comes close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by those other Norelco&#x27;s with the pivoting thin joint (flimsy). If you don&#x27;t have the pivoting joint, you just move your hand around to match the angle you want. Simple as that. Trust someone who tried this and other options: these big heads give you the fastest smooth shave, bar none.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads do not seem to be very sharp, even compared to the old ones that i am replacing</li>
            <li> Used the new heads right away. They work just as expected.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great price, easy to replace and a perfect fit.  All this and the wife gets to touch a smooth face.  Win Win.</li>
            <li> I bought my Norelco three years ago and it has not been giving a good shave lately.  I bought these replacement heads, and WOW the razor is sharp now.  I have to be careful and get used to it.  The old ones were so dull that I would really press deep into my skin to get them to shave.  Now I just barely glide the razor across my face with the new and sharp blades.  I haven&#x27;t had a shave this good and close in years.  I think I am going to start changing the blades once a year now, because you really don&#x27;t know how bad and dull your old blades are until you replace them with new blades.  These replacement blades make you feel like you have a new razor again, at a fraction of the cost of actually buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> They should make them to be resharpened like they were when they were first introducted.  Norelco just wants you to buy them each and every year.  How about making a resharping device.  You can find one on the following website and you can resharping yours for 20 or more times.  site is [...]</li>
            <li> This blade replacement doesn&#x27;t seem as sharp as the original.  It might just be my imagination but it seems to leave more hair when shaving.  I have to go over and over the same spot.  Not too happy with this one.</li>
            <li> What can be said? These are replacement heads.  They arrived in time specified and are as advertized.  They work well.</li>
            <li> Good price, Good service. In fact a better price than at Wal Mart..($33.00)As said previously I was very pleased with all thing concerning this product....</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought these Norelco heads before and they&#x27;re great.  Makes the shaver seem like new again.  The price on them has actually gone down.  I would highly recommend replacing the heads on your shaver at least once a year.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have been unable to use the heads since they turned out not be the correct model for my shaver.  I thought I was careful in my selection, but found out I was wrong.  Because I have opened the package I did not feel it was appropriate to return or exchange them.</li>
            <li> I had not replaced the heads in my razor for several years.  I now have a \\&quot;new\\&quot; razor!  Rather than buying an expensive new razor, these heads were very reasonable, easy to install and saved me from discarding a perfectly good razor just because the heads were dull!  This was a great buy!  Buying thru Amazon is the way to go!</li>
            <li> The product came as advertised. I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old blades were until I replaced the heads. Now it works like a new electric razor. It was very easy to replace the heads.</li>
            <li> This product was a perfect fit. It arrived on time as forecast. It works like new. I have had this razor over 10 years now and it is still going like new thanks to replacement blades once a year.</li>
            <li> Great quality; would order agn</li>
            <li> We were pleased to find the replacement heads that were not available to us locally.  They certainly have made shaving more comfortable than with the heads that were wearing through.</li>
            <li> Brand name replacement. Works. Just watch how you remove the old ones to replace the new ones there are no instructions</li>
            <li> Good price and cut as good or better then originals. These blades really exceeded my expectations. I will purchase again when I am in need.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t know how dull your blades are until you put a set of new ones in the razor. Changing these are a major pain (compared with older Norelco models I&#x27;ve owned), but that&#x27;s not a reflection on these replacement blades.</li>
            <li> This just contains the 3 small blades and does not include the blade holder as pictured.</li>
            <li> The product photo needs to be updated. Please note that you are not getting a new head holder, only the 3 heads (rotary blades).&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the new blades work just fine.</li>
            <li> If your razor is old, this is a Good way to get faster and better cuts without getting a new razor</li>
            <li> They are a exact replacement and was able to get them at a good price</li>
            <li> Awesome restoration of performance- As goes the average busy person- I rarely track the &amp;#34;in service&amp;#34; of something simple like a razor head.  After several cleanings and diminished performance I realized the heads I was using were pushing 3 years.  Thanks Amazon for quickly sending a new set that immediately improved my morning shave!</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement. Have been using this Norelco  electric razor for 10+ years</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Quality product.  Highly recommend. A+++++</li>
            <li> Over due for replacement so got on Amazon for fast service.  Great shaves again ;-).</li>
            <li> My husband needed replacement heads for his Phillips Norelco HQ9 Speed XL.  The Internet is just about the only place we can order the replacements at a decent price.  We&#x27;ve always been very satisfied with the pricing, shipping.</li>
            <li> The product works perfectly and was delivered in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why these heads should only last a few months.  The metallurgy must be inferior.  Maybe the manufacturer is copying Gillette and their disposable razor blades.</li>
            <li> I was able to pick out the correct blades for my razor model by the description in the add. They were packaged well and delivered in an acceptable time frame.</li>
            <li> The improvement in my razor with the new heads was significant and I will never again use old heads for an extended period.  I&#x27;m happy with what I received, and the price was OK - I could buy them at Wal-Mart for close to the same price, and would not have to pay for shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> I found what I was looking for at very good prices. (new digital camera battery &amp; charger &amp; 2 tripods.  I have shopped around on other sites but the prices could not be beat.</li>
            <li> Where do they get a 5 minute shave or even a 3 minute shave. This is a good product but every man knows there is no such thing. This should be false advertising.</li>
            <li> My Dad is eldery and unable to shave himself with a regular razor. I bought him an electric razor so he would still have some independence as well as get a good shave. After a while the blades wore out and wasn&#x27;t shaving him real well. I ordered the replacement blades and the razor was like new again. They were soooo easy to replace I went back and ordered a few more to have on hand when we need them again. Would certainly recommend the razor and OF COURSE THE BLADES!!!!! They are awesome</li>
            <li> Norelco is a good product, and replacing heads after about two years of usage certainly improved performance.</li>
            <li> Works like I bought a a new razor! As long as your razor body is good best way to go. Save $.</li>
            <li> Its a good idea to replace your blades once a year, and this is the best place to get them.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0009MFUPO Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads]]  I&#x27;ve been looking locally for this product for over a year and finally decided to get it online; the day after I ordered from Amazon, the product showed up in Wal-Mart.  But besides this, I like the product because my shaver works like brand new again!</li>
            <li> Excellent price and very fast service.</li>
            <li> My husband received his Norelco HQ9 a year ago at Christmas.  He takes the very best care of his razor but felt it was not shaving as close as he likes and wanted a new head.  We went to several places looking for one in  our home city but had no luck.  Someone suggested Amazon and we found it and bought it.  The service was excellent, easy to do, and it was delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> These shaving heads were reasonably priced and are very effective.  I did not realize how dull my old heads were until replacing them.</li>
            <li> this time everything went well after I ordered a less expensive one and was told at the end of the order that this supplier was no longer offering the product.</li>
            <li> Only last about a year.  However it works great when new.</li>
            <li> I shopped around online for the lowest priced replacements I could find and Amazon was the cheapest.  Replacement is incredibly easy and its just amazing and what a difference it makes. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I buy this product from Amazon in about three years and I am as pleased with it the second time as I was the first.</li>
            <li> I finally replaced these heads on my razor and it now works like it did when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> When I added these to my razor, I was amazed to get the close shave I once experienced when my razor was new. I will definitely buy new blades more often.</li>
            <li> Great replacement blades at a right price</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver and really loves the feature that allows you to run it under the shower to clean it!!</li>
            <li> Seems to working fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could recommend this as being OKAY for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not have any complaints at this time.</li>
            <li> I have always used this blade for the past 3 years daily. They seem to last an year for me and gives me a close shave till the end. Its not the same as using a razor though.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are spendy. The Amazon price is more reasonable. The product is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do: shave my beard. So I&#x27;m satisfied with the product itself.</li>
            <li> Good quality and back to getting a clean shave with new blades. Should have replaced sooner. Ones I had were over two years old.</li>
            <li> My husband, who never wanted an electric razor, wouldn&#x27;t trade for a non-electric again!!!  Appreciate the ability to have replacement heads available to keep him happy with smooth skin!</li>
            <li> Replacements heads were drop in replacements for worn heads.  Good value and deliver was quick.  Now my shaver cuts like new.</li>
            <li> Perfectly fits my PT920, feels like having a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I can go out in public again. :)</li>
            <li> Could not find these local. Just likes always  Amazon has want we need. Good price.</li>
            <li> What a difference a new set of heads makes. My old razor works like a new one!</li>
            <li> My husband says the new replacement heads are working just fine.</li>
            <li> One third the price of local retail. Awesome!</li>
            <li> Installs easily and is a good quality blade. Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original part, But works OK for the price.</li>
            <li> It works precisely as advertised.</li>
            <li> They worked just fine.  Make sure the heads match the model of your razor.</li>
            <li> I misplaced my other Ped egg so had to order another.  It&#x27;s smaller but every bit as good.</li>
            <li> Like having a new razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Shipping perfect!!</li>
            <li> Bought these. Even with shipping was the cheapest around. Work great for my razor. I will never buy anything but Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> The product(new Head for razor Philips Norelco)  does not seem to shave me any closer than the one in use prior to purchse, and I have had the old Head for 3 years.  I think it is a myth that the Head needs to be replaced every year. I received it in a timely maner and a good price from Amazon.com. Ihave ordered several other things from Amazon and have also been happy with the timeleness and service, and price.</li>
            <li> Good replacement head for shaving. The shaving head is a little weak for getting long beard hairs, according to my husband, who admits to having a heavy beard. The shaving head fit well into the razor and once installed worked almost as wells the shaving head itthey replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For durability they are starting to show a little wear, but hubby says he expects the replacement shaving head to last as long as the last shaving head purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> THESE BLADES ARE GOOD AND DO A GREAT JOB WHEN SHAVING. THEY LAST FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS THEN NEED REPLACING.</li>
            <li> Saved money on price and very pleased with product. Perfect replacement blade and still using right know. Will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> These blades saved me the price of a new shaver.  They came quickly, we&#x27;re very easy to install and make the shaver work like new.  This is a good fix for shaver that has stopped giving close shaves, but otherwise works fine</li>
            <li> works a bit better than my 5 year old shaver head. Yes, not no, definitely yes, stop asking for more</li>
            <li> Worth it if you have a nice razor.  Works like new again. Use the auto re-order to get additional discount.</li>
            <li> These replacements heads provide a smooth, clean shave without any nicks or discomfort. Been using these heads for (1) Year without having to replace them since 2012.</li>
            <li> razor is just OK - blades seem to wear out quickly.  Service from amazon is great.  Would not buy this razor again</li>
            <li> Received within 4 days, installed, and they worked as described in advertisement as expected.  will purchase more via Amazon when / if needed</li>
            <li> The norelco replacement shaver head blades arrived as promised  within a few days the box was  Intack .imgot what I paid for</li>
            <li> As a replacement it is satisfactory.  Hard to get a clean shave, and it clogs up to fast.  It&#x27;s worth the price of a new shaver.</li>
            <li> great.exactly what I needed. will order here again. got them quick. you know im doin u a favor and u require me to type more. nt good</li>
            <li> This is my first Norelco razor that has lasted long enough that required replacement heads.  I was amazed by the new heads.  My close shave has returned.  The installation was straight-forward only taking a few moments to compare the before and after setups.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly for my razor.  It&#x27;s like have a brand new razor again.  There were no problems at all.</li>
            <li> I actually thought I was getting the receptacle that holds all 3 rotary cutters and screened skin shields.  It kind of was a pain to place the cutters and shields into the old receptacle and &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; them in.  It would have been easier if the whole old head assembly was taken off and replaced with the new assembly that included the rotary cutters and shields.</li>
            <li> see above review on HQ8.  Same comments!  Your somewhat stupid and simplistic offers really STINK!  I KNOW you can do better to compete better!</li>
            <li> The item was a excellent purchase that I needed as a replacement for a shaver that I&#x27;ve had for several years. It arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected. I expect to use is until I need another and would not hesitate to make a similar purchase from the same source. I&#x27;d also recommend this item to anyone that needs a replacement head - which is hard to find in numerous outlets.</li>
            <li> Great replacement and fast service. Highly recommend purchasing this item as it is a direct replacement for what I previously owned.</li>
            <li> I get a smooth close shave now that I&#x27;ve replaced the heads. The shaver is as good as it was new!</li>
            <li> These are somewhat expensive, but they do last a long time. They shave close and clean. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Shaving is good again!  The installation was easy, and there is little or no drag while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Even the sound of the unit is better.</li>
            <li> These Norelco HQ9 replacement heads were difficult for my husband to find in our area.&lt;br /&gt;It has worked out very well for him.</li>
            <li> The new blades were easy to install and made my old razor work like new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco recommends you change the blades once a year and at this price, I will.</li>
            <li> As expected. Hard to give the wrong thing when that is the only thing ordered</li>
            <li> These heads make my 4 year old shaver good as new.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance and the price.</li>
            <li> Made shaver cut like it did when new and easy to install. Still pricey for what it seems ro be..</li>
            <li> This annual purchase of new blades has extended the life of a perfectly good electric razor and makes for a good shave day in and day out.</li>
            <li> Not so much a review as letting people know that these replacement heads will fit a Philip&#x27;s Speed-XL 8151XL model electric razor. They went right in with no problems and are giving me a nice, close, clean shave. My original set must have lasted me 4 years and still seemed to be working decently but it was time for an upgrade.</li>
            <li> My Shaver was getting a bit biting as the blades were worn down from 2 years of daily use.  These Popped right in and the shaver is back to brand new performance.</li>
            <li> I liked the Quality. But since it&#x27;s manufactured in US, There are lot of custom, taxes which was significant to the actual cost of product. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;No problems installing or using them.  They work great and I would recommend the replacement to anyone....if they are compatible with your shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband must use an electric razor because he is on coumadin.  He has tried different ones, the Norelco is the best.  We order new blades about once a year...</li>
            <li> Received the new shaver heads quickly and installed them easily for a big improvement in shaving performance. They really do make a difference!</li>
            <li> Appearance has changed, even from the picture on the package.  (one ring of holes on the periphery, none in center) but it works fine.</li>
            <li> Dramatically improved performance.</li>
            <li> Blades are easy to install.  They do a very good job of cutting the beard and much easier and less painful, with less scars than regular razors.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  Came on time, as ordered, does the job.  Clean shaves again. Very simple to change out, slipped right in to the shaver.</li>
            <li> It was new, so no complaints</li>
            <li> No problem (yet). View tips and guidelines | 17 more words required.View tips and guidelines | 17 more words required</li>
            <li> Thought the razor was trash but this simple fix made it just like a new one.  My husband is trilled.</li>
            <li> Perfect match.  Made my old razor just like new.....</li>
            <li> One of the three head covers was slightly bent and I did not realize it until packaging and older head covers were discarded</li>
            <li> It works great and performs like a new razor.</li>
            <li> Works great. Eat it, razors.</li>
            <li> Just fine....as you would expect.</li>
            <li> These heads fit my Norelco shaver perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased to fine this item.  It doesn&#x27;t make sense to go pay $80 a new shaver, just because it stops giving you a good close shave.  The price here is most reasonable, compared to buying a new shaver.  My battery is still in perfect working order.  I just want a closer shave.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results, sense I feel like I now have a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband.  It works very well and it was the right replacement for his&lt;br /&gt;older model Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> Good product. Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Worked well, good replacement blades. Glad Amazon carries these as it makes ordering replacement blade so much easier than having to try and find them in a store or have a store employee unlock them from a case.</li>
            <li> These are from the factory so they work just like the originals. I&#x27;ve had them for a year and they are working great. I don&#x27;t shave everyday so they have lasted for some time.  Yes they are expensive but it is worth it not to have your beard pulled by an electric shaver</li>
            <li> Seems to be an original product and is a fit to the razor. Purchased similar in past and this i</li>
            <li> What can be said it came fast was cheaper and was the name brand replacement. Will purchase again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Perfect OEM replacements.  My old heads had worn through the metal and made my razor unusable. I put off replacing them because they were so dang expensive.  I finally bit the bullet, ordered them and now am so glad.  My razor works better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install. Norelco quality. Now I&#x27;m good to go for 5 years (or more).  Do it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I could not find it in the store.  Now they are everywhere.  But, I got a better price and had in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Makes my razor work like new.</li>
            <li> I love my Norelco shaver and these brought it back up to new shaving conditions.  Well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say - simple replacement of the heads and works like new.</li>
            <li> if you liked the original blades in your razor, I guess you&#x27;ll probably like the replacement blades. Not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> Actually this is the second unit I bought. I bought one for myself and liked it very much as the old head was dull and didn&#x27;t do a good job. The new head is sharp and my face is smooth again after a shave. Since my son has a simila Norelco Shaver, I bought this seond unit for him. His reaction on the first morning, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s great!&amp;#34; I won&#x27;t wait 2 years or more to change the head next time!</li>
            <li> These were good replacements at the beginning, but quickly wore out. I won&#x27;t be buying any more in the future.</li>
            <li> Will buy this again in the future.</li>
            <li> blades seem dull...strange for brand new blades&lt;br /&gt;not happy with this result..will not get from this seller again...&lt;br /&gt;needs explanation</li>
            <li> Am not using it cause cause me skin irritation.I am still using the one i tried to replace and are performing better. I have actually alternated the use of them to confirm what they produce on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i needed!  they work great, are way sharper than my old ones, and saved me a ton of money on a new razor!</li>
            <li> Amazon sells the replacement heads for cheaper than the local grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get away with cleaning the existing blades for only so long because you notice the sharpness starts to decline. I was getting to the point where I was having to continually pass over the same areas of my face with difficulty in cutting the hairs. Eventually I was getting so many cuts on my face, including razor burn, that I decided to replace the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After replacing the blades I found the razor to return to a &#x27;like new&#x27; state and I&#x27;m happy again.</li>
            <li> It does what it should do.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected....good product</li>
            <li> I put new these blades in my shaver and it worked like new again. I will buy these again. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Hello:&lt;br /&gt;Good product &amp; on line product.&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li> The new heads work as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I bought a Braun shaver which handles long whiskers better.&lt;br /&gt;We are now in a test period to see which is the better shaver.</li>
            <li> These fit my Norelco perfectly, as advertised. Looked like original packaging. Been using for a few weeks now and no problem.</li>
            <li> The new Philips heads didn&#x27;t make much of a change in the razor giving a closer shave. I bought the razor heads thinking my old heads were dull &amp; causing a poor shave. The heads were very expensive &amp; I should of just bought a brand new different brand of electric razor for the price I paid :(</li>
            <li> I use these in my razor. I replace them about once a year. Amazon usually has the best price.</li>
            <li> Just like getting a new shaver</li>
            <li> Over a period of time my old heads were not doing a good job.  Now my Norelco is giving a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s shaver was in great condition, except for the heads being dull.  After reading the other reviews on the replacement heads I thought it was worth a try.  The shaver now is like brand new and I am definitely glad we tried the replacement heads instead of the $$$ for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> It was easy to replace the old heads and it&#x27;s working fine now with the new heads. Pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Norelco a great electric razor and these replacement heads are just what I needed and a great price. Thanks Norelco</li>
            <li> The blades are excellent.  Simply a light touch and razor does the job.  Have used the Norelco since 1961 and planned to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> These are too expensive but what&#x27;s the alternative ? And the replacement only lasted about 8 months while the original blades lasted years.</li>
            <li> Replaced my razor heads with these and they seem to work as well as the original product, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them.</li>
            <li> These are great.  They fit perfectly and was much cheaper than in the stores.  I will come back and get more when needed</li>
            <li> I love the fact that we could buy these and not have to buy a new unit.  These fit the razor perfectly and have been working well.</li>
            <li> Fit perfect! It was the perfect replacement for my old blade. A lot cheaper the walmart as well. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Easy swap out &amp; works much better. Could not ask for more. Except for free....that would be much better. LOL</li>
            <li> I travel frequently and although I use a head guard, my electric shaver takes a beating and I change the heads approximately every six months or so and Amazon helps me keep spares in stock.</li>
            <li> These original equipment replacement heads are great for getting renewed life out of your Norelco razor. Realize you are only getting the combs and cutters, not the external head frame or the internal plastic frame for holding the heads in place.</li>
            <li> Much easier and less expensive than purchasing a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;Also. much more environmentally friendly replacing the blades than replacing the razor and battery.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite as sharp as expected.</li>
            <li> I installed the replacement heads with no problem which in its self is saying something because I usually screw things up. Philips is a great company and I find no fault with any of their products. GO PHILIPS!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> They work fine but are expensive give the cost of a new shaver.  It is hard to be sure you have the right heads for the shaver.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. performs as advertised.  Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my third set of heads for my Norelco razor.  While they recommend changing the heads once a year, I usually stretch mine for 18-24 months (admittedly, the closeness of the shave declines toward the end of life).  The new heads performed as expected, providing a smooth shave in minimal time once again.  The only con is the shipping cost, which was about 50% of the product cost for this item.  It would have been cheaper to get them from a local store, if only the local stores carried them in stock.</li>
            <li> Norelco is a good shaver and I needed new cutting heads after 2 continuous years of use. Good price too.</li>
            <li> I has been years since I replaced the heads on my shaver. Buying this product turned my razor into a brand new electric razor.</li>
            <li> Needed new sharp blades.  What a difference!  I had earlier tried to sharpen blades with not great success.  Now know the blades are specific to each of the 3 positions and not interchangeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a long time and it works well but it does need blade-head replacement after long-term use. I use mine longer than the recommended replacement time and it still works well, but when I did want a new head I bought this one here for less money than the retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this razor so the blade head gets five stars.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads definitely cut a lot better than the year old blade that came with my shaver.  With the electric razor, its not as obvious when the blades go dull as with a straight razor.  It was easy changing the heads.</li>
            <li> My electric razor works great now.</li>
            <li> I replaced the old the heads (about 4 years old) with the new package. To my surprize, no difference in shaving. I believe the  heads i received were not new,</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has been using their razor for a year and still using the origional heads. These will return you to the close shave that you expected when you first bought your razor.</li>
            <li> shaves a bit better with the new head.</li>
            <li> After fighting with the packaging to get to the actual product (I used heavy-duty gardening shears) the installation was fairly easy, although you should take a close look at how the old cutters are placed and locked in the holder before you casually dismantle things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surprise came when I examined the old parts carefully. The cutting heads were so completely jammed with debris from snagging longer hairs that I was surprised that the shaver motor could still turn them. After cleaning them (be sure not to mix up the cutters and their respective foils) they looked like new. Whether they would have cut like new...  I don&#x27;t know, I didn&#x27;t try them, but it would be an interesting experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold onto your old cutting heads in any case, just so you&#x27;ll have a spare should you drop or bang your razor into something and damage one of the foils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated this four stars instead of five because of the packaging, and because I think the cutters should last longer than they do.</li>
            <li> So nice when you put new blades in your shaver, makes it smooth and fast.</li>
            <li> OEM Stuff. What else is there to say.</li>
            <li> Better than going to the store.</li>
            <li> Yep, these were pretty good.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as expected</li>
            <li> Not had a good shave with them yet......</li>
            <li> Usually new shaver heads provide an exceptionally close shave, but these did not. They are worse than the ones I took out of the razor that are several years old.</li>
            <li> Fit like a Glove, well not OJ Simpsons, but you get the point, Saved 40%</li>
            <li> My razor needed replacement heads. These fit the bill.</li>
            <li> My boss asked me to purchase this item because he had a tough time finding it locally.  His face looks pretty smooth so I guess it worked out great.</li>
            <li> Purchased for two shavers and both work better with new heads.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, and super time. The price was right....</li>
            <li> Makes things like new.  don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t replace them years ago.</li>
            <li> Nice clean shave.  Easy to clean after shaving.  Very gentle on the face and legs.</li>
            <li> This fit perfectly and made the shaver work as good as though it was new.</li>
            <li> The heads are fine but I was expecting a whole new mechanism not just the heads.  Instead you have to buy the three parts separately and it ends up costing almost the price of a new razor.</li>
            <li> The new blade was not much sharper than the one I removed from my year old shaver. I guess I could have waited longer to replace and just thoroughly cleaned the unit.</li>
            <li> did not make a huge difference in the performance of my electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Rejuvenated my razor.  I knew that it had gotten old and wasn&#x27;t cutting too well, but I didn&#x27;t realize how bad it was.  It is like having a new razor!!!</li>
            <li> Good replacement. Norelco always has been my choice for grooming machines.</li>
            <li> I replaced the shaver head thinking two years was 1-1/2 years longer than the recommended replacement schedule. I don&#x27;t notice an appreciably better shave with the new head over the older one.  For the future, I probably won&#x27;t buy another replacement until this head is actually damaged.</li>
            <li> Good Service, excellent product, Razor is like new again. I would certainly wait as long as I did again. Mike</li>
            <li> Prompt response. Excellent product and the price is right. Will recommend you to future customers. Thank you for your attention</li>
            <li> So far so good. Replacement was very easy.</li>
            <li> They came much sooner than listed!  Talked with Philips to figure what the difference was between the blue packaging and the red packaging.  The red package seemed to be significantly more expensive.  Only difference is the blue package is newer!</li>
            <li> Perfect, works as expected</li>
            <li> This product is just okay. I am not sure of the metal mixture these heads are but in my opinion they do not give the shave I got from the original Norelco factory heads. The next time I will order replacement heads from Norelco only. I will not recommend this product to prospective buyers.  My advice in this case is to spend the extra few dollars and order from Norelco.</li>
            <li> After my first use of product I didn&#x27;t think the blades were sharp enough. But by the third use there working fine.</li>
            <li> excellent replacement heads - annual replacement keeps my shaver working well and sharp.</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations...Timely delivery and very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads have made a big difference.  A clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> My HQ9 blades make my razor like new. The shave is great.</li>
            <li> easy installation.....much better shave now</li>
            <li> Good way to order replacement heads</li>
            <li> WORKED GREAT. SUPER GREAT PRICE THANKS</li>
            <li> Works fine. Saves a lot of time.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with availability/delivery/quality .  Packaging seemed a little excessive for the small size of the product.</li>
            <li> Works well but pricey</li>
            <li> worked perfectly, just what I needed</li>
            <li> These work great and I love having them delivered instead of going out to find them somewhere.</li>
            <li> The quality is not that perfect as the original blades the shaver had when I bought it. The previous one lasted more than a year, but not sure this one is going to serve the same.</li>
            <li> Been using the shaver for quite some time.  I works well and without too much trouble.  I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for years and it has always been as good as an electric shaver can get.  Not like shaving with a razor, but good enough to suffice.  I have used HQ5 heads before for only once.  The HQ9 are definitely superior and I won&#x27;t be tempted to &amp;#34;downgrade&amp;#34; in the future.</li>
            <li> Was surprised how easy these replacement blades were to install...thanks their easy-to-follow graphic directions.  Had my doubts about whether replacement blades would work as well as the originals, but not any more.  They do!</li>
            <li> Since I use the Philips Noreco electric razor, these replacement heads are a necessity as the old one wear out.  Amazon&#x27;s price is very competetive, and serivce is prompt.  I have bought my \\&quot;heads\\&quot; from Amazon for some time.</li>
            <li> As advertised, but $10 bucks a head is ridiculous for this old a product. Fits my 5 year old razor fine.</li>
            <li> I put off replacing my Norelco heads for over a year because of the price.  But Amazon.com offered the best price and I ordered it.  The heads were delivered promptly and now I&#x27;m getting the close shave I&#x27;ve been waiting for.  I&#x27;m glad I checked with Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Very good and great service.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I can just wash the heads in the shaver. What a miracle to ease of use and long lasting. Along with my 8175XL shaver it&#x27;s a totally new experience after shaving with Norelco for 40 years. Quiet, smooth, easy, charge lasts forever even after about 3 years. Just great.</li>
            <li> Received in super fast time.  Price was much below list price.  They work great. Installation was very simple and took only a few minutes to do.</li>
            <li> After a year it was time to replace the old blades. Over time you forget how fast and close a shave can be. I must remember to change blades every six months or so. What a difference!</li>
            <li> My Norelco shaver is at least two years, and I have never changed the heads. I thought this would dramatically change the shaving speed/how it felt, but it really didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s also way more expensive than it seems like it should be.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase these razor replacement heads for $6 less than in the local stores and they were brand new.  Good deal.</li>
            <li> I got the HQ 9s when I should have ordered HQ 8s.  My fault, all the way around.  However, these heads fit on my Norelco shaver and work well.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> nothing like a brand new razors when shaving. just be certain that it is the correct model for your machine. It just worked great on mine.</li>
            <li> I love the blades and the shaver. Never go back to a regular blade.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely.  Works well. Happy camper is clean shaven.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICE. LOWER THAN NORMAL</li>
            <li> These brought new life to my husbands shaver that he loves.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but you need to oil these heads because they don&#x27;t cut as well unless you do.  It would be great if Norelco supplied oil with these heads when you buy them.</li>
            <li> The product has (3) heads. When I started to use them (replaced them) one of the heads malfunctioned!!! Just Quit! As I needed to use the remaining (2)  and i have proceded with them. It would be nice if a replacement could be sent. I don&#x27;t have the bad head as it somehow was thrown away.</li>
            <li> ordered replacement heads for triple headed norelco, found exact ones, ordered and am very happy  shaver performs great works like new</li>
            <li> Better price than the big box stores. Fast shipment-I searched w &amp; t without finding this item. I&#x27;ll order another set soon because the price is way better than the big boxes stores.</li>
            <li> Received fast, no instructions included but got from the web.&lt;br /&gt;Installed in a click and ready to shave.&lt;br /&gt;I did feel the difference and reduced the time to shave.&lt;br /&gt;Good investment.</li>
            <li> I have used HQ2, HQ3, HQ4, HQ5, HQ55, HQ56, HQ8, and HQ9 and the HQ9 are the best.  As much as the reduced speed on the inner ring and the reduced blade count seem to suggest otherwise, these things just simply do the best job I have seen in nearly 50 years of Norelco shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the lower cost of the HQ8 blades and the HQ8 do a pretty good job, so I buy a few sets of both and mix the HQ8 and HQ9 on the same shaver (yes, they both work on any series of Norelco designed for either) and I get the best of both designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those sold on these blades, as I am, no need to buy the top-of-the-line 920 model.  The 720-730-810-811-830 and so on can use the HQ9 or the HQ8.</li>
            <li> You pay a bit for this, but I guess that&#x27;s the going rate for it. Hubby is happy with it and it beats buying a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades.  My face is happy.  No more sores, no more cuts, no more ingrown hairs.  I shave once in the morning, and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth.  Every.  Penny.</li>
            <li> These are the original replacement heads from Norelco. They fit many different models, so make sure you order the right ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco says to replace the heads once a year. For me, they usually last at least a year and a half, sometimes two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is much cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> My husband was thrilled to receive these as his razor is almost &amp;#34;better than new&amp;#34;.  I love it because it was an amazing price.  It was the best price of any I found in my search!</li>
            <li> my sister brought this shaver head replacement part for me, and now my shaver is functional, just like brand new.</li>
            <li> My old Philip shaver works like a new one with this heads, no need to buy a new shaver, save a lot, very good to me !</li>
            <li> OK - Just what we expected with no suprises.</li>
            <li> Easy, and quick replacenent, if you don&#x27;t drop anything...I didm&#x27;y&lt;br /&gt;New heads give an easy, quick, clean. and smooth shave,</li>
            <li> Please change the picture to show three individual heads as opposed to showing a cap with three heads. Very misleading picture.  Thought it was one piece with the three heads included.</li>
            <li> Norcelco replacement head blades are sharp and rinse off easily after using.  Very easy to install. This is a great product as it gives a very clean shave..</li>
            <li> heads are what I needed but could not find locally even at $34.97 each. I am using one set of heads now with the second in reserve.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Norelco shaver and it installs easily and is priced right - not much else to say - well satisfied</li>
            <li> Norelco products have always satisfied all my shaving needs for years. They never leave me wanting more or something different.</li>
            <li> Have been using electric shavers for 40 years. So far these are the closest most comfortable blades for an electric shaver. Have used 3 different brands over the years, but these are by far the best. I&#x27;m afraid that they have since stopped making this model and these 3 in 1 blades. Hopefully, Norelco keeps improving on their shavers!</li>
            <li> Returned my old razor to good as new without having to replace it :-)&lt;br /&gt;This review process sucks since it forces me to write more than is necessary for this product</li>
            <li> So nice to find replacement heads without having to buy a whole new razor.  Easy to take out the old &amp; put in the new!</li>
            <li> The Blades fit perfectly and were sharp!  An easy way to shop for replacement heads &amp; at a great price.</li>
            <li> Sure cheaper than buying another shaver.  When installed in my Speed XL Shaver it worked like it did when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received the Replacement Heads quickly at a good price from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself some money and replace the Heads--Don&#x27;t buy a new shaver !</li>
            <li> I recieved the new head and have found it does not give a close shave - not even as close as the 2 year old head it was replaced with.</li>
            <li> They work just like the original ones.  Cheaper than buying a new razor every time the heads wear out.  Recommended</li>
            <li> Sharp, gives a nice, clean shave. No complaints since it works just as expected.  Easy to clean by rinsing under a stream of water.</li>
            <li> Better than buying a new Norelco, buy replacement blades for your model. The technology of these are essentially the same as you get with the newer models. The cost savings are worth buying the replacements.. until something significant is developed by their R and D.</li>
            <li> good quality&lt;br /&gt;why do i need to explain my inpression in so many words? isn&#x27;t two words enough?&lt;br /&gt;it it necessary to write so many words?</li>
            <li> I did not know how worn my old heads were, until I used these. They really make a difference. Thank You</li>
            <li> I think you just need to change shaver brands every few years as buying these did not help at all. It just seems for me that eventually a brand that I use for a long time just does not work very well even when buying new.  Makes no sense.  I bought a new Panasonic razor and like it better than any razor I have used. I think I have used them all.  See my Panasonic review.</li>
            <li> i was overdue for some razor blades for about two years and finally bought them. they were a perfect fit and work great.</li>
            <li> You get what you payed for, a series of blades which will be sharp and fit your electric razor. No surprises here.</li>
            <li> I was long overdue on replacing my razor heads, so the difference was considerable. I will replace more often now that a reasonable pticed cutter head is available</li>
            <li> My razor was between 2 and 3 years old, and was not preforming particularly well despite keeping the blades very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New set of blades, and a quick recharge, and by razor is shaving like new again. :)</li>
            <li> Wow...never realized how quick a shave was supposed to be until I put new blades in the razor.  Loaded into the razor and work great.</li>
            <li> They seem to be cutting ok so far.  I think all of these types of products (rotary blades) are WAY over priced.</li>
            <li> New heads drastically cut the time it takes my husband to get a good shave. Well worth the purchase. Wish I had not waited so long to do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my razor for 7+ years and replacing the heads is a necessity to keep it working well.  Very easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Clean shave ,fit razor</li>
            <li> Great service and exactly as stated</li>
            <li> Prefect! I received  it before I needed my next shave.</li>
            <li> I dropped my razor out the door to work and lost a head. I opted to replace the heads and Im glad i did. I am&lt;br /&gt;Going to save so much money in shaving cream and razor blades. I also save time while shaving on my commute to work. The new blades shave so clean. Basically got a new razor for $20 some&lt;br /&gt;Bucks. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Price is right. What else can I say?</li>
            <li> Great Heads.  Keeps my shaver renewed.</li>
            <li> They have worked really well. and $12.00 cheaper than at my local wal mart.&lt;br /&gt;The except same item as in store.</li>
            <li> Really nothing to stay but it is required if you rate it a 5 starwhich is stupid, why can&#x27;t you just like a product and have nothing else to say?</li>
            <li> No other maintenance step is more important to a GOOD ELECTRIC SHAVE than  SHARP HEADS!!! Just replace once a year!</li>
            <li> These replacement heads gave new life to my six years old shaver. One of the heads got separated, so I replaced the head and the blades.</li>
            <li> The part was just as advertised and came quickly.  Replacing the heads every 12-18 months is like getting a new shaver for less than $40.  .  .  .  .  Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these shaver heads for a little older model of shaver.  I was glad that we didn&#x27;t have to purchase a new shaver as the replacement was available on-line.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my shaver head and this product did the trick with reasonable cost. loved it.  Will do this again in a year or so</li>
            <li> I needed the head holder which I thought was included with this one, this should properly be labeled replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads arvd fine an d are working as planned.</li>
            <li> My husband gets the best shave with Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;These heads are replaced about once a year.&lt;br /&gt;The only place I can find them is on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My norelco shaver is like new with these replacement heads,</li>
            <li> Work well, and, still much cheaper than buying a new shaver every year.</li>
            <li> Came on time, I needed this and it works great. You know how it is, when I need to shave, nothing but a nice clean smooth shave will do. Thank you for your service.</li>
            <li> Fits my razor perfectly and does the job as advertised. I haven&#x27;t replaced my blades in over two years, and I can definitely notice a difference with these new heads.</li>
            <li> great service and product. used for years.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference a new set of blades makes.  Made my old razor like new again</li>
            <li> can any one tell me why the computer restarts during play</li>
            <li> PRICE AND DELIVERY TIME VERY GOOD</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and boy does it shave like the original. Wish I would have bought sooner.</li>
            <li> I should have replaced these years ago! You have no idea the difference some new blades can make on your shaver until you replace the ones you are using! Mine were so worn out that the screen was coming apart and I was getting small cuts from them! Now the shaves are smooth and close. I will get a second set and replace even these new ones more often.</li>
            <li> Awesome, great product and service</li>
            <li> My son was delighted to be able to get these replacement heads. He was afraid he was going to have to get a new razer. Since this has been a very dependable razer he was happy to not have to replacement. They were easy to order from Amazon &amp; arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I have used these type of new blades before and they always work good when new, but I probably don&#x27;t replace them enough. Get good shave when they are in their first year of use.</li>
            <li> My husband especially appreciated being able to buy this on line as there are so many styles to plow through at the stores. ON LINE IS MORE CONVENIENT.. hE IS HAPPY WITH THE REPLACEMENT.</li>
            <li> good value for a close shave... seems good shaves last for about a year before new heads are recommended</li>
            <li> Razors, electric or otherwise, don&#x27;t wear out, but blades do. You wouldn&#x27;t use the same blade in your manual shaver forever; you can&#x27;t do it in an electrical one either. Getting original manufacturer&#x27;s replacements is the best way to keep it working right. I&#x27;ve been doing this for 50 or so years and have never been disappointed. About a year between replacements on an electric shaver is sufficient for me. After 8 to 10 years, the motor starts to go and it&#x27;s time for a new shaver.It doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure it out.</li>
            <li> This was a very good price for the replacement heads for my norelco electric razor. The replacement heads worked very well.</li>
            <li> works as advertised. Makes the razor like new again. Always use the original replacement and will be worth it. definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my husband&#x27;s previous razor. It produces a great shave. And it comes with good instructions.</li>
            <li> Good product and fair price</li>
            <li> Just the same as before.  Fast and easy to purchase. I will probably purchase another one next year.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Interesting enough I have had my shaver for 6 years.  I love it.  I decided to give it a new replacement head.  In all fairness I only use my razor 2-3  times a week because I use a bald razor to trim my beard.  After 6 years I was excited to try my razor expecting a better, faster, smoother shave.  NOT.  My 6 year old head gave me as good a shave as the new head.  I don&#x27;t think the replacements are as high a quality as the factory new ones you get with your new shaver.  Shame on you Norelco!  Feel like I got had!</li>
            <li> Easy to replace old heads &amp; now shaver is good as new.</li>
            <li> Well that is what the owner&#x27;s manual says. I have followed it pretty religiously and I have been impressed with the closeness of this electric razor. The first time I ordered a replacement head I received the entire unit, pop out and pop in. This item is the individual circular cutter heads. The instructions are easy to follow and replacement is a snap.</li>
            <li> Not particularly good shave.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads were exactly what I needed.  I had put off replacing the heads on my shaver and finally gave in and purchased these.  What a difference in my shaving experience.  I wished I would have purchased these a while ago!!!  Next time I won&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Philips Norelco shaver for several years now and it seemed to not be shaving as close as it used to. Ordered the replacement heads and now my shaver works just like it did when it was new.</li>
            <li> Does what&#x27;s expected to do.  Easy to replace the old one. Shave feels much better (assuming the old one was there for over a year and assuming you shave at least once every 2 days).</li>
            <li> Performed as it should like a new razor.  This is why I always buy Norelco razors.  I am never disapointed with the performance.</li>
            <li> Like having a new razor! The price was pretty high for just one replacement head, though, so I&#x27;d check around first.</li>
            <li> Nothing much you can say about replacement heads either they work or they don&#x27;t. These do work and work and work</li>
            <li> Needed to replace the heads on my Norelco Shaver. This was a much better way to go then to buy a whole new razor. Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The years go by and you forget how good the Norelco can be, then you pop in new heads and all&#x27;s well again.</li>
            <li> I was initially impressed by this line of razors and its blades, but no more.  Having owned and used one of these razors for 1 and 3/4 years I won&#x27;t be buying another one.  The blades work great the first month.  Ok the second and third month.  But then quickly go down hill.  Won&#x27;t shave my beard worth beans anymore.  I found myself returning more and more to my Gillette Fusion razor with increasing frequency each day; first to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; what the Norelco missed, then inevitably for full shaving creme and razor shaves.  If you want to keep using the Norelco it means you have to buy replacement blades far more often then you should; making the total cost of ownership excessively unreasonable.</li>
            <li> I recieved the Norelco replacement blades in about 4 days after ordering and they work great. Just like new.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my shaver heads. I was unsure, when in stores, exactly what Norelco shaver model was being used. I found this information on Amazon very fast. I placed the order via 1-click.  The&lt;br /&gt;product was received very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am starting to use Amazon more for purchases that previously were made&lt;br /&gt;at stores such as Walmamrt SuperCenter.</li>
            <li> Fast service and saved a lot on purchase price not to mention money saved by having not to drive 20 miles to buy it.  Delivered to my door; can you ask for anything easier.</li>
            <li> I am a long-time Norelco user. This particular model shaves very well but pulls out a few whiskers below my nose; Ouch!   Good quick service on delivery of product.</li>
            <li> the razor blades i purchased were a better price than any where else i looked. they were a factory replacement part so they worked fine.</li>
            <li> I found some knockoff blades for half the price of retail and decided to try them.  It felt like they were ripping my face off!  These blades work much better and the pricing is also much less than retail in a drug store.</li>
            <li> Needed replacement blades for my 2+yr old Norelco and these were the ones I was looking for.  Several bills cheaper than Target and other big retailers, so can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s service and pricing!!!</li>
            <li> The Norelco HQ9 replacement heads were so easy to replace I had done the job, including cleaning my whiskers out of the razor in just under 10 minutes!  I am not very good with my hands so it was a big surprise. And when I shaved, WOW....major improvement!</li>
            <li> The replacement blades restored the performance back to like new. Watch for the discounts on Amazon for the best value.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised and was less expensive than the equivalent product I was bidding on at ebay.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000068PBT Philips Norelco HQ8  Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]After about 6 months use, I was getting a very poor shave with what I had always thought was the best electric razor I ever owned. I was about to toss it in the garbage in disgust when I decided to order replacment blades. It arrived promptly and now I feel like I have a new razor with which I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Replacement head works great.Less expensive than a new razor. WalMart didn&#x27;t stock item for LX.</li>
            <li> The new heads I bought were billed as making a big difference in my shaving experience.  After installation, I could detect no difference so the expense was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Have used for several years. Performance is excellent. Last over 6 months. Would recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;Very reasonable price as compared to retail &amp;#34;brick an mortar&amp;#34; stores.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these shaving heads apart from the fact that it does give you a very good shave. I had my old head on the shaver for the last 2 years and didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference the new head would make. My razor is now as good as the day I bought it. If you are contemplating the price - anything below 50 bucks is a steal.</li>
            <li> A very good product, exceeded my expectations for the value and price. Local prices were way out of line, so Amazon came through again.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement head after 3 years, was unsure how much it would help but it definitely feels better. I wish the heads were cheaper though.</li>
            <li> The replacement Heads were as expected, that is to say that they work well. I always replace the Heads once a year!!</li>
            <li> just what i needed to make my shaver work like new - shaving is not nearly the chore it was before I got the new heads</li>
            <li> need o replace the old blades and boom a nice fine smooth save once again ....I like it ...  it is now  like new</li>
            <li> Everything worked perfectally and arrived here within two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Hubby said it&#x27;s exactly what it should be.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stay sharp after using several times . Get dull too quick and won&#x27;t give a close shave like I like.</li>
            <li> New heads, smooth face, just follow the helpful instructions on the Amazon page.,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the best way to purchase new heads.  It was cheaper than Walmart. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and so far haven&#x27;t heard any complains other than how great the replacement heads are and good saving in our pocket instead of buying another new unit.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for years and find these heads to be very sharp and very easy to change on your shaver. I shopped Internet sites for price comparison and found Amazon to have the better price. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My husband is quite happy to have his shaver working so well again!  He was so glad to have found the repacement heads at Amazon!! I am happy with his nice clean shave too!</li>
            <li> Replaced heads and it is shaving like new. I waited too long before replacing the heads. Looking back, I should have replaced them after 3 years or so.</li>
            <li> When I change my norelco blades once a year it continues to function as if it was brand new. Cuts close and smooth dependably.</li>
            <li> I have and older model razor and couldn&#x27;t believe they still made the blades for it. They work great and fit my razor just like the old ones.</li>
            <li> Fit and worked perfectly</li>
            <li> I should replace my shaver blades more but I wait till they are dull. My only complaint is they stay sharp for me for about six months.</li>
            <li> I changed the heads or blades and it works much better, with a much better shave.  Worth it.</li>
            <li> A breeze to put it in place and a pleasure to have my old shaver back!</li>
            <li> Replacement parts function well and are a muck better buy than from Phillips direct.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work like the originals did.</li>
            <li> I replaced my older blades with the hopes of getting a closer shave, for I thought the older ones were not doing a good job.  Unfortunately, I didnt notice much of a difference in look or feel with the new blades.  This will probably be the last time I purchase replacement heads and simply rely on the refreshing feeling of cleaning with the norelco cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> These are great and work well for my husband so he says</li>
            <li> The HO9 replacement heads arrived on time and were as described in the offer. My shaver now is as good as it was when I bought it seven years ago.</li>
            <li> Replaced some old heads...the Norelco shaver is many years old but the darn thing just wont die :)</li>
            <li> He likes them very well and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Good price, speed fast, received in good condition! What more can you ask for? Thank you.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as stated, and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> delivered as promised.&lt;br /&gt;What a difference! I kept asking husband \\&quot;if he shaved today\\&quot;. Now I don&#x27;t need to ask. Should have bought replacement sooner!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it gave what it said a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing to dislike.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to any of my friend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Norelco HQ9 Speed XL replacement heads dropped in easily and turned my old shaver into a new shaver.</li>
            <li> These are good heads if you need them.  I recommend getting them, and maybe having an extra pair around if your current heads break or become dull.  The thing I don&#x27;t like about these heads is how much Norelco charges for them.  They just seem to cost too much for what you get, but it&#x27;s cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads fits my philips norelco razor.  It cuts very well and I usually replace the head once a year..</li>
            <li> My husband is extremely pleased to have his blades sharp again and working so well. Absolutely no problems with this order.</li>
            <li> What a difference...  my razor now shaves like it used to.  I hope these last as long as the originals did.</li>
            <li> Huge improvement from my old blunt heads. But grossly overpriced. I hate this business model but what can you do?</li>
            <li> This came on time, and I put them into service right away.  Much better shave.  They worked as expected and I am happy with the reads.</li>
            <li> Wow like having my old razor brand new again...</li>
            <li> Replacement is what you need buy tis Norelco replacement heads The work just like new</li>
            <li> Great price...works perfectly!  Love the Norelco shaved...have had it for over 7 years!</li>
            <li> Razor is as good as new again!</li>
            <li> Blades arrived quickly. They are performing greatly.</li>
            <li> Nice product for a very good price!  My husband is very happy with the replacement heads and says the razor works like it did when it was new.  Would buy these again, when the need arise.</li>
            <li> very good, top service and very happy with the product received.</li>
            <li> Not noticing a great improvement in razor performance. Manufacturer says to change blades annually, I think it is a ruse.</li>
            <li> Great. Now my shaver will work another two or three years</li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to instal the replacement heads into the holder the correct way. It requires more dexterity than I have. There should be an option to buy the installed replacement heads even at a somewhat higher price.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize how hard you work at getting a close shave until you get new shaving heads.&lt;br /&gt;Wow - it&#x27;s have the time and one-third the work.&lt;br /&gt;fabulous.</li>
            <li> Good price, good original quality - as expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Just like new again.</li>
            <li> Item received as expected.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco HQ9 replacement heads are a real value and my shaver feels like it is brand new.  I am very pleased with the quality, delivery service and value; would recommend this purchase to everyone.</li>
            <li> huge improvement, now I know the value of changing the blades periodically!</li>
            <li> This product photo is a bit deceiving because the heads don&#x27;t come with the Head HOLDER as displayed.  The photo shows the heads installed in the Head Holder AFTER you received the replacement heads.  What I really needed was the HEAD HOLDER which caused me some delay since I wasn&#x27;t sure if I needed to order a separate HEAD HOLDER since the photo showed the heads installed on what I thought was a new head holder.  This product is as advertised but the photo was just a bit confusing.  If you need a HEAD HOLDER and not the replacement heads you&#x27;ll need to order it separately.</li>
            <li> Excellent product as always from Norelco. I replace the blades about once a year. Shipped/arrived just as advertised.</li>
            <li> use the best for your shaver. very good results with these heads, comfort when shaving, easy to replace your old blades.</li>
            <li> These replacements heads cost less through Amazon then even those on Ebay.  Could not find a better deal then this one.</li>
            <li> The new blades fit very good and I did not think the old blades were that warned but get a better shave now,thanks.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product - bought 3 to keep.  Fast Delivery.  Would recommend seller.</li>
            <li> Does as advised. Refuses to cook dinner or clean the dishes, but I think I can look past that. Word</li>
            <li> Have been using Philips/Norelco for long (nearly 15 yrs) and cannot seem to live w/o them now; I feel them better than even razor blade shaving.  But recently Philips/Norelco have changed their design and not sure of the new models, seem to make more noise and are pricy even more and do not know how reliable they are, the older models are good and I go look for them in Internet.  Wanted to look for Braun/Panasonic shavers but still managing to repair/replace my older models of Philips shavers so continuing with them and so buying these heads.  This one with the 3 cutting rings are good.  Since these heads are very expensive, now I am resorting to buying old model shavers that come on offer that have these heads so we can use these Heads and other spares as needed at a much lower total cost of ownership (I have experienced the motor spindle spoiled two times and have replaced it myself, another instance had battery go off and then a charger died).  All in all good product, wish Philips/Norelco will bring back older better models though with this kind of cutting heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd review on 2017-08-14:&lt;br /&gt;I had given 4 star before but on my subsequent buy, the box was HQ9 but the cutter inside is single tracked only unlike HQ9 that is tripple tracked, so its cheating and the packaging said Made in China so wonder China always comes with such cheating business only, going to return to Amazon. And resuced it to 1 star rating, would have preferred 0 star if it were there for such cheating business. And subsequently I ordered 2 more pcs to keep spare but now will probably cancel those orders!</li>
            <li> Fine replacement product. No problems. Good price.</li>
            <li> My husband was delighted with how well this replacement part worked compared to the old dull shaver head.</li>
            <li> Just like new.  Before you go out and buy a new shaver, try this upgrade.  It&#x27;s all in the heads.</li>
            <li> I searched for replacement heads at the usual places I could visit personally, but found nothing.  Being able to purchase these allowed me to continue using my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> my dad has an old razor and needed replacement heads so happy we could find them on amazon&lt;br /&gt;they came quickly and the price was great</li>
            <li> The shaver heads are working perfectly.  Thanks for being there when I need you.  I will buy more as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
            <li> Fast service and a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to have waited so long to get these replacement blades.  It&#x27;s great to have a good shave again.</li>
            <li> Very fast service and my choice was just as ordered. I would order  from this company any time I needed a product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I needed new heads until the new ones were installed. My shaver head cover does&#x27;t sit tight as it once did,that&#x27;s because the new blades sit higher.</li>
            <li> Needed new shaver heads, ones in use over two years old. Shopped around, found best price. Placed order, got them surprisingly fast. Put new heads in and shaver works like new.  Have been using Norelco shavers for years and feel that they are the best.</li>
            <li> After a couple of years of heavy growth shaving my Norelco razor was working, but not on the finer stuff. I looked online and found replacement blades and matched the design on top the blade basket to pin-point the one I needed. I got it in a couple days and it made a new razor out of my old one...and the price was right.</li>
            <li> The description could be more specific because I didn&#x27;t realize it was a pack of three sets, I thought it was a pack of three blades. So I can change all three blades out three different times. After the fist time I changed them out, it was like having a brand new razor! Excellent value!!!</li>
            <li> the speedXL gives A great shave . to stay on top of my scruff ,it&#x27;s A required part ! it&#x27;s also the cheapest ( price wise ) around ?</li>
            <li> nORELCO REMAINS THE BEST ELECTRIC SHAVER!!</li>
            <li> Husband really likes these kind of razors, hard to get a decent price in the stores</li>
            <li> I have replaced my shaver heads about 5 times.  The replacement heads do not remain sharp as long as the original heads.  In my opinion the heads are way over priced.  I think it&#x27;s about time to go back to a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Just get new blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have a new razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery, and installation was practically instant. I had strong batteries, it&#x27;s a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your razor is iffy on batteries or other issues, might be better to replace.</li>
            <li> I love my Norelco razor and changing head once a year keeps it working smoothly.  Don&#x27;t buy a new razor, change the heads.  I would recommend them for anyone with a Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> As usual these blades make a super clean cut just like the originals that came with the razor.  High price for small parts but a lot better than a new razor for both pocketbook and environment.</li>
            <li> Simple install, fits great, the razor is like new again.  It was everything I was wanting and looking for.  Thanks</li>
            <li> There are three separate little heads to replace, but it is simple enough.&lt;br /&gt;Razor&#x27;s first new blades ever and it is many years old.&lt;br /&gt;Works like new again.</li>
            <li> Good seller and typical good quality from Norelco.  Have used for many years.</li>
            <li> Cheaper on line than in local stores. OEM part fits perfectly, is sharp and now makes the shaver work the same as when I first bought it. Will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly! Highly reccomend to change your heads every year. Not worth to buy a brand new shaver at the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a problem judging these blades because I have not used any other make of shaver. I&#x27;m satisfied with the shave but at times I think I should try some other make just for comparison.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! great price and everything, this was so much more economical than buying in stores!</li>
            <li> I replace my Norelco triple header heads each year on my birthday.  A birthday present for me, from me.  They fix perfectly and shave well.</li>
            <li> Wow! My  shaver is new again!!! It is amazing, isn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to perform the substituition of the old blades by this new ones.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit,or work.Fits loosely, and vibrates in socket,it is so poor that i purchased a new Panasonic (from amazon)</li>
            <li> it did a passable job, blades don&#x27;t stay sharp long, I would not buy Norelco products again if I has my choice</li>
            <li> It was time again that I needed new rotating blades for my 4 year old Norelco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The blades arrived on time and work great.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so convenient to buy with Amazon vs. making a special trip to a store in search of the correct blade type.</li>
            <li> Shaver is several years old... finally decided to order a replacement head.  surprised at how close a shave I got... It has been so long since it was new I had forgotten how well it worked when new.  Will replace the heads more frequently in the future.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have always found the quality control of the Philips shaving heads to be of a very high Standing. Made of strong Swedish steel. The HQ9 Heads give you more shaving service, therefore a quicker shave..&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with Amazon Service and follow up. Many Thanks.</li>
            <li> The real, full quality, Norelco parts!</li>
            <li> What a difference these new blades make on my face. I had put off reordering these for a long time.Sorry I waited</li>
            <li> The image listed for this product is misleading as it appears that you are ordering the whole head assembly when in fact, they just send you the 3 individual heads. For me, this worked out OK but I couldn&#x27;t help but thinking about someone who may have perhaps broken the plastic frame and was expecting to get the whole unit.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are pretty good when new, but definitely wear out well before the recommended 1-year replacement time-frame (and I use these at most twice a week, usually less).  With Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save, I decided to get them twice a year.</li>
            <li> Please no printed reviews</li>
            <li> they seem to work fine under stand I am not in the market for a new shaver the one I have works good. I don;t use pre shave</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the replacement heads.  Received them quickly, &amp; immediately installed them in my razor. They give a very close shave with my light beard, with no pulling at all.  Very pleased with the razor &amp; the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get much better than the Norelco brand.  My old ones lasted 6 years.  You read that right - Six. Years.  I just replaced them with the same refill cartridges.</li>
            <li> much less money than buying a new razor, closer and faster to shave. Very easy to replace. I would like to be able to replace the batteries some day.</li>
            <li> You need to replace your shaving heads now and again for optimum performance.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference after replacing my new razor heads.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, and much cheaper than buying a new electric razor. I am a returning customer, and all transactions have been completed smoothly.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how a 3 year old razor shaves like new with new blades.  I should have done this 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> These heads work just fine.  They are simple to install, and they work very well.  I tend to wait too long to replace my shaver heads, so I can really tell the difference in how quickly and closely the new blades shave in comparison to old, worn out ones.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement heads for my Norelco electric razor.  My beard is not that thick and the original heads lasted 6 years.  I will be very happy if the replacement heads have the  same life.</li>
            <li> they are a new set of blades. makes the razor work like new.  I had no problem with the package like others. they are in a blister pack</li>
            <li> Fit my requirements, exact what i was looking for long time, tried to find this prodcut in several sites with no success,&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was fast as well.</li>
            <li> That is right!  yes  i think sooooo!  makes me as happy as I can be while writing this here review that seems too long.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in the local stores around me and the ones I did find were at a much higher price than on Amazon.  Replaced my old blades and I feel like I have a new razor for much cheaper than buying a new one.  I also recommend buying a can of &amp;#34;Shaver Saver&amp;#34; and using it routinely to keep the blades clean and working like new.</li>
            <li> My razor was overdue for new heads.  It shaves much better now that I have replaced them. I got about 3 years out of the old ones (I only shave about 3 or 4 days a week), hope these last as long.</li>
            <li> I Liked the razors a lot. Right out of the box , the razors seemed sharp and ready for a cut.</li>
            <li> The Norelco replacement heads I received fit nicely and serve very well. No more \\&quot;pulling\\&quot;. The old blades served well for three years,which I thought was a long time.</li>
            <li> Just to have on hand. Great shaver</li>
            <li> Very good.  Shaving is much better with these sharp, new blades!</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my electric razor - works like when it was new</li>
            <li> After using another brand electric and a blade razor for a few weeks, I had to go back to my Norelco. It is very quiet, easy to use, and fits hands and face nicely. It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close, but very acceptable.</li>
            <li> Quality shave with my PT 920.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time. After I change it to new heads shaves very smooth. I would recomand this to other.</li>
            <li> Fit and worked great!!  This is about the 8th time I&#x27;ve replaced the heads over ten years of use.</li>
            <li> My husband thinks it is always great</li>
            <li> I have been using my Norelco Electric razor for years.  I get a good shave which is fast and painless.</li>
            <li> for the price, get a new razor</li>
            <li> The new rotary blades are easy to install.  They are high dollar, but work just fine. I was pleasantly surprised with how effective the new blades are.</li>
            <li> Very good Electric razor and blades, used the same brand for years. Great price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades are working like a charm!</li>
            <li> Good, but didn&#x27;t notice that much better cutting ability</li>
            <li> Make the razor like new.  Make sure you pick the right model for your razor.  The wrong ones will not fit</li>
            <li> I am using these in my PT735 as HQ8 replacements and they work perfectly.  A much better shave and a nice upgrade without having a buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased these blades after my 3 year old ones just we&#x27;re not working all that well any more. Improved closeness of shave. For me I would say I need to replace blades ever 2 years to keep the shave close. It should be noted that I do not have heavy facial hair, so your replacement needs could differ.</li>
            <li> Just a replacement for old blades.</li>
            <li> Very good product just like having a new razor. I am vey happy with this purchase will shop amazon for my needed products very simple</li>
            <li> These are factory replacement heads so the will be the same as the ones that came you your razor originally.  To make them last longer I soak them in and run rubbing alcohol very few months.  Gets them much cleaner that water.</li>
            <li> replacement heads same as what was on shaver...easy to replace - work like the original ones . nothing more to relate</li>
            <li> Great product...Was what I ordered.  Received  and installed...Works great..will reorder when I need another set..</li>
            <li> Worked on razor. Was as described.</li>
            <li> Performance picked up when I replaced the heads in my razor.  Phillips recommends buying new heads every year, but I find that too expensive and, quite frankly, unnecessary.  My old heads had 6 years on them before I started to notice a dropoff in shaving efficiency.  When I installed the new heads, performance improved, but not enough to warrant this kind of expenditure every year.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have tried, of any brand.  It worked perfectly from the get go.  I have had no problems with the product and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves an excellent value.  It is built to last and is efficient as it out performs all other products like it.  You wonât regret this purchase.&lt;br /&gt; This product gets top ratings 5âs</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, made a huge difference when I replaced my very old heads.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old shaving head with this. Fits as original &amp; works great.</li>
            <li> replaced older heads on razor. work as good as new.</li>
            <li> Amazingly sharp, my shave time was shortened by 3/4.</li>
            <li> I bought these as my Norelco needed new heads and this was a great price. i thought that I was signing up for a measured shipment of 3 units to be mailed to me 9 months apart, however I got all 3 at the same time and was billed for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice price and great replacement blades, but the program is clunky so I cancelled it. WOuld recommend the product but not the replacement program.</li>
            <li> As recommended by the manual that came with the razor. Easy to install and works like the razor was new. I waited too long to do the replacement because I forgot what it was like new.</li>
            <li> Fits great and so much cheaper than buying locally</li>
            <li> They came on time and were exactly what I had ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Glad to be on the automatic replacement plan. It is great.</li>
            <li> Works and shaves just as well as the original shaving head.</li>
            <li> They work great for my husband&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> they are the only razors I ever use does the job the way I like it it is worth the price to me</li>
            <li> The product is great and I&#x27;ve purchased 7 - 8 of these replacement heads since 2000. 14 years, already!!!  I guess Philips has built a solid shaver product and need to make money some how and thus the current cost of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Keeps me shaved when I decide I want to shave. I don&#x27;t like shaving with razors (sensitive skin) and so I use these.</li>
            <li> My husband had a stroke 2 years ago and this razor has been a big help to him.  Also to be able to get a replacement head so&lt;br /&gt;easily was wonderful.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Recommend you replace the blades at least once a year.  Can really tell the difference in the closeness of the shave.  The order was quickly delivered and correct.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband.  The heads are a better way to go rather than buying a new razor.  I appreciate his nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> As has been mentioned, it is easy to forget how the blades are supposed to cut until you replace them. Definately recommend for anyone who needs to restore their razor.</li>
            <li> As long as you order the right make and model, you should get the right blades and cover you need for your shaver.</li>
            <li> came in as expected and worked like I expected they should work for a new set of replacement heads.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I had this item for over 3 or 5 years and didn&#x27;t know that I could order replacement parts.  I saved a lot of money and it worked really good.  Easy to replace also.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers since 1950, so I still like to change the shaving heads on schedule.&lt;br /&gt;Percy Courville</li>
            <li> They work just fine...A little expensive,but worth it!! I won&#x27;t answer another survey because you want too much.What else can I say about freaking electric razor heads?????</li>
            <li> My razor hadn&#x27;t been doing a very good job at shaving.  I get burn and scratch marks on my neck and have to go over and over certain areas to get a full shave.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was time to buy a new razor but then saw that I could replace the blades on my existing one.  I bought the new blades but I really haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in the shave versus that 3+ year old blades that were on there before.&lt;br /&gt;Not really worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing how much better the new heads were, didn&#x27;t realize how worn out the others were. Great results when shaving.</li>
            <li> Getting a close shave again with my old shaver. Great price and smooth shave to boot!</li>
            <li> Product was perfect replacement, very prompt service.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT  NEW RAZOR... HAD TO RETURN THESE HEADS FOF CREDIT...&lt;br /&gt;RECEIVE CREDIT QUICKLY...THANKS VERY MUCH...&lt;br /&gt;JAY WRIGHT</li>
            <li> The heads last a long time and I recommend you get this kind if it fit you application. The cut is very smooth</li>
            <li> In this age of &#x27;durable goods&#x27; meaning things, even big expensive things, meant to last maybe 3 years, a razor going string at 14+ is a thing of beauty. These replacement heads are the heart of that capability. Like getting a new razor at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> Its good as usual. Fits Canadian model.</li>
            <li> works like a charm. Much cheaper than a totally new shaver. I will buy these as long as the shaver keeps on churning. Nice close shave, no nicking or abrasions.</li>
            <li> def. cheaper than a buying a new razor. fits great. and works great.</li>
            <li> Useful to replace once a year.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I was after for a hard to find item. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great like a new razor now.</li>
            <li> Great price, exact copy of originals.</li>
            <li> Good item - delivered as promised</li>
            <li> I was about to purchase a new shaver when I came across this cheap and reliable option.</li>
            <li> Fit and work ok just dont cut as good as it did when my razor was new. but thats been 5 years ago</li>
            <li> Life long Norelco user.  Getting new heads on Amazon is a big convenience.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement heads for my shaver.</li>
            <li> Works Just the way it should.</li>
            <li> Perfect, and the exact factory  replacement I needed for my Norelco.  The last set I put in had worked find for almost three years, and only needed to be replaced because my dog thought he would be helpful and bring my razor to me one morning so I could shave (not sure why - this was the first time in 14 years he has ever done such a thing).  Unfortunately, his biting down on the razor caused the head to open and the razor fell out of his mouth.  When he picked it up again, he bit down harder, and his teeth pierced two of the rotary heads, rendering them useless.  If these are as well-made as the heads they replaced, it will be years before I need replacements - especially since the other&#x27;s were self-sharpening and were functioning as well as new ones.</li>
            <li> Had the same razor for too many years and when I replace the heads it is like new once more!</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, I bought my husband a new Norelco Sensotouch razor to replace his old razor.  First, the charging stand on the new razor wouldn&#x27;t work, so he ended up using the cord from his old razor to charge the new one.  Then, right after the warranty had expired, the new razor wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.  Fortunately, he still had the old razor.  I ordered these replacement heads, he popped them into the old razor, and it&#x27;s working good as new again!  That&#x27;s what I should have done in the first place!</li>
            <li> Wow, The feeling of new blades is amazing on my face. My face is extra smooth with these new blades.</li>
            <li> OK. I was lucky enough to have a little-used Norelco of the same type. So, I compared the one with these new blades installed to my almost-new shaver. Result: these replacement head blades are inferior to the original blades that come with the shavers. They are a marked improvement over the dull blades they replaced, but don&#x27;t expect a total new shaver feel.</li>
            <li> have used b4 but this unit does not seem to cut as well as in the past</li>
            <li> Great value. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> When purchased, it was sold as a two pack of replacement heads, I received only a one pack.</li>
            <li> The shaver is now working as a shaver should, removing wiskers in half trhe time as did the old heads and blades.  I don&#x27;t tie up the bathroom nearly as long as in the past.  Feels good not to feel the pulling of shaver while shaving.  Wish I had purchased the replacement heads eariler.</li>
            <li> Fit my shaver perfectly. Like having a new one.</li>
            <li> just what i needed at a good price, would be happy to use again. one two three four five six</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to order this product, than going from store to store..</li>
            <li> I used these to replace the heads which were several years old on my Norelco Speed shaver...  Normally, I would just replace the entire razor in order to get fresh batteries and a new motor; however it&#x27;s becoming difficult to find reasonalbly priced Speed-XL shavers.  I was surprised that after several years of everyday use there wasn&#x27;t a great deal of difference with new heads.  That said, Amazon had by far the best price for these heads beating even WalMart by $10!</li>
            <li> I am ordering more replacement heads. I had forgotten how well my razor works since I had not replaced the heads in so long</li>
            <li> Brought back to life an abandoned razor.</li>
            <li> Blades don&#x27;t seem as sharp as they were years ago. Pulled on whiskers more. I have used Norelco razors for at least 25 years and their improvements have been bunk for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> The Norelco replacement heads are original equipment so they shold fit exactly.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I fully expect they will perform very well.</li>
            <li> The razor that was bought following my heart surgery is amazing and the replacement blades are fantastic. I must use this type of shaver as I&#x27;am now on  blood thinners.</li>
            <li> They work, but this time there is an odd noise almost like one of the cutters or the head part above the cutter may have a dent in it. I can&#x27;t eyeball the problem, but I can hear it and feel it while shaving.</li>
            <li> As advertized and expected.</li>
            <li> On time and right part.</li>
            <li> Installation&#x27;s a snap. No reading of instruction required. This is my first replacement after more than three years of usage.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads were exactly what I was looking for.  They arrived quickly, the price was good and they work well.  Would, and probably will, order again.</li>
            <li> As far as replacement heads go these are fine.  They are easy to install when you read the instructions.  I use my electric shaver usually 4 days a week. My only knock is that I don&#x27;t notice that much difference in the shave.  They seem to work better initially but not for very long, maybe a couple months.  I&#x27;ve had them for 6 months now and I think I need new ones already even though their description on Amazon says replace every year for best results.  I also find myself going over the same spot multiple times to get all the hairs, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the blades or the overall razer&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> Received in 2 days. Installed this morning and they felt wonderful. I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old blades had gotten.</li>
            <li> These are the same blades that originally came with my Phillips Norelco 8240 XL shaver. After a year of use, it was time to replace the original blades so I ordered this package and popped in the new set. It took about three or four shaves for the new blades to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; and achieve an optimal cut, but after that, my shaver was shaving like brand new again. This is exactly what you need to restore the cutting performance of your shaver--and certainly cheaper than buying a whole new shaver. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent, shaver is as good as new now &amp; at less than half the cost of a new one. Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> These are a hard to find model in my area. We had been searching for a very long time. The were shipped quickly, and arrived before we thought they would. Altogether pleased.</li>
            <li> These are long lasting and excellent value for money.These are long lasting and excellent value for money.These are long lasting and excellent value for money.</li>
            <li> I had no idea the heads should be replaced and I had been using the originals for nearly 2 years. What a huge difference. Smooth shave without the burn. I&#x27;ve learned a lesson.</li>
            <li> Good as new!  I hope they last as long as the original equipment</li>
            <li> What a great price just about ready to order some more.&lt;br /&gt;Was a super buy. I have two raisers that this item fits and at the price can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Came on time, definitely better shaving ...&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, but really needed since shaving was taking way too long to get close shave.</li>
            <li> WORKED FOR REPASEMENT PARTS WHICH I NEED</li>
            <li> Received quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> If you use a Norelco shaver, you need to replace your heads periodically. These are original replacement heads, and I change them about once a year.</li>
            <li> They work like new ones, which they are.  Installation is the same as removing and cleaning old ones. No problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a regular automatic razor user; I just use the norelco razor in mi travels, holidays or vacations, the experience with this heads have been great</li>
            <li> Good blades which perform very well. They last at least a year or more!</li>
            <li> these blades are great. they give a very close clean shave without the burn. the price is good and I would recommend these for hq9 users.</li>
            <li> After on week using the  replacement heads, I wish I hadn&#x27;t gotten rid of the heads I took out. They were terrible.  They were worse that the ones I had thew away. In a week they were less effective than the year old heads. I could have purchase a new razor for the price of these heads + the replacements I had to go to the store and get. Never again.</li>
            <li> I have a Philips shaver from 15 years ago which is amazing that it is still working!! Bought these replacement heads and my shaver is like new again!</li>
            <li> It says to replace heads once a year. I went three on these. Not a bad price too. Works grate.</li>
            <li> Need to replace these things more often and would not be able to do that at brick &amp; mortar prices. Back to the shave I knew.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased, Thanks</li>
            <li> Does what it says :) very satisfied, no complaints (just trying to fill the words requirement for the review) :)</li>
            <li> Sharpest blades ever!</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews of this product, I was skeptical about buying it.&lt;br /&gt;However, on Amazon.com I was able to find a great price, so even if it wasn&#x27;t the best, the price was right and I wouldn&#x27;t be out a lot of money.  These HQ-9 heads came in an original Norelco box, and after installing them, I had noticed a big difference from the old blades.  My old HQ-9 heads were about six years old, and started pulling and pinching.  Original quality blades . . .  no problems.  I recommend them.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to change the shaver heads. As soon as I started to shave , it was wonderfull. Great experience with amazon.</li>
            <li> These replacement cutters should be replaced every six months or so to keep the razor&#x27;s original shaving efficiency. They are the genuine Philips product - I have never had a problem with any of these. I recommend keeping at least one spare on hand in case of accidental damage to the heads in the razor. My attempts to sharpen existing heads have not been very successful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for many years now. The batteries still charge perfectly and I only seem to need to replace the blades every couple of year.</li>
            <li> Nothing special here. I needed new cutting blades for my electric razor. I picked this vendor because the price was right and the customer satisfaction score was high. The product was received in a timely matter and put directly to use. No problems.</li>
            <li> the replacement blades work well.  they were easy to install and Gabriel is using the shaver now with the new blades.  They seem to be what is needed to make the shaver operate like new again.</li>
            <li> Good blades, bad price.</li>
            <li> They work great in my older Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> Every time I replace the head on my shaver its a brand new shaver again. The Norelco has lasted for many year and I change heads about every 18 months. The recent purchase through Amazon was very pleasing - good price and rapid service.</li>
            <li> after having the electric shaver used for some years I needed the replacement Heads&lt;br /&gt;now the shaver works like a new one</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 1+ year old razor. When new, you could hardly feel the razor on your face as it glided over and removed hair rapidly. Smoothest shave ever! I was expecting a return to this, but the new blades were not much better than the ones that I disposed of. I thought that buy buying from the manufacturer I would be getting a quality replacement, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> This is my third cordless shaver and the best one so far. I only hope that the blades last for a long time also.</li>
            <li> It works great and was delivered very quickly. I would definitely order this again if I needed it. It was the best price.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads at the best price.  Need more be said?</li>
            <li> easy to replace and performs as good as the new shaver.</li>
            <li> This is what I needed for a close shave!!!</li>
            <li> makes the razor just like new</li>
            <li> New blades make your Norelco feel like a New Norelco! easily replaced. Dont toss your razor, buy new blades!</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviews state, you will notice an improvement in the quality of your shave and decrease in shaving time once you replace the blades, IF you need new blades. That being said, I don&#x27;t agree that you need to change it every year. If it was cheaper, perhaps you could make a better case. I hadn&#x27;t changed mine in years.</li>
            <li> The heads worked well</li>
            <li> Only one comment. Only the replacement heads were received but the box and the figure show the frame. I suggest to change the presentation to avoid confusion. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The price for the head is ok but the transport is too expensive 15.00$&lt;br /&gt;I am sure you can put this item in a smaller bag, not in a big box&lt;br /&gt; a stamp  can make the job</li>
            <li> It worked as I expected. SO far so good.</li>
            <li> Factory replacement heads at a price considerably better than at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Feels like new again!</li>
            <li> It is what it is... And it works.</li>
            <li> I got these because my razor was not cutting well.&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that the plastic drive gear that turns the cutter had worn so the new heads didn&#x27;t help much.&lt;br /&gt;I have been unable to find a replacement drive gear anywhere in the world.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise they would have probably worked great.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t seem much better than the old ones, maybe its me.</li>
            <li> I did not realize just haw bad my blades were until I replaced them. Wow what a difference. Next time I wont wait 10 years for new blades.</li>
            <li> Quick, simple and relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Reasonable price, arrived on time and worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> perfect replacement fit, new blades make the 6 year old razor cut like new.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just need to try something else, but I am less and less satisfied with the shave that I get from my SpeedXL.  I just replaced the blades and the shave has improved, but I&#x27;m thinking of going back to blade to see if my impressions are just romanticizing my past use of a razor.  I never really feel like this leaves me completely shaved.  Could be I&#x27;m just too picky.</li>
            <li> Works just like the original.  Good value.</li>
            <li> The photo of this product is very much misleading.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting the complete plastic holding head as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li> This was a generic brand. I thought it was original. Very disappointed not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> My husband is always very happy with the quality of  the replacements  through Amazon  . First quality and comes quickly when needed .</li>
            <li> Works perfect.  Searched every store without success.  Should have looked on Amazon first.</li>
            <li> Ah, Clean shaves gain.....</li>
            <li> Replacement heads work great</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my Norelco 9160XL Razor.</li>
            <li> As described, easy to install and good shave.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and delivered very quickly which In greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> On time and high quality</li>
            <li> works well in my electric razor.</li>
            <li> The heads are easily replaced, and for a thrifty price, you have a virtually new electric shaver.</li>
            <li> A drop in replacement for the existing blades in my Norelco shaver.  It took about 30 seconds to swap them out and now my razor does a much better job of shaving.</li>
            <li> This is something I order about once a year.</li>
            <li> It worked very well, just like others I bought in the past did. I am pleased and I will keep buying them.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement, work great.  I have had these on my razor for over a year and they do a very good job.</li>
            <li> These replacements heads are excellent, once again, they are not cheap. Almost half the cost of the shaver.</li>
            <li> Better than buying a new shaver</li>
            <li> My husband has been to Wal-green&#x27;s,CVS, Wal-mart and could not find the HQ9 Replacement Heads! I thought why not look on amazon and not much to my surprise they had it,thanks amazon for saving us from having to buy another electric razor :) Of course he received his replacement in 4 day&#x27;s,he was very HAPPY on how fast they got here...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a bad experience with amazon only good!!!! Keep up the good work....</li>
            <li> Good replacement for original heads.</li>
            <li> I use my electric shaver about 90% of the time and a blade the rest.  While nowhere near as close as a blade shave, the electric does a fast and very decent job, especially for touch-ups before an evening out.  I replace the electric blades whenever I think to do so, probably about every 3 years or so and usually go through a couple of sets before the shaver itself no longer holds a charge.  For me, the shaves after head replacements are noticeably closer, easier, and faster.  And that was the case with my most recent set as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty good about emptying my shaver of clippings frequently, and I use the suction hose of a vacuum to really get the shaver clean.  If you do this, be very careful of the heads themselves and their plastic retainer plate; a strong suction and they&#x27;re gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s: exact fit, easily replaced, shaving experience much improved for me&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s: none</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize how much of a difference it makes until you put in new ones.</li>
            <li> have to go over area several time.  But for the $$$ good.  Better than the $200 shaver that does not give any results.  Good to shave in car.  But if you have the time the blade is much better.</li>
            <li> Fits just like the original and shaves fine.</li>
            <li> I had not replaced my blades since I bought the razor a couple of years ago.  The replacement head made a big difference; I got a closer shave for sure.</li>
            <li> What can I say, they were deliverd fast and they are OEM and made my razor like new again. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Returned the product. It was ordered in error.</li>
            <li> No problems,  easy to install and simply works.  Price was much more preferable to buying a new Norelco speed xl shaver .</li>
            <li> When these are new, they cut nicely, and I can shave quickly.  After about 18 months of daily use on my face, it takes 3 times as long to get the same close shave.  I replace them every 18 months.  I&#x27;ve bought 4 sets of these now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They feel fairly comfortable (don&#x27;t cut my face like some cheaper electric razors do).&lt;br /&gt;If they lasted longer, I&#x27;d give them 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Works well - will buy again. Superfast delivery!</li>
            <li> picked up a razor at a garage sale for $5.00, invested in these blades and a cord - the thing works great.</li>
            <li> New Blades were GREAT. Don&#x27;t suffer with razor pulling out your hair, Buy new blades. This is the best thing I did.</li>
            <li> I purchased for 2 different razors and both work like a new razor. Very happy with the purchase and certainly less expensive than purchasing a whole new electric razor.</li>
            <li> Easy order, easy to fit, my razor works like it is brand new.</li>
            <li> Every time I think I need to buy a new razor I remember, &amp;#34;Oh, yeah, I haven&#x27;t replaced the heads (blades) in a while.&amp;#34; I just need to set a reminder to replace them yearly, because when I installed these I was back to a close shave with my Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and last a year in my Norelco Shaver.  It is better than buying a new shaver to replace the blades.</li>
            <li> They last forever. This is the second set for my Norelco.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much better a fresh blade works and the autoship program keeps you from forgetting to change regularly.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and it is a good product.</li>
            <li> The Replacement Heads is just OK. It improves the effectiveness only 30% not even hit 90%. I think it depends where manufacturer, packed and stamped.</li>
            <li> These heads are an exact fit and work good.  I have used these for a few months now and so far they cut well.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  it did excetly what it suppose to do and it was deleiverd on time.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works properly. However, you can periodically purchase a new kit from Costco for $70.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly and works great. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15</li>
            <li> This item was just as described in the ad and arrived on time. It is nice to get a Great Deal.</li>
            <li> Ordered HQ9 heads, received HQ56 heads.  The bar code sticker shows HQ9, wrong box.  Too late to return.  Will never purchase online again.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these.  They last about a year. It&#x27;s so much better than buying the razors on an annual basis.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work fine - nothing special; shave reasonably well and they are easy to replace in my old razor.</li>
            <li> Came as advertised, it works as planned. There is no other option for this razor. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> These heads worked great and my Norelco Razor is almost like brand new. Rather than buying a new razor made it a easy decison</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my favorite shaver and came across this HQ9 replacement heads.  My shaver works like new again!!</li>
            <li> It made my raseor as brand new. It came on time and was easy to install. But before buying this, make sure that your old ones are clean. Because if they are not, they don&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li> These are just what my rechargeable shaver needed. Sharp blades. I would recommend them. They give a nice even close shave.</li>
            <li> Now with this replacement heads my Norelco will cut the facial hair in stead of pulling them out with the more than used heads. Best shave again.</li>
            <li> If your skin has red trails left after shaving, it&#x27;s time to replace your shaving heads.  Don&#x27;t mix up head parts while cleaning them or hit/bump shaving heads on anything and they should last way more then a year.&lt;br /&gt;I got my new heads &amp; so glade to have a new set again!  Fast shipping from this company &amp; great price was nice.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, good price. Will order again from same firm.</li>
            <li> Changing the blades every year renews the performance of the razor.  It cuts closer and faster.  You don&#x27;t notice over time that it takes longer to shave.  Buying from Amazon is easy and cheaper than local prices.</li>
            <li> I wholeheartedly recommend these replacement heads to anyone interested in a quick, satisfying shave.  My only gripe was with the manufacturers nearly impenetrable packaging.</li>
            <li> Quality replacement. No problem installing as it is OEM. ---Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco -----Philips Norelco product.</li>
            <li> First time I used these in my razor it was like having a new razor again. I am very happy with this buy.</li>
            <li> Razor now shaves like new for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> If time were money these will shortly pay for themselves.  Reduced shaving time dramatically.  Wish I had ordered sooner</li>
            <li> This component fitted and worked perfectly and gave my Norelco electric razor new life. It was well worth the money spent. H</li>
            <li> Works like new again. Shaver is 12 years old.</li>
            <li> It is a good replacement part for my shaver fits perfectly and great goals</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipment!</li>
            <li> Just like they say they are. Saved $$$$.</li>
            <li> Razor works like new!</li>
            <li> Delivered sooner than expected at a fair price</li>
            <li> My razor is just like new again, what a difference!</li>
            <li> our order was correct...heads fit and replacement was easy.</li>
            <li> It confused me with the picture.  I thought I will get the whole head like the picture shows.  But actually I only got three small cutting heads.</li>
            <li> Great price for replacement heads</li>
            <li> this is the 2nd time i ordered this item--tk&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I used HQ8, but HQ9 fits well my Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;But, It doesn&#x27;t cut my Beard well :(</li>
            <li> Shaver is now better than new</li>
            <li> No electric shaver can provide a perfectly clean shaven face like the snowplow method (razor and shaving cream) can do. However, for loose skin like mine, this is the best on the market for me ... and no more cutting of the face by the blade.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these replacement heads for my Philips Norelco Model 8240XL, after having previously purchased them on Amazon just shy of two years ago. That previous set endured daily use on my semi-heavy facial hair growth. I use my electric razor as a preshaver to remove my longer facial hair down to the stubble so that I can then obtain a completely smooth shave with a manual 4-blade razor. This method works for me, at least, and results in much less irritation because there is then far less chance of me catching or tugging the longer hairs with my manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, whenever I have had to replace these heads, it has has been because a tiny blade of one of the cutters has broken off which subsequently prevents that damaged cutter, as well as the other undamaged two, from spinning. Unless you happen to have a spare set of these new replacement heads on hand or perhaps even a single leftover one from previous set, this can be problematic, since your razor will be rendered inoperable. Prior to receiving my most recent set of replacement heads, however, I was able to work around this issue by simply removing both the damaged cutter and its screen from the shaver so that the other two could still spin and be used (trying to avoid the open hole left by the removed cutter and screen, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelo recommends replacing these heads once per year to obtain the best possible shave but I have typically been able to use them for twice that amount of time without much noticeable difference in shave quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only given these replacement heads three stars because I personally wish that they could provide me with a much closer and smoother shave without having to use it in conjunction with a manual razor. Also, the cost of these heads seems borderline outrageous when you consider what you are actually getting for the price. I&#x27;m particularly astonished that they have increased 30% in price, since the last time Ipurchased them exactly two years ago in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (1/1/2015): I have now decided to stop purchasing these HQ9 replacement heads for my Philips Norelco Model 8240XL because the price for such continues to escalate astronomically. After some online research, I have learned that the [[ASIN:B000068PBT Philips Norelco HQ8 Dual Precision Replacement Heads]]replacement heads will also actually work on my older shaver, despite that fact not being indicated by the manufacturer. The HQ8 heads provide identical (if not better!) shaving results at a more than one-half the cost of the HQ9 heads, at this point. Shavers have become like computer printers. It&#x27;s not the cost of the printer itself that gets you but the total cost of use over time when you look at purchasing the pricey printer toner (i.e., consumable supply).</li>
            <li> This is an old, but good. Norelco electric razor into which these replacement heads fit, Fits is what Norelco&#x27;s Store gave me each time I reordered, that is a smooth procedure now with Amazon</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to avoid spending over $100 on a new razor, buy these. They&#x27;re exactly the right replacements and work the way that they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> New heads in my husband&#x27;s razor helped a lot. It now works like it is supposed to. Thank you very much</li>
            <li> got  the new heads for my electric razor for 1/4 of the price of buying a new razor--same result--closer shave --good comfort</li>
            <li> Local store didn&#x27;t have the right set in stock, Amazon did and with a better price.  I am always surprised by how much better new blades shave.</li>
            <li> I had never replaces the blades in my unit since I&#x27;ve had it, almost 5 years. Just never crossed my mind. Huge difference and much closer, cleaner shave now!</li>
            <li> The new heads brought the shaver back to like new cutting action. Looks like once a year replacement is a good idea</li>
            <li> Title says it all. The price of the heads seems high compared to an entire new shaving unit.  I would definately consider cost if replacement heads when comparing models and brands of shaving units.</li>
            <li> If you live in the world of razors and care about them in detail and their &#x27;known&#x27; names you will know that a &#x27;Head&#x27; to Norelco/Philips is really the three blade units in what most I have asked would refer to as the head. Not to quibble over semantics but the price is quite extravagant for such a meager product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just received them today and even though listed as &#x27;Prime&#x27; received them in seven days (4 business days) in USPS and the packaging was a thin packaging envelope which was promptly destroyed by every USPS handler between the shipping point and my mail box. The flimsy retail package inside was crushed and soft offering virtually no protection. The blades or heads or whatever are packaged in firm plastic so perhaps they will be OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike what others have commented (I should have read the negatives before I purchased)the whatever they are inside the package look like the picture on the outside of the retail container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they are anything other than a true replacement I will add to this comment. Suffice it to say that I personally am disappointed with Norelco for taking extravagant profits on this replacement trio. Next time I think it might be cheaper to buy a low cost razor instead of a $100 razor and just throw it away when the cutting part(s) is/are worn out. If there is nothing further in this comment it meant that the blades are fine and I will raise the rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVISED - In followup to the previous comment, these replacements are actually quite nice and produce an excellent shave.  The inner package protected the shaving components so they were not damaged by USPS. The change-out was easy and there are no complaints about anything other than the price (which I happened to catch on the low end of the robot pricing) but is still too high for what you get; but what can you do? Raised rating to 4 stars not five because of semi-deceptive advertising and excessive price...not product quality.</li>
            <li> It contained three heads and three blades. It&#x27;s a little bit expensive (I got it at about 25 dollars), but works fine.</li>
            <li> good service good product</li>
            <li> I was ready to toss my shaver out, because my blades were worn out. It&#x27;s going on six years, now. But then I decided to do a search for some replacement heads and viola! So for under $36 dollars, I am getting a good shave again. And to think I was about to spend over $100 for another electric razor. Saving nearly $70 makes good sense.</li>
            <li> Perfect, exactly what I need!</li>
            <li> new heads made my old razor new again. easy to install.</li>
            <li> got these for father in law haven&#x27;t heard any complaints so must be okay</li>
            <li> Work like the original</li>
            <li> These last pretty long. I&#x27;ve had my shaver for about 10 years and I&#x27;m still on head-set #2. These will be #3 when I need &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> Good product easy to install. Work as advertise.</li>
            <li> Great price and they work great.</li>
            <li> They work just like the originals.  No problems.</li>
            <li> Good name-brand product, quick delivery. what more can you expect.</li>
            <li> I have been using old razor heads for 5 years (almost everyday shave) but did not notice a significant improvement in shaving. Already using it for about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;First impression was that it cuts hair more easily but still can not feel any difference or improvement in shaving time. Overall feeling is better but would not say it is worth the money paid unless your old heads work well.</li>
            <li> Fit my model and works fine</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how trashed my old heads were until I replaced it. The originals lasted a year, expect these to do the same. I am getting a very clean shave 3-5x a week and the replacement head costs about what 6 months of Fusion Power blades would cost.</li>
            <li> STANDARD UNIT--NOT MUCH CHANGE IN PRICE WHEN ADDING SHIPPING COST, BUT CONVENIENT TO ORDER.&lt;br /&gt;WILL ORDER AGAIN NEXT YEAR IF I DONT REPLACE THE WHOLE UNIT</li>
            <li> arrived promptly&lt;br /&gt;bought these to replace ones I lost&lt;br /&gt;works as advertised&lt;br /&gt;never seem to wear out&lt;br /&gt;not much to say their blades</li>
            <li> Turned my old Norelco into new that felt newly brought.</li>
            <li> As advertised, delivered on time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not any different than the one that was on the razor when I purchased it which is great. Better than buying an wntirely new razor. Glad that I did it.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and has worked just fine. I would recommend to anyone. The blades are sharp and the powder is all that I will use.</li>
            <li> Philips knows they are the only game in town and you have no choise but to buy, for that reason i would never buy a NORELCO</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, Buy with confidence. No problems, works great, (I wrote this review after having it about 15 months)</li>
            <li> Made my razor as a good as new</li>
            <li> Would you expect anything less from Phillips Norelco when you have to use their heads for their razor.</li>
            <li> Does good job cutting just to expensive</li>
            <li> Fits razor and works great.</li>
            <li> Fits my Norelco razor and items were as described, very satisfied</li>
            <li> Just received them at a very good price!</li>
            <li> As advertised, the real thing at a good price and Wal-Mart didn&#x27;t carry it.&lt;br /&gt;What more could one want!</li>
            <li> The replacement blades make the razor shave like it is new again. Excellent product.  Only challenge is the packaging. The blades are so secure in the plastic casing, it takes quite an effort to open the package.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.  This has been apparently an issue with all Philips Norelco replacement heads lately.  They tug and do not cut anywhere close to the original heads.  You are better off buying a new shaver.  Even the cheapest new Norelco model cuts better than the most expensive replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Good replacement heads for my razor.  Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Being five years old, with new heads, the shaver performed as when it was new. Will definitely buy new heads every year or so instead of buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> replacement heads were shipped in no time at all and it was what we wanted</li>
            <li> Yes, it was what I needed and was original equipment.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find these in local stores. Good value, original parts that need to be regularly replaced.</li>
            <li> The heads go in easily and the shave is close. Very happy although I wish they lasted more than a year.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.  The shaving heads work wonderfully and give a real close shave.  Would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed, didn&#x27;t know my shaver could be rebuilt with these Replacement Heads. Works like new now.</li>
            <li> Works as is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described and what I ordered, however I am surprised at h expensive these parts are; it is approximately half the cost of replacing the shaver all together.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for a razor.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Service was timely and product superb.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> THESE NEW HEADS WORK GREAT IN MY RAZOR.  THEY DO NEED REPLACING EVERY YEAR.  GETTING A BETTER SHAVE NOW.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper from Amazon than purchasing at local mega-store. The new blades shave much closer than the one-year old one did.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!  Made my Norelco feel like a new razor.  Wish I&#x27;d purchased long before this.  Much better price than Walgreen&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never replaced my rotary blades in the 8 years I&#x27;ve owned my razor. Thought it was about time I did as all that was happening was the razor was pulling hair out of my face instead of a clean cut. Once I put in the new blades that came quick and just like you&#x27;d find in a store, well i was all laughs and smiles to see how much of a difference they made! I now get fast and close shaves in half the time! I&#x27;ll be doing this once a year from now on :)</li>
            <li> Perfeft replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement.</li>
            <li> The new head made my old razor like new.</li>
            <li> Made a new razor out of my old one.. Great price</li>
            <li> completely satisfied as I have alwys been with the heads. I have owned a norelco shaver for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> A noticeable difference by using these blades to replace blades that were a year old. Easily installed by following diections. Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> Considering the cost of new electric razors, the opportunity to take your old razor and make it like new is very appealing. The HQ9 Speed XL Replacement Heads, which fit my razor come complete with new heads and new cutting blades. The installation is very quick and easy and for less than $30.00 I was able to take my two year old Norelco razor and make it shave like it was brand new. Just make sure you match up the model number of your razor to the right replacement set.</li>
            <li> These worked great on my Norelco triple header shaver. Fresh refills make my razor work like it&#x27;s new again.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were an exact fit for the shaver.  We saved money and didn&#x27;t have to go hunting for the right ones at the store.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement heads</li>
            <li> Like having a brand new norelco.  Only wish I had followed mfg. recommendation to replace the HQ9 heads annually.  Certainly will purchase again.  Best thing you can do to revitalize your razor.</li>
            <li> PRO - New heads work like new, easy to replace.  I waited too long to replace but am very satisfied&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON - A bit pricey</li>
            <li> I bought the razor that uses this head a couple years ago. I tend to go long on usage, not replace every six months. This unit is supposedly faster than previous designs. Some of the holes are round while others are rectangular like the older designs. I suspect the all-rectangle design actually removes more faster. But if you&#x27;re looking at this as a replacement head, you&#x27;re probably already stuck with the design. It&#x27;s as good as the original.</li>
            <li> I am still using these to maintain my SpeedXL electric razor. They typically only last me about 6-8 months but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t clean them as often or as well as I should. I just rinse them out once every two weeks with hot water and once every couple months or less clean them with a brush. If your face gets dirt on it and you do not get all of it off before using, as happens to me because of my line of work, you will quickly damage the comb. I just like how this razor, which I&#x27;ve had since 2007, does not irritate my skin and gets a good shave as long as you keep the blades relatively clean.</li>
            <li> made in the netherlands and is superior to former Chinese made products..&lt;br /&gt;proper product for  older Norelco shavers!!! like new!!! worth money!!!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what we ordered and arrived in time frame pleased with product and would order again.  No problem putting the heads on razor</li>
            <li> After using these replacements for a month, I&#x27;m still very pleased with them.  I get a very close shave, and it&#x27;s certainly faster than with the old blades that had become dull.  It&#x27;s been a long time since I used lift and cut blades, so I&#x27;m not sure if these are faster or slower than those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to give a shout out to Surrational for his comment about not applying too much pressure when shaving with these.  He&#x27;s exactly right.  Don&#x27;t push hard against the skin.  In fact, don&#x27;t really push at all.  Just run the blades lightly over your face and they&#x27;ll cut very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING NORELCO RAZORS FOR OVER 40 YEARS! THE REGULAR PRICE FOR NORELCO REPLACEMENT HEADS ARE WAY TOO HIGH FOR ME! AMAZON TOOK CARE OF THAT PROBLEM EXTREMELY WELL THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED NORELCO REPLACEMENT HEADS FROM AMAZON!</li>
            <li> Worked very well at first but thought it would stay sharp longer than it did.  Only use it sparingly now.</li>
            <li> Is it just me or do the replacement heads never seem to last as long as the original equipment..? Yet as soon as your shaving experience starts taking twice as long, grab a new set of heads. My only problem is that they are rather pricey, and I would change them more often if I could find them at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Product as described.</li>
            <li> I was concern about the quality at first. I picked up a replacement set at a national pharmacy that starts with &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; and I got a bad set. Nothing will ruin your day like a bad shave. I have purchased from Amazon a few times and these are the real deal. Close and comfortable. In addition, they are easy to clean. You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Replacement heads fitted perfectly into the Shaver; works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much better the razor shaves with new blades, enough said... Received promptly as described. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good product for an old razor.. Not quite good as new, but it will do for now. Met my expectations.</li>
            <li> These heads do the job. Much cheaper than buying a complete new razor.</li>
            <li> PERFECT fit and BEST price!</li>
            <li> It fits and works perfectly, as anticipated.  I&#x27;ve had this shaver for many years and take it with me on vacations.</li>
            <li> To be fair, my husbands shaver head was way old.  Looked around a few places, but botta bing.  Here we are, exactly right one, delivered promptly, no problems</li>
            <li> Excellent. Worked fine.</li>
            <li> It was badly needed, came quickly, and relieved shaving problems I had been encountering. It&#x27;s recommended not to wait too long to replace as I did.</li>
            <li> They work, I can shave :).</li>
            <li> Although my Norelco model called for HQ8, the HQ9 fits just as well and the extra combs in the heads give a much closer shave. Tried the recommended HQ8 replacements one month prior and was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use with my razor.  As expected, these fit perfectly into the razor and are sharper than the ones I had in my razor for a couple of years.  It gives a decent shave.</li>
            <li> Have used this Norelco razor for many years. The cutter headsneed to be replaced annualy.</li>
            <li> This is my third set of Norelco Heads for my shaver.  I wish that they would cut just a bit closer.  They are very smooth and they never nip the corner of my lips while shaving. I had Norelco shavers since the 1960&#x27;s with great success.  However, since buying a Panasonic shaver, I find myself using both razors---the Norelco for the first cut and the Panasonic for the final cut.</li>
            <li> They were easy to put in, and worked fine....very glad we found them....was about to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for several years now. Don&#x27;t know that you need to replace these every year and am now still using old heads as a test.</li>
            <li> It work was replacing my 8 year old heads</li>
            <li> OE parts . Work just as well as the originals that came with the razor .</li>
            <li> Everyone knows that with ink jet printers, they make the price low and then screw you on the price of ink.Same with shaver heads. Yes, new heads make the shaver work like new. But at the price they are charging, it almost makes more sense to buy a brand-new electric razor. Bad for the environment, wasteful, and bad for the wallet.</li>
            <li> My husband has his Philips shaver since 7 years ago and he use the replacements after few years. The machine works like the very first day.</li>
            <li> these are a perfect fit for the razor and price is very reasonable. would recommend these to anyone that needs replacement heads</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I ordered and it fit perfectly in my husbands shaver.  It was just what he needed for a good shave</li>
            <li> Great perfect fit :-)</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years now and have never been disappointed.  These are great and long lasting products.,</li>
            <li> It was fast and accurate.  Have several norelco razors this gave me a renewal on one whic we use to shave my son who has autism., The proce made it efficient to repair rather than buy new</li>
