            <li>Excellent for in between time.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for me!</li>
            <li>This is awesome product and made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>I love it!!!!</li>
            <li>I had bought this but to me it doesn&#x27;t work very good.</li>
            <li>Worked great and the price was perfect.  </li>
            <li>this worked great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for when the roots start showing as well.  </li>
            <li>But it smells good..</li>
            <li>The texture isn&#x27;t good at all, you can see that it&#x27;s on the hair.</li>
            <li>I would ignore all good reviews on Amazon for this product.</li>
            <li>My daughter was very satisfied with that.</li>
            <li>A nice way to maintain your hair roots in between salon&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product more than lives up to its expectations.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this</li>
            <li>This is much better than the brush color touch ups.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite and will buy again and again.</li>
            <li>it is was as i want and more thank you ..  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite things.</li>
            <li>I could tell I liked the product, though, so I ordered Black and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Perfect to cover gray hairs in between color time, tried other product didn&#x27;t work that</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It does just what it claims to do, is easy and stays in place.  </li>
            <li>So why a deal breaker, because the smell lingers in your hair;  so the money spent on nice great smelling shampoo is out the window.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I then immediately ran a fine comb thru all the roots to distribute it evenly.  </li>
            <li>I love it very much!</li>
            <li>You can apply as light or as dar.</li>
            <li>and it was too light.</li>
            <li>It is like rubbing your hair with smooth rock and no color.  </li>
            <li>great for in between hair dyes - especially on the sides.</li>
            <li>l happy with purchase and will continue using it in the future!</li>
            <li>The best method I came up with was to use a makeup spunge or any small sponge, and dab it on the areas.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes that hurts, specially when the graying hair is in the temple area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for when you&#x27;re just starting to get those first gray hairs.  </li>
            <li>She is pregnant and can&#x27;t dye her hair for now</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and in the exact places  I want it to be.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth what you pay for it.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and such an inexpensive fix!</li>
            <li>I got a more expensive one, and this, liked this better.  </li>
            <li>I used a light towel not thinking, but I really didn&#x27;t see much discoloring of it.  </li>
            <li>If you have naturally straight hair you will find this crayon useful.</li>
            <li>Yes, it has an odor when you first put it on</li>
            <li>, this is going to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I just ran it under the hot tap and then applied it.</li>
            <li>This product is easy enough to use and covers as well as those costing twice as much</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I was very eager to try this product based on the reviews it received</li>
            <li>Very  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t color my hair as much.</li>
            <li>What a great way to touch up grey roots without all the mess.</li>
            <li>Better than other products.  </li>
            <li>Love this thing, I have natuarlly blonde hair and dye it black, and on one side of my head, I have it shaved, well as you can imagine, the black dye doesnt last long on that shoet hair, this things work perfect for not just that side when it gets lighter but my roots too- super easy, has a litte odd smell, but just at first, I dont notice after about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>does exactly what I wanted, gets me bween colorings , if I am too busy to do it on time.</li>
            <li>What is cool is that I can wash my hair and put this product on the grays - and it stays on until I wash it 10 days later.</li>
            <li>Anyway,  it is better to buy waterproof masker and cover your greys, don&#x27;t waste the time and money.</li>
            <li>Actually, it may be really  good for my hair because if I color less, it may help the quality overall.</li>
            <li>But I still usually color every 4 weeks:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, just dampen it a little and cover up.  </li>
            <li>It is light and doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair.  </li>
            <li>but, it just wouldn&#x27;t color my hair, my fingers on the other hand were nice and black.</li>
            <li>Tomorrow is Mother&#x27;s Day, and I am invited to a party unexpectedly, but my hair appointment is not until next Wednesday for my real professionl color.  </li>
            <li>It is really a product that I will re-order when necessary.  </li>
            <li>but it smells like old man cologne.  </li>
            <li>This is a complete joke of a product and Amazon should consider taking this off their website.</li>
            <li>it is true that your hair will adjust and produce less oil.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and guys me a few extra days before having to dye my hair.</li>
            <li>Conceals the white and doesn&#x27;t come off after it dries, would highly recommend it as a temporary fix for white hair.</li>
            <li>get tip wet, and gently rub on roots, ...</li>
            <li>Nice for people who are on a budget or way to busy for regular touch ups at expensive salons.</li>
            <li>Also, this one stick is going to last me forever - I can&#x27;t remember when I bought it - months ago - and I can barely tell I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m black, my hair is chemically straightened, my roots aren&#x27;t the problem just a couple very noticeable strands, I tried to apply the product</li>
            <li>died hair with a few large blonde streaks and when my roots show up, they show up!!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> this little stick has helped me look decent for outing and photos with the baby.</li>
            <li> At first it was too waxy sort of, then it was too hard.</li>
            <li> Covers the grey if u don&#x27;t mind drawing on your scalp.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t flatiron or blow dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> I used it every day on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Too dry and smelly product.</li>
            <li> I have medium neutral (not golden or red) hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Plush Brown (not much choice in store and the Chocolate looked definitely too dark.)  </li>
            <li> You have to wet the crayon then apply it to your hair.  </li>
            <li> It is drying now, and the color did actually cover the gray (I&#x27;m shocked) and it is blending very well with my hair overall.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of touch-ups in the past to help me get through the last week or two between coloring.</li>
            <li> It had a strange smell, appear used, was dried out and did not color my white hairs at all no matter how hard I rubbed the stick on the hair.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and my gray hair shows when it grows in.  </li>
            <li> This product is not very smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> I have bsically gray hair with a bit of black in it.  </li>
            <li> I have jet black</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown hair, ordered the dark brown</li>
            <li> For a new look I randomly apply the black color to my hair then disperse it by dong a comb through.  </li>
            <li> A few little swipes of this down my part</li>
            <li> and it is hard to apply even with wet hair.</li>
            <li> Caution, can be a bit messy if you&#x27;re a head scratcher.</li>
            <li> It did drip all over the place and was messy.  </li>
            <li> I tried this a few times</li>
            <li> The stick is all dried up and does not provide any coloring at all.  </li>
            <li> It is stick, so it is not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This is bad if you have curly hair and trying to wear it straight.  </li>
            <li> It is pointless to buy it.</li>
            <li> Have to press really hard on the scalp for the color to get transferred to the hair.</li>
            <li> It has taken me almost a year, but I have slowly extended the time between washings to 10 days -</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the seller and or producer  ever tried it and why they sell such a bad stuff.</li>
            <li> Last year, my beautician told me that washing my hair every day was really, really, bad for my hair</li>
            <li> The effect is dramatic.</li>
            <li> this product does the job without looking fake.</li>
            <li> It smears and it looks fake as heck on the hair.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed, this didn&#x27;t work for me, this product is a waste of time from my experience.</li>
            <li> so I could wash it out if it looked really bad for some reason.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what it smells like (which isn&#x27;t that bad).  </li>
            <li> but, I was very disappointed when it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> but it was awful.</li>
            <li> Terrible product!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product is not very smooth to apply. It will be also easier to apply if it was made into lipstic form. This way you don&#x27;t get color on your fingers.</li>
            <li> This product more than lives up to its expectations.  I am extremely pleased with this and it works as advertised.  It is really a product that I will re-order when necessary.  My hairdresser loves it and will recommend it to her customers.</li>
            <li> messy and the smell is a to loud and masculine to me.</li>
            <li> Works like a water craylola on gray hair. You can apply as light or as dar. Easy to use. I really like it.</li>
            <li> What a great way to touch up grey roots without all the mess. A nice way to maintain your hair roots in between salon&lt;br /&gt;visits. Nice for people who are on a budget or way to busy for regular touch ups at expensive salons. Definitely worth&lt;br /&gt;a try to see if you like it!</li>
            <li> It is stick, so it is not easy to use.  For me, I do not like it, but you can try.</li>
            <li> I got a more expensive one, and this, liked this better.  get tip wet, and gently rub on roots, ...does exactly what I wanted, gets me bween colorings , if I am too busy to do it on time.

            <li> Covers the grey if u don&#x27;t mind drawing on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot and so does my daughter who&#x27;s been dying her hair for that goth look.  It does just what it claims to do, is easy and stays in place.  It&#x27;s great for when you&#x27;re just starting to get those first gray hairs.  It&#x27;s easy to use, just dampen it a little and cover up.  It&#x27;s good for when the roots start showing as well.  My daughter was very satisfied with that.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and guys me a few extra days before having to dye my hair. Caution, can be a bit messy if you&#x27;re a head scratcher.</li>
            <li> You have to wet the crayon then apply it to your hair.  This is bad if you have curly hair and trying to wear it straight.  You can&#x27;t flatiron or blow dry your hair.  The color will come off.  If you have naturally straight hair you will find this crayon useful.</li>
            <li> Have to press really hard on the scalp for the color to get transferred to the hair. Sometimes that hurts, specially when the graying hair is in the temple area.</li>
            <li> This product is easy enough to use and covers as well as those costing twice as much but it smells like old man cologne.  So why a deal breaker, because the smell lingers in your hair;  so the money spent on nice great smelling shampoo is out the window.</li>
            <li> Excellent for in between time. I&#x27;ve recently had a baby and it threw off my coloring schedule. I&#x27;ve gone weeks beyond my root touch up time with my stylist and this little stick has helped me look decent for outing and photos with the baby. Very easy to use and such an inexpensive fix!</li>
            <li> I only gave it 1 star because it worked on my fingers 😒. It NEVER COLORED MY HAIR. I was very eager to try this product based on the reviews it received but, I was very disappointed when it didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m black, my hair is chemically straightened, my roots aren&#x27;t the problem just a couple very noticeable strands, I tried to apply the product but, it just wouldn&#x27;t color my hair, my fingers on the other hand were nice and black. Very disappointed, this didn&#x27;t work for me, this product is a waste of time from my experience.</li>
            <li> I had bought this but to me it doesn&#x27;t work very good. So I&#x27;m back to coloring my hair, yuck! But it smells good..</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for me! I&#x27;ve used all kinds of touch-ups in the past to help me get through the last week or two between coloring. This is my favorite and will buy again and again. I like this product because it is activated by water - that means it stays on between washings. Last year, my beautician told me that washing my hair every day was really, really, bad for my hair and she recommends only washing every 10 days to 2 weeks! It has taken me almost a year, but I have slowly extended the time between washings to 10 days - it is true that your hair will adjust and produce less oil. What is cool is that I can wash my hair and put this product on the grays - and it stays on until I wash it 10 days later. It does not come off on my pillow. It does not come off on my fingers (unless I actually scratch my head). Yes, it has an odor when you first put it on but it fades and that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. IF YOU ARE DECIDING BETWEEN TWO SHADES, GO WITH THE DARKER SHADE. I have very dark brown hair, ordered the dark brown and it was too light. I could tell I liked the product, though, so I ordered Black and it works perfectly. Also, this one stick is going to last me forever - I can&#x27;t remember when I bought it - months ago - and I can barely tell I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> I have medium neutral (not golden or red) hair.  Tomorrow is Mother&#x27;s Day, and I am invited to a party unexpectedly, but my hair appointment is not until next Wednesday for my real professionl color.  so my temples are showing gray and around my bangs.  I bought the Plush Brown (not much choice in store and the Chocolate looked definitely too dark.)  I decided to put it on this morning so I could wash it out if it looked really bad for some reason.  It did drip all over the place and was messy.  The best method I came up with was to use a makeup spunge or any small sponge, and dab it on the areas.  I then immediately ran a fine comb thru all the roots to distribute it evenly.  this worked great.  It is drying now, and the color did actually cover the gray (I&#x27;m shocked) and it is blending very well with my hair overall.  I think for one-day things (with no rain!!??) such as business meetings, dinners etc., this is going to work pretty well.  PS - I used a light towel not thinking, but I really didn&#x27;t see much discoloring of it.  I will probably try to find the touch-up sticks for my temples.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and a brown one for me.  My gray shows through after 3 weeks so I needed to cover it for the week before I got my roots colored at the salon.  I used it every day on dry hair.  I just ran it under the hot tap and then applied it. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> She is pregnant and can&#x27;t dye her hair for now so I bought this for her. She claims it feels like shoe polish and it is hard to apply even with wet hair.</li>
            <li> Too dry and smelly product. Don&#x27;t work at all. I am not sure if the seller and or producer  ever tried it and why they sell such a bad stuff. Anyway,  it is better to buy waterproof masker and cover your greys, don&#x27;t waste the time and money. It is pointless to buy it.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. Better than other products.  Conceals the white and doesn&#x27;t come off after it dries, would highly recommend it as a temporary fix for white hair.</li>
            <li> I have bsically gray hair with a bit of black in it.  For a new look I randomly apply the black color to my hair then disperse it by dong a comb through.  The effect is dramatic.</li>
            <li> I tried this a few times but it was awful. The texture isn&#x27;t good at all, you can see that it&#x27;s on the hair. At first it was too waxy sort of, then it was too hard.</li>
            <li> I love it very much! It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> This touch-up does not work period... ugh.  The stick is all dried up and does not provide any coloring at all.  It is like rubbing your hair with smooth rock and no color.  I wish I can get money back on this product.  I would ignore all good reviews on Amazon for this product.</li>
            <li> Love this thing, I have natuarlly blonde hair and dye it black, and on one side of my head, I have it shaved, well as you can imagine, the black dye doesnt last long on that shoet hair, this things work perfect for not just that side when it gets lighter but my roots too- super easy, has a litte odd smell, but just at first, I dont notice after about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> great for in between hair dyes - especially on the sides. this product does the job without looking fake. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is like using a waxy crayon on your roots.  It smears and it looks fake as heck on the hair.  I tossed this.</li>
            <li> it is was as i want and more thank you ..  it&#x27;s worth what you pay for it. thank you again</li>
            <li> Worked great and the price was perfect.  Very  l happy with purchase and will continue using it in the future!</li>
            <li> perfectttttt.........</li>
            <li> This is awesome product and made in the USA.  Hope I had seen this product before.  It is light and doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair.  Last until next hair wash.</li>
            <li> My mother loves these products!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have dark hair and my gray hair shows when it grows in.  This tool gives me an extra week or two between coloring.</li>
            <li> Perfect to cover gray hairs in between color time, tried other product didn&#x27;t work that well, it was too sticky</li>
            <li> Terrible product! I have 10 or so white hairs and wanted to cover them up. This item did not work at all. It had a strange smell, appear used, was dried out and did not color my white hairs at all no matter how hard I rubbed the stick on the hair. This is a complete joke of a product and Amazon should consider taking this off their website. It was $7 and so I didn&#x27;t bother with their convoluted return procedure.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things. I don&#x27;t color my hair as much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what it smells like (which isn&#x27;t that bad).  I have jet black died hair with a few large blonde streaks and when my roots show up, they show up!!  A few little swipes of this down my part and you&#x27;d never no my hair is all WHITE.  I love it!!!!</li>
