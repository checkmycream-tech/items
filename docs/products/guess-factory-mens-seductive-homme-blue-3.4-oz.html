            <li>Sweet, but incredibly concentrated.  </li>

            <li>My wife hasn&#x27;t tore off my clothes yet but it smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Purchased at a good price here on Amazon and love it.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to replace this!</li>
            <li>Not found on the shelves any more.</li>
            <li>Hopefully i get  to find more like this, especially price wise!!</li>
            <li>Im not all that convincing with this product.....</li>
            <li>So I found the same item somewhere else perfect timing.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband &amp; I love it on him.</li>
            <li>I had looked some dept stores &amp; it was much more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Great product fast ship</li>
            <li>Love the clean scent!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok not too strong</li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick, I received within couple of days of purchasing it.</li>
            <li>The scent seems that its not as strong as my friends.</li>
            <li>Smells great (although it wont smell the same on everybody).</li>
            <li>it has a light soapy fragrance that just smells clean.</li>
            <li>Quality product and 100% original ... recommended as a seller</li>
            <li>but he absolutely loves Guess seduction,He says it smells better then the original.</li>
            <li>smells nice and soft but have not recieved any compliments yet.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent that reminds me of the days I use to wear blue jeans with the holes in them before it became a fashion.</li>
            <li>Probably my new favorite.</li>
            <li>The shipping took a very long time, just before Christmas, but package was in good shape upon arrival.</li>
            <li>Sweeter tone is weak at best.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Price is right and anyone can wear it</li>
            <li>and you get much more in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>The pony 2 is a better choice it last all day unlike this one</li>
            <li>but I love the smell will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>Very nice, subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Kind of like it was watered down.</li>
            <li>Bought this cologne one for my daddy, he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It was nice for a change of pace for my daily wear but not likely to buy again.</li>
            <li>Smells nice , not sure what else to say ...</li>
            <li>I highly suspect a knockoff product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last long enough we got a sample from Macy&#x27;s that smelled great and lasted longer, this doesn&#x27;t last for some reason.</li>
            <li>It does not have good longevity and it has poor projection.</li>
            <li>Very classy.</li>
            <li>I prefer the crisp smell of Nautica Aqua Rush Eau De Toilette in the same size, I just wish the Nautica were as dense.</li>
            <li>but after a whole like ten twenty minuets it&#x27;s fragrance  disappeared.  </li>
            <li>That was a present for my son, but he didn&#x27;t like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;F</li>
            <li>It smells amazing definitely a must have perfume and not even expensive compared to list price.</li>

            <li> and I ordered directly from Amazon to avoid buying an imitation</li>
            <li> Size bigger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> this guess seductive perfume is the same as you can get at anywhere else,after shopping around i finded this on amazon at less value price for the same quality,perfume i would order it again</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last too long, but I use as an everyday scent.</li>
            <li> Floral dry down, comparable to d &amp; g The One Gentleman.</li>
            <li> No fine cologne produces this affect.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need very little of this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure if it is because of poor storage or any other cause.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately it did not smell like the sample I had</li>

            <li> smells good and good quality and good price</li>
            <li> Very nice, subtle scent. Doesn&#x27;t last too long, but I use as an everyday scent. Floral dry down, comparable to d &amp; g The One Gentleman.</li>
            <li> Cheaper rhan buying it at a store and you get much more in a bigger bottle. Smells great (although it wont smell the same on everybody). Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> As you spray it&#x27;s look like very good perfume but after a whole like ten twenty minuets it&#x27;s fragrance  disappeared.  Not recommended  to amazon buyers to buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> My friend purchased this brand at the mall. So I decided to buy it online since its cheaper. The scent seems that its not as strong as my friends. Kind of like it was watered down. I dont know maybe its just me but wasnt as thrilled about it as I was expecting to be.</li>
            <li> Ahhhh smells wonderful. husband loved it</li>
            <li> smells nice and soft but have not recieved any compliments yet. i guess its because of my body chemistry. might work for someone else.</li>
            <li> I highly suspect a knockoff product. Initial smell is instantly of alcohol. No fine cologne produces this affect. Sweeter tone is weak at best. Not happy and I ordered directly from Amazon to avoid buying an imitation and that&#x27;s still what I got. Will not buy cologne from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time when I where this.  The smell doesn&#x27;t take over but also lasts all day</li>
            <li> Sweet, but incredibly concentrated.  You&#x27;ll need very little of this.  I recommend buying a smaller bottle, because this will last for a decade.  I prefer the crisp smell of Nautica Aqua Rush Eau De Toilette in the same size, I just wish the Nautica were as dense.</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to replace this! Not found on the shelves any more.</li>
            <li> Love the clean scent!  100ml bottle lasts forever!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing definitely a must have perfume and not even expensive compared to list price.</li>
            <li> Probably my new favorite. Smells great I have to hide it from my father..</li>
            <li> i loved it , it was a great gift and for a great price. Hopefully i get  to find more like this, especially price wise!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long enough we got a sample from Macy&#x27;s that smelled great and lasted longer, this doesn&#x27;t last for some reason. The shipping took a very long time, just before Christmas, but package was in good shape upon arrival.</li>
            <li> This is awesome. My husband smells great with this on. Very classy.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift.  The recipient is very happy with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm and spicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive so don&#x27;t expect this to be a power house fragrance.</li>
            <li> Im not all that convincing with this product..... The pony 2 is a better choice it last all day unlike this one</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as a just because gift.I knew he liked guess but he absolutely loves Guess seduction,He says it smells better then the original.Great Buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok not too strong</li>
            <li> Guess blue jeans leave up to its name. It has a nice clean scent that reminds me of the days I use to wear blue jeans with the holes in them before it became a fashion.</li>
            <li> Did not come on the day it was supposed to come I actually bought it for someone birthday and I had to go run out and buy another gift because this did not come on time.. So I found the same item somewhere else perfect timing. I had to send this one back because it did not come when it was supposed to come.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not smell like the sample I had so I was a bit disappointed. It does not have good longevity and it has poor projection. I&#x27;m unsure if it is because of poor storage or any other cause. I would not purchase this cologne again.</li>
            <li> this guess seductive perfume is the same as you can get at anywhere else,after shopping around i finded this on amazon at less value price for the same quality,perfume i would order it again</li>
            <li> Bought this cologne one for my daddy, he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> My wife hasn&#x27;t tore off my clothes yet but it smells nice.  Maybe I need to buy Axe like in the commercials.  LOL!</li>
            <li> Smells nice , not sure what else to say ... it has a light soapy fragrance that just smells clean.</li>
            <li> Quality product and 100% original ... recommended as a seller</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband &amp; I love it on him. I had looked some dept stores &amp; it was much more.</li>
            <li> Smells gret and &#x27;she&#x27; likes it, even asked what I was wearing &#x27;tonight&#x27;</li>
            <li> Found and loved the scent while at Target which it was told out. Purchased at a good price here on Amazon and love it. Size bigger than I expected.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this cologne for my cousin and my son --very very nice !!  Price is right and anyone can wear it</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne and I do to when he wears it. Shipping was very quick, I received within couple of days of purchasing it.</li>
            <li> My bottle came chip on the edge believe it was the postal service fault but I love the smell will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Omg this guess is the best one out there had it before and buying it again</li>
            <li> It was nice for a change of pace for my daily wear but not likely to buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product fast ship</li>
            <li> Good cologne.  Came on time.</li>
            <li> That was a present for my son, but he didn&#x27;t like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;F</li>
