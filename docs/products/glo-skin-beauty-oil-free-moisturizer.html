            <li>I am in love...</li>

            <li>Works great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and oil free!</li>
            <li>I have got so many compliments on how smooth my skin looks</li>
            <li>As the entire Glo line is incredible.</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>This lotion is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>This one is not too strong.</li>
            <li>This is a great product I bought from my spa- highly recommended for most skins as a good to go extra.</li>
            <li>Moisturizer quickly absorbs into the skin without leaving any greasy residue!</li>
            <li>The smell is little strong but otherwise IT IS PERFECT!!!!!</li>
            <li>I tried peter thomas roth oil free moisturizer..</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and soaks in really well, and feels super refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li>Light moisturizer and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer, works great, to too heavy, not too light, works wonders.</li>
            <li>I originally had this recommended by my dermatologist -</li>
            <li>However, after I started to use it, I was not disappointed</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pricey, but it is well worth it!</li>
            <li>After using some products that were less than ideal think I will stay loyal to this product, although yeah</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really check how many ounces this was..</li>
            <li>Feels super light weight and absorbs right away.</li>
            <li>It also arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I use mostly at night, but it is light enough to use under makeup and during the day as well.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer leaves me feeling fresh, clear, and with healthy skin.</li>
            <li>you need less than you think, but even then it absorbs so nicely and so quickly.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer, but a bit heavy for what I was used to.</li>
            <li>I really have a sensitive nose, if a fragrance is too strong</li>
            <li>My face seems to be less oily throughout the day, and the texture of the cream/gel is nice.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not big on the scent, but it&#x27;s not too strong</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and it can be hard to find a good moisturizer for that</li>
            <li>It was really light weight, lasted all day and didn&#x27;t clog my pores or make my face feel oily by the middle of the day.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream and will probably purchase again.</li>
            <li>I found that it is light enough not to irritate me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This lotion has never once clogged my pores (and I really layer it on) and it works so well under makeup.</li>
            <li>I often accidentally take out too MUCH...</li>
            <li>It is light and it helps keep my face moisturized without feeling like I am wearing a mask all day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for a new moisturizer that didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily</li>
            <li>Its keeps my skin soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does moisturize and lives the skin soft and smelling</li>
            <li>I am absolute fanatic of this lotion - It&#x27;s incredibly light weight in that I don&#x27;t immediately feel greasy like most other lotions I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a combination skin type that has really dry spots and for me this doesn&#x27;t have that wow factor.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great transaction. Love the product. Works great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I loved this!! It was really light weight, lasted all day and didn&#x27;t clog my pores or make my face feel oily by the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> Feels great on skin, absorbs fast...doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.  I really like this cream and will probably purchase again.</li>
            <li> timely and items were as expected</li>
            <li> A nice moisture and probably great for oily skin but I&#x27;m a combination skin type that has really dry spots and for me this doesn&#x27;t have that wow factor. I guess I&#x27;m just used to using a cream because I do have really dry skin (as well as a frustrating T zone, lucky me). But this moisture does have a lovely silky feel that I&#x27;m sure is perfect for many skin types. I&#x27;m not wild about the scent but it doesn&#x27;t bother me either, and I found that it is light enough not to irritate me. I really have a sensitive nose, if a fragrance is too strong I won&#x27;t use it, body lotion included! This one is not too strong.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  I love glo-therapeutics make up line so was expecting something better. I ended giving it away and went back to using biolements &amp;#34;beyond hydration&amp;#34; moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But I absolutely LOVE this product.  It is light and it helps keep my face moisturized without feeling like I am wearing a mask all day long.</li>
            <li> I love glo-therapeutics! I won&#x27;t use any other facial moisturizer. It&#x27;s light and oil free! It also arrived quickly. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent Moisturizer!  Does NOT make me break out... everything else DOES!  I reccommend it  A little pricey... I tried peter thomas roth oil free moisturizer.. that made me break out.. im going back to this one.</li>
            <li> Just get this moisturizer. Good quality. Makes all the difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve been using for 2 years now and won&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Its keeps my skin soft without feeling greasy. I put it on everynight in the winter and summer. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> I am oily and acne type skin. This moisturizer is he best one I have ever tried. Strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I use mostly at night, but it is light enough to use under makeup and during the day as well. Sometime when I am traveling to drier climates or have been exposed to elements drying out my skin I will use this for a few days morning and night and it seems to get my skin back to feeling balanced.</li>
            <li> I purchased this moisturizer for my daughter, who also uses the skin care line of Glo Therapeutics for moderate acne.  She is very pleased with the oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this, moisturizing with no breakouts</li>
            <li> I was given this moisturizer by an aestitician (sp?) after I got a few facials done to help my congested skin and cystic acne scars due to a severe milk allergy. This lotion has never once clogged my pores (and I really layer it on) and it works so well under makeup. It smells amazing and soaks in really well, and feels super refreshing and clean. Glotherapeutics is my hero :)</li>
            <li> One of my favorite moisturizers! Feels super light weight and absorbs right away.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer, works great, to too heavy, not too light, works wonders. I have got so many compliments on how smooth my skin looks</li>
            <li> It is perfect! I don&#x27;t get a rash or a reaction like other creams and my skin feels great! Love it</li>
            <li> You can tell a good product because it&#x27;s reordered.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with oily skin since having a baby....i think my hormones are causing it! Anyhow, i was looking around online for a highly rated / not too expensive / oil-free moisturizer. Glo Therapeutics works great!! My face seems to be less oily throughout the day, and the texture of the cream/gel is nice. i&#x27;m not big on the scent, but it&#x27;s not too strong so I can get over that. My limit on a good face cream is about $30 so thus was perfect since no drugstore creams were working for me! I would suggest this product for anyone looking for a good, light moisturizer. Your face doesn&#x27;t feel coated or greasy at all after the moisturizer is applied.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, I break out from everything but not this, love it!!! The smell is little strong but otherwise IT IS PERFECT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this cream!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Received in excellent condition</li>
            <li> I am absolute fanatic of this lotion - It&#x27;s incredibly light weight in that I don&#x27;t immediately feel greasy like most other lotions I have used in the past. I originally had this recommended by my dermatologist - As the entire Glo line is incredible. I have since moved and found this to be the best place to buy - Great price for an even greater product!!</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, but a bit heavy for what I was used to.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I bought from my spa- highly recommended for most skins as a good to go extra. Found online little cheaper and delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a new moisturizer that didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily and I finally did! This moisturizer leaves me feeling fresh, clear, and with healthy skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past month or so and so far it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> This lotion is light and refreshing. Perfect for the summer and spring months. Great clean smell. Would buy again for the summer and spring months.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and I didn&#x27;t really check how many ounces this was.. I thought it was going to be bigger than this, which was really a huge disappointment on my end. However, after I started to use it, I was not disappointed any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pricey, but it is well worth it! I love what it does for my skin.. I am hardly breaking out now!</li>
            <li> Moisturizer quickly absorbs into the skin without leaving any greasy residue! Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth. T-zone appears to be less oily. Visible results in less than one week!</li>
            <li> I am in love...I have sensitive skin and this is amazing. I often accidentally take out too MUCH...you need less than you think, but even then it absorbs so nicely and so quickly. I wear this mostly during the day under make-up. After using some products that were less than ideal think I will stay loyal to this product, although yeah it&#x27;s on the pricey side....I have combination skin and it can be hard to find a good moisturizer for that, this is really great....</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used. I use this morning and evening and sleep with it on my face.</li>
            <li> This product absorbs quickly and has a subtle scent.  It does not clog pores and lasts all day.  I&#x27;ll never purchase anything else.</li>
            <li> Light moisturizer and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a few months...love it! ((Good seller to buy from as well))</li>
            <li> Use this moisturizer twice a day and it is never grease! Love it!</li>
            <li> It is extremely light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to have any effect I had to apply double amount when compared to other brands that I usually used.&lt;br /&gt;It does moisturize and lives the skin soft and smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;No negative experience except that it ends fast. I finished that jar in three weeks. When I used Kehl&#x27;s, Perlage or Dior, they lasted minimum 3 months for the same number of oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may buy it again but only on sale.</li>
