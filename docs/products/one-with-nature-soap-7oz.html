            <li>I love this soap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this soap!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this soap!</li>
            <li>Elegant scents!</li>
            <li>I just love this mud!</li>
            <li>When I purchase a bar of soap I like a more pleasant scent and this doesn&#x27;t have that.</li>
            <li>Be sure to also use a good &amp;#34;toner&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; for best results and be consistent.</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for preventing that.</li>
            <li>Also noteworthy is many good quality soaps are crazy-overpriced ($8-$10).</li>
            <li>This works great on my skin making it feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Nice lather.  </li>
            <li>Nicely made and sized.</li>
            <li>Many of them are great for skin, and others love the remaining harmful stagnate oils.  </li>
            <li>but, honestly I feel like the roughness of the bar</li>
            <li>product works really well for me, but I encourage everyone to try out a bunch of options to see what works best for them.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Rose Petal and Lavender.</li>
            <li>* Has a nice grit to it  *</li>
            <li>Gently exfoliating with a delightful smell.</li>
            <li>Really nice soap.</li>
            <li>Nice scrub.</li>
            <li>Feels nice.</li>
            <li>we loved this soap need to order more.</li>
            <li>It kind f smells like lye soap with hint of some fragrance.</li>
            <li>The granules in it feel so good, but they don&#x27;t dissolve, so make sure you wash off your body.</li>
            <li>It never dries out my skin and it gets nice and frothy when I use it with my bath gloves.</li>
            <li>Cleans my face really nice.</li>
            <li>i love this product and would recommend this for a good cleansin.</li>
            <li>it has a nice feel and it exfoliates</li>
            <li>has a nice smell</li>
            <li>Ok product, good price but won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li>It lathers well, scrubs nicely and does not have any EDTA, SLS, Sulfates, bla bla bla ingredients that make us raise our eyebrows once we realize they are in our skincare products.</li>
            <li>&gt; Has a nice grit to it</li>
            <li>Nicely exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>Watch out for shipping charges; it&#x27;s a nice size bar.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going to buy a&amp;#34; fancy&amp;#34; soap (rather than my classic Dove) it has to be awesome.  </li>
            <li>Great soap leaves you squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent, very mild and doesn&#x27;t have a hint of earth or mud smell.</li>
            <li>Most amazing soap, love it!</li>
            <li>Great soap, has mild exfoliant properties and leaves skin feeling supple.</li>
            <li>soap itself has a very nice, sweet cinnamon scent to it.</li>
            <li>It works very good on your skin,facial and whole body.</li>
            <li>It just smells pleasant and gets you clean.</li>
            <li>a cloth or loofah may be best if you have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and this is by far the best product out there.</li>
            <li>This soap is superb, it soothes my skin, and makes it so soft.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap, it feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>and I love how it is &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; and nice at exfoliating.</li>
            <li>but this bar has a light scent, but still smells good</li>
            <li>By far the best bar of soap I have ever used</li>
            <li>It feels great on my skin, providing just the right amount of exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>I really miss this soap good product!</li>
            <li>Will write a head line in 3 to 5 days  Monday afternoon, am loving this mud soap more and more each time shower time.</li>
            <li>This is the Most natural and best Soaps ive ever used!</li>
            <li>Smells good, makes me feel clean afterward.</li>
            <li>Pros - Great price for the amount of soap you get; light clean fragrance</li>
            <li>It is very light.  </li>
            <li>The best moister is water, once dry, apply favorite lotion or cream, then slammo bammo!</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Amazon, you better re-stock it.</li>
            <li>but it hasn&#x27;t worked any miracles on my skin : ).</li>
            <li>Love the scrubby inside.</li>

            <li>and I will never use another (I&#x27;ve tried many soaps)</li>

            <li>The soap miraculously did serve its purpose as a soap (regardless of the contained dirt), so it may be better used as a hand soap.</li>
            <li>I think but decided to wait to finish using it before reviewing it just to be sure of its use.</li>
            <li>and then I was able to start using this version.</li>
            <li>Exceptional pricing and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I love this soap for exfoliation and for my psoriasis.  </li>

            <li>It smells pretty good</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good soap.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel wonderful; I have excessively dry skin</li>

            <li>This soap is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used on my face that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>And it works great on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I just use it a couple of times per week and gently scrub psoriatic patches for 30 seconds to a minute on each area and it really does an excellent job at exfoliating the flakey skin so that it&#x27;s much more smooth when I am finished.  </li>
            <li>I have just started using this soap and love the mild scent!</li>
            <li>Many thanks for a great product that is very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>nice on skin and washes fine cool scent.,</li>
            <li>Love this soap, exfoliates and leaves your skin feeling clean and healthy</li>
            <li>Great soap for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Also, the fact that it&#x27;s so natural is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rough and is a great exfoliation!</li>
            <li>Great for myself and daughters sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Wonderful soap, nice minerals to gently scratch your back, exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li>Great exfoliating soap, even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great soap, helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>but it is great for my sensitive areas -</li>
            <li>I keep it around for when I really need to give my hands a good scrub.</li>
            <li>My whole family loved this product.</li>
            <li>smells good, gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling very clean and smooth, like the feeling of baby powder, almost, on your skin.</li>
            <li>Very mild scent.  </li>
            <li>It leaves you feel clean, not &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; like many national brand soaps we see advertised.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re easy to cover up with makeup</li>
            <li>If you clean more than I do, it may not be an issue.</li>
            <li>It rinses off so easily.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin, so it is awesome that this soap can clean my skin well yet nourish it.  </li>
            <li>but its makes me feel clean : )</li>
            <li>I am prone to skin irritation from strong or fragrant products but need something that cleans.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any strong, unnatural smelling fragrances that the manufacturer added in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok - nothing insanely special.</li>
            <li>and it still lathers well under the cool water (many soaps do not).  </li>
            <li>No crazy strong scent either!  </li>
            <li>A great big bar that delivers clean!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good as new.</li>
            <li>At its core, it is nothing but fine sand.  </li>
            <li>Cleans hands fine, but it made our soap dish look like a mud puddle.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, not perfumee at all, works nicely on my skin, leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>First best purchase was The Ultimate Ice Cream Book--</li>
            <li>But why mess with something i&#x27;d consider close to perfect.</li>
            <li>Left my skin very smooth, smells good</li>
            <li>However, if you like the exfoliating feeling of little granules in the soap, as I do, then this soap is awesome!  </li>
            <li>This stuff has made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Huge bar, lasts months.</li>
            <li>Really great lather and my skin feels squeaky clean, but not dry.  </li>
            <li>would buy it again because it feels &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and free of chemicals.</li>
            <li>If you like smooth soap, this may not be the product for you.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and the scrubbies in it are like a back scratcher!</li>
            <li>This soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li>i realy enjoy this soap.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like anything too fragrant, but enjoy a soap with some scratchy exfoliating properties.</li>
            <li>My skin was smooth, but still felt oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Great gritty feeling.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a smooth soap, this bar is not for you.  </li>
            <li>I bought this soap as a add on item to get my free shipping</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shrink up fast, big bar, smells great!</li>
            <li>This is a great soap, it is very cleansing yet gentle.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it smells good in a natural feeling way.</li>
            <li>WHEN A FRIEND FROM WORK SAID SHE USED IT AND HAD SENSITIVE SKIN, AND IVE LOVED IT</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>sometimes they are surprised at the difference of a good product</li>
            <li>* indicate that you include fragrance, but I noted that you indicate that it has light and clean scent or something of that nature.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff... would love it more if they brought it back to Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li>Great exfoliator and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>Great soap - cleans well, rinses off clean, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredible how cheap this little bar of heaven is</li>
            <li>Lathers great &amp; lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li>soap lasts a very long time and is a great value.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Makes you feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>and I had to clean the tub after every use.</li>
            <li>Never dries out my skin, leaves me feeling clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li>feel so clean after using it,</li>
            <li>, so I guess I just need it to clean.</li>
            <li>But I just didn&#x27;t feel totally clean after using this.</li>
            <li>And when you are done your skin feels super smooth.</li>
            <li>they like their skin to be clean too</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin to where I can only use a number of soaps, this has got to be one of the best I have gotten.</li>
            <li>I did not see anything special this soap did.</li>
            <li>Nothing special though.  </li>
            <li>it has a nice scent and you feel clean and soft after using it, i lik the exfolicant factory also.</li>
            <li>Really do not understand what is great about this soap.</li>
            <li>Using it in a bathtub filled with Dead Sea Salt creates beautiful additional bubbles.</li>
            <li>At only $4 I feel this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>I had grabbed it from my local health food store on a whim and loved it</li>
            <li>So good that we will purchase this regularly.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin at all, and it honestly looks like I was attacked by cat.</li>
            <li>It gave her such good results with her acne</li>
            <li>I like this soap, I feel super clean after using it</li>
            <li>out my skin tone, I will be ordering this product again, thanks :)</li>
            <li>This soap is cool.  </li>
            <li>loved this soap but not now that it had actually caused superficial lacerations in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Where most soaps tend to aggrivate my psoriasis this soap really seems to help soothe it.</li>
            <li>A 7 oz One With Nature bar is good for almost a month and one-half of daily showers.  </li>
            <li>my skin is still looking fresh and blemish free.</li>
            <li>and I am glad to now see it as an add on item at a very competitive price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels good and the bar seems to last forever.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is true.</li>
            <li>I purchased only one and it felt good the 1st couple of times of use</li>
            <li>A bar lasts me a month, not a bad price to use ratio.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell is not bad if you get used to it.</li>
            <li>So its great to find one (other than glycerin) that works well.</li>
            <li>GREAT BUY, JUST AS I EXPECTED!</li>
            <li>I finally started trying different soaps and this was the one that worked best for me.</li>
            <li>We are allergic to sulfas, main ingredient in most soaps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger than your Dove soap which makes it just fit the hand nicely.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into the mild sandpaper experience, this is your product.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Love this soap, the skin feels extremely soft and smooth after showering with it.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing a few more bars of this as I do believe this product is well made and good for your skin.</li>
            <li>It has a mild soap scent and you will see a muddy residue that you have to rinse out of your tub if you take a bath rather than shower with it.  </li>
            <li>If you have a heat rash it seems to help get rid of it quickly.</li>
            <li>Mild, not perfume-y.  </li>
            <li>A new favorite.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh, nothing extraordinary there.</li>
            <li>love my natural soap!</li>
            <li>Cleans and leaves your skin very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It lathers up great and has little exfoliating things.</li>
            <li>Okay just used the huge bar, double 2.5 coast bars</li>
            <li>Has helped calm and sooth my psoriasis and eczema  </li>
            <li>Exfoliates, and just leaves you clean and smooth but never feeling dry like many soaps do to my skin.</li>
            <li>Soak in the salt bath for 20 minutes and gently massage the bar on your body, then rinse off in the shower, and your skin will feel ultra smooth after this spa treatment - even your heals.  </li>
            <li>I used it with the konjac sponge that I also got in the same delivery and it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>At the end, it rinses away completely and leaves your skin feeling fantastic!</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>This soap literally makes your skin so soft, I don&#x27;t care to much for the scent, but I love how gentle it feels, I plan on buying more soaps from this company.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>After many uses, it made my body soft.</li>
            <li>I started buying more natural soaps for him to use.</li>
            <li>it seems to strip too much oil from the skin compared to even irish spring which I found surprising.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I noticed that I&#x27;ve started to get Adult Acne  ALOT of Acne</li>
            <li>It is natural which we love and it exfoliates as well.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it&#x27;s got a scrubbing feel to it, and I like the fresh smell and the &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; feel of using it on my body.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good scrubbing soap, holds up and does not fall apart like some other natural made soaps.</li>
            <li>This one is pretty mild.</li>
            <li>Overall, I feel that it&#x27;s a good, natural soap that isn&#x27;t chock full of chemicals like a lot of soaps are.</li>
            <li>Price is right.  </li>
            <li>Perfect amount of abrasion (which lasts down to the core of the soap) and definitely helped control acne on my face.</li>
            <li>Either way I will highly recommend it as a fabulous body soap.</li>
            <li>have tried several within this line and I like this one the most as it is very neutral in smell (read...almost no smell) and feels super clean after use.</li>
            <li>Very large bar.</li>
            <li>(have to list it twice, its the only soap i&#x27;ve used so far that has been able to make it feel better)    </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it sooths my irritated skin (have to list it twice, its the only soap i&#x27;ve used so far that has been able to make it feel better)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and so far this soap has been great for keeping my face clear.</li>
            <li>It matters nicely and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>it is a fairly large bar, but it became manageable fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Do not feel dried out as much ,am sure as time goes on it will put more moisture on my skin.</li>
            <li>Left it smooth and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, smells nice.</li>
            <li>This soap is not only healthy to use on the skin but also refreshing,Has helped calm and sooth my psoriasis and eczema</li>
            <li>Soft sudsy gentle exfoliating and non drying...had to buy more.</li>
            <li>I wish more products were like this, no strange chemicals.</li>
            <li>I first tried the Vanilla Oatmeal kind of this One with nature dead sea minerals soap collection and that one was fantastic.</li>
            <li>It has a nice aroma to it, as you would expect not very much aroma.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Which then after I get out of the shower my body is soft and it feels super moisturized!</li>
            <li>It cleared up my skin problems I had on my arms, left my skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lil grainy, nice earthy mild smell, used the first bar noticed no skin reaction, my skin type is combination, my mother in law is dry, my son normal, seems to do well for everyone, my husband doesn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>I love this soap and it will be my go to facial cleanser from now on!  </li>
            <li>Already feel the grainy texture that open your skin with many derm abrasion like grains.</li>
            <li>Any recommendations would be appreciated!</li>
            <li>There were several more, but I think this gives the idea of what you&#x27;re probably going to deal with.</li>
            <li>More drying then the regular over the counter body soap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It rinses on well and left my face feeling soothe and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>Love the pieces of mud that stick out like tiny exfoliators.</li>
            <li>but it’s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>These soaps are fantastic and One With Nature’s customer service was excellent in helping me discern the difference between the Dead Sea Mud and Dead Sea Salt soaps.</li>
            <li>but it’s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>These soaps are fantastic and One With Nature’s customer service was excellent in helping me discern the difference between the Dead Sea Mud and Dead Sea Salt soaps.</li>

            <li>After my first use I could immediately see an improvement.</li>
            <li>First of all I ordered one</li>

            <li>I always make sure I have enough supply.  </li>
            <li>body acne but the ones that are there are pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li>This soap is excellent for stressed skin as it originates from the Dead Sea, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I prefer to put it onto a washcloth first, so the salt dissolves before i apply it to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap I actually signed up for auto delivery.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and natural.  </li>

            <li>, it&#x27;s heavenly-that get you clean, rinse off clean, and last forever.</li>

            <li>I have Clear and Healthy 20 year old looking skin!  </li>
            <li>I bought this just because I wanted to live more naturally, but when I used it in intimate places, it prevents girl problems.</li>
            <li>It will clean anything and leave your hands so soft.</li>
            <li>It is very earthy and mild so it does not dry your skin out and makes your skin feel really clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves you feeling clean and your skin is soft.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, however, long term use will leave your skin a bit dry.</li>

            <li>Also, the small bits in mud or whatever else provide a good exfoliating effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This most recent bar however,  has pieces of something in it that are so sharp,  I ended up with fairly prominent scratches across my body and face.</li>

            <li>Last long and good smell.</li>
            <li>This works great to not only keep my face moisturized (although I also use hyaluronic acid for that) and also keeps the oil down.</li>
            <li>There are large grains of minerals, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using on your face.  </li>
            <li>I certainly hope not..</li>
            <li>It is a large bar</li>
            <li>so she is certain to get the soap every month.</li>
            <li>and it is a large bar.  </li>
            <li>It almost felt burnt and a bit itchy in certain places.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large</li>
            <li>Use it everyday on my face - I have not gotten as many pimples as I used to with this product!</li>
            <li>I love the slight fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>There is a slight grit in the soap,  but that was never an issue, I actually really liked the gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Will definitely come back for more!</li>
            <li>I put the shavings in a bag and just used it as needed, the shavings will crumble so you could just slice the soap into larger chunks but for me the shavings work fine</li>
            <li>Not the actual little bits, which felt great as an exfoliant, but the salt.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t mind having natural texture to the soap for a good scrub, but I don&#x27;t understand the abrasive little shards of rock in this.</li>
            <li>Cleans really well.</li>
            <li>The lather is dense and works very well.</li>
            <li>A gentle exfoliation on the skin</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This soap has you absolutely covered.  </li>
            <li>But it rubs into a lather and the silt  opens up clogged pores so gently you don&#x27;t even feel the abrasive particles as they work.  </li>
            <li>Cleans really well</li>
            <li>This bar really helps me.</li>
            <li>I like this for the neutral scent, the exfoliating nature, and the fact that lasts for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>But it really does help keep the skin in my legs from getting ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but this product was very drying.</li>
            <li>Leaves face feeling clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>It was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and find this soap very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have much of a scent.&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li>I am very picky about soap.</li>
            <li>But when I ordered it, it was only three dollars and change with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t pay that much.  </li>
            <li>Can use on face and whole body.</li>
            <li>Also very drying.</li>
            <li>Great soap without any unnecessary ingredients.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li>for my face, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I also like it but not so much as her.</li>
            <li>This soap is really gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>and it lathers really well.</li>
            <li>that cost three times as much as One with</li>
            <li>It really softens the water a lot.</li>
            <li>With Nature is a Jordan manufactured product, is as luxurious a soap like the Israel product, with twice the weight per bar, a reasonable price, and the ability to subscribe for monthly delivery.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i have to be gentle or it hurts to bathe with this.</li>
            <li>Do not expect too much from this otherwise.</li>
            <li>I purchased a prime eligible 5 pack at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>doesnt have much of a scent, which I dont mind.</li>
            <li>Really unacceptable.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>It has to much a a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smell which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell to entice you.</li>
            <li>and I find body washes to be much easier to use, but I like this.</li>
            <li>I have provided a picture of my arm right after using this soap and you can clearly see a cut extending up the forearm.</li>
            <li>My skin is uber sensitive, so the first time I used it, I got a little red, but put on some coconut oil, and since then, it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>Fine soap for regular use for normal skin.</li>
            <li>I found that my normal acne spot treatment worked better, but I&#x27;ve been trying to find natural products to take care of that because of synthetic chemicals in regular store products.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and has fine grains that exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Because of that, I tend to try out a LOT of natural soaps and this is not near the top of the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the clean scent left on my skin after a shower.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not much, heck I barely notice it, but that&#x27;s kind of the point</li>
            <li>no lather whatsoever, but effective and long lasting</li>
            <li>Nice and clean-feeling, long lasting soap.</li>
            <li>fantastic, and rinses so well and lasts so long.  </li>
            <li>Using this in combination with my Skyroad bath mitts has made my skin SOFT for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>I know that it is supposed to be for exfoliating purposes, but honestly, it feels like I&#x27;m rubbing small scratchy sand across my body.</li>
            <li>When looking for something a step above the multi-pack of soap bars like Dove, but not as expensive as top of the line fancy soap, this is a good way to go.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice, big, solid bar of soap, but is too scratchy for my skin except for my legs though I&#x27;ve never considered myself the sensitive type.  </li>
            <li>First couple times I rubbed soap directly on my face...HUGE MISTAKE.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very heavy and looks to last a long time which is awesome for the price.</li>
            <li>I was referred to this product as well as African Black Soap ( No where near as good as this soap, but still decent ) due to the fact that I had fairly severe acne on my face, chest and back.</li>
            <li>I love this soap but it&#x27;s sharp!</li>
            <li>If you want more froth and less scratch, than you can use a puffy or washcloth.</li>
            <li>The more I use Amazon, the less I trust reviews.</li>
            <li>I like how the ingredient list is pretty short and recognizable.  </li>
            <li>Decent price.</li>
            <li>I was noticing how quickly it was going away with only a week camping.  </li>
            <li>Bought it to try, and I would buy it again, just would use a different washcloth method to lather it in order to keep it from being used up so quickly.</li>
            <li>Lathers very well and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a decent soap.  </li>
            <li>:) Totally recommend this soap and sender for my next purchase.</li>
            <li>I do not plan to continue to use this particular variant of &amp;#34;One</li>
            <li>mainly shower with it, but I have also used it in a bath of Epsom salts.  </li>
            <li>Decent soap, scratchy to the skin though.</li>
            <li>I gave this to a man who is older and</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have any particular scent, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little puzzled by the white color it took when first exposed to water, but after some use it returned to a more brown color.</li>
            <li>Though after the first few times the soap felt softer, and I found that putting directly on my skin helped better to eliminate my skin problems.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t hurt maybe to have a little more cinnamon in it to give it a little more smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks... Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Shannon Little</li>
            <li>Big soap that exfoliates my skin leaving it soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild scent washes off completely, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li>All natural soap that gently exfoliates your skin.  </li>
            <li>The cinnamon falls under the category of fragrance for allergy sufferers, so those who are sensitive should really take note.  </li>
            <li>A clear label would be very beneficial.</li>
            <li>It really exfoliates when held in the palm of your hand and applied directly to skin.</li>
            <li>Way longer than a normal bar of soap.</li>
            <li>realize everyone&#x27;s skin will react differently to this soap, but it is definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the dead sea mud soap.</li>
            <li>This soap has dead sea salts embedded in it which provides a refreshing stimulus while showering.</li>
            <li>One With Nature Dead Sea Mud soap was just OK.</li>
            <li>Her face looks alot better after just a few days and my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>Their soaps all lather quickly and the bar lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Then I tried the Shea Moisture brand African Black Soap, and liked that a lot, but found the smell a bit strong and the price a little high.</li>
            <li>It lathers and it is nice and scratchy (seriously, I like that).</li>
            <li>It seemed to get more expensive and often wasn&#x27;t available in Amazon Prime</li>
            <li>Probably just because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Since first using a Dead Sea Mud based soap that has no perfume added, my skin, especially my face, is less oily, feels cleaner and more comfortable to be living-in, and I experience far fewer blemishes.</li>
            <li>Pretty gritty.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it a lot!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this soap and this soap alone, which I use to wash my face, has been keeping my acne and blackheads under better control than the small arsenal of skin care products I had in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  washed my face and shoulders with this every morning for about a week and my acne is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>The gritty mud pieces exfoliated my skin very well!</li>
            <li>went from US$8.50 in shekels in the Israel shop and Israel online store, to $12 for my first purchase off Amazon (Israel site can&#x27;t be reached from the USA), to $18 when I was planning a second purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I just love using this soap, not sure if its doing what it suppose to do</li>
            <li>It smells pretty natural, and the ingredients list is short.</li>
            <li>I normally break out everywhere when I travel back home to Ghana..and yet thanks to this</li>
            <li>It works just as good as some of the more expensive brand names that I have bought in the past,</li>
            <li>I have oily T zone, takes it right off without leaving feeling dry.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price in comparison to other natural soaps.</li>
            <li>certain she will want to continue buying this soap, and she has told several friends about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Certainly dries your skin; almost as much as regular soap does.</li>
            <li>like this Dead Sea mud soap because it really calms stressed skin, has no scent of it&#x27;s own, and is very long lasting even with 2 people hitting it hard.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I love it, it has little pieces inside, acting like a vitalizing body scub.</li>
            <li>This soap dries hard and just sits on top of this soap saver.  </li>
            <li>Wash your face TWICE a day and no less!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the strong fragrance some other specialty soaps have which I definitely appreciate.</li>
            <li>It took a couple weeks of use before I really started seeing my skin clear up (which can seem like a lifetime if you&#x27;re itching constantly), but everything is under control now</li>
            <li>On a whim, I picked up a bar of this, and it&#x27;s just as kind and gentle to our skin as the soaps that are 3x as expensive.</li>
            <li>Now, personally, I use this soap directly on my hands and the granules don’t do much,</li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive skin (eczema prone) and I bought this based on the reviews that it helps.  </li>
            <li>If you have naturally soft skin</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this soap..nor if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My search continues to find a smooth and silky dead sea mud soap.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin, like I have.</li>
            <li>I look young</li>
            <li>Was looking for something naturally abrasive to skin but also purifying.</li>
            <li>To get a real exfoliation with this, go to your local Target and get some of The Bathery’s shower gloves.</li>
            <li>I like the texture and the natural smell.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast and the product was just what I needed- ordering in bulk next time.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid over $15 for some bars of soap but this product really delivers for only $3!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care too much for the micro grains mixed in the bar soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve contacted the company directly regarding this issue and they have not even responded with a courtesy email to notify me that they acknowledge my correspondence.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The grit in this bar is not overly abrasive, but it is there, so if you choose to use the bar directly on your skin like I do, expect it to feel like you are scratching with medium pressure.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like there is any soap residue and for that reason it has helped my sensitive skin from soap irritation.  </li>
            <li>I did not like this soap, its not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As far as the smell, it&#x27;s rather earthy, but you can get this soap in a variety of scents.</li>
            <li>and so far I am getting a lot of benefits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that this soap has somewhat of an exfoliating nature and you need to be cautious going over the skin if you are sensitive, or look into the lavender option of this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>We like the natural ingredients in the soap too,</li>
            <li>Adult acne is going away.</li>
            <li>Used to get this at the local Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use this soap directly on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This soap leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve found better are the dead sea salt scrubs</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Dead Sea products and have been for many years now.  </li>
            <li>I have a thing for Dead Sea products as they say the Dead Sea is so good for you.</li>
            <li>This soap melts too easily and gets too slick to hold in hand.  </li>
            <li>The smell of is quite mild, but it left my skin too dry and prone to irritation.</li>
            <li>the mud in it is highly textured almost reminding me of an apricot facial scrub with the &amp;#34;scrubby bits&amp;#34; in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall a sudsy, natural smelling soap experience.</li>
            <li>It cleanses without drying, and I have pretty dry skin!</li>
            <li>This especially works well in winter as extra hot h2o, and your heat dries your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this particular one for my face only when I have applied sunscreen for outdoor activities.</li>
            <li>(you can feel the little bits of mud doing their job) but your skin feels super clean without feeling dried out.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, it has some little grit in it for exfoliating, it is large and&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very expensive -- if you have dry, flaky, and/or sensitive skin, you should give it a try.</li>
            <li>I started using this as my daily face soap and within a few days my skin was soft and nearly free of eczema.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I feel this product definitely deserves one...</li>
            <li>It also lathers very well, which is a little unusual for this type of soap.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had with it is that it seemed to be eaten up rather quickly in comparison to other soaps.  </li>
            <li>And although it&#x27;s not made with Dead Sea mud, Dudu Osun Black Soap is absolutely my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Really helped my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a problem with it wearing too fast, I just let it dry when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If left in shower with too much moisture does seem to take on a slimy feel but this seems to be the case with bar soap, with 3 people using it to last about 3 weeks</li>
            <li>Forget those wimpy four ounce soaps that are typically sold at the store; One With Nature gives you your money&#x27;s worth and then some.</li>
            <li>Though it is certainly an exfoliating soap, it uses actual large particles of black dirt to get the job done, and if you use this soap in the bath tub you will find yourself cleaning dirt out of the tub afterwards.</li>
            <li>No other soap in our house in the shower/bath.</li>
            <li>Bar is made just fine, seems hard keeping shape.</li>
            <li>Then I began to rub it on a wet wash cloth upon entering shower leaving on duration of shower, finally rinsing  off with cool water last just before getting out.</li>
            <li>My skin was a little dryer and more sensitive than it was with the Black Soap.</li>
            <li>This bar will last a few months easily for men especially and women.</li>
            <li>Compared to some of the other dead sea soaps I&#x27;ve tried this is also more affordable.</li>
            <li>Used every other day for 2 mths and it has really helped to calm severe eczema and lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and buffed, but it&#x27;s hard for me to go with a full five stars.</li>
            <li>I deducted a star because the bar is much bigger than regular soaps and I had a hard time gripping it while moving it in circular motion to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>My son used to have eczema and we were using another brand of shea butter soap that helped clear it up and this is working just as well as it still hasn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li>As an adult man and only user of this bar, I get just over one month of use from this bar of soap.</li>
            <li>He used to use only Old Spice body wash for years</li>
            <li>The bar itself will scratch my skin if I&#x27;m not careful, but if I use a washcloth it somewhat negates the exfoliating quality of it.</li>
            <li>My scars and acne have almost completely disappeared and it&#x27;s only been 4 weeks!</li>
            <li>his skin is starting to get really sensitive and papery and he also gets rashes from things.</li>
            <li>This Dead Sea Mud soap is WELL WORTH the price that you pay.  </li>
            <li>I love the little black pieces in it.</li>
            <li>My skin is very prone to be dry and flaky, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>and this does not dry it out!  </li>
            <li>Large, long lasting, and doesn&#x27;t leave an icky film like so many other bar soaps.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the quick shipment as this is the only soap my son can use for his dermatitis, and this soap is very hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating with the shea butter and other moisturizing ingredients.  </li>
            <li>gave me long scratches on my skin with only simple gentle scrubbing.</li>
            <li>As it left red bruised patches on my skin...too Abrasive for direct contact with my face.</li>
            <li>Does not dry my skin out or even bother my patches.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Mud soap is supposed to be on the more exfoliating end of the spectrum with granules in it to scrub away dead skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very well made soap from mostly palm oil with nothing artificial - it has no SLS and no EDTA, which are the two often-used ingredients that give me rashes and allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I assume this came from a defective batch, perhaps some unknown material made its way into the particular batch of soap that this bar came from.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this soap because it does not dry his skin.</li>
            <li>soap cleans terrifically and has really brought my complexion issues which I have struggled with since middle school under control to levels that I haven’t seen in any other product to date.</li>
            <li>Lasts long doesn&#x27;t melt in the shower and the scrubbing action is invigorating.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, a little rosacea in my cheeks, quick to burn, prone to dryness, redness, ingrown hairs and those little bumps on the backs of my arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lathers very well, even in hard water, and does not leave skin dried out as many other bars.  </li>
            <li>It is a little on the large side, so</li>
            <li>, it does break down very fast so keep it dry when not in use.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t help with my psoriasis, and it didn&#x27;t feel any different from other high end soaps.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is you must guard it from extra water when not using otherwise wit will run out quickly.</li>
            <li>Firm large bar.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin so much like all the other soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this soap!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this soap!</li>
            <li> Elegant scents!</li>
            <li> I just love this mud!</li>
            <li> When I purchase a bar of soap I like a more pleasant scent and this doesn&#x27;t have that.</li>
            <li> Be sure to also use a good &amp;#34;toner&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; for best results and be consistent.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for preventing that.</li>
            <li> Also noteworthy is many good quality soaps are crazy-overpriced ($8-$10).</li>
            <li> This works great on my skin making it feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice lather.  </li>
            <li> Nicely made and sized.</li>
            <li> Many of them are great for skin, and others love the remaining harmful stagnate oils.  </li>
            <li> but, honestly I feel like the roughness of the bar</li>
            <li> product works really well for me, but I encourage everyone to try out a bunch of options to see what works best for them.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Rose Petal and Lavender.</li>
            <li> * Has a nice grit to it  *</li>
            <li> Gently exfoliating with a delightful smell.</li>
            <li> Really nice soap.</li>
            <li> Nice scrub.</li>
            <li> Feels nice.</li>
            <li> we loved this soap need to order more.</li>
            <li> It kind f smells like lye soap with hint of some fragrance.</li>
            <li> The granules in it feel so good, but they don&#x27;t dissolve, so make sure you wash off your body.</li>
            <li> It never dries out my skin and it gets nice and frothy when I use it with my bath gloves.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face really nice.</li>
            <li> i love this product and would recommend this for a good cleansin.</li>
            <li> it has a nice feel and it exfoliates</li>
            <li> has a nice smell</li>
            <li> Ok product, good price but won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> It lathers well, scrubs nicely and does not have any EDTA, SLS, Sulfates, bla bla bla ingredients that make us raise our eyebrows once we realize they are in our skincare products.</li>
            <li> &gt; Has a nice grit to it</li>
            <li> Nicely exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> Watch out for shipping charges; it&#x27;s a nice size bar.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to buy a&amp;#34; fancy&amp;#34; soap (rather than my classic Dove) it has to be awesome.  </li>
            <li> Great soap leaves you squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, very mild and doesn&#x27;t have a hint of earth or mud smell.</li>
            <li> Most amazing soap, love it!</li>
            <li> Great soap, has mild exfoliant properties and leaves skin feeling supple.</li>
            <li> soap itself has a very nice, sweet cinnamon scent to it.</li>
            <li> It works very good on your skin,facial and whole body.</li>
            <li> It just smells pleasant and gets you clean.</li>
            <li> a cloth or loofah may be best if you have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and this is by far the best product out there.</li>
            <li> This soap is superb, it soothes my skin, and makes it so soft.  </li>
            <li> I love this soap, it feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> and I love how it is &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; and nice at exfoliating.</li>
            <li> but this bar has a light scent, but still smells good</li>
            <li> By far the best bar of soap I have ever used</li>
            <li> It feels great on my skin, providing just the right amount of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> I really miss this soap good product!</li>
            <li> Will write a head line in 3 to 5 days  Monday afternoon, am loving this mud soap more and more each time shower time.</li>
            <li> This is the Most natural and best Soaps ive ever used!</li>
            <li> Smells good, makes me feel clean afterward.</li>
            <li> Pros - Great price for the amount of soap you get; light clean fragrance</li>
            <li> It is very light.  </li>
            <li> The best moister is water, once dry, apply favorite lotion or cream, then slammo bammo!</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Amazon, you better re-stock it.</li>

            <li> This one is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> Personally, I love the scratchy scrubby feeling.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> The water always looks dingy after using because of the silt in the soap so don&#x27;t think I am always that grimy :)</li>
            <li> and I love the micro beads, that help exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I love &amp;#34;One</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite brands.</li>
            <li> The soap miraculously did serve its purpose as a soap (regardless of the contained dirt), so it may be better used as a hand soap.</li>
            <li> I think but decided to wait to finish using it before reviewing it just to be sure of its use.</li>
            <li> and then I was able to start using this version.</li>
            <li> Exceptional pricing and quick delivery.</li>

            <li> Smells nice, rinses clean.</li>
            <li> My husband has eczema and I tried the soap first and decided it would do him more harm than good.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and an amazing product!</li>
            <li> And it is really amazing at getting the leftover sweet sweat off my body after a work out.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good soap.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel wonderful; I have excessively dry skin</li>
            <li> This is the best for exfoliating the skin without leaving my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used on my face that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> And it works great on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just use it a couple of times per week and gently scrub psoriatic patches for 30 seconds to a minute on each area and it really does an excellent job at exfoliating the flakey skin so that it&#x27;s much more smooth when I am finished.  </li>
            <li> I have just started using this soap and love the mild scent!</li>
            <li> Many thanks for a great product that is very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> nice on skin and washes fine cool scent.,</li>
            <li> Love this soap, exfoliates and leaves your skin feeling clean and healthy</li>
            <li> Great soap for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Also, the fact that it&#x27;s so natural is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rough and is a great exfoliation!</li>
            <li> Great for myself and daughters sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap, nice minerals to gently scratch your back, exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliating soap, even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great soap, helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> but it is great for my sensitive areas -</li>
            <li> I keep it around for when I really need to give my hands a good scrub.</li>
            <li> My whole family loved this product.</li>
            <li> smells good, gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling very clean and smooth, like the feeling of baby powder, almost, on your skin.</li>
            <li> Very mild scent.  </li>
            <li> It leaves you feel clean, not &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; like many national brand soaps we see advertised.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re easy to cover up with makeup</li>
            <li> If you clean more than I do, it may not be an issue.</li>
            <li> It rinses off so easily.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so it is awesome that this soap can clean my skin well yet nourish it.  </li>
            <li> but its makes me feel clean : )</li>
            <li> I am prone to skin irritation from strong or fragrant products but need something that cleans.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any strong, unnatural smelling fragrances that the manufacturer added in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok - nothing insanely special.</li>
            <li> and it still lathers well under the cool water (many soaps do not).  </li>
            <li> No crazy strong scent either!  </li>
            <li> A great big bar that delivers clean!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good as new.</li>
            <li> At its core, it is nothing but fine sand.  </li>
            <li> Cleans hands fine, but it made our soap dish look like a mud puddle.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, not perfumee at all, works nicely on my skin, leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> First best purchase was The Ultimate Ice Cream Book--</li>
            <li> But why mess with something i&#x27;d consider close to perfect.</li>
            <li> Left my skin very smooth, smells good</li>
            <li> However, if you like the exfoliating feeling of little granules in the soap, as I do, then this soap is awesome!  </li>
            <li> This stuff has made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Huge bar, lasts months.</li>
            <li> Really great lather and my skin feels squeaky clean, but not dry.  </li>
            <li> would buy it again because it feels &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and free of chemicals.</li>
            <li> If you like smooth soap, this may not be the product for you.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and the scrubbies in it are like a back scratcher!</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li> i realy enjoy this soap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like anything too fragrant, but enjoy a soap with some scratchy exfoliating properties.</li>
            <li> My skin was smooth, but still felt oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Great gritty feeling.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a smooth soap, this bar is not for you.  </li>
            <li> I bought this soap as a add on item to get my free shipping</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shrink up fast, big bar, smells great!</li>
            <li> This is a great soap, it is very cleansing yet gentle.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it smells good in a natural feeling way.</li>
            <li> WHEN A FRIEND FROM WORK SAID SHE USED IT AND HAD SENSITIVE SKIN, AND IVE LOVED IT</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> sometimes they are surprised at the difference of a good product</li>
            <li> * indicate that you include fragrance, but I noted that you indicate that it has light and clean scent or something of that nature.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... would love it more if they brought it back to Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliator and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Great soap - cleans well, rinses off clean, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredible how cheap this little bar of heaven is</li>
            <li> Lathers great &amp; lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> soap lasts a very long time and is a great value.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Makes you feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> and I had to clean the tub after every use.</li>
            <li> Never dries out my skin, leaves me feeling clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li> feel so clean after using it,</li>
            <li> , so I guess I just need it to clean.</li>
            <li> But I just didn&#x27;t feel totally clean after using this.</li>
            <li> And when you are done your skin feels super smooth.</li>
            <li> they like their skin to be clean too</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin to where I can only use a number of soaps, this has got to be one of the best I have gotten.</li>
            <li> I did not see anything special this soap did.</li>
            <li> Nothing special though.  </li>
            <li> it has a nice scent and you feel clean and soft after using it, i lik the exfolicant factory also.</li>
            <li> Really do not understand what is great about this soap.</li>
            <li> Using it in a bathtub filled with Dead Sea Salt creates beautiful additional bubbles.</li>
            <li> At only $4 I feel this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I had grabbed it from my local health food store on a whim and loved it</li>
            <li> So good that we will purchase this regularly.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin at all, and it honestly looks like I was attacked by cat.</li>
            <li> It gave her such good results with her acne</li>
            <li> I like this soap, I feel super clean after using it</li>
            <li> out my skin tone, I will be ordering this product again, thanks :)</li>
            <li> This soap is cool.  </li>
            <li> loved this soap but not now that it had actually caused superficial lacerations in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Where most soaps tend to aggrivate my psoriasis this soap really seems to help soothe it.</li>
            <li> A 7 oz One With Nature bar is good for almost a month and one-half of daily showers.  </li>
            <li> my skin is still looking fresh and blemish free.</li>
            <li> and I am glad to now see it as an add on item at a very competitive price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels good and the bar seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is true.</li>
            <li> I purchased only one and it felt good the 1st couple of times of use</li>
            <li> A bar lasts me a month, not a bad price to use ratio.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell is not bad if you get used to it.</li>
            <li> So its great to find one (other than glycerin) that works well.</li>
            <li> GREAT BUY, JUST AS I EXPECTED!</li>
            <li> I finally started trying different soaps and this was the one that worked best for me.</li>
            <li> We are allergic to sulfas, main ingredient in most soaps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger than your Dove soap which makes it just fit the hand nicely.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into the mild sandpaper experience, this is your product.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, the skin feels extremely soft and smooth after showering with it.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing a few more bars of this as I do believe this product is well made and good for your skin.</li>
            <li> It has a mild soap scent and you will see a muddy residue that you have to rinse out of your tub if you take a bath rather than shower with it.  </li>
            <li> If you have a heat rash it seems to help get rid of it quickly.</li>
            <li> Mild, not perfume-y.  </li>
            <li> A new favorite.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh, nothing extraordinary there.</li>
            <li> love my natural soap!</li>
            <li> Cleans and leaves your skin very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It lathers up great and has little exfoliating things.</li>
            <li> Okay just used the huge bar, double 2.5 coast bars</li>
            <li> Has helped calm and sooth my psoriasis and eczema  </li>
            <li> Exfoliates, and just leaves you clean and smooth but never feeling dry like many soaps do to my skin.</li>
            <li> Soak in the salt bath for 20 minutes and gently massage the bar on your body, then rinse off in the shower, and your skin will feel ultra smooth after this spa treatment - even your heals.  </li>
            <li> I used it with the konjac sponge that I also got in the same delivery and it was amazing.  </li>
            <li> At the end, it rinses away completely and leaves your skin feeling fantastic!</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> This soap literally makes your skin so soft, I don&#x27;t care to much for the scent, but I love how gentle it feels, I plan on buying more soaps from this company.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> After many uses, it made my body soft.</li>
            <li> I started buying more natural soaps for him to use.</li>
            <li> it seems to strip too much oil from the skin compared to even irish spring which I found surprising.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I noticed that I&#x27;ve started to get Adult Acne  ALOT of Acne</li>
            <li> It is natural which we love and it exfoliates as well.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;it&#x27;s got a scrubbing feel to it, and I like the fresh smell and the &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; feel of using it on my body.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very good scrubbing soap, holds up and does not fall apart like some other natural made soaps.</li>
            <li> This one is pretty mild.</li>
            <li> Overall, I feel that it&#x27;s a good, natural soap that isn&#x27;t chock full of chemicals like a lot of soaps are.</li>
            <li> Price is right.  </li>
            <li> Perfect amount of abrasion (which lasts down to the core of the soap) and definitely helped control acne on my face.</li>
            <li> Either way I will highly recommend it as a fabulous body soap.</li>
            <li> have tried several within this line and I like this one the most as it is very neutral in smell (read...almost no smell) and feels super clean after use.</li>
            <li> Very large bar.</li>
            <li> (have to list it twice, its the only soap i&#x27;ve used so far that has been able to make it feel better)    </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it sooths my irritated skin (have to list it twice, its the only soap i&#x27;ve used so far that has been able to make it feel better)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and so far this soap has been great for keeping my face clear.</li>
            <li> It matters nicely and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> it is a fairly large bar, but it became manageable fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Do not feel dried out as much ,am sure as time goes on it will put more moisture on my skin.</li>
            <li> Left it smooth and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, smells nice.</li>
            <li> This soap is not only healthy to use on the skin but also refreshing,Has helped calm and sooth my psoriasis and eczema</li>
            <li> Soft sudsy gentle exfoliating and non drying...had to buy more.</li>
            <li> I wish more products were like this, no strange chemicals.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Vanilla Oatmeal kind of this One with nature dead sea minerals soap collection and that one was fantastic.</li>
            <li> It has a nice aroma to it, as you would expect not very much aroma.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Which then after I get out of the shower my body is soft and it feels super moisturized!</li>
            <li> It cleared up my skin problems I had on my arms, left my skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lil grainy, nice earthy mild smell, used the first bar noticed no skin reaction, my skin type is combination, my mother in law is dry, my son normal, seems to do well for everyone, my husband doesn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> I love this soap and it will be my go to facial cleanser from now on!  </li>
            <li> Already feel the grainy texture that open your skin with many derm abrasion like grains.</li>
            <li> Any recommendations would be appreciated!</li>
            <li> There were several more, but I think this gives the idea of what you&#x27;re probably going to deal with.</li>
            <li> More drying then the regular over the counter body soap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It rinses on well and left my face feeling soothe and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> Love the pieces of mud that stick out like tiny exfoliators.</li>
            <li> but it’s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> These soaps are fantastic and One With Nature’s customer service was excellent in helping me discern the difference between the Dead Sea Mud and Dead Sea Salt soaps.</li>
            <li> but it’s pretty darn close.</li>

            <li> After my first use I could immediately see an improvement.</li>
            <li> First of all I ordered one</li>

            <li> I always make sure I have enough supply.  </li>
            <li> body acne but the ones that are there are pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li> This soap is excellent for stressed skin as it originates from the Dead Sea, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I prefer to put it onto a washcloth first, so the salt dissolves before i apply it to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Love this soap I actually signed up for auto delivery.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and natural.  </li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s heavenly-that get you clean, rinse off clean, and last forever.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a VERY active person but take great care in my skin, there is no drying or residue from this soap and the bar lasts forever, unlike a lot of natural bars that melt away.</li>
            <li> I have Clear and Healthy 20 year old looking skin!  </li>
            <li> I bought this just because I wanted to live more naturally, but when I used it in intimate places, it prevents girl problems.</li>
            <li> It will clean anything and leave your hands so soft.</li>
            <li> It is very earthy and mild so it does not dry your skin out and makes your skin feel really clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves you feeling clean and your skin is soft.  </li>

            <li> Love this soap, lasts a long while also.</li>
            <li> Also, the small bits in mud or whatever else provide a good exfoliating effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This most recent bar however,  has pieces of something in it that are so sharp,  I ended up with fairly prominent scratches across my body and face.</li>
            <li> No real smell, kinda gritty, but my skins feels amazing!</li>
            <li> Made my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy with this best soap, my skin really so soft n clean</li>
            <li> Good ingredients, long lasting, and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Last long and good smell.</li>
            <li> This works great to not only keep my face moisturized (although I also use hyaluronic acid for that) and also keeps the oil down.</li>
            <li> There are large grains of minerals, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using on your face.  </li>
            <li> I certainly hope not..</li>
            <li> It is a large bar</li>
            <li> so she is certain to get the soap every month.</li>
            <li> and it is a large bar.  </li>
            <li> It almost felt burnt and a bit itchy in certain places.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large</li>
            <li> Use it everyday on my face - I have not gotten as many pimples as I used to with this product!</li>
            <li> I love the slight fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight grit in the soap,  but that was never an issue, I actually really liked the gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Will definitely come back for more!</li>
            <li> I put the shavings in a bag and just used it as needed, the shavings will crumble so you could just slice the soap into larger chunks but for me the shavings work fine</li>
            <li> Not the actual little bits, which felt great as an exfoliant, but the salt.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mind having natural texture to the soap for a good scrub, but I don&#x27;t understand the abrasive little shards of rock in this.</li>
            <li> Cleans really well.</li>
            <li> The lather is dense and works very well.</li>
            <li> A gentle exfoliation on the skin</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This soap has you absolutely covered.  </li>
            <li> But it rubs into a lather and the silt  opens up clogged pores so gently you don&#x27;t even feel the abrasive particles as they work.  </li>
            <li> Cleans really well</li>
            <li> This bar really helps me.</li>
            <li> I like this for the neutral scent, the exfoliating nature, and the fact that lasts for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> But it really does help keep the skin in my legs from getting ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but this product was very drying.</li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> It was better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and find this soap very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have much of a scent.&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li> I am very picky about soap.</li>
            <li> But when I ordered it, it was only three dollars and change with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t pay that much.  </li>
            <li> Can use on face and whole body.</li>
            <li> Also very drying.</li>
            <li> Great soap without any unnecessary ingredients.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li> for my face, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I also like it but not so much as her.</li>
            <li> This soap is really gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> and it lathers really well.</li>
            <li> that cost three times as much as One with</li>
            <li> It really softens the water a lot.</li>
            <li> With Nature is a Jordan manufactured product, is as luxurious a soap like the Israel product, with twice the weight per bar, a reasonable price, and the ability to subscribe for monthly delivery.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i have to be gentle or it hurts to bathe with this.</li>
            <li> Do not expect too much from this otherwise.</li>
            <li> I purchased a prime eligible 5 pack at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> doesnt have much of a scent, which I dont mind.</li>
            <li> Really unacceptable.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> It has to much a a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smell which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell to entice you.</li>
            <li> and I find body washes to be much easier to use, but I like this.</li>
            <li> I have provided a picture of my arm right after using this soap and you can clearly see a cut extending up the forearm.</li>
            <li> My skin is uber sensitive, so the first time I used it, I got a little red, but put on some coconut oil, and since then, it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> Fine soap for regular use for normal skin.</li>
            <li> I found that my normal acne spot treatment worked better, but I&#x27;ve been trying to find natural products to take care of that because of synthetic chemicals in regular store products.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and has fine grains that exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Because of that, I tend to try out a LOT of natural soaps and this is not near the top of the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the clean scent left on my skin after a shower.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much, heck I barely notice it, but that&#x27;s kind of the point</li>
            <li> no lather whatsoever, but effective and long lasting</li>
            <li> Nice and clean-feeling, long lasting soap.</li>
            <li> fantastic, and rinses so well and lasts so long.  </li>
            <li> Using this in combination with my Skyroad bath mitts has made my skin SOFT for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> I know that it is supposed to be for exfoliating purposes, but honestly, it feels like I&#x27;m rubbing small scratchy sand across my body.</li>
            <li> When looking for something a step above the multi-pack of soap bars like Dove, but not as expensive as top of the line fancy soap, this is a good way to go.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice, big, solid bar of soap, but is too scratchy for my skin except for my legs though I&#x27;ve never considered myself the sensitive type.  </li>
            <li> First couple times I rubbed soap directly on my face...HUGE MISTAKE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy and looks to last a long time which is awesome for the price.</li>
            <li> I was referred to this product as well as African Black Soap ( No where near as good as this soap, but still decent ) due to the fact that I had fairly severe acne on my face, chest and back.</li>
            <li> I love this soap but it&#x27;s sharp!</li>
            <li> If you want more froth and less scratch, than you can use a puffy or washcloth.</li>
            <li> The more I use Amazon, the less I trust reviews.</li>
            <li> I like how the ingredient list is pretty short and recognizable.  </li>
            <li> Decent price.</li>
            <li> I was noticing how quickly it was going away with only a week camping.  </li>
            <li> Bought it to try, and I would buy it again, just would use a different washcloth method to lather it in order to keep it from being used up so quickly.</li>
            <li> Lathers very well and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a decent soap.  </li>
            <li> :) Totally recommend this soap and sender for my next purchase.</li>
            <li> I do not plan to continue to use this particular variant of &amp;#34;One</li>
            <li> mainly shower with it, but I have also used it in a bath of Epsom salts.  </li>
            <li> Decent soap, scratchy to the skin though.</li>
            <li> I gave this to a man who is older and</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have any particular scent, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little puzzled by the white color it took when first exposed to water, but after some use it returned to a more brown color.</li>
            <li> Though after the first few times the soap felt softer, and I found that putting directly on my skin helped better to eliminate my skin problems.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t hurt maybe to have a little more cinnamon in it to give it a little more smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks... Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Shannon Little</li>
            <li> Big soap that exfoliates my skin leaving it soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild scent washes off completely, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li> All natural soap that gently exfoliates your skin.  </li>
            <li> The cinnamon falls under the category of fragrance for allergy sufferers, so those who are sensitive should really take note.  </li>
            <li> A clear label would be very beneficial.</li>
            <li> It really exfoliates when held in the palm of your hand and applied directly to skin.</li>
            <li> Way longer than a normal bar of soap.</li>
            <li> realize everyone&#x27;s skin will react differently to this soap, but it is definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the dead sea mud soap.</li>
            <li> This soap has dead sea salts embedded in it which provides a refreshing stimulus while showering.</li>
            <li> One With Nature Dead Sea Mud soap was just OK.</li>
            <li> Her face looks alot better after just a few days and my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> Their soaps all lather quickly and the bar lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried the Shea Moisture brand African Black Soap, and liked that a lot, but found the smell a bit strong and the price a little high.</li>
            <li> It lathers and it is nice and scratchy (seriously, I like that).</li>
            <li> It seemed to get more expensive and often wasn&#x27;t available in Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> Probably just because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Since first using a Dead Sea Mud based soap that has no perfume added, my skin, especially my face, is less oily, feels cleaner and more comfortable to be living-in, and I experience far fewer blemishes.</li>
            <li> Pretty gritty.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this soap and this soap alone, which I use to wash my face, has been keeping my acne and blackheads under better control than the small arsenal of skin care products I had in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  washed my face and shoulders with this every morning for about a week and my acne is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> The gritty mud pieces exfoliated my skin very well!</li>
            <li> went from US$8.50 in shekels in the Israel shop and Israel online store, to $12 for my first purchase off Amazon (Israel site can&#x27;t be reached from the USA), to $18 when I was planning a second purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I just love using this soap, not sure if its doing what it suppose to do</li>
            <li> It smells pretty natural, and the ingredients list is short.</li>
            <li> I normally break out everywhere when I travel back home to Ghana..and yet thanks to this</li>
            <li> It works just as good as some of the more expensive brand names that I have bought in the past,</li>
            <li> I have oily T zone, takes it right off without leaving feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Not a bad price in comparison to other natural soaps.</li>
            <li> certain she will want to continue buying this soap, and she has told several friends about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Certainly dries your skin; almost as much as regular soap does.</li>
            <li> like this Dead Sea mud soap because it really calms stressed skin, has no scent of it&#x27;s own, and is very long lasting even with 2 people hitting it hard.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> I love it, it has little pieces inside, acting like a vitalizing body scub.</li>
            <li> This soap dries hard and just sits on top of this soap saver.  </li>
            <li> Wash your face TWICE a day and no less!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the strong fragrance some other specialty soaps have which I definitely appreciate.</li>
            <li> It took a couple weeks of use before I really started seeing my skin clear up (which can seem like a lifetime if you&#x27;re itching constantly), but everything is under control now</li>
            <li> On a whim, I picked up a bar of this, and it&#x27;s just as kind and gentle to our skin as the soaps that are 3x as expensive.</li>
            <li> Now, personally, I use this soap directly on my hands and the granules don’t do much,</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin (eczema prone) and I bought this based on the reviews that it helps.  </li>
            <li> If you have naturally soft skin</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this soap..nor if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My search continues to find a smooth and silky dead sea mud soap.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin, like I have.</li>
            <li> I look young</li>
            <li> Was looking for something naturally abrasive to skin but also purifying.</li>
            <li> To get a real exfoliation with this, go to your local Target and get some of The Bathery’s shower gloves.</li>
            <li> I like the texture and the natural smell.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast and the product was just what I needed- ordering in bulk next time.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid over $15 for some bars of soap but this product really delivers for only $3!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care too much for the micro grains mixed in the bar soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve contacted the company directly regarding this issue and they have not even responded with a courtesy email to notify me that they acknowledge my correspondence.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The grit in this bar is not overly abrasive, but it is there, so if you choose to use the bar directly on your skin like I do, expect it to feel like you are scratching with medium pressure.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like there is any soap residue and for that reason it has helped my sensitive skin from soap irritation.  </li>
            <li> I did not like this soap, its not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As far as the smell, it&#x27;s rather earthy, but you can get this soap in a variety of scents.</li>
            <li> and so far I am getting a lot of benefits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that this soap has somewhat of an exfoliating nature and you need to be cautious going over the skin if you are sensitive, or look into the lavender option of this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> We like the natural ingredients in the soap too,</li>
            <li> Adult acne is going away.</li>
            <li> Used to get this at the local Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use this soap directly on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve found better are the dead sea salt scrubs</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Dead Sea products and have been for many years now.  </li>
            <li> I have a thing for Dead Sea products as they say the Dead Sea is so good for you.</li>
            <li> This soap melts too easily and gets too slick to hold in hand.  </li>
            <li> The smell of is quite mild, but it left my skin too dry and prone to irritation.</li>
            <li> the mud in it is highly textured almost reminding me of an apricot facial scrub with the &amp;#34;scrubby bits&amp;#34; in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall a sudsy, natural smelling soap experience.</li>
            <li> It cleanses without drying, and I have pretty dry skin!</li>
            <li> This especially works well in winter as extra hot h2o, and your heat dries your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this particular one for my face only when I have applied sunscreen for outdoor activities.</li>
            <li> (you can feel the little bits of mud doing their job) but your skin feels super clean without feeling dried out.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, it has some little grit in it for exfoliating, it is large and&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very expensive -- if you have dry, flaky, and/or sensitive skin, you should give it a try.</li>
            <li> I started using this as my daily face soap and within a few days my skin was soft and nearly free of eczema.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I feel this product definitely deserves one...</li>
            <li> It also lathers very well, which is a little unusual for this type of soap.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with it is that it seemed to be eaten up rather quickly in comparison to other soaps.  </li>
            <li> And although it&#x27;s not made with Dead Sea mud, Dudu Osun Black Soap is absolutely my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Really helped my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with it wearing too fast, I just let it dry when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If left in shower with too much moisture does seem to take on a slimy feel but this seems to be the case with bar soap, with 3 people using it to last about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Forget those wimpy four ounce soaps that are typically sold at the store; One With Nature gives you your money&#x27;s worth and then some.</li>
            <li> Though it is certainly an exfoliating soap, it uses actual large particles of black dirt to get the job done, and if you use this soap in the bath tub you will find yourself cleaning dirt out of the tub afterwards.</li>
            <li> No other soap in our house in the shower/bath.</li>
            <li> Bar is made just fine, seems hard keeping shape.</li>
            <li> Then I began to rub it on a wet wash cloth upon entering shower leaving on duration of shower, finally rinsing  off with cool water last just before getting out.</li>
            <li> My skin was a little dryer and more sensitive than it was with the Black Soap.</li>
            <li> This bar will last a few months easily for men especially and women.</li>
            <li> Compared to some of the other dead sea soaps I&#x27;ve tried this is also more affordable.</li>
            <li> Used every other day for 2 mths and it has really helped to calm severe eczema and lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and buffed, but it&#x27;s hard for me to go with a full five stars.</li>
            <li> I deducted a star because the bar is much bigger than regular soaps and I had a hard time gripping it while moving it in circular motion to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> My son used to have eczema and we were using another brand of shea butter soap that helped clear it up and this is working just as well as it still hasn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> As an adult man and only user of this bar, I get just over one month of use from this bar of soap.</li>
            <li> He used to use only Old Spice body wash for years</li>
            <li> The bar itself will scratch my skin if I&#x27;m not careful, but if I use a washcloth it somewhat negates the exfoliating quality of it.</li>
            <li> My scars and acne have almost completely disappeared and it&#x27;s only been 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> his skin is starting to get really sensitive and papery and he also gets rashes from things.</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud soap is WELL WORTH the price that you pay.  </li>
            <li> I love the little black pieces in it.</li>
            <li> My skin is very prone to be dry and flaky, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> and this does not dry it out!  </li>
            <li> Large, long lasting, and doesn&#x27;t leave an icky film like so many other bar soaps.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the quick shipment as this is the only soap my son can use for his dermatitis, and this soap is very hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating with the shea butter and other moisturizing ingredients.  </li>
            <li> gave me long scratches on my skin with only simple gentle scrubbing.</li>
            <li> As it left red bruised patches on my skin...too Abrasive for direct contact with my face.</li>
            <li> Does not dry my skin out or even bother my patches.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud soap is supposed to be on the more exfoliating end of the spectrum with granules in it to scrub away dead skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made soap from mostly palm oil with nothing artificial - it has no SLS and no EDTA, which are the two often-used ingredients that give me rashes and allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I assume this came from a defective batch, perhaps some unknown material made its way into the particular batch of soap that this bar came from.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap because it does not dry his skin.</li>
            <li> soap cleans terrifically and has really brought my complexion issues which I have struggled with since middle school under control to levels that I haven’t seen in any other product to date.</li>
            <li> Lasts long doesn&#x27;t melt in the shower and the scrubbing action is invigorating.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, a little rosacea in my cheeks, quick to burn, prone to dryness, redness, ingrown hairs and those little bumps on the backs of my arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lathers very well, even in hard water, and does not leave skin dried out as many other bars.  </li>
            <li> It is a little on the large side, so</li>
            <li> , it does break down very fast so keep it dry when not in use.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t help with my psoriasis, and it didn&#x27;t feel any different from other high end soaps.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is you must guard it from extra water when not using otherwise wit will run out quickly.</li>
            <li> Firm large bar.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin so much like all the other soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Meaning, your tub/shower get dirty pretty quickly when you use this soap.  </li>
            <li> It really softens the skin and makes my psoriasis less dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> no, not yet as I am trying other natural soaps, but this soap is a contender for exclusiveity</li>
            <li> It is such a big bar it will last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do have a big of back acne, which I hope it would eradicate completely, but it didn&#x27;t, though it did help; I have less back acne</li>
            <li> and it last a long time definitely will buy again</li>
            <li> interesting soap, but there are little hard minerals or sand in it that feels really rough on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly doubt it&#x27;s from the Dead Sea,</li>
            <li> ; DR: I have sensitive skin and prefer Shea Moisture&#x27;s African Black Soap</li>
            <li> Long lasting bar of soap.  </li>
            <li> Is appearing to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> Doesnt last as long as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> so it did not last as long (a month and three weeks)</li>
            <li> Has last me a long time will buy again.</li>
            <li> so it last a long time when just being used on your face.</li>
            <li> I prefer to lather the bar in my hands to wash down with once, then take the bar directly to my skin to scrub with.</li>
            <li> Again..don&#x27;t purchase this soap if you have soft, sensitive skin that cannot handle hard &amp; abrasive grains in it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I decided to try any other soap other than the ones that I used to get from India.&lt;br /&gt;This was suggested to me by my friend due to some acne flare ups for my wife.  </li>
            <li> plus, this is probably the only soap that I use where I don&#x27;t need to use any sort of cream or lotion on my face from dry</li>
            <li> I have used this especially for dry heels and under my feet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any skin conditions, and not super sensitive either.</li>
            <li> After I use this soap, my body feels as soft as it did when I actually got out of the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> a big, heavy, solid bar: worth at least 2+ of &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; soaps.</li>
            <li> Only down side is it can dry out skin a little too much.</li>
            <li> I used this twice so far and my acne seems to have gotten under control and a little smother looking.</li>
            <li> But, I will say it might be a little scratchy for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But if you have sensitive skin, the little &amp;#34;salt rocks&amp;#34; in the soap might scratch you.  </li>
            <li> If you have tough, oily skin you might really like it but careful on the sensitive bits.</li>
            <li> Lasts long.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower everyday and it makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> ; rinses off w/o drying your skin; lasts a long time when using as a face or body bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -</li>
            <li> ACNE SOAP THAT LASTS LONG; AND WORKS</li>
            <li> Smell is not offending at all, lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t get gummy.</li>
            <li> Quite a gritty soap, but I expected that.</li>
            <li> I hate soaps with too much fragrance and whatever chemicals that smell too strong.</li>
            <li> well spent.ave struggled with since middle school under control to levels that I haven’t seen in any other product to date.</li>
            <li> Beware giant sharp granuls which can cause scrapes.  </li>
            <li> I dislike &amp;#34;plain&amp;#34; bar soap; such as Dove, but if you do not like the grit, the other scents of this brand do not have it.</li>
            <li> I noticed other reviewers saying that they used it as a facial bar, and I have not tried that.</li>
            <li> Not only is it not a 4/5 star product, but it actually is a small step above Irish Springs, which dries the hell out of your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels a bit dry after using.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too dry.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to moisturize if you&#x27;re prone to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it to wash away the residual debris and makeup on my face after using a cleanser, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face either.</li>
            <li> Doesnt leave my skin dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry; it&#x27;s oily; it&#x27;s about to break out in a rash because of some nearby plants or cleaning products.</li>
            <li> and I feel that this product relieves my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> You can rub the whole bar on your body for some serious exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I use to use only Dove soap, but now I only use Dead Sea Mineral soap.</li>
            <li> I also had read an article about how to make single serving soap sheets...</li>
            <li> They are either paid reviews, or there are lots of unintelligent (I wish Amazon would let me use a more descriptive word...)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little hard to handle at first b/c</li>
            <li> Also, I live in NC and the water is hard here.</li>
            <li> Now that is some sharp soap, and I mean that very literally.</li>
            <li> This soap bar lasted me 5 and a half weeks with daily use.</li>
            <li> I have a little extra grease on my face when i get home from work</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other bar soaps.</li>
            <li> tried some Ahava brand Dead Sea products, and while I liked the smell, my skin reacted badly.</li>
            <li> I am a 26 year old man and by no means have delicate skin, so you can imagine what it may be like if you do.</li>
            <li> The lather is creamy, lathers like you Grandpas wet shave with the brush.</li>
            <li> Your Military Dermatology Sp.  </li>
            <li> Kinda has a rough texture once you rub it together with some water</li>
            <li> minimal scent -</li>
            <li> I have only been using this soap for a few months, and it has already gotten rid of 95% of my acne..  </li>
            <li> I bought my daughter a Dead Sea facial mud mask.</li>
            <li> The sand doesn&#x27;t dissolve though so you have to be careful going over knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say on the packaging, it comes in a plastic wrap that you&#x27;d expect a soap to come</li>
            <li> This is money well spent.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of dead sea products.  </li>
            <li> Careful - exfoliating bits cut my skin</li>
            <li> The rough grain of this soap, like pumice, works well for me but may not be for everyone.  </li>
            <li> The grains were a bit abrasive and rough.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m partial to Soul Nourishing&#x27;s though www.</li>
            <li> I am looking for an alternative product since there might not be sufficient supply of Dead Sea Salt from the Middle East.  </li>
            <li> Minimal scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very glamorous-looking in the bath...</li>
            <li> I expected a softer soap..</li>
            <li> I also tried the Dead Sea Salt soap, and found it to be the same.</li>
            <li> extremely rough on skin.</li>
            <li> It also has a sandiness to it that was scratchy and kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> the exfoliating minerals or whatever is in it are quite sharp, and actually hurt a little if you&#x27;re trying to rub the soap on your body.  </li>
            <li> Soap is fairly rough due to the sea salt crystals.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t rub bars of soap on our skin, we take our washcloth and rub it on the soap and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> soap is made very tightly, meaning there is almost no air gaps or air bubbles resulting in a dense heavy compact soap...which means your soap will last a long time, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tight and dry feeling like other soaps have.  </li>
            <li> is actually getting the dead skin off my body!</li>
            <li> I can see this working on other people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day for the past three weeks, and I&#x27;m guessing it will last me another week.</li>
            <li> Was like any other soap plus scrubbing effect.</li>
            <li> Extremely drying and made my face itchy.</li>
            <li> I will be trying the other frangrances.</li>
            <li> Men seem to like soaps as gifts long as it&#x27;s not too fluffy</li>
            <li> The new blemish that was joining the infinitely increasing family actually decreased in size and eventually disappeared with the rest of them.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin or leave any icky feeling residue.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different &#x27;Dead Sea&#x27; soaps for my psoriasis because I read that it could be helpful.</li>
            <li> was hoping that it wouldn&#x27;t be irritating to my skin as my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> a little rough on tender skin</li>
            <li> It can be a little on the rough side</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of different treatment options and had a really hard time finding something that worked.</li>
            <li> usually you don&#x27;t find these hard grains in soap unless the soap is marked &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; on the label..which this soap isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, it did not do what it claimed nor did it meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Expensive, and it can really scratch your skin if you rub it hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not fun.</li>
            <li> I hope the price goes down.  </li>
            <li> I even tried it as an overnight mask on my bikini line and it calmed down those stubborn ingrown hair bumps a bit.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this stuff, havente even tried the other scents yet!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like other mud soaps I have tried, this one too sort of leaves a black or gray residue on my skin, especially my hands - also on my white towels (it washed out).  </li>
            <li> if you have smaller hands, it&#x27;s a little hard to keep a grip on it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It took a few washes before the issue began but it seems that bits of a reddish-orange, sharp substance, which I&#x27;ve not seen in previous bars, began to be exposed in the soap.</li>
            <li> I contacted them and explained the problem and that I was past the due date of returning this soap to the store I purchased it from..and if they could send me any other mineral soap they had that did not have abrasive grains in it..</li>
            <li> It does have a slight &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; texture to it, so</li>
            <li> Just wish I could buy it in bulk for less.....</li>
            <li> The problem is the small particles in the soap are so abrasive that I actually had small cuts all over my body after using it.</li>
            <li> I like the slight cinnamon smell and also the feel of it.</li>
            <li> not super lathery, but i have faith in mineral goodness it brings to the table</li>
            <li> Only complaint i have is that it is messy and leaves a residue in the shower on the bar holder.  </li>
            <li> Slightly abbrasive.</li>
            <li> When I saw this item as an add-on for a lower price than the Black Soap, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as if I was washing with very sharp little pieces of stone in my soap.</li>
            <li> other soaps I&#x27;ve tried just made it worse, so I was amazed when I saw it the next morning.  </li>
            <li> due to sensitive skin, we&#x27;ve been buying some terribly expensive shea butter soaps.</li>
            <li> The little black specks are not sand or salt.</li>
            <li> The sand hurts a little, though.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s a little too abrasive and ends up leaving scratch marks</li>
            <li> Was a little nervous to use it on my face, even at age 60 allergies still make it break out and</li>
            <li> it has little to no fragrance which i prefer.  </li>
            <li> Is a little bit drying.</li>
            <li> I ordered it to round up my order</li>
            <li> I would order again if I need to round up an order again.</li>
            <li> It has some grit to it for exfoliating and does not seem to leave my skin dried out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap a few times since I received it</li>
            <li> I like the Dead Sea Salt, one, too.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out a lot, made me break out.</li>
            <li> After washing up I always feel like my dead cells are scrubbed off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks, and already suggested it to a few friends.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates but doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dried out.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for my face everyday and it is like giving myself a face mask everyday except quicker.</li>
            <li> and I heard a lit about dead sea soap</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud soap is not a miracle product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It exfoliates the dead skin that comes along with psoriasis and doesn&#x27;t cause inflammation.  </li>
            <li> You can feel the minerals scrubby away the dead sky.</li>
            <li> This is the replacement product that I found after the price of the Dead Sea Mud Soap</li>
            <li> I am a believer of the benefits of Dead Sea Salt</li>
            <li> The soap dish is always messy looking.</li>
            <li> I like heavily scented soap</li>
            <li> or it may not be for everyday use as I did not get any noticeable difference on my face.</li>
            <li> This soap was way too harsh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my everyday soap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than the dead sea mud soap I used to use.</li>
            <li> This review is for the \\&quot;Dead Sea Mud\\&quot; variety of this soap.</li>
            <li> So I purchased the Dead Sea mud soap.</li>
            <li> For a sort of Poor Gal&#x27;s Spa steam facial treatment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like bar soaps, they are just too messy to keep in the shower</li>
            <li> Some other soaps I have used lately sorta soften up and melt onto my soap saver http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFA66/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3  </li>
            <li> No strong scent.</li>
            <li> After 2 spine surgeries in 1.5 years, bathing is difficult I get dead skin in odd spots like my upper arms.  </li>
            <li> No strong smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if all Dead Sea Mud soaps are like this one..</li>
            <li> had previously gotten one for my mother though she hardly used it and said it made her skin kinda dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Of course, don’t rub yourself raw</li>
            <li> Not having to worry about absorbing bad chemicals into my system.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this line of One With Nature in the past.  </li>
            <li> But the bar is too small for me.</li>
            <li> Though not nearly as many as when I was</li>
            <li> Not sure how this soap helps people with eczema.</li>
            <li> Not magical.  </li>
            <li> It looks like something robbery like little specks of tire grinds --  seriously.</li>
            <li> After three weeks using this soap, my daughter&#x27;s complexion became worse and worse to the point that inflamed red eczema and acne covered her face and it puffed with displeasure.  </li>
            <li> only bad part is I found a lot of build up around my drain; it doesn&#x27;t flow down as cleanly a plain ivory soap.</li>
            <li> I wish this company had listed on the label this soap had hard grains in it..</li>
            <li> (my acne had added about 30 minutes to my makeup routine because it was so hard to cover up).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and hard milled</li>
            <li> lather, and another plus for me at least, is the fact that it re-dries hard.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells a little bit like mud, but not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely terrible product; I am shocked this has 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This bar has lasted almost a month and there is a least another months use, and I shower AT LEAST once a day.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Skin felt smoother and moisturized, even in winter time (at least for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> is that the product isn&#x27;t filled with artificial fragrances that could anger your skin.</li>
            <li> Grainy but not a nice name</li>
            <li> Creates a thick, mucky texture in my soap dish which clogged my tub a bit.  </li>
            <li> Feeling green and glamorous!!</li>
            <li> I hate those dinky little 4 oz things-they last about 4 days.</li>
            <li> Seriously, my one bar, used with a sisal washcloth in the shower, has lasted about 3 months already.</li>
            <li> Plus, it has a really subtle smell, which I like since I don&#x27;t like smelling like flowers, etc.</li>
            <li> not a good soap to just leave a bar in the shower.</li>
            <li> but this soap had very hard grains in it that scratched and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t press very hard at all, so that isn&#x27;t the issue.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got addicted to it too.</li>
            <li> I got worse.</li>
            <li> The smell is very subtle.</li>
            <li> I dont have very bad back</li>
            <li> Kinda weird.</li>
            <li> Dealing with eczema is awful, especially when you don&#x27;t fully understand what triggers it.</li>
            <li> So, needless to say, I am blown away.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> Sorry did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> I am wary about ordering anything from the One with Nature line</li>
            <li> Sorry if TMI, but this needs to get out to all the girls.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> and they felt horrible on my wet skin..</li>
            <li> I like to take cold showers a lot</li>
            <li> This soap causes my dyshidrosis to flare up like CRAZY, and it dries out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad it melts away</li>
            <li> Very painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now obsessed with this brand!!!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a nasty scratch.  </li>
            <li> You will not need one of those awful heel shaving devices.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried this on a whim and I LOVE it!!! Makes my skin feel wonderful; I have excessively dry skin and this does not dry it out!  Love it.  Amazon, you better re-stock it.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Cleans really well. No strong scent.</li>
            <li> The good thing about this bar is that it lasts forever.  Way longer than a normal bar of soap. Also, the small bits in mud or whatever else provide a good exfoliating effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad part is I found a lot of build up around my drain; it doesn&#x27;t flow down as cleanly a plain ivory soap.</li>
            <li> This soap bar lasted me 5 and a half weeks with daily use. I like it but it hasn&#x27;t worked any miracles on my skin : ).</li>
            <li> Smells Amazing! Lathers great &amp; lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> This soap has cleared up my acne and also makes my skin look and feel great, my son and daughter have also used it and it has also cleared up their break outs.  It appears to work on all skin types.</li>
            <li> Best bar on the market.  Course ingredients scrub you.  Smells great.  Purest ingredients.  No other soap in our house in the shower/bath.</li>
            <li> I am a mineral freak so I bought this to see what it was like.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; is a bit course at times but over all, I do like the soap.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again because it feels &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and free of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Amazing price! Great soap for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> All natural soap that gently exfoliates your skin.  Non-drying.  Very mild scent.  Fantastic!!  Also noteworthy is many good quality soaps are crazy-overpriced ($8-$10). At only $4 I feel this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> will buy again. nice on skin and washes fine cool scent.,</li>
            <li> Best soap eva! Love the scrubby inside. Doesn&#x27;t shrink up fast, big bar, smells great! Good for women and men.</li>
            <li> After three weeks using this soap, my daughter&#x27;s complexion became worse and worse to the point that inflamed red eczema and acne covered her face and it puffed with displeasure.  We obviously discarded the soap and now owe the allergist&#x27;s office a thousand dollars to find out that she is allergic to fragrances.  Your ingredient label does *not* indicate that you include fragrance, but I noted that you indicate that it has light and clean scent or something of that nature.  The cinnamon falls under the category of fragrance for allergy sufferers, so those who are sensitive should really take note.  If one is not allergic, then that may be a completely different story.  A clear label would be very beneficial.</li>
            <li> After 2 spine surgeries in 1.5 years, bathing is difficult I get dead skin in odd spots like my upper arms.  This does the trick!  The only thing I&#x27;ve found better are the dead sea salt scrubs but I can&#x27;t do them myself. I have used this on my face &amp; body and it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a big, heavy, solid bar: worth at least 2+ of &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; soaps. The lather is dense and works very well.</li>
            <li> This is the best for exfoliating the skin without leaving my skin feeling dry. Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Pretty gritty. Cleans well enough I suppose. My skin feels a bit dry after using. The sand hurts a little, though. Not sure I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought for my Niece,I will purchase more of it.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this product and have used it daily on my face.  I purchased it because I had always heard that Dead Sea minerals was really good for your skin.  Kudos to One With Nature!  I love this soap and it will be my go to facial cleanser from now on!  Many thanks for a great product that is very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Okay just used the huge bar, double 2.5 coast bars and perhaps you are close. Had some pumice in it but, not enough. The lather is creamy, lathers like you Grandpas wet shave with the brush. Do not feel dried out as much ,am sure as time goes on it will put more moisture on my skin. The best moister is water, once dry, apply favorite lotion or cream, then slammo bammo! This especially works well in winter as extra hot h2o, and your heat dries your skin.  Your Military Dermatology Sp.  Will write a head line in 3 to 5 days  Monday afternoon, am loving this mud soap more and more each time shower time. Just use the bar on your skin. Already feel the grainy texture that open your skin with many derm abrasion like grains. Now the Mudd runs in as that happens! Bar is made just fine, seems hard keeping shape. This bar will last a few months easily for men especially and women.</li>
            <li> If you like smooth soap, this may not be the product for you. However, if you like the exfoliating feeling of little granules in the soap, as I do, then this soap is awesome!  In addition to the \\&quot;scrubby\\&quot; feeling, it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent.  It just smells pleasant and gets you clean. At the end, it rinses away completely and leaves your skin feeling fantastic! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years now,  I love it.  I used to purchase the soap at a local store; however, the prices spiked.  I got a good price at Amazon.  Very pleased with the price and the quality of the soap.  This is the only soap I use.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, is smooth feeling and smells great! A gentle exfoliation on the skin and I love it in the bath and shower. I believe it is a good price, would appreciate a 2 or 4 pack.</li>
            <li> a little rough on tender skin</li>
            <li> This works great on my skin making it feel nice and smooth. I actually have this on subscribe and save every month. Perfect scrub with Argan oil so it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too dry.</li>
            <li> Really helped my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is great.  Not only does it exfoliate (you can feel the little bits of mud doing their job) but your skin feels super clean without feeling dried out.  The scent was neither here nor there.  Using this in combination with my Skyroad bath mitts has made my skin SOFT for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin (eczema prone) and I bought this based on the reviews that it helps.  It did not help my daughter at all... I guess it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> Lovely soap.  I love it!  After one use, you can tell how it works.</li>
            <li> Ladies, great for the complexion. Men, perfect for using before or after shaving.</li>
            <li> This soap is great. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin so much like all the other soaps I&#x27;ve tried. Also, the fact that it&#x27;s so natural is great. Not having to worry about absorbing bad chemicals into my system.</li>
            <li> After one month of continuous use, I can say that it appears to be working!</li>
            <li> Creates a thick, mucky texture in my soap dish which clogged my tub a bit.  Kinda weird.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SOAP!  Great for battling acne</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap! Lasts long.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I use it in the shower everyday and it makes my skin so soft. It&#x27;s rough and is a great exfoliation!</li>
            <li> Long lasting bar of soap.  Highly doubt it&#x27;s from the Dead Sea, maybe so.  It is a very nice soap though.  I ordered it to round up my order so I didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping.  I would order again if I need to round up an order again.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this soap and love the mild scent! It has some grit to it for exfoliating and does not seem to leave my skin dried out. So far, I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> This stuff has made a huge difference in my skin. My problems with roscea have disappeared, no acne, and my skin actually glows. Even my friends asked me what I&#x27;d been using!!</li>
            <li> Nice lather.  Good scrubbing soap.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating with the shea butter and other moisturizing ingredients.  There are large grains of minerals, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using on your face.  You&#x27;ll get a nasty scratch.  The graininess is great for exfoliating the body.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, it did not do what it claimed nor did it meet my expectations. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used as face wash and it made skin feel great. Thanks</li>
            <li> Nicely made and sized.</li>
            <li> Worried about pores clogged with stagnate body oils?  This soap has you absolutely covered.  At its core, it is nothing but fine sand.  But it rubs into a lather and the silt  opens up clogged pores so gently you don&#x27;t even feel the abrasive particles as they work.  This soap is also packed with minerals.  Many of them are great for skin, and others love the remaining harmful stagnate oils.  The oils are caught up in the frothy soap suds with the minerals and washed away.  Your worries are over!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if all Dead Sea Mud soaps are like this one..I certainly hope not..but this soap had very hard grains in it that scratched and irritated my skin. Whatever these abrasive grains are they are a black/dark brown in color and they felt horrible on my wet skin..as if I was washing with very sharp little pieces of stone in my soap. If you have naturally soft skin like I do I would not recommend this soap..nor if you have sensitive skin. I wish this company had listed on the label this soap had hard grains in it..usually you don&#x27;t find these hard grains in soap unless the soap is marked &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; on the label..which this soap isn&#x27;t. To the credit of this company..I contacted them and explained the problem and that I was past the due date of returning this soap to the store I purchased it from..and if they could send me any other mineral soap they had that did not have abrasive grains in it..to which they replied they could send me their Sea Salt soap. I received their Sea Salt soap and was very happy with it. Again..don&#x27;t purchase this soap if you have soft, sensitive skin that cannot handle hard &amp; abrasive grains in it. My search continues to find a smooth and silky dead sea mud soap. Any recommendations would be appreciated!</li>
            <li> This is the best soap ever! It lasts a long time and has fine grains that exfoliate. Cleans really well and I will never use another (I&#x27;ve tried many soaps)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap a few times since I received it and I&#x27;m totally in love with it! Kinda has a rough texture once you rub it together with some water but, honestly I feel like the roughness of the bar is actually getting the dead skin off my body! Which then after I get out of the shower my body is soft and it feels super moisturized! The smell is definitely a mud smell but, it doesn&#x27;t linger on your body afterwards! For the price I&#x27;d buy a bunch of these just to know I have them in the closet! Never been a fan of bar soap just because of that texture it leaves on your hands and body but, this thank god doesn&#x27;t do that!&lt;br /&gt;So, overall an awesome buy and I think if you like earthy stuff this is perfect for you! (:</li>
            <li> great soap. even my husband loves it</li>
            <li> Love this soap, perfect.</li>
            <li> I wish this was more moisturizing. The smell is great and the scrubbies in it are like a back scratcher! awesome!</li>
            <li> I like this soap, need to get more!</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful!  It does have a slight &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; texture to it, so a cloth or loofah may be best if you have extremely sensitive skin.  Lathers very well, even in hard water, and does not leave skin dried out as many other bars.  May want to rinse surfaces after using, the suds do leave a bit of residue.</li>
            <li> You cannot beat the value, here-these soaps are BIG. I hate those dinky little 4 oz things-they last about 4 days. One With Nature makes an incredible line of soaps-get the Lemon Verbena, it&#x27;s heavenly-that get you clean, rinse off clean, and last forever. Makes lots of suds-you can even rub the bars on your shower puffy.&lt;br /&gt;I like this Dead Sea mud soap because it really calms stressed skin, has no scent of it&#x27;s own, and is very long lasting even with 2 people hitting it hard.&lt;br /&gt;Try them. I like the Dead Sea Salt, one, too.</li>
            <li> Dealing with eczema is awful, especially when you don&#x27;t fully understand what triggers it. I tried a lot of different treatment options and had a really hard time finding something that worked. I finally started trying different soaps and this was the one that worked best for me. It took a couple weeks of use before I really started seeing my skin clear up (which can seem like a lifetime if you&#x27;re itching constantly), but everything is under control now and I&#x27;m really happy with this product, so much so that I set up a subscription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very minimal scent - What you can smell is gender neutral&lt;br /&gt;Big size - Each bar lasts me about a month&lt;br /&gt;Abrasive/Gritty - Good for exfoliation&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients - My skin feels great after using it&lt;br /&gt;Effective for skin conditions - It helps a lot with eczema&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Abrasive/Gritty - This one cuts both ways. Sometimes it&#x27;s a little too abrasive and ends up leaving scratch marks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works really well for me, but I encourage everyone to try out a bunch of options to see what works best for them.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST SOAP EVER!.....EVER!</li>
            <li> This is great soap especially for dry winter skin</li>
            <li> Firm large bar. Nice package and great smell.</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic. It leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized. It does not dry out my skin or leave any icky feeling residue. It also lathers very well, which is a little unusual for this type of soap. While I realize that suds are not an indication of anything, I like when they are present. I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin, like I have. This bar has lasted almost a month and there is a least another months use, and I shower AT LEAST once a day.</li>
            <li> I have severe psoriasis. This bar really helps me. Does not dry my skin out or even bother my patches. The smell is very subtle. It is such a big bar it will last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;I have even shaved some off to soak in a bath.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like other mud soaps I have tried, this one too sort of leaves a black or gray residue on my skin, especially my hands - also on my white towels (it washed out).  It IS soothing and lathers well, but I will have to try another non-mud soap.</li>
            <li> worth the price. I was able to see improvements in my skin after 1 week use.</li>
            <li> I have used this line of One With Nature in the past.  Their soaps all lather quickly and the bar lasts a long time.  It is a little on the large side, so if you have smaller hands, it&#x27;s a little hard to keep a grip on it in the shower.  I&#x27;m using this particular one for my face only when I have applied sunscreen for outdoor activities.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SOAP! Just wish I could buy it in bulk for less.....</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out a lot, made me break out. Probably just because my skin is very sensitive. I can see this working on other people.</li>
            <li> This has become one of my favorite soap brands.&lt;br /&gt;This soap lasts a very long time and is a great value.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is non-drying and has improved my skin.</li>
            <li> After washing up I always feel like my dead cells are scrubbed off and I&#x27;m good as new. Very refreshing!</li>
            <li> The best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Don&#x27;t forget to moisturize if you&#x27;re prone to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I feel this product definitely deserves one... I was referred to this product as well as African Black Soap ( No where near as good as this soap, but still decent ) due to the fact that I had fairly severe acne on my face, chest and back. I have only been using this soap for a few months, and it has already gotten rid of 95% of my acne..  I still have the occasional zit pop up, but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another plus, this is probably the only soap that I use where I don&#x27;t need to use any sort of cream or lotion on my face from dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize everyone&#x27;s skin will react differently to this soap, but it is definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of soap but not this variant. I prefer the Rose Petal and Lavender.</li>
            <li> Great for myself and daughters sensitive skin. We are allergic to sulfas, main ingredient in most soaps. So its great to find one (other than glycerin) that works well. Did get darker after two weeks, so it is a deep muddy brown color now but still works.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, lasts a long while also.</li>
            <li> Pros:  * Has helped calm and sooth my psoriasis and eczema  * Only 9 Ingredients, all of which i can pronounce  * Smells great  * Has a nice grit to it  * it sooths my irritated skin  (have to list it twice, its the only soap i&#x27;ve used so far that has been able to make it feel better)    Cons:  * It wouldn&#x27;t hurt maybe to have a little more cinnamon in it to give it a little more smell.  But why mess with something i&#x27;d consider close to perfect.</li>
            <li> This soap is great. Gently exfoliating with a delightful smell. Makes a great addition to subscribe-and-save.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My skin feels awesome!</li>
            <li> I like this product, no complaints. It is a large bar and so it lasts longer</li>
            <li> This is a great soap, it is very cleansing yet gentle.  I like to take cold showers a lot and it still lathers well under the cool water (many soaps do not).  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks, and already suggested it to a few friends.</li>
            <li> This soap literally makes your skin so soft, I don&#x27;t care to much for the scent, but I love how gentle it feels, I plan on buying more soaps from this company. (:</li>
            <li> The little black specks are not sand or salt. It looks like something robbery like little specks of tire grinds --  seriously. My skin did not feel any different. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but for this I need to keep people informed because this product lured me in with an excellent rating. The smell is good, the size is good, and it seems like it does its job. The problem is the small particles in the soap are so abrasive that I actually had small cuts all over my body after using it. Now I don&#x27;t press very hard at all, so that isn&#x27;t the issue. I have provided a picture of my arm right after using this soap and you can clearly see a cut extending up the forearm. There were several more, but I think this gives the idea of what you&#x27;re probably going to deal with. I am a 26 year old man and by no means have delicate skin, so you can imagine what it may be like if you do.</li>
            <li> Used this soap all over. Very pleasant scent that is almost not there.  My skin loves it!  Left it smooth and comfortable.  Was a little nervous to use it on my face, even at age 60 allergies still make it break out and other soaps I&#x27;ve tried just made it worse, so I was amazed when I saw it the next morning.  The bumps weren&#x27;t bumpy and the redness had faded.  Washed my hair with it and that worked out well too. One With Nature has a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Love this soap, but too expensive on Amazon.  Just found it at the Vitamin Shoppe for 3.99 a bar.</li>
            <li> i realy enjoy this soap. it has a nice scent and you feel clean and soft after using it, i lik the exfolicant factory also.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, I use it to exfoliate in the shower. And it is really amazing at getting the leftover sweet sweat off my body after a work out.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I&#x27;m a VERY active person but take great care in my skin, there is no drying or residue from this soap and the bar lasts forever, unlike a lot of natural bars that melt away. I am prone to skin irritation from strong or fragrant products but need something that cleans. I had grabbed it from my local health food store on a whim and loved it but they don&#x27;t always have it so this is a reorder for me.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Helped lessen keratosis pilaris&lt;br /&gt;-Skin felt smoother and moisturized, even in winter time (at least for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Price&lt;br /&gt;-Soap has to be used sparingly and cut in pieces so as to last longer</li>
            <li> This is an excellent all-around soap and also worked great for clearing up face breakouts. So good that we will purchase this regularly.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin at all, and it honestly looks like I was attacked by cat.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates but doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dried out.</li>
            <li> Abrasive. Leaves your skin dry. Need to follow it up with something more moisturizing. I found it not for daily use but once in awhile it feels good. Will definitely exfoliate. If you have tough, oily skin you might really like it but careful on the sensitive bits.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, exfoliates and leaves your skin feeling clean and healthy</li>
            <li> when I used this soap people told me the I look young and I just said Thank you but I know is Because the Soap.</li>
            <li> due to sensitive skin, we&#x27;ve been buying some terribly expensive shea butter soaps. On a whim, I picked up a bar of this, and it&#x27;s just as kind and gentle to our skin as the soaps that are 3x as expensive. I like this for the neutral scent, the exfoliating nature, and the fact that lasts for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Makes you feel squeaky clean. Also like how it exfoliates. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the soap, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the grit in it. I know that it is supposed to be for exfoliating purposes, but honestly, it feels like I&#x27;m rubbing small scratchy sand across my body. I have even had scratches on my legs from using this soap.</li>
            <li> I bought my daughter a Dead Sea facial mud mask. It gave her such good results with her acne I had to try this soap. I was not disappointed. It is great and my skin loves it. Exfoliates, and just leaves you clean and smooth but never feeling dry like many soaps do to my skin.</li>
            <li> I like this soap, I feel super clean after using it</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap, nice minerals to gently scratch your back, exfoliate your skin. Repeat buyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightly scented, if at all.  Really nice soap. A new favorite.</li>
            <li> I like it. But the bar is too small for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this soap!</li>
            <li> No real smell, kinda gritty, but my skins feels amazing!</li>
            <li> Loved it. Made my skin super soft. The mud and beaded soap literally made my skin radiate. Will definitely come back for more!</li>
            <li> i have psoriasis and this is my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for my face everyday and it is like giving myself a face mask everyday except quicker.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It&#x27;s totally luxurious?</li>
            <li> The best soap I&#x27;ve use the smell is great and I heard a lit about dead sea soap so I&#x27;ll continue to use this soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap but it&#x27;s sharp! I like it because it smells good in a natural feeling way. I love the abrasive quality, and I love its size. It&#x27;s bigger than your Dove soap which makes it just fit the hand nicely. The sand doesn&#x27;t dissolve though so you have to be careful going over knees and elbows. But it really does help keep the skin in my legs from getting ingrown hairs so they feel softer and nicer.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but this product was very drying. More drying then the regular over the counter body soap.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that it wouldn&#x27;t be irritating to my skin as my skin is very sensitive. It also has a sandiness to it that was scratchy and kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> When they say this is made with mud, they weren&#x27;t kidding. After using this as body soap for a week, I threw it away. It leaves the shower/tub covered in muck and I had to clean the tub after every use.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday on my face - I have not gotten as many pimples as I used to with this product!</li>
            <li> This is another &amp;#34;no ands, ifs, or buts about it&amp;#34; product. Price is fair. Product works great. Leaves face feeling clean but not dry. Moisturized, but not greasy. Well you get the picture... :)</li>
            <li> omg, gouches out your skin and leaves welts and scratches.  Can&#x27;t even use.  Very painful.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great lather!  It rinses on well and left my face feeling soothe and refreshing. I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> Left my skin very smooth, smells good</li>
            <li> Was looking for something naturally abrasive to skin but also purifying. Bought this on a whim and have not regretted. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to and would recommend people try it.</li>
            <li> It is like 2 in one, or 3 in one :)))) because this soap makes peeling, cleans, and smoothes my skin. I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great, and lasts forever. It was better than I expected. I Would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Nice scrub. Better than I thought. Not a bad price in comparison to other natural soaps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lil grainy, nice earthy mild smell, used the first bar noticed no skin reaction, my skin type is combination, my mother in law is dry, my son normal, seems to do well for everyone, my husband doesn&#x27;t like the smell he&#x27;s a dial body wash kinda guy, he says it leaves no scent just doesn&#x27;t like it initially.  If left in shower with too much moisture does seem to take on a slimy feel but this seems to be the case with bar soap, with 3 people using it to last about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Cleans hands fine, but it made our soap dish look like a mud puddle.</li>
            <li> Great soap, feels like exfoliating while working</li>
            <li> Feels nice. Love the pieces of mud that stick out like tiny exfoliators. I like how the ingredient list is pretty short and recognizable.  Would give it 5 stars if it smelt better. I would recommend to friends and family that are trying to reduce their enviromental impact or lead a healthier lifestyle because it&#x27;s not just about what u put in its what u put on.</li>
            <li> I am going to start off this review with the following statement. I do not believe there is a miracle product. If there was, everyone would buy that product and nothing else. This Dead Sea Mud soap is not a miracle product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this soap and this soap alone, which I use to wash my face, has been keeping my acne and blackheads under better control than the small arsenal of skin care products I had in my medicine cabinet. Not only that, it has evened out my skin tone and faded acne scars (I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s supposed to do this but it has). So, needless to say, I am blown away. Do I still get pimples here and there? Yeah. Do I still have some blackheads to deal with in problem areas? Yeah. Though not nearly as many as when I was carpet bombing my face with salycic acid, benzoyl peroxide and all that nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price for the soap is actually a bargain for the whopping seven ounce brick you get. Forget those wimpy four ounce soaps that are typically sold at the store; One With Nature gives you your money&#x27;s worth and then some. There&#x27;s not much to say on the packaging, it comes in a plastic wrap that you&#x27;d expect a soap to come in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself has a very nice, sweet cinnamon scent to it. It&#x27;s not much, heck I barely notice it, but that&#x27;s kind of the point is that the product isn&#x27;t filled with artificial fragrances that could anger your skin. That&#x27;s the problem we&#x27;re trying to FIX remember!  The Dead Sea Mud soap is supposed to be on the more exfoliating end of the spectrum with granules in it to scrub away dead skin. Now, personally, I use this soap directly on my hands and the granules don’t do much, that’s just me though. To get a real exfoliation with this, go to your local Target and get some of The Bathery’s shower gloves. Lather those up and have at it. Of course, don’t rub yourself raw I accidentally did that once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap cleans terrifically and has really brought my complexion issues which I have struggled with since middle school under control to levels that I haven’t seen in any other product to date. Again, will it work miracles? Probably not, but it’s pretty darn close. These soaps are fantastic and One With Nature’s customer service was excellent in helping me discern the difference between the Dead Sea Mud and Dead Sea Salt soaps. This is money well spent.ave struggled with since middle school under control to levels that I haven’t seen in any other product to date. Again, will it work miracles?

            <li> Great exfoliating soap, even for sensitive skin. Was a great price when offered through S&amp;S.</li>
            <li> It has a nice aroma to it, as you would expect not very much aroma. Only down side is it can dry out skin a little too much. Use with mineral lotion or alternating with a soap that has moisturizers is key. It makes  a great lather and cleanses very well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Perfect amount of abrasion (which lasts down to the core of the soap) and definitely helped control acne on my face. NOT A DISINFECTING SOAP! But I don&#x27;t think it was intended to be.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t tell you how I came across or why I purchased this the first time, but it really is amazing soap. Never dries out my skin, leaves me feeling clean but not stripped. I like the texture and the natural smell. A bar lasts me a month, not a bad price to use ratio.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and love it even more when it&#x27;s on sale.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with it wearing too fast, I just let it dry when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;I feel so clean after using it, just wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and find this soap very helpful.  I use it in the shower and for hand washing. It exfoliates the dead skin that comes along with psoriasis and doesn&#x27;t cause inflammation.  I need to tell more people about this great soap!</li>
            <li> Expensive, and it can really scratch your skin if you rub it hard.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is not bad if you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Allergic reactions to it. Arrrrgh. Can&#x27;t think of which of the ingredients is the culprit. Maybe the argan oil?</li>
            <li> I did not see anything special this soap did.</li>
            <li> we loved this soap need to order more.</li>
            <li> Price is right.  I am a big fan of dead sea products.  I would purchase this again.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the Most natural and best Soaps ive ever used!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok - nothing insanely special. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, smells nice. Decent price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  Every bar of soap I have purchased from this company has been great.  It leaves you feel clean, not &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; like many national brand soaps we see advertised.</li>
            <li> This was okay.  Didn&#x27;t have much of a scent.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the exfoliating minerals or whatever is in it are quite sharp, and actually hurt a little if you&#x27;re trying to rub the soap on your body.  I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I like the salt content that is anti inflammatory.  I have ankle/foot problem that I am hoping to get better with this.&lt;br /&gt;Holistic soap.  Also, soothing for skin ailments like rosacea, acne..</li>
            <li> I am very picky about soap. If I&#x27;m going to buy a&amp;#34; fancy&amp;#34; soap (rather than my classic Dove) it has to be awesome.  And this one is worthy of being considered awesome.  It feels great on my skin, providing just the right amount of exfoliation. It matters nicely and it lasts a long time. But when I ordered it, it was only three dollars and change with free shipping.  Now with shipping it&#x27;s tuning six to seven dollars a bar.  I just can&#x27;t pay that much.  I hope the price goes down.  For now I ordered a six pack which comes to four and change per bar.</li>
            <li> Love the exfoliating!! Not a fan of the scent. It kind f smells like lye soap with hint of some fragrance.</li>
            <li> Bought this for camping, seemed to work great.  The only problem I had with it is that it seemed to be eaten up rather quickly in comparison to other soaps.  I was noticing how quickly it was going away with only a week camping.  Bought it to try, and I would buy it again, just would use a different washcloth method to lather it in order to keep it from being used up so quickly.</li>
            <li> I STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT WHEN A FRIEND FROM WORK SAID SHE USED IT AND HAD SENSITIVE SKIN, AND IVE LOVED IT EVER SINCE.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used on my face that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and it&#x27;s evening out my skin tone, I will be ordering this product again, thanks :)</li>
            <li> Out standing.Can use on face and whole body.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference after only one use. Very pleased with it so far. It&#x27;s very heavy and looks to last a long time which is awesome for the price.</li>
            <li> I find the Dead Sea Mud to be a good value bar of quality soap. I don&#x27;t like anything too fragrant, but enjoy a soap with some scratchy exfoliating properties. This bar of soap fits the bill. As an adult man and only user of this bar, I get just over one month of use from this bar of soap. At first I was a little puzzled by the white color it took when first exposed to water, but after some use it returned to a more brown color. When looking for something a step above the multi-pack of soap bars like Dove, but not as expensive as top of the line fancy soap, this is a good way to go. Good ingredients, long lasting, and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Careful - exfoliating bits cut my skin</li>
            <li> it defiantly exfoliates. i don&#x27;t use it daily but i like it, it does break down very fast so keep it dry when not in use. not a good soap to just leave a bar in the shower. I have a little extra grease on my face when i get home from work and this is great for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Great for my psoriasis</li>
            <li> I have oily T zone, takes it right off without leaving feeling dry. Good for sensitive/oily face. Have tried many products, only one that works for me. Use it for body and face. Huge bar, lasts months. Use about 4 out of 7 times per week. You can feel the minerals scrubby away the dead sky. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  washed my face and shoulders with this every morning for about a week and my acne is almost completely gone! I feel like I have my face back. After my first use I could immediately see an improvement. The new blemish that was joining the infinitely increasing family actually decreased in size and eventually disappeared with the rest of them. There are still some red dots on my forehead and chin but they&#x27;re not bumps so they&#x27;re easy to cover up with makeup (my acne had added about 30 minutes to my makeup routine because it was so hard to cover up). I only wish it came in a bottle facial cleanser form so I didn&#x27;t have to rub a giant bar on my face (that&#x27;s the best way to get the sandy exfoliation sensation).</li>
            <li> This is a very well made soap from mostly palm oil with nothing artificial - it has no SLS and no EDTA, which are the two often-used ingredients that give me rashes and allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is made very tightly, meaning there is almost no air gaps or air bubbles resulting in a dense heavy compact soap...which means your soap will last a long time, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several within this line and I like this one the most as it is very neutral in smell (read...almost no smell) and feels super clean after use. The silt specks within the soap also acts as an exfoliant. Made in Jordan.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. The granules in it feel so good, but they don&#x27;t dissolve, so make sure you wash off your body. After I use this soap, my body feels as soft as it did when I actually got out of the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> First of all I ordered one but my cart added a second bar? Second I had the impression that the bar was going to be Bigger like a wider bar like you find in Ross dept stores. Anyway I will keep you posted.</li>
            <li> great product.  I will purchase again</li>
            <li> I like exfoliating soaps but whatever minerals/exfoliant is in this soap gave me long scratches on my skin with only simple gentle scrubbing. Not recommended. Also very drying.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now and it&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;ve literally tried everything there is and this is by far the best product out there. It&#x27;s incredible how cheap this little bar of heaven is</li>
            <li> It was okay. I am a big fan of Dead Sea products and have been for many years now.  This product however is not one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I like the way this soap makes my skin feel. It cleanses without drying, and I have pretty dry skin! I&#x27;ve also used it to wash away the residual debris and makeup on my face after using a cleanser, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face either.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It&#x27;s the only one that I use. It never dries out my skin and it gets nice and frothy when I use it with my bath gloves. My boyfriend got addicted to it too. Whenever we&#x27;re running low, he asks me to get more.</li>
            <li> scratches a bit too nuch</li>
            <li> Been using this for several years. Great stuff, however, long term use will leave your skin a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!!&lt;br /&gt;I had previously gotten one for my mother though she hardly used it and said it made her skin kinda dry.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy one anyway for myself and I&#x27;m glad I did. It cleared up my skin problems I had on my arms, left my skin smooth and clean. It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other bar soaps. I loved that it had  exfoliating features. It can be a little on the rough side and you may want to put in on a wash cloth. Though after the first few times the soap felt softer, and I found that putting directly on my skin helped better to eliminate my skin problems.</li>
            <li> Not the best smelling thing, but its soap, so I guess I just need it to clean.</li>
            <li> Just love it. Need to order it monthly.</li>
            <li> It made my face dry,exacerbated my blackheads,but the rest of my body was OK.</li>
            <li> Scratchy, scratchy, scratchy.  If you&#x27;re into the mild sandpaper experience, this is your product.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and exfoliating soap!</li>
            <li> Love the exfoliating!  Too bad it melts away</li>
            <li> LOVE the exfoliating beads in it!  And it works great on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Lathers very well and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a decent soap.  it didn&#x27;t help with my psoriasis, and it didn&#x27;t feel any different from other high end soaps.</li>
            <li> Excellent and moisturizing. I will continue to buy this soap.</li>
            <li> I used this twice so far and my acne seems to have gotten under control and a little smother looking. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast and the product was just what I needed- ordering in bulk next time. :) Totally recommend this soap and sender for my next purchase.</li>
            <li> Its good soap. Doesnt leave my skin dry.  Cleans my face really nice. Last long and good smell. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I brought this soap for me and my daughter who suffer from ance. Her face looks alot better after just a few days and my skin feel very soft. i love this product and would recommend this for a good cleansin.</li>
            <li> This soap is superb, it soothes my skin, and makes it so soft.  It lasts a long time. I have not noticed any smell, just lots of lather.  I have purchased twice in a year.  And will buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I keep it around for when I really need to give my hands a good scrub. It will clean anything and leave your hands so soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin. It&#x27;s dry; it&#x27;s oily; it&#x27;s about to break out in a rash because of some nearby plants or cleaning products. You get the idea. Because of that, I tend to try out a LOT of natural soaps and this is not near the top of the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind having natural texture to the soap for a good scrub, but I don&#x27;t understand the abrasive little shards of rock in this. It&#x27;s too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted - my skin is not your skin. But I just didn&#x27;t feel totally clean after using this. My skin was smooth, but still felt oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had much better luck with Sea of Life Mud Soap, (though I don&#x27;t think Amazon sells it). And although it&#x27;s not made with Dead Sea mud, Dudu Osun Black Soap is absolutely my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom for her birthday she said it&#x27;s great it cleared up her rash it has a nice feel and it exfoliates it&#x27;s really a great product has a nice smell and it last a long time definitely will buy again</li>
            <li> I like the smell, sorta gave me a flashback to my youth.  The rough grain of this soap, like pumice, works well for me but may not be for everyone.  Is appearing to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice lather, and another plus for me at least, is the fact that it re-dries hard.  Some other soaps I have used lately sorta soften up and melt onto my soap saver http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFA66/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3  This soap dries hard and just sits on top of this soap saver.  For me this is an indicator that the soap may not be melting away and being wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy this soap again.....yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I use this soap exclusively.....no, not yet as I am trying other natural soaps, but this soap is a contender for exclusiveity</li>
            <li> This soap is cool.  It lathers up great and has little exfoliating things.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get. A novelty.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I decided to try any other soap other than the ones that I used to get from India.&lt;br /&gt;This was suggested to me by my friend due to some acne flare ups for my wife.  I decided to try this on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow.  This is one of the best products that we have bought.&lt;br /&gt;She loves the way it makes her skin feel, and she says it gets the job done quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m certain she will want to continue buying this soap, and she has told several friends about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subscribe and save gave me another 15% off the total price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this.  I&#x27;m in my 60s and still have oily skin in the T area.  This works great to not only keep my face moisturized (although I also use hyaluronic acid for that) and also keeps the oil down.</li>
            <li> Love. Super moisturizing. Lathers well. Noticed reduction in itchy skin while using this soap. My new favorite! (Also exfoliating, has some grainy texture)</li>
            <li> Great soap without any unnecessary ingredients. Smells nice, rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Very good scrubbing soap, holds up and does not fall apart like some other natural made soaps.</li>
            <li> smeels so good want to get another</li>
            <li> Love this soap, the skin feels extremely soft and smooth after showering with it. Love the soap.</li>
            <li> This soap is great! It has granules of sand or pumice in it that exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a follow up I want to say: I really like this soap but you may get surface scratches on you skin. So if you aren&#x27;t concerned about that then it&#x27;s great if you don&#x27;t want scratches on you then you may want to apply it with a shower brush or wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Re ordered because this product delivers a great result.</li>
            <li> I love the slight fresh smell.  It is very light.  It made my skin silky smooth.  I bought this for my husband who has skin allergies, but he has been using the tar soap and likes it.  So I gave it a try.  I normally use the natural lavender soap, but like this one even better for how it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Love a bar of soap with some texture. Wish the scent was stronger though.</li>
            <li> Quite possibly the best soap I have ever used and I have tried a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely good value as well.  I&#x27;ve paid over $15 for some bars of soap but this product really delivers for only $3!</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY different soaps for my eczema on my face and nothing seems to work including steroids which i now refuse to use. I heard this type of soap is good for eczema and psoriasis. I started using this as my daily face soap and within a few days my skin was soft and nearly free of eczema. I did not find it to be gritty at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and I have noticed that my skin is noticeably smoother.  No I do not work for the company.  I purchased this soap since it was more than half the price of the more popular version of the dead sea mud soap.  I will be purchasing a few more bars of this as I do believe this product is well made and good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. We don&#x27;t rub bars of soap on our skin, we take our washcloth and rub it on the soap and a little goes a long way. Lathers and cleans well. Has helped our acne and the smell doesn&#x27;t irritate my asthma. My son used to have eczema and we were using another brand of shea butter soap that helped clear it up and this is working just as well as it still hasn&#x27;t come back. Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  It doesn&#x27;t have any strong, unnatural smelling fragrances that the manufacturer added in.  It smells pretty natural, and the ingredients list is short.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it feels amazing.  The grittiness against your skin from the mud/sand particles is invigorating, and the soap itself rinses off well and seems to soften my skin.  The only drawback is, that it&#x27;s brown.  Meaning, your tub/shower get dirty pretty quickly when you use this soap.  If you clean more than I do, it may not be an issue.</li>
            <li> GREAT BUY, JUST AS I EXPECTED!</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Very large bar.</li>
            <li> Pros - Great price for the amount of soap you get; light clean fragrance; rinses off w/o drying your skin; lasts a long time when using as a face or body bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Didn&#x27;t care too much for the micro grains mixed in the bar soap. The grains were a bit abrasive and rough.</li>
            <li> I got worse. Sorry did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> The size is great. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for the past three weeks, and I&#x27;m guessing it will last me another week. The gritty mud pieces exfoliated my skin very well! It leaves your skin feeling very clean and smooth, like the feeling of baby powder, almost, on your skin. I do have a big of back acne, which I hope it would eradicate completely, but it didn&#x27;t, though it did help; I have less back acne now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my face, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference. I found that my normal acne spot treatment worked better, but I&#x27;ve been trying to find natural products to take care of that because of synthetic chemicals in regular store products. Will be exploring more products.</li>
            <li> no lather whatsoever, but effective and long lasting</li>
            <li> Love it.  Cleans and leaves your skin very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for four months without any issues until now. The last bar I received has actually caused scratches on my skin.  There is a slight grit in the soap,  but that was never an issue, I actually really liked the gentle exfoliation. This most recent bar however,  has pieces of something in it that are so sharp,  I ended up with fairly prominent scratches across my body and face. It took a few washes before the issue began but it seems that bits of a reddish-orange, sharp substance, which I&#x27;ve not seen in previous bars, began to be exposed in the soap. I cannot identify the substance but it&#x27;s not likely something that should be used in soap. I assume this came from a defective batch, perhaps some unknown material made its way into the particular batch of soap that this bar came from. I&#x27;ve contacted the company directly regarding this issue and they have not even responded with a courtesy email to notify me that they acknowledge my correspondence.&lt;br /&gt;I loved this soap but not now that it had actually caused superficial lacerations in my skin.  I am wary about ordering anything from the One with Nature line ever again simple because their ability to address customer&#x27;s concerns is nonexistent.</li>
            <li> I love it, it has little pieces inside, acting like a vitalizing body scub. Definitly purchasing this one again for ourselves and as gifts to family.</li>
            <li> I really miss this soap good product!</li>
            <li> My wife adores this soap and uses it daily, she even insisted that I try it as well. I also like it but not so much as her. It does do a great job of exfoliating the skin. We even have this on subscription from Amazon so she is certain to get the soap every month.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves it. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but she didn&#x27;t remember who bought it for her and was raving about it. So there isn&#x27;t a bias.</li>
            <li> Most amazing soap, love it!</li>
            <li> Beware giant sharp granuls which can cause scrapes.  If you think it&#x27;s scratching you, it probably is.</li>
            <li> This soap is good. But I&#x27;m partial to Soul Nourishing&#x27;s though www.SoulNourishingHomemade.com</li>
            <li> fantastic, and rinses so well and lasts so long.  will order again and again</li>
            <li> Keep it simple. I wish more products were like this, no strange chemicals. It does a good job and we use this exclusively now.</li>
            <li> Really do not understand what is great about this soap. Was like any other soap plus scrubbing effect. Smells fresh, nothing extraordinary there. Certainly dries your skin; almost as much as regular soap does. Not sure how this soap helps people with eczema. My husband has eczema and I tried the soap first and decided it would do him more harm than good. I don&#x27;t understand how this has so many great reviews.</li>
            <li> Great soap leaves you squeaky clean. Only complaint is you must guard it from extra water when not using otherwise wit will run out quickly.</li>
            <li> This soap is getting the job done the way I hoped it would. But, I will say it might be a little scratchy for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> great soap- love the feel and smell- I use it after water aerobics to get the chlorine off my skin-- and it works-have not had any break-outs- and don&#x27;t have to use anything with chemicals to get rid of the chemicals!</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this soap! Helps with his eczema and I love how it is &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; and nice at exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Unintended consequences: has eliminated yeast infection issues.  I bought this just because I wanted to live more naturally, but when I used it in intimate places, it prevents girl problems. Sorry if TMI, but this needs to get out to all the girls.  I&#x27;m thrilled with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Extremely drying and made my face itchy.</li>
            <li> This soap is really gentle on my skin. I love the exfoliating beads in it. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> The smell is divine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a soap with medium lather and some type of grit in it. This soap goes above and beyond! I prefer to lather the bar in my hands to wash down with once, then take the bar directly to my skin to scrub with. The grit in this bar is not overly abrasive, but it is there, so if you choose to use the bar directly on your skin like I do, expect it to feel like you are scratching with medium pressure. I dislike &amp;#34;plain&amp;#34; bar soap; such as Dove, but if you do not like the grit, the other scents of this brand do not have it. What I did not expect was the divine smell of this soap - it smells so good that I have just stood in the shower sniffing it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap.  It rinses off so easily.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like there is any soap residue and for that reason it has helped my sensitive skin from soap irritation.  It lasted me for two months just don&#x27;t keep it sitting in water.  I like the clean scent left on my skin after a shower.  Leave it to our Lord and Savior to put these wonderful minerals in His chosen land.</li>
            <li> Used every other day for 2 mths and it has really helped to calm severe eczema and lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... would love it more if they brought it back to Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different &#x27;Dead Sea&#x27; soaps for my psoriasis because I read that it could be helpful. This one is definitely my favorite. I like the slight cinnamon smell and also the feel of it. It is not too scratchy at all. The best thing is how it feels afterwards. It really softens the skin and makes my psoriasis less dry and flakey. Where most soaps tend to aggrivate my psoriasis this soap really seems to help soothe it. Compared to some of the other dead sea soaps I&#x27;ve tried this is also more affordable. I would definitely recommend this to someone with psoriasis or similar skin conditions.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice, big, solid bar of soap, but is too scratchy for my skin except for my legs though I&#x27;ve never considered myself the sensitive type.  The soap quality itself is the best and it lathers really well.</li>
            <li> Ok product, good price but won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> I did not like this soap, its not for sensitive skin. Might work for you though.</li>
            <li> Nice perfect for skin and dread locks thank you</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud soap is WELL WORTH the price that you pay.  It works just as good as some of the more expensive brand names that I have bought in the past, that cost three times as much as One with Nature&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks... Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Shannon Little</li>
            <li> This soap feels so good on your skin. If you are not a fan of scratchy exfoliating products, then this is not the soap for you. It really exfoliates when held in the palm of your hand and applied directly to skin. If you want more froth and less scratch, than you can use a puffy or washcloth. Personally, I love the scratchy scrubby feeling. And when you are done your skin feels super smooth. Also, I live in NC and the water is hard here. It really softens the water a lot. I noticed other reviewers saying that they used it as a facial bar, and I have not tried that. As far as the smell, it&#x27;s rather earthy, but you can get this soap in a variety of scents. This one has Argan oil and Shea butter. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I have problem of sy skin and I ahve been using this soap for 2 weeks and so far I am getting a lot of benefits.</li>
            <li> Great soap!!.. Can&#x27;t find in stores</li>
            <li> Great gritty feeling. No need for a buff puff like sponge. The water always looks dingy after using because of the silt in the soap so don&#x27;t think I am always that grimy :)</li>
            <li> This is the replacement product that I found after the price of the Dead Sea Mud Soap I&#x27;d seen in Israel went from US$8.50 in shekels in the Israel shop and Israel online store, to $12 for my first purchase off Amazon (Israel site can&#x27;t be reached from the USA), to $18 when I was planning a second purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On With Nature is a Jordan manufactured product, is as luxurious a soap like the Israel product, with twice the weight per bar, a reasonable price, and the ability to subscribe for monthly delivery.  A 7 oz One With Nature bar is good for almost a month and one-half of daily showers.  Since first using a Dead Sea Mud based soap that has no perfume added, my skin, especially my face, is less oily, feels cleaner and more comfortable to be living-in, and I experience far fewer blemishes.</li>
            <li> not super lathery, but i have faith in mineral goodness it brings to the table</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy with this best soap, my skin really so soft n clean</li>
            <li> I use this product for my face and entire body.  I am a believer of the benefits of Dead Sea Salt and I feel that this product relieves my dry skin.  I always make sure I have enough supply.  I am looking for an alternative product since there might not be sufficient supply of Dead Sea Salt from the Middle East.  For now I am happy and contended!</li>
            <li> This soap melts too easily and gets too slick to hold in hand.  The soap dish is always messy looking. I did not like it!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I still keep the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; soap around depending on my mood but I always keep a bar of this soap on hand. Doesn&#x27;t have the strong fragrance some other specialty soaps have which I definitely appreciate.</li>
            <li> Lathers up well. Doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done. I like heavily scented soap but this bar has a light scent, but still smells good</li>
            <li> My whole family loved this product. 😊</li>
            <li> What a awesome soap.  I have used this especially for dry heels and under my feet. My feet fell so good. Some spots on arms and face. It really works.  Back buying again....</li>
            <li> The soap lathers well and I love the micro beads, that help exfoliate. Last a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells good....After many uses, it made my body soft. I plan on purchasing again!!</li>
            <li> I love &amp;#34;One With Nature&amp;#34; soap. It&#x27;s one of my favorite brands. I&#x27;m not fond of the &amp;#34;Dead Sea Mud&amp;#34; variant, however. Though it is certainly an exfoliating soap, it uses actual large particles of black dirt to get the job done, and if you use this soap in the bath tub you will find yourself cleaning dirt out of the tub afterwards. Not fun. The soap miraculously did serve its purpose as a soap (regardless of the contained dirt), so it may be better used as a hand soap. I do not plan to continue to use this particular variant of &amp;#34;One With Nature&amp;#34; soap.</li>
            <li> Well, it is soap...what to say about soap? It lathers and it is nice and scratchy (seriously, I like that). It smells pretty good and it is a large bar.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> interesting soap, but there are little hard minerals or sand in it that feels really rough on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have to be gentle or it hurts to bathe with this.</li>
            <li> Grainy but not a nice name</li>
            <li> I would like to try the others One With Nature&#x27;s soaps</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. The exfoliation is like none I&#x27;ve ever used, it feels like someone is scratching me... ahhh!</li>
            <li> I really love this soap! I was truly impressed with the size of the bar, the length of time it lasts, and the remarkable job it dies on the body! By far the best bar of soap I have ever used and it yields an over abundance of lather too!</li>
            <li> Very good soap. Doesnt last as long as I would have hoped. I think maybe two/three weeks with two people using every day. Smells good, makes me feel clean afterward. My husband seems to like it.</li>
            <li> I love the dead sea mud soap. I find its healing to my skin. I have no skin issues but I just like it.</li>
            <li> So I bought this way back in September or October I think but decided to wait to finish using it before reviewing it just to be sure of its use. I first tried the Vanilla Oatmeal kind of this One with nature dead sea minerals soap collection and that one was fantastic. I even tried an overnight mask on my face with that one and it worked miracles. It lasted for two months and then I was able to start using this version. Also I did not put it in a cover but just in the soap dish in the shower so it did not last as long (a month and three weeks) but that is my fault. This soap is the truth. I dont have very bad back and/or body acne but the ones that are there are pretty noticeable. After using this soap they are all gone and have stayed gone. I tried it for my face as a scrub but I may have overused it or it may not be for everyday use as I did not get any noticeable difference on my face. Either way I will highly recommend it as a fabulous body soap. It lathers well, scrubs nicely and does not have any EDTA, SLS, Sulfates, bla bla bla ingredients that make us raise our eyebrows once we realize they are in our skincare products. I even tried it as an overnight mask on my bikini line and it calmed down those stubborn ingrown hair bumps a bit. I think I will work towards buying a lifetime supply of these until they stop making them or until it stops working for me, which I hope is never. I normally break out everywhere when I travel back home to Ghana..and yet thanks to this my skin is still looking fresh and blemish free. I am sold.</li>
            <li> All of these soaps have helped my skin and my sons skin.</li>
            <li> After looking around town this is the only way I will buy this product again. Exceptional pricing and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This soap was way too harsh. Not the actual little bits, which felt great as an exfoliant, but the salt. It almost felt burnt and a bit itchy in certain places. I don&#x27;t have any skin conditions, and not super sensitive either. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> ACNE SOAP THAT LASTS LONG; AND WORKS</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this soap.  Only complaint i have is that it is messy and leaves a residue in the shower on the bar holder.  I am constantly cleaning the excess soap off of it daily after my daughter showers.  She loves the soap though and I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This soap is excellent for stressed skin as it originates from the Dead Sea, and lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve found that this soap has somewhat of an exfoliating nature and you need to be cautious going over the skin if you are sensitive, or look into the lavender option of this product.</li>
            <li> Fine soap for regular use for normal skin. Do not expect too much from this otherwise.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap. It seemed to get more expensive and often wasn&#x27;t available in Amazon Prime so we stopped ordering.</li>
            <li> I love this soap for exfoliation and for my psoriasis.  It has a mild soap scent and you will see a muddy residue that you have to rinse out of your tub if you take a bath rather than shower with it.  It&#x27;s not my everyday soap.  I just use it a couple of times per week and gently scrub psoriatic patches for 30 seconds to a minute on each area and it really does an excellent job at exfoliating the flakey skin so that it&#x27;s much more smooth when I am finished.  I also use it on my feet for exfoliation.  The last time I purchased from Amazon I purchased a prime eligible 5 pack at a reasonable price and I am glad to now see it as an add on item at a very competitive price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly shower with it, but I have also used it in a bath of Epsom salts.  An exceptional psoriasis treatment!  Together they make a great pair for exfoliating the skin. Soak in the salt bath for 20 minutes and gently massage the bar on your body, then rinse off in the shower, and your skin will feel ultra smooth after this spa treatment - even your heals.  You will not need one of those awful heel shaving devices.</li>
            <li> I brought this soap when I visited Israel and fell in love with this product. When I ran out of the soap, I went on Amazon to see it I could get this product  without having to order from the overseas company (Amazon is the best). This soap smells good and lathers great. I can feel the difference in my skin. I use to use only Dove soap, but now I only use Dead Sea Mineral soap. I gave a bar to my sister and she loved it. She is going to order more and give a bar to her grandson, who has some skin issues. I have told all of my family and friends about this soap. Love it!</li>
            <li> very nice, with good lather.  it&#x27;s a little hard to handle at first b/c it is a fairly large bar, but it became manageable fairly quickly.  it has little to no fragrance which i prefer.  if you are looking for a smooth soap, this bar is not for you.  the mud in it is highly textured almost reminding me of an apricot facial scrub with the &amp;#34;scrubby bits&amp;#34; in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall a sudsy, natural smelling soap experience.</li>
            <li> This soap is not only healthy to use on the skin but also refreshing,Has helped calm and sooth my psoriasis and eczema&lt;br /&gt;Only 9 Ingredients, all of which i can pronounce&lt;br /&gt; Smells great&lt;br /&gt; Has a nice grit to it&lt;br /&gt;it sooths my irritated skin (have to list it twice, its the only soap i&#x27;ve used so far that has been able to make it feel better)</li>
            <li> Slightly abbrasive. Works very well. If you have a heat rash it seems to help get rid of it quickly.</li>
            <li> Feels good and the bar seems to last forever. Which is great for me but not so great for the company as I won&#x27;t be buying another anytime soon. They do have me as a customer for life though. One With Nature all the way.</li>
            <li> I tried this product in Israel and didn&#x27;t have enough suitcase room to bring home as a gift.  It is great.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected. Love it.</li>
            <li> I like this, feel good on my skin. Now my husband is using it too.</li>
            <li> Now that is some sharp soap, and I mean that very literally. I love it, but be sure you&#x27;re not a wuss.</li>
            <li> I always turn back to this bar. I love the little black pieces in it. You can rub the whole bar on your body for some serious exfoliation. Smell is not offending at all, lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t get gummy.</li>
            <li> Big soap that exfoliates my skin leaving it soft and clean. Has last me a long time will buy again.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this soap!</li>
            <li> Really good scrubbing soap...  doesnt have much of a scent, which I dont mind.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he loves it. Leaves skin soft. He likes that it exfoliates, but is soothing and nourishing at the same time.</li>
            <li> the smell is overpowering</li>
            <li> The QC department at this soap-making facility is not up to Western standards. With one scrub, I tore through my arm and started bleeding. Really unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, not perfumee at all, works nicely on my skin, leaves my skin soft and clean. Does not leave a film</li>
            <li> My spouse loves this soap. He used to use only Old Spice body wash for years but, he started having skin issues,&lt;br /&gt;so I started buying more natural soaps for him to use.I bought this soap as a add on item to get my free shipping&lt;br /&gt;before I was a Prime member. It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, it has some little grit in it for exfoliating, it is large and&lt;br /&gt;long lasting.</li>
            <li> Great soap, has mild exfoliant properties and leaves skin feeling supple. The argan oil and shea butter hydrates the skin and didn&#x27;t need to apply lotion after showering. Pleasant scent, very mild and doesn&#x27;t have a hint of earth or mud smell. I deducted a star because the bar is much bigger than regular soaps and I had a hard time gripping it while moving it in circular motion to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and so far this soap has been great for keeping my face clear. It&#x27;s large so it last a long time when just being used on your face. It&#x27;s cheaper than the dead sea mud soap I used to use. I will purchase again</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. It makes my skin feel soft and buffed, but it&#x27;s hard for me to go with a full five stars. The bar itself will scratch my skin if I&#x27;m not careful, but if I use a washcloth it somewhat negates the exfoliating quality of it. It&#x27;s like eating Captain Crunch, but for your skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted an exfoliating soap and tried this and I am now sold and will forever purchase it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! Perfect for sensitiive skin. I will be trying the other frangrances.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap.  Not magical.  Nicely exfoliating.  Lasted a while.  Nothing special though.  Would probably not bother to buy again.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the quick shipment as this is the only soap my son can use for his dermatitis, and this soap is very hard to find in the stores. I have a thing for Dead Sea products as they say the Dead Sea is so good for you.</li>
            <li> Soap is fairly rough due to the sea salt crystals. Minimal scent.</li>
            <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good I&#x27;ll keep buying</li>
            <li> Love the way it nourishes my skin</li>
            <li> Personally I didn&#x27;t care for this bar of soap. It has to much a a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smell which I don&#x27;t like. When I purchase a bar of soap I like a more pleasant scent and this doesn&#x27;t have that. Also, ants were attracted to it! I&#x27;ve NEVER had an issue with ants eating soap before.</li>
            <li> great price for a great soap.  smells good, gentle on my skin.  I even use it for facial cleanser in the shower</li>
            <li> This review is for the \\&quot;Dead Sea Mud\\&quot; variety of this soap. My skin is very prone to be dry and flaky, especially in the winter. This stuff is amazing for preventing that. It&#x27;s not very glamorous-looking in the bath... looks like, well, mud. And it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell to entice you. But let me tell you, it lathers incredibly and it lasts for-honkin&#x27;-ever. Seriously, my one bar, used with a sisal washcloth in the shower, has lasted about 3 months already. It&#x27;s not very expensive -- if you have dry, flaky, and/or sensitive skin, you should give it a try.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap because it does not dry his skin. I also use it for my face. We like the natural ingredients in the soap too,</li>
            <li> Product that does not quite</li>
            <li> This smells as good as it works. Also, it&#x27;s good for you.</li>
            <li> This soap makes you feel really clean and it cured my rash my old soap was giving me! Plus, it has a really subtle smell, which I like since I don&#x27;t like smelling like flowers, etc.</li>
            <li> I expected a softer soap.. it seems to strip too much oil from the skin compared to even irish spring which I found surprising.</li>
            <li> Good soap.  Mild, not perfume-y.  But if you have sensitive skin, the little &amp;#34;salt rocks&amp;#34; in the soap might scratch you.  I prefer to put it onto a washcloth first, so the salt dissolves before i apply it to my skin.  Adult acne is going away.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this stuff, havente even tried the other scents yet! Soft sudsy gentle exfoliating and non drying...had to buy more.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I noticed that I&#x27;ve started to get Adult Acne  ALOT of Acne and I&#x27;m almost 40! Acne always signals my period...like clock work. So I purchased the Dead Sea mud soap. Second BEST PURCHASE TO DATE (out of thousands and I have proof...thousands) from Amazon! First best purchase was The Ultimate Ice Cream Book--but nevermind that now!  First couple times I rubbed soap directly on my face...HUGE MISTAKE. As it left red bruised patches on my skin...too Abrasive for direct contact with my face. Then I began to rub it on a wet wash cloth upon entering shower leaving on duration of shower, finally rinsing  off with cool water last just before getting out. For a sort of Poor Gal&#x27;s Spa steam facial treatment. Then follow with Now Solution&#x27;s Avocado Oil on my face, lips and body ( also purchased on Amazon, their Almond Oil is great too!) My scars and acne have almost completely disappeared and it&#x27;s only been 4 weeks! I have Clear and Healthy 20 year old looking skin!  I got my period but NO ACNE...WOW!  Will share this with my family and friends as i have it on Auto delivery. Got my second shipment today...Still have 1/2 of bar left. Can&#x27;t wait to try the Lavender and Lemon Verbena soaps next!  If  you have Acne and Acne Scars GET THIS SOAP!</li>
            <li> Decent soap, scratchy to the skin though. Is a little bit drying.</li>
            <li> love my natural soap!</li>
            <li> Love this soap! I&#x27;m now obsessed with this brand!!!</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing! It is very earthy and mild so it does not dry your skin out and makes your skin feel really clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good cleansing face soap.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Used to get this at the local Whole Foods. They stopped carrying it. Why? I have no idea. This soap has dead sea salts embedded in it which provides a refreshing stimulus while showering.</li>
            <li> Love this soap I actually signed up for auto delivery. Lasts long doesn&#x27;t melt in the shower and the scrubbing action is invigorating.</li>
            <li> Great soap. No strong smell.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.It works very good on your skin,facial and whole body.It opens up pores and cleans them out..,</li>
            <li> Received it in the morning and I immediately tried it out for my morning wash.  The scent is light and natural.  I used it with the konjac sponge that I also got in the same delivery and it was amazing.  Really great lather and my skin feels squeaky clean, but not dry.  I have dry skin, so it is awesome that this soap can clean my skin well yet nourish it.  I will keep using it and see if my skin (acne)  condition will improve.</li>
            <li> The more I use Amazon, the less I trust reviews. They are either paid reviews, or there are lots of unintelligent (I wish Amazon would let me use a more descriptive word...) people buying this stuff. This is one of those products that blow your mind. Not only is it not a 4/5 star product, but it actually is a small step above Irish Springs, which dries the hell out of your skin. This soap causes my dyshidrosis to flare up like CRAZY, and it dries out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and guess what? Those reviews you read about it scratching your skin? Yes, it is true. You can&#x27;t use this soap directly on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells a little bit like mud, but not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely terrible product; I am shocked this has 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry skin.  I don&#x27;t like body washes because they leave a film.  I love this soap.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and hard milled so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, a little rosacea in my cheeks, quick to burn, prone to dryness, redness, ingrown hairs and those little bumps on the backs of my arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried some Ahava brand Dead Sea products, and while I liked the smell, my skin reacted badly. Then I tried the Shea Moisture brand African Black Soap, and liked that a lot, but found the smell a bit strong and the price a little high. When I saw this item as an add-on for a lower price than the Black Soap, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The One With Nature Dead Sea Mud soap was just OK. My skin was a little dryer and more sensitive than it was with the Black Soap. The smell of is quite mild, but it left my skin too dry and prone to irritation. I felt like with Shea Moisture, I almost didn&#x27;t even need lotion after my showers, with these, I definitely do. I also tried the Dead Sea Salt soap, and found it to be the same. It&#x27;s OK, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used these soaps in a soap sock and a loofah pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL; DR: I have sensitive skin and prefer Shea Moisture&#x27;s African Black Soap</li>
            <li> I gave this to a man who is older and his skin is starting to get really sensitive and papery and he also gets rashes from things. So far so good he says w this. Men seem to like soaps as gifts long as it&#x27;s not too fluffy they like their skin to be clean too they just don&#x27;t like spending the money :) sometimes they are surprised at the difference of a good product</li>
            <li> Love this soap!! A great big bar that delivers clean! This soap is wonderful and we really enjoy using it. It cleans great and smells good too. It is natural which we love and it exfoliates as well. I would definitely get it again!</li>
            <li> Great soap, helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> Love love this stuff.  I have been using it for a month now and feel it has minimized my pores. My skin is uber sensitive, so the first time I used it, I got a little red, but put on some coconut oil, and since then, it&#x27;s been great. Feeling green and glamorous!! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I got this and the lemon; I like the lemon best.  Watch out for shipping charges; it&#x27;s a nice size bar.</li>
            <li> Large, long lasting, and doesn&#x27;t leave an icky film like so many other bar soaps. It&#x27;s very mild scent washes off completely, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry. well priced item</li>
            <li> I just love using this soap, not sure if its doing what it suppose to do but its makes me feel clean : )</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good soap. I prefer oatmeal over minerals, but this one is ok.</li>
            <li> extremely rough on skin. leaves scratch marks with just the slightest touch.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this soap and it&#x27;s the only one of hers that I can stand. I hate soaps with too much fragrance and whatever chemicals that smell too strong. This one is pretty mild.</li>
            <li> This is a good soap.  I don&#x27;t like bar soaps, they are just too messy to keep in the shower and I find body washes to be much easier to use, but I like this. I also had read an article about how to make single serving soap sheets... you shave the bar with a vegetable peeler!!!!!! so you don&#x27;t have to keep the bar of soap in the shower, you just use a shaving each time and that is it- so i gave this a try.  I put the shavings in a bag and just used it as needed, the shavings will crumble so you could just slice the soap into larger chunks but for me the shavings work fine and I feel like the bar of soap will last me years that way.  For a bar soap this stuff is very good.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tight and dry feeling like other soaps have.  Give it a try, I added it to my subscribe and save so the price was excellent.  No crazy strong scent either!  I like it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap !!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s got a scrubbing feel to it, and I like the fresh smell and the &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; feel of using it on my body.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great, too,  for a premium soap like this.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It leaves you feeling clean and your skin is soft.  I highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Came damaged. Could not give as gift.</li>
            <li> super exfoliater - very refreshing and invigorating</li>
            <li> This soap leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Sorry but, this one is like using Lava soap on your skin. Maybe even rougher. Felt like sandpaper.I guess, if you&#x27;re trying to remove skin, this would be your soap. Only place I could use it was on my back brush.</li>
            <li> Great soap. One of the best ones I ever had. I recommenden for all skin types. Elegant scents! I bought 12 already.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Suds well. No scent.</li>
            <li> Great soap - cleans well, rinses off clean, and lasts a long time. Doesn&#x27;t have any particular scent, which I appreciate. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliator and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Quite a gritty soap, but I expected that. Overall, I feel that it&#x27;s a good, natural soap that isn&#x27;t chock full of chemicals like a lot of soaps are.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin and rinses off nicely. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> did nothing for my face.</li>
            <li> Nice and clean-feeling, long lasting soap.</li>
            <li> dries out my skin - so for my legs/arms, I only use in occasionally but it is great for my sensitive areas - regular soap irritates me.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial cleansing soap for adolescent acne prone skin.  Wash your face TWICE a day and no less! In order to get acne under control, washing twice a day is a must and also adjusting your food choices and nutrition is key. Be sure to also use a good &amp;#34;toner&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; for best results and be consistent.</li>
            <li> I just love this mud! 21+ minerals. Using it in a bathtub filled with Dead Sea Salt creates beautiful additional bubbles. This must be healing.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin to where I can only use a number of soaps, this has got to be one of the best I have gotten. It feels great and does not upset my skin what so ever. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this soap</li>
            <li> love this soap. skin issues are finally under control.</li>
            <li> I purchased only one and it felt good the 1st couple of times of use but then my skin felt like it was burning after just seconds of use. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buybthis again .</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and an amazing product!</li>
