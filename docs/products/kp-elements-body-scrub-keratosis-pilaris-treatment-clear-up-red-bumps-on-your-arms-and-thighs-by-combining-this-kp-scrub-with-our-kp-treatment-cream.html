            <li>Love love love this product!!  </li>
            <li>For the price it would be best to go with a normal body scrub.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice scrub and all, but I was hoping I would have gotten more out of it by the time I used up the bottle.  </li>
            <li>The dermatologist prescribed me a cream with urea and gave me some tips on how to manage it including: not using any kind of soap or body wash on the affected area, taking cod liver oil supplements, and drinking more water.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been battling with KP for about 15 years now and have tried too many products to list.  </li>
            <li>The combo of the two is the best thing to exfoliate your skin and then use the cream to put the moisture back in.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t make it any better.</li>
            <li>a long way.before you start seeing your best results.</li>
            <li>Seems to be workigg great so far.  </li>
            <li>I have never had anything work as quickly and easily as this product!</li>
            <li>Really easy to use in the shower and seems to be helping a lot.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy bump free skin. :)</li>
            <li>I will recommend for exfoliating; it makes my skin smooth; but I have not seen any improvement in my pilaris keratosis even though I use the KP cream afterwards.</li>
            <li>I never knew there was something to make my skin so smooth and &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Just read the steps I took below and be free of bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wash body with Aveeno Moisturizer (light scrub)&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s summer, which is even more unusual because my KP is usually better in the summer.  </li>
            <li>the first time I used this product!!</li>
            <li>Works best when applied with a small loofah.  </li>
            <li>I contacted elements and was issued a full refund.</li>
            <li>This was more gentle, but is working just as well.  </li>
            <li>Both together really keep my KP at bay :)</li>
            <li>I just wish it would calm the redness.</li>
            <li>After that I took matters into my own hands and began researching different treatments.</li>
            <li>I really think you have to use it for at least 6 weeks before you start seeing your best results.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that after 2 years, I finally found something that actually works.  </li>
            <li>I can see myself ordering more of this scrub in the future.</li>
            <li>My arms feel the way they used to, smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>This scrub along with the body cream have really worked!</li>
            <li>Start to see a difference after first use ;)</li>
            <li>After using this for 3 weeks I am still on my first bottle with plenty to go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering trying the lotion as well as I think that will really keep the KP at bay!</li>
            <li>This scub is not too harsh, smells good, and works as it says it will.</li>
            <li>I also gave it 4 stars because it has a light, pleasant smell (in my opinion) and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>After using it a week my upper arms feel smooth and the bumps have gone away.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen improvement.</li>
            <li>Worked Very well on the skin.  </li>
            <li>For the price I expected more.</li>
            <li>I have been using this company&#x27;s skin cream for almost a year now, and it really helps with my KP.</li>
            <li>The exfoliation from the scrub was the real kicker for my skin</li>
            <li>and I noticed a real improvement after about a week of using it in combination with KP Elements cream.</li>
            <li>My KP is by no means gone, but this stuff does seem to be reducing the appearance of it, which is a lot more than I can say for any other treatment I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>What I did was use it twice a day with an advanced healing lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is a decent product</li>
            <li>too early to tell if this really works.</li>
            <li>You will a burning sensation which is completely normal</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft, however I was hoping it would fade the red blotchiness of porokeratosis.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in over 10 years, I feel like I can wear shorts in public again.</li>
            <li>For the first time in over 10 years, I feel like I can wear shorts in public again.</li>
            <li>Within less than a week, it cleared up and now the rear of my thighs are as smooth as the front.</li>
            <li>I came across this stuff and because of the overall positive reviews decided to try it.</li>
            <li>have now been using this stuff for a little over 8 weeks, and there is a HUGE difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>This product did not help at all to clear up my Keratosis Pilaris on my arms...</li>
            <li>They are now completely clear</li>
            <li>but so far Info like it.</li>
            <li>She has been using the product for a month, and feels it has helped diminish the appearance of the redness and bumps considerably.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I can see considerable improvement in my KP in just 3 days,</li>
            <li>I want to start out by saying that I&#x27;m 28 years old and have had Karatosis Pilaris on my thighs since I was 15 or 16.</li>
            <li>so it makes my legs feel soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they were filled with sebum/</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to use this for at least another couple of months to see if there is any more progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not a coarse enough scrub for my skin, just too gentle.</li>
            <li>I tried the body scrub in hopes that it would finally smooth out the last little bit of KP - and it worked!</li>
            <li>I used the cream and followed her advice for 6 months straight and saw absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li>Oh, and after 8 weeks of using this everyday, I am still on my first bottle.</li>

            <li> A little bit really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I went to refill my KP Duty, I saw this on the amazon page as a product with high reviews that people usually buy or look at instead.  </li>
            <li> I had rough bumpy skin on my upper arms for about 10 years and tried everything to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had the bumps that go along with KP, only the reddish/brownish dots.</li>
            <li> One bottle also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> But same as other scrubber made of acid.</li>
            <li> Take my advice, ignore all of those other extensive treatments and buy this.</li>
            <li> Once you dry off, immediately apply Amlactin which is a AHA moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little smoother, but the red marks are still there.</li>
            <li> but I started noticing my KP coming back a little.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected....</li>
            <li> My current regime is exfoliation with KP duty by derma doctor scrub (1-2 x/week) plus Palmers Alpha Beta Smoothing lotion (everyday).  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> but since it did not work, I would not recommend to others who are looking for a solution - especially since it is not cheap!</li>
            <li> Have tried other things for KP with no success.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did absolutely nothing for my KP.</li>
            <li> I also bought the body cream and after about a week of using both, the KP seems much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Not even a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve felt a little burning sensation after using the cream which went away after awhile.</li>
            <li> Still though, I had a little bit of roughness and redness that I couldn&#x27;t quite kick.</li>
            <li> My skin is generally a little oily so that may be why.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I typed in karatosis pilaris in the Amazon search bar just to see what would come up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this once a day, everyday for 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> I had trouble deciding whether to rate this a 3 or 4.</li>
            <li> The cream works well with it, but I can&#x27;t use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> The scrub I have to use everyday.  </li>
            <li> I had run out of the KP Duty and gotten lazy with the moisturizer, so by the time I started using this my KP had returned.  </li>
            <li> As someone who suffers from KP quite badly on my arms, I purchased this product hoping it would calm things down.  </li>
            <li> Anyways the goal here is to scrub hard for about 10 seconds and rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;3.)</li>
            <li> It is helpful just a little to remove my KP as the scrubber make  smaller bad keratin blocking my pores  ..</li>
            <li> If you are considering trying this, use it for at least 6 weeks before giving up!</li>
            <li> If you are considering trying this, use it for at least 6 weeks before giving up!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make it worse</li>
            <li> Expensive scrub, but</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see that.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but they were nasty looking.</li>

            <li> I used both of there products just as directed and it didn&#x27;t work at all. I am very disappointed wish I could get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I contacted elements and was issued a full refund. Although the product didn&#x27;t work for me I liked that I received good service and they backed up what they advertised.</li>
            <li> Item received as described.</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers from KP quite badly on my arms, I purchased this product hoping it would calm things down.  It&#x27;s a nice scrub and all, but I was hoping I would have gotten more out of it by the time I used up the bottle.  Now that it&#x27;s gone, I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> it works well. I had rough bumpy skin on my upper arms for about 10 years and tried everything to get rid of it. After using it a week my upper arms feel smooth and the bumps have gone away. will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the scrub once but so far Info like it. I can see myself ordering more of this scrub in the future. I like that there is a product that is specific to what I struggle with which is kp. I&#x27;ve felt a little burning sensation after using the cream which went away after awhile. I still like the product I just wish the product came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and lasts quite a while. I use the body cream as well.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use in the shower and seems to be helping a lot.  I use in conjunction with body exfoliater, KP exfoliating cream and Amlactin. The combination has made a huge difference I am very happy.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little smoother, but the red marks are still there. Expensive scrub, but I haven&#x27;t really seen improvement.</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft, however I was hoping it would fade the red blotchiness of porokeratosis.  I love that my skin does not feel bumpy &amp; is hydrated I just wish it would calm the redness.</li>
            <li> Seems to be workigg great so far.  I also bought the body cream and after about a week of using both, the KP seems much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Worked Very well on the skin.  Cleared up the issue and it helped reduce flareups.</li>
            <li> I will recommend for exfoliating; it makes my skin smooth; but I have not seen any improvement in my pilaris keratosis even though I use the KP cream afterwards.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my KP at all. For the price it would be best to go with a normal body scrub.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter who has had this skin condition since birth, esp on legs and arms. She has been using the product for a month, and feels it has helped diminish the appearance of the redness and bumps considerably. She is quite happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li> Did not work after 3 weeks of religiously using it.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that after 2 years, I finally found something that actually works.  My arms feel the way they used to, smooth and soft.  Hooray for this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very good scrub for bumpy skin.  I have the bumps on arms and back of legs.  This scub is not too harsh, smells good, and works as it says it will.</li>
            <li> Have tried other things for KP with no success. This scrub along with the body cream have really worked! My KP is essentially gone!</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.... It has sand all in it... so basically sand gets all over everything... I was disappointed to see that. But the product does work.... it just gets sand all over everything.</li>
            <li> I have not used the product for long enough to determine if it gets rid of the complexion issue completely but I do like the way my skin feels after bathing with it in the areas being treated.</li>
            <li> Did not get any results after using using this for one week with exfoliating gloves. For the price I expected more. H2O sea salt scrub was wonderful and made my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling with KP for about 15 years now and have tried too many products to list.  My current regime is exfoliation with KP duty by derma doctor scrub (1-2 x/week) plus Palmers Alpha Beta Smoothing lotion (everyday).  When I went to refill my KP Duty, I saw this on the amazon page as a product with high reviews that people usually buy or look at instead.  I went ahead and tried it and after about 3 weeks my KP has come back with a VENGEANCE.  And, it&#x27;s summer, which is even more unusual because my KP is usually better in the summer.  Regardless, I&#x27;ll count this among the numerous products that claim to help KP but in reality do nothing.</li>
            <li> Does not work. Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Did not help my KP at all. Not even a slight improvement. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> A great refreshing wash, a great way to exfoliate your skin, took away alot of the skin bumps i had , and soothing to the skin to.</li>
            <li> Used 3 times and already noticing a difference</li>
            <li> It is helpful just a little to remove my KP as the scrubber make  smaller bad keratin blocking my pores  ..I thought It would be  a great invention for the people suffered from kp. But same as other scrubber made of acid.</li>
            <li> I didnt notice a difference on my arms. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have never had anything work as quickly and easily as this product! It is truly a lifesaver! I never knew there was something to make my skin so smooth and &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;. I would recommend this to anyone with this issue.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ! Actually works. Start to see a difference after first use ;)</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I will keep this review very simple. This product simply works and my Keratosis Pilaris is gone. Just read the steps I took below and be free of bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Wash body with Aveeno Moisturizer (light scrub)&lt;br /&gt;2.) Apply a quarter sized of KP Elements on problem area. For me I had white head bumps on the back of my arms. I&#x27;m not sure if they were filled with sebum/puss because I couldn&#x27;t reach them but they were nasty looking. Anyways the goal here is to scrub hard for about 10 seconds and rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Once you dry off, immediately apply Amlactin which is a AHA moisturizer. You will a burning sensation which is completely normal and you know it&#x27;s doing the job of getting rid of the bumps.&lt;br /&gt;4.) Enjoy bump free skin. :)</li>
            <li> too early to tell if this really works.</li>
            <li> I can see considerable improvement in my KP in just 3 days, Im using it twice a day and applying CERAVE SE lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!!  I have used another product for some time now but I will definately be switching to KP Elements.  I could tell a difference in my KP the first time I used this product!!</li>
            <li> I switched to this after using DermDoctor&#x27;s KP Duty scrub for a while.  This was more gentle, but is working just as well.  I had run out of the KP Duty and gotten lazy with the moisturizer, so by the time I started using this my KP had returned.  This help decrease the number of bumps and redness just as well without causing the sun sensitivity.  Works best when applied with a small loofah.  I will keep using this rather than going back to KP Duty.</li>
            <li> I want to start out by saying that I&#x27;m 28 years old and have had Karatosis Pilaris on my thighs since I was 15 or 16. I&#x27;ve never really had the bumps that go along with KP, only the reddish/brownish dots. So my review of this product won&#x27;t apply to the bumpiness since I don&#x27;t have it, just the redness. I had this for years not knowing what the heck it was until I finally went to a dermatologist and got it diagnosed. The dermatologist prescribed me a cream with urea and gave me some tips on how to manage it including: not using any kind of soap or body wash on the affected area, taking cod liver oil supplements, and drinking more water. I used the cream and followed her advice for 6 months straight and saw absolutely no difference. After that I took matters into my own hands and began researching different treatments. I tried everything from soaps, lotions, scrubs, bath soaks, oils, vitamins, and supplements. Nothing helped, and I gave up for a while. A few weeks ago I typed in karatosis pilaris in the Amazon search bar just to see what would come up. I came across this stuff and because of the overall positive reviews decided to try it. I&#x27;ve been using this once a day, everyday for 3 weeks now. I had trouble deciding whether to rate this a 3 or 4. My KP is by no means gone, but this stuff does seem to be reducing the appearance of it, which is a lot more than I can say for any other treatment I&#x27;ve tried.  I also gave it 4 stars because it has a light, pleasant smell (in my opinion) and a little bit goes a long way. After using this for 3 weeks I am still on my first bottle with plenty to go. Also, it&#x27;s an exfoliating scrub so it makes my legs feel soft. I will definitely continue to use this for at least another couple of months to see if there is any more progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using this stuff for a little over 8 weeks, and there is a HUGE difference in the appearance of my skin. I really think you have to use it for at least 6 weeks before you start seeing your best results. I honestly can&#x27;t believe how much better my legs look. For the first time in over 10 years, I feel like I can wear shorts in public again. I realize that everyone&#x27;s KP is different and treatments that work for some, may not work for others. But this worked for me, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. If you are considering trying this, use it for at least 6 weeks before giving up! Oh, and after 8 weeks of using this everyday, I am still on my first bottle. A little bit really goes a long way.before you start seeing your best results.

            <li> I have been using this company&#x27;s skin cream for almost a year now, and it really helps with my KP. Still though, I had a little bit of roughness and redness that I couldn&#x27;t quite kick. I tried the body scrub in hopes that it would finally smooth out the last little bit of KP - and it worked! The exfoliation from the scrub was the real kicker for my skin and I noticed a real improvement after about a week of using it in combination with KP Elements cream. I tried just using the body scrub without the cream but I started noticing my KP coming back a little. The combo of the two is the best thing to exfoliate your skin and then use the cream to put the moisture back in. Both together really keep my KP at bay :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - here is the skin cream that I mentioned before (and love!), also on Amazon: [[ASIN:B004IS1GGC KP Elements Keratosis Pilaris Cream]]</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did absolutely nothing for my KP. Didn&#x27;t make it worse but it didn&#x27;t make it any better. It&#x27;s just not a coarse enough scrub for my skin, just too gentle.</li>
            <li> Works great! Been using this for about a month and it dries up my &amp;quot;KP zits&amp;quot; wonderfully. I&#x27;m considering trying the lotion as well as I think that will really keep the KP at bay!</li>
            <li> Its okay, nothing great but yet better than the cream they offer.</li>
            <li> I must confess, I did not expect this to work, I was just trying yet another solution to get rid of the kp on my thighs. Within less than a week, it cleared up and now the rear of my thighs are as smooth as the front. I just bought it by itself, without the accompanying lotion. What I did was use it twice a day with an advanced healing lotion for dry skin. One bottle also lasts a long time. I started with 2x a day for about 3 weeks, and now I use it once per day. I&#x27;ve had the one bottle for almost 2 months.Take my advice, ignore all of those other extensive treatments and buy this.</li>
            <li> It has only been 4 days since I started useing thing product and the KP creme and I am already seeing a big difference in my skin. After all the products I was given by my dermatologist, nothing works as good as KP Elements!</li>
            <li> This product did not help at all to clear up my Keratosis Pilaris on my arms... It is a decent product but since it did not work, I would not recommend to others who are looking for a solution - especially since it is not cheap! A 10% glycolic acid body wash worked for me.</li>
            <li> This scrub is amazing!  My arms have been covered in KP for the past 10 years and this is the first product that has worked on them.  They are now completely clear and I can wear short sleeve shirts again.  The cream works well with it, but I can&#x27;t use it everyday.  The scrub I have to use everyday.  My skin is generally a little oily so that may be why.</li>
