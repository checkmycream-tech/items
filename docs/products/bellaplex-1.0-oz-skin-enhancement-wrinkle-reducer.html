            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>This is a great product!  </li>
            <li>This product may in fact be awesome -</li>
            <li>Best of all, it evened out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Great product with incredibly inefficient packaging!</li>
            <li>your skin feels and looks great.</li>
            <li>But this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>but my guess is it is doing a great job at preventing them since it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see non-retouched photos of their before and after if it worked so great for them.  </li>
            <li>For the price my skin feels great, looks great and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>and I am still happy with it.</li>
            <li>Good service and great products.</li>
            <li>( they were good)</li>
            <li>I used this product for 60 days as I wanted to give it a fair shot at working.</li>
            <li>I bought a quantity of 2 bottles and tried it for 60 days to be completely fair.</li>
            <li>I am delighted.</li>
            <li>its great just on its own.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer and very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels on my skin!</li>
            <li>GREAT SMOOTH SERUM THAT SEEMS TO SINK INTO YOUR SKIN</li>
            <li>It is too soon to tell if this product is effective.</li>
            <li>Zip, no improvement or changes, I have my own pictures I took to see if there was a difference.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!</li>
            <li>But the product that had the best review was Bellaplex because it contains live collegen.  </li>
            <li>This is still the best so far on the market, I will tell my friends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten to the point now where I have tried so many of these so called, miracle creams that I now mix my own products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as effective as I thought it might be but maybe over time will be more improvement.  </li>
            <li>it works better than $85.00 creams I used to purchase from Lancome</li>
            <li>This feels better than all of them.</li>
            <li>There are much better products out there.</li>
            <li>Be sure to keep it on (don&#x27;t wash it) for 24 hours before making a decision.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a product girl and can no longer afford my favorite....</li>
            <li>and I should have known better.</li>
            <li>There are many well known products that do a much better job for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>When I called to return two unopened packages the company refused to allow the retune of more than one package.</li>
            <li>I take good care of my skin and stay out of the sun, still, age is showing noticeable lines around my eyes and my laugh lines are there.</li>
            <li>For which I am glad to report I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>With Bellaplex orders I have received the push top worked.</li>
            <li>Together they keep my face fully moisturized without becoming oily or clogged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told my skin looks great for being 56 years old.</li>
            <li>The pump did not have the most important detail that allows it to pump.  </li>
            <li>but when I took off the top, the bottle was still full.  </li>
            <li>it sounds too good to be true, it probably is\\&quot; certainly applies here.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 10 years now and it does reduce the fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes are gone.  </li>
            <li>It smelled different than the bottle I had gotten before that worked great.</li>
            <li>This did nothing that a cheap lotion wouldn&#x27;t have done just as well.  </li>
            <li>I was supposed to get a free magazine subscription with my order.</li>
            <li>The combination works well for me; it keeps my face nourished and smooth.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t see too much improvement after 30 days, but used it 2x a day for 60 days i see nice results.</li>
            <li>The product also smells like a cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that I could get it for cheaper at Amazon through Urban Nutrition.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t perform miracles but it&#x27;ll smooth it out a bit.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product when I ordered it direct from[...]  </li>
            <li>it is a smooth, non-greasy lotion that feels clean on your skin.</li>
            <li>I bought Bellaplex after some research - and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>It originally came with tubing with the pump.</li>
            <li>So I gave it a go, applied it to clean skin as directed, even went without makeup for a month.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing special.</li>
            <li>This product does not do anything special.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good at following instructions to a T.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin breaks out with most moisturizers, but this one is light and soothing.  </li>
            <li>so if you are looking for a quick fix, this is not what Bellaplex does.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several months and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>you use this product the better...and if the best results are supposed to take a few weeks/months, then I&#x27;m in for even more of a surprise because I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week.</li>
            <li>IT GOES REAL FAST.</li>
            <li>I have used many brands:  Clinique, Mary Kay, Avon ANEW, Clarins, Natural Advantage, and others.  </li>
            <li>The expense is worth it.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is very smooth, absorbs rather fast and leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My wrinkles are a lot less noticeable and my skin tone is really good</li>
            <li>It improves skin texture and lasticity at a very reasonable price.&#x60;</li>
            <li>This is an over priced synthetic face cream, go natural organic if you want a good moisturizer and keep searching for other worthy alternatives.</li>
            <li>the ingredients are listed so you know exactly what you get.</li>
            <li>After the first day I noticed a glow to my skin that was never there before.</li>
            <li>Also, one bottle will last me more than a month.  </li>
            <li>used the product consistently twice a day (using a tooth pick to get the product out).  </li>
            <li>If there is an effect, it does not last for more than a day.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, the ingredient list on this product did not match the ingredient list on the Bellaplex official website (previous bottles I received did match).  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my purchase of this item that is very pricy at all other places.</li>
            <li>It is a terrific product, but gave it four instead of 5 stars because I think I still need another month or so to really get results, as most reviewers have stated (6-8 weeks).</li>
            <li>I have ordered this item multiple times, I can&#x27;t say for sure that it really reduces wrinkles, but I like to think so.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and sinks in almost instantaneously.</li>
            <li>I also have very oily skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I found that the texture of my skin has improved and is much softer.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the improvement and smoothness of my skin much quicker than I noticed the diminishing of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It really does help with wrinkles</li>
            <li>and then, I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest it!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>i have used many \\&quot;age-defying\\&quot; skin treatments for the past 5 years and this is the first one that i am satisfied enough to re-order after finishing the bottle.</li>
            <li>I like that it has all four of the anti aging products in it, especially natural collagen.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THE PRODUCT, BUT CANT AFFORD TO ORDER FOR AWHILE.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>It seems very suspicious.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know if all these positiv reviews on the Bellaplex site are real.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference with this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much change as of yet in the appearance of deeper lines, but have noticed that the finer lines around my eyes seem less prominent.  </li>
            <li>I am a skin product junkie and have drawers full of lotions that promise to tighten, firm, reduce fine lines, improve uneven skin color and give my skin a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>And unlike most other creams it does not sting the eyes!  </li>
            <li>Product was delivered quickly and packed properly.  </li>
            <li>Mine did not list collagen which is one of the main reasons I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>BUT, I do strongly suggest that anyone trying this for the first time (or another skin tx) first test it on a very small area of your face.</li>
            <li>I received this product last week and started using it right away.  </li>
            <li>This is one product I cannot live without.  </li>
            <li>I will review the new bottle once I start to use it.</li>
            <li>My message is to try new products either on the inside of your elbow (crease) or the jawline before using it all over your face.</li>
            <li>Then another review that said exactly the opposite.  </li>
            <li>Definitely use with another more conditing lotion, but this is great as a base.  </li>
            <li>This is the first skin care  product I&#x27;ve used that actually delivers!</li>
            <li>Ok..so I&#x27;m not naive enough to truly believe a cream can make wrinkles disappear but this cream treats my skin very well.</li>
            <li>u look more youthful.u only need to apply a little.</li>
            <li>It took over 1 week for my face to clear up.</li>
            <li>I am approaching 30 and don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The soft lines around my eyes have diminished.</li>
            <li>old and have combination skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive eyes, and they were puffy for almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>The old saying \\&quot;If</li>
            <li>Some of the key ingredients are missing like DMAE - a top wrinkle fighting ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I am 47 years old and a high school science teacher, so obviously have the wrinkles to try this on and \\&quot;hopefully\\&quot; an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>Firstly, misrepresentation took place when I though I ordered only free samples with small shipping fee (according to their ad!), and it turned out that I had to pay for the kit $69.00.</li>
            <li>The wrinkles are less deep and my skin feels smooth and firmer.</li>
            <li>This product does not work as expected and cost way too much!</li>
            <li>You only need about two pumps since it is very light and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>(won&#x27;t make them dissapear totally), but it takes several months to really see an improvement.  </li>
            <li>I use a vitamin cream with natural ingredients mixed with StriVectin-SD.</li>
            <li>But the main problem I only have a tiny little amount left from the first bottle/ordered 4 bottles/.</li>
            <li>Many other important active ingredients are wrong or different from the product I ordered last year.</li>
            <li>This is a BIG money industry and it would not cost these companies very much to have a few people working the internet to steer us in their direction.</li>
            <li>I have used it for approximately one month now, and I notice that my fine lines have diminished and my overall skin texture has improved.  </li>

            <li> I REALLY LIKE THE PRODUCT, BUT CANT AFFORD TO ORDER FOR AWHILE.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> It seems very suspicious.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know if all these positiv reviews on the Bellaplex site are real.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference with this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much change as of yet in the appearance of deeper lines, but have noticed that the finer lines around my eyes seem less prominent.  </li>
            <li> I am a skin product junkie and have drawers full of lotions that promise to tighten, firm, reduce fine lines, improve uneven skin color and give my skin a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li> And unlike most other creams it does not sting the eyes!  </li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and packed properly.  </li>
            <li> Mine did not list collagen which is one of the main reasons I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> BUT, I do strongly suggest that anyone trying this for the first time (or another skin tx) first test it on a very small area of your face.</li>
            <li> I received this product last week and started using it right away.  </li>
            <li> This is one product I cannot live without.  </li>
            <li> I will review the new bottle once I start to use it.</li>
            <li> My message is to try new products either on the inside of your elbow (crease) or the jawline before using it all over your face.</li>
            <li> Then another review that said exactly the opposite.  </li>
            <li> Definitely use with another more conditing lotion, but this is great as a base.  </li>
            <li> This is the first skin care  product I&#x27;ve used that actually delivers!</li>
            <li> Ok..so I&#x27;m not naive enough to truly believe a cream can make wrinkles disappear but this cream treats my skin very well.</li>
            <li> u look more youthful.u only need to apply a little.</li>
            <li> It took over 1 week for my face to clear up.</li>
            <li> I am approaching 30 and don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The soft lines around my eyes have diminished.</li>
            <li> old and have combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes, and they were puffy for almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> The old saying \\&quot;If</li>
            <li> Some of the key ingredients are missing like DMAE - a top wrinkle fighting ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and a high school science teacher, so obviously have the wrinkles to try this on and \\&quot;hopefully\\&quot; an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Firstly, misrepresentation took place when I though I ordered only free samples with small shipping fee (according to their ad!), and it turned out that I had to pay for the kit $69.00.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles are less deep and my skin feels smooth and firmer.</li>
            <li> This product does not work as expected and cost way too much!</li>
            <li> You only need about two pumps since it is very light and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (won&#x27;t make them dissapear totally), but it takes several months to really see an improvement.  </li>
            <li> I use a vitamin cream with natural ingredients mixed with StriVectin-SD.</li>
            <li> But the main problem I only have a tiny little amount left from the first bottle/ordered 4 bottles/.</li>
            <li> Many other important active ingredients are wrong or different from the product I ordered last year.</li>
            <li> This is a BIG money industry and it would not cost these companies very much to have a few people working the internet to steer us in their direction.</li>
            <li> I have used it for approximately one month now, and I notice that my fine lines have diminished and my overall skin texture has improved.  </li>
            <li> In addition, aren&#x27;t we all just a little scared of growing older?</li>
            <li> I found reviews that said one product was by far the worst, but another was great.</li>
            <li> from what i did get out of the bottle it didnt seem to have any positive or negative  affects on my skin</li>
            <li> My complexion is still glowing even after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> This product did not work any better than less expensive items that I could buy at a health food store or drugstore.</li>
            <li> The results are not instant, I started to see changes in my skin half way through my second bottle.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think that I will replace my other products with this one.  </li>
            <li> I read multiple reviews for this and other products</li>
            <li> Both the ingredient list and the packaging were different from other bottles of this same product that I had previously ordered.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I saw absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you order online from official bellaplex website[...].</li>
            <li> It was not what I had expected nor did I like the quality of the product</li>
            <li> Three of the four key ingredients were missing from the list of ingredients on this bottle(Argireline, Matrixyl 3000 and Collagen).  </li>
            <li> Also, they are listed in different order and are either missing or adding some.  </li>
            <li> I thought the bottle was empty</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t care about the subscription, but I don&#x27;t appreciate the false advertising.</li>
            <li> No more red splotches.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to buy other products as they recommend,you can tell a difference on the skin,</li>
            <li> There might be a small effect, but it can equally by my imagination.  </li>
            <li> The worst thing is that the description leaves out some hazardous ingredients that this product actually has on the bottle label like Ceteareth-20 and Triethanolamine which are known carcinogens!</li>
            <li> I returned this product immediately upon receiving it because I believe it was an imitation product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I could not see any wrinkle-deminishing results, even though I used up the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li> It was not worth the price</li>
            <li> However, they should at the very least advertise the correct ingredient list that actually is on the bottle label!</li>
            <li> But my skin tone was uneven</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle of Bellaplex, which is poorly packaged to begin with.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to tighten and firm up my skin.  </li>
            <li> But at least I didn&#x27;t get any allergic reactions as with some other creams.  </li>
            <li> Amazon gave me a prompt refund, but did not refund the shipping charges, which I thought was poor customer service, given that this product is clearly not what it purports to be.</li>
            <li> I do use other products besides Bellaplex, but when I stopped using it for a few weeks (which I only did once), I am unhappy with my skin.  </li>
            <li> And I using a very little bit every time just to cover my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is going on here, but the ingredients list on the bottle is not what appears in the the description of the product.  </li>
            <li> And my face isn&#x27;t an oil slick by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this is at correcting wrinkles</li>
            <li> I ordered recently and received products with wrong ingredients.</li>
            <li> Collagen is missing from the product!</li>
            <li> THE TEXTURE IS SMOOTHER AND BRIGHTER, THE SMALL LINES AROUND THE EYES HAVE DIMINISHED, AND THE ELEVEN LINES BETWEEN MY EYES ARE VIRTUALY</li>
            <li> One bottle usually lasts me about 50 to 60 days.  </li>
            <li> It makes me wonder if the other reviewers are just working for the company and putting up false claims.  </li>
            <li> Once the level of the product decreased a little, my pump stopped pumping.  </li>
            <li> Please use your common sense and don&#x27;t do as my wife did.</li>
            <li> Seriously, save your money, do some research.  </li>
            <li> They were not good.  </li>
            <li> Anything with a pump leaves product behind which is next to impossible to get out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t review this item as I am horribly allergic to it.</li>
            <li> it came broken.  </li>
            <li> I called customer service, one lady said they shipped out wrong product and promised me to mail me correct ones within 3-5 days.</li>
            <li> A dangerous combination.</li>
            <li> I had a bad, disappointing experience with Bellaplex and Hydraxaton.</li>
            <li> I had just purchased a very expensive skin care regime from Cosmedicine</li>
            <li> But as said before, for me it was just like a very expensive moisturizing cream.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product for several months and I am very pleased with the results. It improves skin texture and lasticity at a very reasonable price.&#x60;</li>
            <li> This is still the best so far on the market, I will tell my friends.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is going on here, but the ingredients list on the bottle is not what appears in the the description of the product.  Some of the key ingredients are missing like DMAE - a top wrinkle fighting ingredient.  The worst thing is that the description leaves out some hazardous ingredients that this product actually has on the bottle label like Ceteareth-20 and Triethanolamine which are known carcinogens! This product is definitely not organic, but then again I guess it doesn&#x27;t claim to be.  However, they should at the very least advertise the correct ingredient list that actually is on the bottle label! My advise to others in this market is become an informed consumer - Know what your putting on your face, because it could end up backfiring!</li>
            <li> This product is owesome it works better than $85.00 creams I used to purchase from Lancome ( they were good) your skin feels and looks great. the ingredients are listed so you know exactly what you get. This one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> This product is great! I am approaching 30 and don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles. But my skin tone was uneven and I was concerned about pore size. I also have very oily skin that is prone to breakouts. But this stuff is great. It goes on very smooth and sinks in almost instantaneously. After the first day I noticed a glow to my skin that was never there before. I think this product really helps exfoliate dead skin cells which I believe I&#x27;ve always had a problem with. And my face isn&#x27;t an oil slick by the end of the day. My complexion is still glowing even after a long day at work. I&#x27;m not sure how this is at correcting wrinkles but my guess is it is doing a great job at preventing them since it it keeping my skin balanced so well. I&#x27;m thinking the sooner you use this product the better...and if the best results are supposed to take a few weeks/months, then I&#x27;m in for even more of a surprise because I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I ordered Bellaplex from ebay for a cheaper price.  It smelled different than the bottle I had gotten before that worked great. I looked at the ingredients and there is no ARGIRELINE, OR MATRIXYL 3000 listed on my bottle, and a bunch of junk ingredients that isn&#x27;t supposed to be in there. Totally different product and a big rip off.</li>
            <li> I received this product last week and started using it right away.  I found that the texture of my skin has improved and is much softer.  It also has tightened my pores making them appear smaller.  I haven&#x27;t seen much change as of yet in the appearance of deeper lines, but have noticed that the finer lines around my eyes seem less prominent.  Overall I think that I will replace my other products with this one.  I have used many brands:  Clinique, Mary Kay, Avon ANEW, Clarins, Natural Advantage, and others.  This feels better than all of them.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bellaplex for almost three years now (May 2007).  This is one product I cannot live without.  It is not a lotion that has instant results.  It does take time to work and once you stop using it, you notice a big difference.  I noticed the improvement and smoothness of my skin much quicker than I noticed the diminishing of wrinkles.  It really does help with wrinkles (won&#x27;t make them dissapear totally), but it takes several months to really see an improvement.  I have ordered both from the Bellaplex website and from Amazon and can&#x27;t tell the difference.  I am a loyal customer and very happy with the product.  My wrinkles are a lot less noticeable and my skin tone is really good and I just turned 50.  I do use other products besides Bellaplex, but when I stopped using it for a few weeks (which I only did once), I am unhappy with my skin.  Also, one bottle will last me more than a month.  I try and use it twice a day, but if I miss now and then, I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  You only need about two pumps since it is very light and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 60 days as I wanted to give it a fair shot at working. I am 47 years old and a high school science teacher, so obviously have the wrinkles to try this on and \\&quot;hopefully\\&quot; an unbiased opinion. I have to say I saw absolutely no difference. I am starting to wonder about the ads, the reviews, the websites, all claiming to be unbiased reviewers out there. I found reviews that said one product was by far the worst, but another was great. Then another review that said exactly the opposite.  This is a BIG money industry and it would not cost these companies very much to have a few people working the internet to steer us in their direction. In addition, aren&#x27;t we all just a little scared of growing older? A dangerous combination.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  The results are not instant, I started to see changes in my skin half way through my second bottle.  Definitely use with another more conditing lotion, but this is great as a base.  Product was delivered quickly and packed properly.  I highly suggest it!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It contains all of the necessary beauty ingredients like matrixyl 3000 and argireline and Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-3.  I notice a difference as soon as I put it on my skin.   The price here is cheaper than the auto shipment from the bellaplex site itself!    Update...I continue to buy this product because I do notice a difference when I do not use it. I have been using it for a couple of years now. They have recently changed the packaging and it looks alot smaller!  But it claims to be 1 once still. I will review the new bottle once I start to use it.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle of Bellaplex, which is poorly packaged to begin with.  Anything with a pump leaves product behind which is next to impossible to get out of the bottle.  This did nothing that a cheap lotion wouldn&#x27;t have done just as well.  My wrinkles are all the same, nothing has changed at all.  It makes me wonder if the other reviewers are just working for the company and putting up false claims.  I&#x27;d like to see non-retouched photos of their before and after if it worked so great for them.  Anyway, as always, buyer beware...</li>
            <li> Be careful when you order online from official bellaplex website[...]. I ordered recently and received products with wrong ingredients. Collagen is missing from the product! Many other important active ingredients are wrong or different from the product I ordered last year. I called customer service, one lady said they shipped out wrong product and promised me to mail me correct ones within 3-5 days. I waited for almost four weeks but did not receive anything from her. Called again and found out she has never shipped out the correct product.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing special. I bought a quantity of 2 bottles and tried it for 60 days to be completely fair. This product did not work any better than less expensive items that I could buy at a health food store or drugstore. Plus, I think the Bellaplex website rips people off. I was supposed to get a free magazine subscription with my order. I contacted them twice only to be ignored. I really didn&#x27;t care about the subscription, but I don&#x27;t appreciate the false advertising. Seriously, save your money, do some research.  There are much better products out there. I&#x27;ve gotten to the point now where I have tried so many of these so called, miracle creams that I now mix my own products. I use a vitamin cream with natural ingredients mixed with StriVectin-SD. The combination works well for me; it keeps my face nourished and smooth. The soft lines around my eyes have diminished.</li>
            <li> I bought Bellaplex after some research - and I am not disappointed.  My sensitive skin breaks out with most moisturizers, but this one is light and soothing.  I have used it for approximately one month now, and I notice that my fine lines have diminished and my overall skin texture has improved.  On some days, my skin almost glows.  It is a terrific product, but gave it four instead of 5 stars because I think I still need another month or so to really get results, as most reviewers have stated (6-8 weeks).</li>
            <li> GREAT SMOOTH SERUM THAT SEEMS TO SINK INTO YOUR SKIN....I HAVE USED THIS FOR APPR. ONE MONTH AND CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE THE CHANGE IN MY SKIN....THE TEXTURE IS SMOOTHER AND BRIGHTER, THE SMALL LINES AROUND THE EYES HAVE DIMINISHED, AND THE ELEVEN LINES BETWEEN MY EYES ARE VIRTUALY GONE...WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering a product called Bellalabs and was sent this. It was not what I had expected nor did I like the quality of the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approx 3 weeks and I have noticed some improvement in the appearance of wrinkles.  It&#x27;s not as effective as I thought it might be but maybe over time will be more improvement.  Softness of my skin has definately improved.  This product makes my skin feel soothed and hyrdated.</li>
            <li> I returned this product immediately upon receiving it because I believe it was an imitation product.  Both the ingredient list and the packaging were different from other bottles of this same product that I had previously ordered.  Most importantly, the ingredient list on this product did not match the ingredient list on the Bellaplex official website (previous bottles I received did match).  Three of the four key ingredients were missing from the list of ingredients on this bottle(Argireline, Matrixyl 3000 and Collagen).  Amazon gave me a prompt refund, but did not refund the shipping charges, which I thought was poor customer service, given that this product is clearly not what it purports to be.</li>
            <li> I use Annemarie Borlind Naturoyale Biolifting cream at night and this product during the day. Together they keep my face fully moisturized without becoming oily or clogged. I am 43 yrs. old and have combination skin. I have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin since using this product - never did before using over-the-counter products. The expense is worth it.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t review this item as I am horribly allergic to it. BUT, I do strongly suggest that anyone trying this for the first time (or another skin tx) first test it on a very small area of your face. My face was beet red &amp; rashy and my eyes swelled up severly. It took over 1 week for my face to clear up. I have extremely sensitive eyes, and they were puffy for almost 2 weeks. This product may in fact be awesome - I don&#x27;t know. My message is to try new products either on the inside of your elbow (crease) or the jawline before using it all over your face. Be sure to keep it on (don&#x27;t wash it) for 24 hours before making a decision. This suggestion came from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> i have used many \\&quot;age-defying\\&quot; skin treatments for the past 5 years and this is the first one that i am satisfied enough to re-order after finishing the bottle. i didn&#x27;t see too much improvement after 30 days, but used it 2x a day for 60 days i see nice results. it is a smooth, non-greasy lotion that feels clean on your skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend Bellaplex.  I have been using it for about 10 years now and it does reduce the fine lines on my face.  It does not work over night so if you are looking for a quick fix, this is not what Bellaplex does.  It works over time.  I like that it has all four of the anti aging products in it, especially natural collagen.  My face is younger looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: You MUST leave your face damp then put the Bellaplex on, that helps the lotion to spread easier and helps a bottle last longer. One bottle usually lasts me about 50 to 60 days.  Some were asking about age, well I&#x27;m now 52.</li>
            <li> I am a skin product junkie and have drawers full of lotions that promise to tighten, firm, reduce fine lines, improve uneven skin color and give my skin a more youthful appearance.  I had just purchased a very expensive skin care regime from Cosmedicine and I googled it to see what kinds of reviews it had received.  They were not good.  But the product that had the best review was Bellaplex because it contains live collegen.  I found it on Amazon for 1/2 price and bought a bottle and started using it twice a day.  It has done wonders for my skin.  It does seem to tighten and firm up my skin.  The fine lines around my eyes are gone.  Gone. Best of all, it evened out my skin tone.  No more red splotches.  Buy it.  Use it liberally, don&#x27;t be stingy with it, twice a day and you&#x27;ll see results.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I could not see any wrinkle-deminishing results, even though I used up the whole bottle.  But at least I didn&#x27;t get any allergic reactions as with some other creams.  The cream itself is very smooth, absorbs rather fast and leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated. And unlike most other creams it does not sting the eyes!  But as said before, for me it was just like a very expensive moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> It is too soon to tell if this product is effective. I like it so far. It is not greasy. Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Ok..so I&#x27;m not naive enough to truly believe a cream can make wrinkles disappear but this cream treats my skin very well. I&#x27;m a product girl and can no longer afford my favorite....Chantecaille so I gave this one a whirl. For the price my skin feels great, looks great and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Being in my 40&#x27;s has not helped my acne prone skin and when I use this cream I do not break out. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This product does not do anything special. It was not worth the price and I should have known better.</li>
            <li> This product does not work as expected and cost way too much! There are many well known products that do a much better job for a fraction of the cost. The product also smells like a cheap perfume. When I called to return two unopened packages the company refused to allow the retune of more than one package. Please use your common sense and don&#x27;t do as my wife did. The old saying \\&quot;If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is\\&quot; certainly applies here.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that in 3 weeks I see a big change in my skin. The wrinkles are less deep and my skin feels smooth and firmer. I am delighted. I just re-ordered it. This is the first skin care  product I&#x27;ve used that actually delivers!</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THE PRODUCT, BUT CANT AFFORD TO ORDER FOR AWHILE. I SEE A DIFFERENCE. IT GOES REAL FAST. THANKS</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I ordered it direct from[...]  I was happy to see that I could get it for cheaper at Amazon through Urban Nutrition.  But, and this is a big BUT... the ingredients are not the same.  Mine did not list collagen which is one of the main reasons I bought it.  Also, they are listed in different order and are either missing or adding some.  It seems very suspicious.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my purchase of this item that is very pricy at all other places. I would recommend this site and product in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m good at following instructions to a T. After reading reviews over at the Beauty product sites (which is probably owned by the product itself) I made a purchase. I take good care of my skin and stay out of the sun, still, age is showing noticeable lines around my eyes and my laugh lines are there. So I gave it a go, applied it to clean skin as directed, even went without makeup for a month. NOTHING. Zip, no improvement or changes, I have my own pictures I took to see if there was a difference. This is an over priced synthetic face cream, go natural organic if you want a good moisturizer and keep searching for other worthy alternatives. I&#x27;m not against lab created stuff but I expect it to WORK!</li>
            <li> I am using the product for ca. 3 years and I am still happy with it. It definitely helps with wrinkle reduction.</li>
            <li> I am using this product and my family noticed already a change, they do not know what was the change, but they asked me if I changed my makeup.  Good service and great products. Thanks</li>
            <li> why don&#x27;t anyone mention the 30 day supply enough for about 2 weeks? I don&#x27;t even know if all these positiv reviews on the Bellaplex site are real. I&#x27;m using Bellaplex for 16 days,2 times a day,no visible results yet. But the main problem I only have a tiny little amount left from the first bottle/ordered 4 bottles/. And I using a very little bit every time just to cover my wrinkles. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the way it supposed to be. I don&#x27;t know what to do,send it back,or wait for 2 month until the 4 month supply run out? Does anybody else has the same issue?</li>
            <li> Put this product in a jar! A pump without tubing does not work! Great product with incredibly inefficient packaging! It originally came with tubing with the pump. Am returning it opened because of the lack of tubing issue.q</li>
            <li> I have decided I will never buy another \\&quot;wrinkle cream\\&quot; on line again. I read multiple reviews for this and other products and I now believe that people who have written these reviews are either paid to write them or they are written by the companies. I have been using this product day and night for over a month and I haven&#x27;t seen a bit of difference. The only thing that I can say that I actually like about this product is that it isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> I had a bad, disappointing experience with Bellaplex and Hydraxaton. Firstly, misrepresentation took place when I though I ordered only free samples with small shipping fee (according to their ad!), and it turned out that I had to pay for the kit $69.00. Secondly, they started \\&quot;renewing\\&quot; my order and charging me automatically without me even knowing it. I would like to warn everyone: stay away from those sneaky guys - once you give them your billing info, they&#x27;ll start charging you before you even know. The company should be sued for unethical business! DO NOT TRUST THEIR AD!</li>
            <li> Lines are getting noticable smaller. Skin looks healthier, skin smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase product again. Will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;I do reccommend.</li>
            <li> its great just on its own. Don&#x27;t need to buy other products as they recommend,you can tell a difference on the skin,u look more youthful.u only need to apply a little.Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference with this product. It does moisturize but you have to use allot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get botox injections anymore because I feel Bellaplex is taking care of my wrinkles.  If you have deep creases in between the brow area then apply bellaplex morning and night.  It won&#x27;t perform miracles but it&#x27;ll smooth it out a bit.  Overall I&#x27;ve been told my skin looks great for being 56 years old.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this item multiple times, I can&#x27;t say for sure that it really reduces wrinkles, but I like to think so. I love how it feels on my skin!</li>
            <li> The pump did not have the most important detail that allows it to pump.  Once the level of the product decreased a little, my pump stopped pumping.  I opened the container itself, and saw no attachment that would allow it to pump - surprise!&lt;br /&gt;I used the product consistently twice a day (using a tooth pick to get the product out).  My wrinkles are still there...  There might be a small effect, but it can equally by my imagination.  If there is an effect, it does not last for more than a day.</li>
            <li> it came broken.  and i never got a refund.... from what i did get out of the bottle it didnt seem to have any positive or negative  affects on my skin</li>
            <li> I ordered Bellaplex Skin Enhancement wrinkle Reducer hoping it would work. For which I am glad to report I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The delivery system did not work.  I thought the bottle was empty but when I took off the top, the bottle was still full.  I have been trying to get the lotion out with a q tip.  With Bellaplex orders I have received the push top worked.</li>
