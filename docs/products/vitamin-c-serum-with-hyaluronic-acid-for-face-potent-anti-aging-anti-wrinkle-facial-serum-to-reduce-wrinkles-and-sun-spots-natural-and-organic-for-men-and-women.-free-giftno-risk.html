            <li>This time the pump seems to pump much better.</li>

            <li>Product also shipped and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but it does not go very far.  </li>
            <li>And when combined with a good regimin, it helps you stay young!</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell, very gentle</li>

            <li>It has made a huge difference.  </li>

            <li>After receiving a promotional coupon, I was excited to try this Vitamin C Serum product.  </li>

            <li>Love this product ;)</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this item as a promotion.</li>
            <li>I am excited to get the pump bottle of the vitamon C serum and continue to use the product.  </li>

            <li>I like this product line and as a first time user of the line I am pleased that is why 4 stars.</li>

            <li>‚Ä¶ I will continue to use it and am excited to see the results after 6 months.</li>
            <li>I literally wiped the mirror to get my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>I love the way this serum goes on very light, not heavy.</li>
            <li>I use 1-2 &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; to cover my face and neck at night on clean face.  </li>
            <li>My big concern is that, tonight when I was checking the container for an expiration date I held the bottle up to a bright light and noticed that the TOULON label had another label underneath...OZNY Skincare anti aging serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pharmacist, and have a lot of experience with all prescription and over-the-counter products, and out of the hundreds of products on the market today, this is the one single product that I happily recommend and encourage people to try.</li>
            <li>Perfect for when you want your skin to look dewy and fresh for a special event or even everyday.  </li>
            <li>Just this one benefit of beautifully soft skin alone would keep me using this product, but there&#x27;s so much more!</li>
            <li>Fantastic fantastic fantastic, I m 75 years old, had some sun damage and wrinkles and all is sooooo much better.</li>
            <li>The Vit C anti age serum was a great find for a few reasons: it was in a very convenient container to get the most of out the product, unlike most anti age serum</li>
            <li>I am so happy I found this anti-aging serum because it is amazing compared to other high quality serum.  </li>
            <li>OKAY BECAUSE GOT  THIS ITEM FOR A LARGE REDUCTION IN PRICE</li>
            <li>But I also feel like I could certainly use it longer and see more benefits.  </li>
            <li>I have fair sensitive skin and was a little nervous, happy to report I worried for nothing.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very picky, and this product is very light weight, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I ordered another bottle for myself and one for my sister.</li>
            <li>Love it highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really have been enjoying my serum. ¬†</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wrinkles: Since I don&#x27;t have conspicuous wrinkles, I can&#x27;t really tell whether it works for wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Sun spots: I don&#x27;t have many sun spots.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t really sure it was doing much for me.</li>
            <li>Good for younger people looking for anti-aging prevention tools.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have switched over to this serum which is much lighter.  </li>
            <li>I love it, A+, and highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>Ok serum can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing much.  </li>
            <li>my fine lines that was getting more defined by the minute it seemed, well, it is nearly unnoticable!</li>
            <li>With the high cost on many beauty products this is budget friendly</li>
            <li>Serum goes on smooth and is absorbed quickly with no residual stickiness.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and feels soft and moisturizing, almost like a light face oil.</li>
            <li>My best friend mentioned Toulon Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid to me, at first I was a bit sceptical as I usually am, however, I know my friend and if she says it&#x27;s something special</li>
            <li>This drives extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>I am now a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>Since I am getting older I am looking for better skin products.  </li>
            <li>It is soaked up quickly by my skin and leaves it glowing.  </li>
            <li>the witch hazel that dries quickly.</li>
            <li>There is no smell to the serum, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>and I did notice it&#x27;s clarifying effects rather quickly.</li>
            <li>The product was easy to use, clear and left a nice clean feeling on my skin / unlike many products that I have tried that were greasy and thick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am going to look to see if there is a more concentrated version if not I will more than likely re-buy.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my complexion is more vibrant and even.</li>
            <li>It came quick and I used it that night.  </li>
            <li>The cream bottle is very pretty and looks for fancy on my vanity.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the vitamin c serum it makes my face feel amazing with no sensitivity at all which i have had with other vitamin c products</li>
            <li>I received it nearly two weeks ago and have already noticed some pretty amazing results.</li>
            <li>It shipped very quickly and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, odorless, and absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is fragrance free and is very gentle on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>At 42, that is exactly what I am looking for!</li>
            <li>Love it so far!  </li>
            <li>The product leaves my skin feeling fresh and it is perfect for my under eyes especially after long nights.</li>
            <li>I have worked in many spas and am very familiar with high quality skin care products, and this is by far one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Texture of this product: Very watery and quickly and smoothly applied.</li>
            <li>Not a heavy gunk but instead quite light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Natural and/or organic is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>serum is clear, has no scent, and is very light.  </li>
            <li>There are 2 very popular and necessary in our skin care active ingredients: Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;The concentration of Vitamin C is 20% which is very high and works fast and great on my skin to reduce Hyper-pigmentation (sun damage) and</li>
            <li>I see the fine lines disappearing around my eyes and my skin is much tighter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and definitely helps with fine lines and wrinkles, as well as age spots.  </li>
            <li>I am even more amazed that it is actually helping to reduce my fine lines ...</li>
            <li>My skin looks great besides a few spot which I think have lighted.</li>
            <li>, now I have been using it everyday morning and night for a week and its great.</li>
            <li>I really like that the serum is frangrance free.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I am definitely seeing some improvement.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>I love how soft my skin feels after I apply it.</li>
            <li>Since beginning use of this product my skin has more of a glow &amp; is so soft.  </li>
            <li>I love all natural products.  </li>
            <li>I use it both day and night and moisturize once it has absorbed.  </li>
            <li>The serum goes on so smoothly and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I recommend the product and it is well worth its money.</li>
            <li>So many do not make it as far as you have.</li>
            <li>so I feel that it is worth</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to most products.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is fast absorbing and non greasy.  </li>
            <li>I believe the airless pump bottle helps keep light out and stabilize the vit c much better than the eye dropper bottles you open up each day.  </li>
            <li>It had all the right ingredients and thus far has provided outstanding results.</li>
            <li>This company has a lot of products that are very effective and useful to our everyday uses.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the results: my skin looks and feels more uniform and smooth; wrinkles seem less prominent and the overall texture looks younger.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are mostly natural, which is important if your skin is easily irritated by many commercial skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes when I use it right out of the shower, it burns.</li>
            <li>The hyaluronic acid acts a sponge and absorbs the moisture right to your skin.</li>
            <li>and it seems to set everything just right.  </li>
            <li>Dr oz was right, vitamin c all the way</li>
            <li>My rating right now is strictly on the consistency and the way it comes out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>an they respond right away if you have any questions.  </li>
            <li>I also like the packaging that dispenses just the right amount.</li>
            <li>right vitamin c can drop a decade from your face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to continued positive results!</li>
            <li>Please write down what really you have experienced people.</li>
            <li>The serum is light and absorbs quickly into my skin leaving the skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>My face is breaking out less and just feels so much better and looks better</li>
            <li>Also, for a Vitamin C serum to be the most effective and for proper absorption, it needs to have a vitamin ration of 10% or above, with 20% being optimal.  </li>
            <li>I have been enjoyed this serum as I feel like it is not only keeping my skin hydrated, soft, and healthy during these drier months but also helping to combat some skin challenges.  </li>
            <li>Very effective!would definitely order more of this!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see if it has made much difference with fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>Excited to see a high quality option in a pump.  </li>
            <li>This serum is very sticky but goes away quickly once it soaks into the skin.  </li>
            <li>The instructions were clear and the product was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>However, I can say that it is easy on sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  </li>
            <li>And so less wrinkles is a good thing</li>
            <li>My skin is glowing and very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Super simple fast pump, great viscosity of product, fast absorbing, no fragrance, and leaves the skin really soft.  </li>
            <li>I went to a very popular online seller of cosmetics and looked at 8 different brands of Vit C Serum ranging in price from $45 to $155, all the same size at Toulon, 1 oz.  </li>
            <li>It helps to improve healing process of acne issues also.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing light and in the same time rich</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly into the skin and has left my skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>I am a 51 year old woman who has, regrettably, not taken very good care of my skin until the past five years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually had more breakouts on my chin since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>this serum twice daily as directed, a bottle of the serum lasts a bit more than a month....</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty generous with the amount of serum that I use during application.</li>
            <li>This pump is really a pretty efficient dispenser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be aware that this product will not make your wrinkles go away permanently, it just diminishes them so you have to keep on using it.  </li>
            <li>But, I gave it a shot and used in at night first.</li>
            <li>of why I love this product:  A lot of Vitamin C serums have ingredients in them that can actually harm your skin like preservatives, or DMAE and retinyl palmitate.  </li>
            <li>and it make my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and that was using it only at night most of the time.</li>
            <li>This is a really fantastic serum for the 40-something year old to help take care of wrinkles and age spots.  </li>
            <li>(The Toulon label was simply glued on top of it...</li>
            <li>Not too much!  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the first one was defective.  </li>
            <li>I first tried the serum on my neck and chest area.  </li>
            <li>I really like it!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many that were too watery or had the opposite problem and seemed oily on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Your hands are one of the first places that show your age.  </li>
            <li>and it absorbed into my skin really fast.</li>
            <li>I am using my Serum for 3 days and my face is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>Using it on my face but also on my d√©collet√©, Thanks!</li>
            <li>I am pretty fussy about my skin care products.</li>
            <li>At the first sign of a skin irritation I dab some on and this vitamin C serum clears up any signs of irritation.  </li>
            <li>Love the serum especially around the eyes</li>
            <li>but I have noticed my skin is a lot smoother exactly where I have been applying it</li>
            <li>and I thought it worked pretty well</li>
            <li>The first application I overused.</li>
            <li>That is a real plus!</li>
            <li>It is very watery!</li>
            <li>I love the vit c with hyaluronic serum and will continue to use it daily.  </li>
            <li>Follow the directions and apply a good moisturizer with sunblock after it has dried.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s got a round top with an easy push-down mechanism as opposed to just a spout.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and sheer and absorbs quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a VERY watery product that will slide right through your fingers if you pump it into your hand to apply it.  </li>
            <li>I refuse to use products with harsh chemicals on my skin, but am more than happy to use products with natural and organic ingredients, such as this Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li>pretty positive this serum is to thank.</li>
            <li>Well, one small thing, the pump is great but be careful to make sure it is pointed at your hand.  </li>
            <li>Well, one small thing, the pump is great but be careful to make sure it is pointed at your hand.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear and clean.</li>
            <li>I am constantly searching for a good facial moisturizer</li>
            <li>And if OZNY is an offshoot of Toulon how long was that because my original container indicated this was originally an OZNY product.</li>
            <li>I only recently heard how helpful using a good serum under a moisturizer can be for your skin.</li>
            <li>It feels like silk and applies very easily, providing my otherwise dry skin with much needed weightless moisture.</li>
            <li>This stuff sinks right in and your skin feels like magic.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and even bought the other TOULON products because of the high quality of the serum.  </li>
            <li>I first heard of this serum from a friend in Florida who really watches her skin for signs of aging/ sun damage.</li>
            <li>This one had not only a great reviews but also had all three ingredients including other ingredients which are beneficial.  </li>
            <li>The skin absorbs it quickly and leaves it feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product goes on easy and feels as if your face comes back to life.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It seem more dry after 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I feel this products absorption into my skin, topically it feels smooth also, and there are no uncomfortable after affects.</li>
            <li>I love that this serum leaves me feeling fresh and light, rather than greasy like other similar products have.</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li>I do have large pores and didn&#x27;t feel like this blocked them.  </li>
            <li>It is different because it is very light weight and sheer and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to report that the serum is actually helping make these less visible.</li>
            <li>Very generous amount for the price, especially for a serum that has such high quality ingredients and more importantly, works.  </li>
            <li>In a short period, a week or two, I can already see a difference with the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  </li>
            <li>but I have wanted to start with a high quality vitamin C because I am aware of the benefits to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I believe that your body makes collagen to keep skin tight, so using the right ingredients on your skin can stimulate your body to make its own collagen and provide a more firm youthful look.</li>
            <li>Amazingly noticeable difference in just a few days.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a change.  </li>
            <li>My wife wants to get rid of the sun spot and the pigmentation but nothing has been changed.</li>
            <li>Very diasppointed.</li>
            <li>I had expected more of an oil.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t produce as much oil.</li>
            <li>A lot of Vitamin C Serums are very sticky when applied to the face and by this, I know that they are working and have quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It seems to leave my face soft and smooth and my skin seems to feel more tighter and firm.</li>
            <li>I really do like the added moisture it provides.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product!</li>
            <li>This product is indeed very helpful in promoting skin tightening.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>The serum comes out of the dispenser to fast</li>
            <li>I have tried and spent money on so many things that didn&#x27;t work , so I am overjoyed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>, my sensitive/acne prone skin really likes it.</li>
            <li>My skin really is noticeably smoother and tighter since I have been using this product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really understand how some reviews said they got no results at all.  </li>
            <li>You have to be so careful, way too many products out there that have harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li>has REALLY sold me on the Toulon brand of vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>There really is nothing to NOT like about this product</li>
            <li>It comes out fast</li>
            <li>There really is nothing to NOT like about this product</li>
            <li>It comes out fast</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really massage it in as much as it says to.</li>
            <li>but I can say that it is very hydrating and smells</li>
            <li>You really feel it</li>
            <li>and you really see the results too.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really do get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this serum -</li>
            <li>My face looks brighter and is so much smoother.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It has really helped with pigmentation issues and keeping my skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone looking to try a serum!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It sits so gently on my skin</li>
            <li>My tip is that you don&#x27;t need much to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>I really like the TOULON vitamin C serum because it comes in a pump bottle.  </li>
            <li>Using it every morning and night has made my face and neck feel much smoother.  </li>
            <li>and I really have to take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes and makes skin feel much softer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>;  I feel like I really like this product</li>
            <li>Gentle and calming.  </li>
            <li>I really like this vitamin c</li>
            <li>I have tried this product two times a day for one month and it really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Smell:</li>
            <li>Literally no smell or very slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>You do not need that much to feel a difference.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my girlfriend, and she is absolutely hooked.</li>
            <li>We will be re ordering is very soon</li>
            <li>My complexion is beaming and much brighter than it was a couple of weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a generous size for the price and the packaging is sleek and modern.</li>
            <li>Trust me, I have tried almost every popular brand out there and abandoned them after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>and after a few minutes kind of gives you a tightening of the skin.</li>
            <li>An obvious solution would be to pump it directly onto your face and then quickly smooth it around (before it drips right off).  </li>
            <li>I was scared to use at first because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to purchase the Eye Renewal Serum next to see how it helps with my crows feet.  </li>
            <li>The serum itself is really well packaged - the bottle looks like that of a pricey high end brand.</li>
            <li>Within the first day or two, my skin felt so unbelievably soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of a serum expert at this point and usually they tingle.</li>
            <li>i.e. it seemed like the bottle was only about 1/2 full.  </li>
            <li>My skin overall is looking much healthier and does actually have more of a glow to it.</li>
            <li>I had been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Brightening Dark Spot Corrector because it has safe ingredients</li>
            <li>The product soaks in well and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue like many other products!</li>
            <li>and i now have the confidence to meet new people!</li>
            <li>have very sensative skin and tend to break out often when putting something new on my face.  </li>
            <li>It feels light under the other products I use, a positive asset for any skincare routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find I&#x27;m needing less foundation because my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>So, after just a couple of weeks I am seeing my undereye area become less darkened, more hydrated and</li>
            <li>Finally, I need to add that most serums have the same ingredients.</li>
            <li>Makes,my face feel smooth and soft when applied, though it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any real lasting effect (after about a month of use).  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get this with a promotional code.</li>
            <li>I have not seen this or felt this with this particular serum.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly into my skin instantly giving my skin a silky feeling.  </li>
            <li>This product works better than ALL the expensive  creams, serums and potions, combined, I have bought over many years.</li>
            <li>my research, I knew I needed to add/incorporate 3 main ingredients into my regime: 20% vitamin C, MSM (sulfur), and hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>and I know the main ingredient, aloe, takes well to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, I think that I would buy this again, but I would debate about it if I had to pay the retail price because there are so many competitors that offer a seemingly similar product for around $20.;</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get this with a coupon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m noticing my skin very soft!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Oz Natural!</li>
            <li>I would suggest using a high SPF as Vit C Serum can make sunburn easier.</li>
            <li>Before even opening, you feel the high quality, spa-like feeling.  </li>
            <li>The ingredient list on the Toulon serum meets my high standards for putting on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Will highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li>I could tell when I opened it and felt it that it is high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>Toul√¥n Vitamin C Serum is like a little miracle in a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;The application of the serum is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I also see a little more vibrancy in my skin since using it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference with fine lines and wrinkles but have noticed my skin definitely feels softer and have only been using for about two weeks.</li>
            <li>Toulon offers the highly touted combination of recommended ingredients for one&#x27;s skin care at a very competitive price.  </li>
            <li>What i like about this product, after i used at night, in a morning i feel like a different person, I look fresh and prettier, what I like the most i can put just a little on my finger, I can put it on my all face, this one is a keeper</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to toss my old moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin, I am really picky about the products I use.</li>
            <li>I am seeing a real difference in less noticable fine lines and</li>
            <li>&quot; look but a much improved natural look.</li>
            <li>I often have some blemishes and using the serum has helped clear them up much quicker than they would heal without help from the vit c.  </li>
            <li>I feel like some manufacturers make there pumps waste more than needed</li>
            <li>My laugh lines will always be there, but I&#x27;ve noticed the smaller lines have begun to fade.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I like wrinkles</li>
            <li>Love the feel of it on my skin and just after a few days of using there is a softness to my cheeks.</li>
            <li>This feels like a nice thin water based product that spreads so easily; it&#x27;s not thick, greasy or sticky, as many other products can be.</li>
            <li>Many other products I have tried have left my acne prone skin feeling very oily.  </li>
            <li>No intense redness follows application on my sensitive skin so it is fine to wear during the day under Toulon moisturizer and cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>The serum is light and not sticky at all like some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic compared to other vitamin C serums, and I started using this immediately for some acne scarring -</li>
            <li>I tried ordering this product again now that they seem to have adopted a new name/manufacturer...</li>
            <li>Even if it is or was, my concern is why would I not have rec&#x27;d a new bottle of the Toulon product.  </li>
            <li>its a new must have in my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>I am always in the sun (I live in FL)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not heavy at all, and really seems to be helping clear my skin up.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clean and immediately sinks into your skin.  </li>
            <li>This serum goes on smooth and clear with absolutely no odor.</li>
            <li>I have aging skin that is still acne prone and has some scarring and is very sensitive as well</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is pretty enough to leave on your dresser</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Too precious to waste!</li>
            <li>There was a definite change in my skin after only a week of using the serum, and I generally only use it at bedtime :).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my sensitive skin either!  </li>
            <li>Even on these hot, summer days in NYC, my face feels and looks younger and softer.</li>
            <li>I first bought the product because of some scarring from acne when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife, because she had been interested in trying a topical vitamin c.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 years old and still get pimples!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve forwarded the link to some of my &amp;#34;mature friends&amp;#34;: who would appreciate the Serum and would all want to stay young !  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Tonight I did my first application after  double cleansing.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a week so far and already see a difference!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft, I feel like some of my fine lines have been diminished &amp; some of my freckles &amp; dark spots have lightened.  </li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin I am always hesitant about using new products.</li>
            <li>Since I have sensitive skin, I‚Äôm always cautious about trying new items on my face.  </li>
            <li>but recently she found more dark spot on her cheek area.</li>
            <li>But since I hit the big one (I won&#x27;t say which one), for the first time, I am actually checking out how much gray I have in my hair.</li>
            <li>First thing is that I love that it is natural and organic as I am working on eliminating unnecessary chemicals from my beauty routine.  </li>
            <li>After trying several anti-aging products out there, with much unsuccessful results, a friend told me about  this new product on the market, Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a little over a month and already see HUGE skin improvements.</li>
            <li>Used only for a short time, but I already am experiencing a definite improvement in skin appearance; diminished fine wrinkles, skin discoloration.</li>
            <li>I‚Äôd rather pay a little more for a product that actually does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The finer lines around my eyes are much less noticeable and I am excited to see what happens after extended use.</li>
            <li>With other C serums I have tried I have felt my skin tightening and seen a difference with my mild Rosacea.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many things to minimize pores and help with some of the uneven tones of my skin with little success until now.</li>
            <li>There is a slight tightening &amp; tingling feeling after I apply it to my clean face, which I assume is the shrinking.</li>
            <li>I should point out that this product came sealed in clear plastic wrap).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 40 year old woman who has oily/dry skin and have been using this twice a day for 4 weeks with no change in my skin.</li>
            <li>After a month of using Toul√¥n Vitamin C serum, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin tone has been completely evened out.</li>
            <li>and so far it has my skin glowing</li>
            <li>This one is actually priced really well too.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it worked so well for me.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The lines at the corner of my eyes have smoothed considerably, there is a glow to my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having my 16yr old son use it too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46 yrs old and my skin looks like it did when I was in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The pump action is rigid, and you can&#x27;t control the amount that is forcefully squirted out.  </li>
            <li>I am 53 years old.</li>
            <li>I have had no adverse affects on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>I am 42 years old and a young man asked me if I was 30 yet?</li>
            <li>and I wasn‚Äôt sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Too early to comment on any improvements</li>
            <li>but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum for just over a week so far.</li>
            <li>My overall complexion is much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin has a much healthier look overall.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is when you push to pump the serum, it comes out with too much pressure and you lose a lot of what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It is really the only change I made.  </li>
            <li>I have never had such noticable results this fast.  </li>
            <li>The scar mark from the burn is already completely gone .  </li>
            <li>, I found it absorbed into my skin fast but did not make me feel like I had it on once it dried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 20&#x27;s, with a pale skin tone and wear sunscreens daily, so I&#x27;m using this to keep my skin in top form.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one piece construction makes for no waste and no mess.</li>
            <li>And when you press down to dispense it, it kind of shoots out at an odd angle.  </li>
            <li>It is starting to lighten my dark spots and soften fine fines.</li>
            <li>I have recently been traveling in dry climates and have found this serum to be of tremendous helpful in keeping my skin moist.</li>
            <li>Reality is though ladies there is no magic that undoes the time we have lived so enjoy your time, respect the fact that you have earned the badge of what ever age you are.  </li>
            <li>Since using it everyday for the last week, I notice my skin has a smooth and clear quality.</li>
            <li>The consistency is clear and light, so you&#x27;re not putting a heavy cream on your face that could potentially clog your  pores.</li>
            <li>With regular use, I have definitely noticed a gradual improvement in the texture, glow, dark spots, fine lines, and remnants of acne on my mature skin.  </li>
            <li>I was a little concerned because this serum isn&#x27;t super pricey</li>
            <li>There are similar products that are more expensive, but this one does the job just right.</li>
            <li>After working for a medical device manufacturer, I had the chance to try lots of new cosmetic products like serums and this one blows all others I tried out of the water.  </li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of vitamin C serum, have used a few different brands, and the Toulon serum did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and didn&#x27;t feel heavy on my sometimes oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I never expected this problem to corrected by this serum!</li>
            <li>I have tried many expensive products that promise results, but this one actually delivers AND at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I have not used anything on my face apart from general body moisturizers.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a cream ....not the least bit greasy and very,very light.</li>
            <li>I have dark sun spots have lightened and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are far less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The dark sun spots on my face have lightened and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are far less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I jump at every opportunity to try and test them as a consumer because I inherited my mothers rooster neck which barely exists anymore.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and over the last 5-10yrs have tried dozens of prescription and over-the-counter to try to improve the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>So far, the serum definitely seems to help!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how soft my skin feels after using this product - it has become an essential part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li>I barely notice it&#x27;s on anymore.</li>
            <li>My skin is finally glowing again as if I was in my early 20s.</li>
            <li>So far I have been using it daily</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much better, it&#x27;s tight and firm</li>
            <li>Now that it&#x27;s part of my daily routine, I&#x27;ve noticed that my dark sun spots have lightened and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are far less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need anything else other</li>
            <li>A very small amount (not enough to cover your face) comes out with one pump, and it soaks into your skin very quickly, so I was using 2 pumps every night.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the subtle scent it gives off when applied.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this vit C serum for a short time but have already noticed my smile lines are beginning to be less.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky about my skin care products, but after reading a little about the company and the product, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Also, when looking at a picture that was taken this past spring, I feel like some of the more pronounced lines and age spots on my face are beginning to be less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I can tell you that my face use to be dry and now  it is soft.  </li>
            <li>It also absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy or thick.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, thick or sticky..</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I first started using it because it was thinner than a serum I had used in the past, but I like how a little goes a long way and absorbs so fast.</li>
            <li>This is definitely inexpensive compared to other high end products that offer the same results</li>
            <li>This serum is gentle, but has made little difference to the appearance or feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed that it will only last me at best, a month of nightly application.</li>

            <li> I love this serum.  </li>
            <li> Ordered 6 bottles in one month, I really love it.  </li>
            <li> My esthetician  recommended I start using a vitamin c serum along with my moisturizer, so I decided to give this one a try since I was able to try it at a promotional discount.</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthier for sure.  </li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s kind of a light cucumber as opposed to a lemon you might expect) and</li>
            <li> and they are more watery?</li>
            <li> I have a background in skincare and have tried many many products over the years.</li>
            <li> I felt that the container however squirted out quite a bit more product than I prefer to use at one time</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll have that glow</li>
            <li> ... lean your head back, close your eyes, &amp;#34;pump the trigger&amp;#34;, and hope for the best.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I noticed more radiance in my face after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a fancy &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; to get spa-like results, that is for sure.  </li>
            <li> Nothing better than a product you can&#x27;t wait to use again.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d prefer I bit more consistency, it&#x27;s thinness makes me wonder if there is anything in it at all, however my skin does feel better after application, so that indicative of something.  </li>
            <li> This time the pump seems to pump much better.</li>
            <li> If I were more diligent and used the .25mm nightly before application, I imagine my results would be even more noticeable.  </li>

            <li> THOUGHT I WOULD SEE BETTER RESULTS AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS, WOULD NOT HAVE PAID FULL PRICE,</li>
            <li> Cool, refreshing feel to this serum.</li>
            <li> But I am loving the results from this vitamin C. First</li>
            <li> Thank you, Toulon, for making this product available through a special promotion!</li>
            <li> After I tried it, my face felt moist,  and, more importantly, still felt clean.</li>
            <li> The fine lines aren&#x27;t as pronounced as they once were.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in my fine lines around my mouth from using this.  </li>
            <li> I swear after just 2-3 weeks the fine lines around my eyes have diminished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my fine lines are finer</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fights signs of aging, like fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can get all the benefits of the vitamin c and HA - specifically lightening of age spots and decreasing appearance of fine lines...without putting watery or oily serum on my face.  </li>
            <li> Since I began using it I have noticed smoother skin, and reduction in fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I am seeing improvment with my complexion and fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> seeing a difference with both the age spots and the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> The product is light and easy to apply to the skin, it does not leave me feeling greasy or shiny.</li>
            <li> This serum did not irritate my skin, but within two weeks managed to diminish fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> skin looks better, it absorbs really quick</li>
            <li> Product also shipped and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but it does not go very far.  </li>
            <li> And when combined with a good regimin, it helps you stay young!</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell, very gentle</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and is not greasy and absorbed in under 2 minutes!  </li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> A nice side effect is that my skin feels much more soft and supple than it had been feeling.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the cheap price let you think this isn&#x27;t a quality product.</li>
            <li> First of all, it comes in a box suitable for gifting.</li>

            <li> I love this product and the price is very reasonable.</li>

            <li> This really impressed me because they took an extra step that&#x27;s not required by law yet at the same time cost them more money</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this as part of a promotion for my review.  </li>
            <li> After receiving a promotional coupon, I was excited to try this Vitamin C Serum product.  </li>
            <li> I see a significant difference in lines on my forehead and around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li> Love this product ;)</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try this item as a promotion.</li>
            <li> I am excited to get the pump bottle of the vitamon C serum and continue to use the product.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, I have used it for the past month</li>
            <li> I like this product line and as a first time user of the line I am pleased that is why 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this with a coupon.  </li>
            <li> I have been impressed with how it has taken away some acne scarring I have from using oily products in the past.  </li>
            <li> ‚Ä¶ I will continue to use it and am excited to see the results after 6 months.</li>
            <li> I literally wiped the mirror to get my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> I love the way this serum goes on very light, not heavy.</li>
            <li> I use 1-2 &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; to cover my face and neck at night on clean face.  </li>
            <li> My big concern is that, tonight when I was checking the container for an expiration date I held the bottle up to a bright light and noticed that the TOULON label had another label underneath...OZNY Skincare anti aging serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pharmacist, and have a lot of experience with all prescription and over-the-counter products, and out of the hundreds of products on the market today, this is the one single product that I happily recommend and encourage people to try.</li>
            <li> Perfect for when you want your skin to look dewy and fresh for a special event or even everyday.  </li>
            <li> Just this one benefit of beautifully soft skin alone would keep me using this product, but there&#x27;s so much more!</li>
            <li> Fantastic fantastic fantastic, I m 75 years old, had some sun damage and wrinkles and all is sooooo much better.</li>
            <li> The Vit C anti age serum was a great find for a few reasons: it was in a very convenient container to get the most of out the product, unlike most anti age serum</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this anti-aging serum because it is amazing compared to other high quality serum.  </li>
            <li> OKAY BECAUSE GOT  THIS ITEM FOR A LARGE REDUCTION IN PRICE</li>
            <li> But I also feel like I could certainly use it longer and see more benefits.  </li>
            <li> I have fair sensitive skin and was a little nervous, happy to report I worried for nothing.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very picky, and this product is very light weight, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I ordered another bottle for myself and one for my sister.</li>
            <li> Love it highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really have been enjoying my serum. ¬†</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wrinkles: Since I don&#x27;t have conspicuous wrinkles, I can&#x27;t really tell whether it works for wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Sun spots: I don&#x27;t have many sun spots.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t really sure it was doing much for me.</li>
            <li> Good for younger people looking for anti-aging prevention tools.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have switched over to this serum which is much lighter.  </li>
            <li> I love it, A+, and highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> Ok serum can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing much.  </li>
            <li> my fine lines that was getting more defined by the minute it seemed, well, it is nearly unnoticable!</li>
            <li> With the high cost on many beauty products this is budget friendly</li>
            <li> Serum goes on smooth and is absorbed quickly with no residual stickiness.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and feels soft and moisturizing, almost like a light face oil.</li>
            <li> My best friend mentioned Toulon Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid to me, at first I was a bit sceptical as I usually am, however, I know my friend and if she says it&#x27;s something special</li>
            <li> This drives extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> I am now a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Since I am getting older I am looking for better skin products.  </li>
            <li> It is soaked up quickly by my skin and leaves it glowing.  </li>
            <li> the witch hazel that dries quickly.</li>
            <li> There is no smell to the serum, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> and I did notice it&#x27;s clarifying effects rather quickly.</li>
            <li> The product was easy to use, clear and left a nice clean feeling on my skin / unlike many products that I have tried that were greasy and thick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am going to look to see if there is a more concentrated version if not I will more than likely re-buy.  </li>
            <li> I feel like my complexion is more vibrant and even.</li>
            <li> It came quick and I used it that night.  </li>
            <li> The cream bottle is very pretty and looks for fancy on my vanity.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the vitamin c serum it makes my face feel amazing with no sensitivity at all which i have had with other vitamin c products</li>
            <li> I received it nearly two weeks ago and have already noticed some pretty amazing results.</li>
            <li> It shipped very quickly and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, odorless, and absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is fragrance free and is very gentle on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> At 42, that is exactly what I am looking for!</li>
            <li> Love it so far!  </li>
            <li> The product leaves my skin feeling fresh and it is perfect for my under eyes especially after long nights.</li>
            <li> I have worked in many spas and am very familiar with high quality skin care products, and this is by far one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Texture of this product: Very watery and quickly and smoothly applied.</li>
            <li> Not a heavy gunk but instead quite light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Natural and/or organic is very important to me.  </li>
            <li> serum is clear, has no scent, and is very light.  </li>
            <li> There are 2 very popular and necessary in our skin care active ingredients: Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;The concentration of Vitamin C is 20% which is very high and works fast and great on my skin to reduce Hyper-pigmentation (sun damage) and</li>
            <li> I see the fine lines disappearing around my eyes and my skin is much tighter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing and definitely helps with fine lines and wrinkles, as well as age spots.  </li>
            <li> I am even more amazed that it is actually helping to reduce my fine lines ...</li>
            <li> My skin looks great besides a few spot which I think have lighted.</li>
            <li> , now I have been using it everyday morning and night for a week and its great.</li>
            <li> I really like that the serum is frangrance free.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I am definitely seeing some improvement.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin feels after I apply it.</li>
            <li> Since beginning use of this product my skin has more of a glow &amp; is so soft.  </li>
            <li> I love all natural products.  </li>
            <li> I use it both day and night and moisturize once it has absorbed.  </li>
            <li> The serum goes on so smoothly and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I recommend the product and it is well worth its money.</li>
            <li> So many do not make it as far as you have.</li>
            <li> so I feel that it is worth</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to most products.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is fast absorbing and non greasy.  </li>
            <li> I believe the airless pump bottle helps keep light out and stabilize the vit c much better than the eye dropper bottles you open up each day.  </li>
            <li> It had all the right ingredients and thus far has provided outstanding results.</li>
            <li> This company has a lot of products that are very effective and useful to our everyday uses.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results: my skin looks and feels more uniform and smooth; wrinkles seem less prominent and the overall texture looks younger.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are mostly natural, which is important if your skin is easily irritated by many commercial skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I use it right out of the shower, it burns.</li>
            <li> The hyaluronic acid acts a sponge and absorbs the moisture right to your skin.</li>
            <li> and it seems to set everything just right.  </li>
            <li> Dr oz was right, vitamin c all the way</li>
            <li> My rating right now is strictly on the consistency and the way it comes out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> an they respond right away if you have any questions.  </li>
            <li> I also like the packaging that dispenses just the right amount.</li>
            <li> right vitamin c can drop a decade from your face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to continued positive results!</li>
            <li> Please write down what really you have experienced people.</li>
            <li> The serum is light and absorbs quickly into my skin leaving the skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> My face is breaking out less and just feels so much better and looks better</li>
            <li> Also, for a Vitamin C serum to be the most effective and for proper absorption, it needs to have a vitamin ration of 10% or above, with 20% being optimal.  </li>
            <li> I have been enjoyed this serum as I feel like it is not only keeping my skin hydrated, soft, and healthy during these drier months but also helping to combat some skin challenges.  </li>
            <li> Very effective!would definitely order more of this!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see if it has made much difference with fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> Excited to see a high quality option in a pump.  </li>
            <li> This serum is very sticky but goes away quickly once it soaks into the skin.  </li>
            <li> The instructions were clear and the product was easy to use.  </li>
            <li> However, I can say that it is easy on sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  </li>
            <li> And so less wrinkles is a good thing</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing and very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Super simple fast pump, great viscosity of product, fast absorbing, no fragrance, and leaves the skin really soft.  </li>
            <li> I went to a very popular online seller of cosmetics and looked at 8 different brands of Vit C Serum ranging in price from $45 to $155, all the same size at Toulon, 1 oz.  </li>
            <li> It helps to improve healing process of acne issues also.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing light and in the same time rich</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly into the skin and has left my skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> I am a 51 year old woman who has, regrettably, not taken very good care of my skin until the past five years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had more breakouts on my chin since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> this serum twice daily as directed, a bottle of the serum lasts a bit more than a month....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty generous with the amount of serum that I use during application.</li>
            <li> This pump is really a pretty efficient dispenser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be aware that this product will not make your wrinkles go away permanently, it just diminishes them so you have to keep on using it.  </li>
            <li> But, I gave it a shot and used in at night first.</li>
            <li> of why I love this product:  A lot of Vitamin C serums have ingredients in them that can actually harm your skin like preservatives, or DMAE and retinyl palmitate.  </li>
            <li> and it make my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and that was using it only at night most of the time.</li>
            <li> This is a really fantastic serum for the 40-something year old to help take care of wrinkles and age spots.  </li>
            <li> (The Toulon label was simply glued on top of it...</li>
            <li> Not too much!  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the first one was defective.  </li>
            <li> I first tried the serum on my neck and chest area.  </li>
            <li> I really like it!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many that were too watery or had the opposite problem and seemed oily on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Your hands are one of the first places that show your age.  </li>
            <li> and it absorbed into my skin really fast.</li>
            <li> I am using my Serum for 3 days and my face is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> Using it on my face but also on my d√©collet√©, Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am pretty fussy about my skin care products.</li>
            <li> At the first sign of a skin irritation I dab some on and this vitamin C serum clears up any signs of irritation.  </li>
            <li> Love the serum especially around the eyes</li>
            <li> but I have noticed my skin is a lot smoother exactly where I have been applying it</li>
            <li> and I thought it worked pretty well</li>
            <li> The first application I overused.</li>
            <li> That is a real plus!</li>
            <li> It is very watery!</li>
            <li> I love the vit c with hyaluronic serum and will continue to use it daily.  </li>
            <li> Follow the directions and apply a good moisturizer with sunblock after it has dried.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s got a round top with an easy push-down mechanism as opposed to just a spout.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and sheer and absorbs quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a VERY watery product that will slide right through your fingers if you pump it into your hand to apply it.  </li>
            <li> I refuse to use products with harsh chemicals on my skin, but am more than happy to use products with natural and organic ingredients, such as this Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li> pretty positive this serum is to thank.</li>
            <li> Well, one small thing, the pump is great but be careful to make sure it is pointed at your hand.  </li>
            <li> Well, one small thing, the pump is great but be careful to make sure it is pointed at your hand.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear and clean.</li>
            <li> I am constantly searching for a good facial moisturizer</li>
            <li> And if OZNY is an offshoot of Toulon how long was that because my original container indicated this was originally an OZNY product.</li>
            <li> I only recently heard how helpful using a good serum under a moisturizer can be for your skin.</li>
            <li> It feels like silk and applies very easily, providing my otherwise dry skin with much needed weightless moisture.</li>
            <li> This stuff sinks right in and your skin feels like magic.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product and even bought the other TOULON products because of the high quality of the serum.  </li>
            <li> I first heard of this serum from a friend in Florida who really watches her skin for signs of aging/ sun damage.</li>
            <li> This one had not only a great reviews but also had all three ingredients including other ingredients which are beneficial.  </li>
            <li> The skin absorbs it quickly and leaves it feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product goes on easy and feels as if your face comes back to life.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It seem more dry after 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I feel this products absorption into my skin, topically it feels smooth also, and there are no uncomfortable after affects.</li>
            <li> I love that this serum leaves me feeling fresh and light, rather than greasy like other similar products have.</li>
            <li> I would certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li> I do have large pores and didn&#x27;t feel like this blocked them.  </li>
            <li> It is different because it is very light weight and sheer and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to report that the serum is actually helping make these less visible.</li>
            <li> Very generous amount for the price, especially for a serum that has such high quality ingredients and more importantly, works.  </li>
            <li> In a short period, a week or two, I can already see a difference with the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  </li>
            <li> but I have wanted to start with a high quality vitamin C because I am aware of the benefits to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I believe that your body makes collagen to keep skin tight, so using the right ingredients on your skin can stimulate your body to make its own collagen and provide a more firm youthful look.</li>
            <li> Amazingly noticeable difference in just a few days.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a change.  </li>
            <li> My wife wants to get rid of the sun spot and the pigmentation but nothing has been changed.</li>
            <li> Very diasppointed.</li>
            <li> I had expected more of an oil.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t produce as much oil.</li>
            <li> A lot of Vitamin C Serums are very sticky when applied to the face and by this, I know that they are working and have quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It seems to leave my face soft and smooth and my skin seems to feel more tighter and firm.</li>
            <li> I really do like the added moisture it provides.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product!</li>
            <li> This product is indeed very helpful in promoting skin tightening.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> The serum comes out of the dispenser to fast</li>
            <li> I have tried and spent money on so many things that didn&#x27;t work , so I am overjoyed.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> , my sensitive/acne prone skin really likes it.</li>
            <li> My skin really is noticeably smoother and tighter since I have been using this product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really understand how some reviews said they got no results at all.  </li>
            <li> You have to be so careful, way too many products out there that have harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li> has REALLY sold me on the Toulon brand of vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> There really is nothing to NOT like about this product</li>
            <li> It comes out fast</li>
            <li> There really is nothing to NOT like about this product</li>
            <li> It comes out fast</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really massage it in as much as it says to.</li>
            <li> but I can say that it is very hydrating and smells</li>
            <li> You really feel it</li>
            <li> and you really see the results too.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really do get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this serum -</li>
            <li> My face looks brighter and is so much smoother.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It has really helped with pigmentation issues and keeping my skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone looking to try a serum!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It sits so gently on my skin</li>
            <li> My tip is that you don&#x27;t need much to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> I really like the TOULON vitamin C serum because it comes in a pump bottle.  </li>
            <li> Using it every morning and night has made my face and neck feel much smoother.  </li>
            <li> and I really have to take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes and makes skin feel much softer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> ;  I feel like I really like this product</li>
            <li> Gentle and calming.  </li>
            <li> I really like this vitamin c</li>
            <li> I have tried this product two times a day for one month and it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Smell:</li>
            <li> Literally no smell or very slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> You do not need that much to feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my girlfriend, and she is absolutely hooked.</li>
            <li> We will be re ordering is very soon</li>
            <li> My complexion is beaming and much brighter than it was a couple of weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a generous size for the price and the packaging is sleek and modern.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I have tried almost every popular brand out there and abandoned them after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> and after a few minutes kind of gives you a tightening of the skin.</li>
            <li> An obvious solution would be to pump it directly onto your face and then quickly smooth it around (before it drips right off).  </li>
            <li> I was scared to use at first because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to purchase the Eye Renewal Serum next to see how it helps with my crows feet.  </li>
            <li> The serum itself is really well packaged - the bottle looks like that of a pricey high end brand.</li>
            <li> Within the first day or two, my skin felt so unbelievably soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of a serum expert at this point and usually they tingle.</li>
            <li> i.e. it seemed like the bottle was only about 1/2 full.  </li>
            <li> My skin overall is looking much healthier and does actually have more of a glow to it.</li>
            <li> I had been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Brightening Dark Spot Corrector because it has safe ingredients</li>
            <li> The product soaks in well and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue like many other products!</li>
            <li> and i now have the confidence to meet new people!</li>
            <li> have very sensative skin and tend to break out often when putting something new on my face.  </li>
            <li> It feels light under the other products I use, a positive asset for any skincare routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find I&#x27;m needing less foundation because my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li> So, after just a couple of weeks I am seeing my undereye area become less darkened, more hydrated and</li>
            <li> Finally, I need to add that most serums have the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> Makes,my face feel smooth and soft when applied, though it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any real lasting effect (after about a month of use).  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get this with a promotional code.</li>
            <li> I have not seen this or felt this with this particular serum.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly into my skin instantly giving my skin a silky feeling.  </li>
            <li> This product works better than ALL the expensive  creams, serums and potions, combined, I have bought over many years.</li>
            <li> my research, I knew I needed to add/incorporate 3 main ingredients into my regime: 20% vitamin C, MSM (sulfur), and hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> and I know the main ingredient, aloe, takes well to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, I think that I would buy this again, but I would debate about it if I had to pay the retail price because there are so many competitors that offer a seemingly similar product for around $20.;</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get this with a coupon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing my skin very soft!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Oz Natural!</li>
            <li> I would suggest using a high SPF as Vit C Serum can make sunburn easier.</li>
            <li> Before even opening, you feel the high quality, spa-like feeling.  </li>
            <li> The ingredient list on the Toulon serum meets my high standards for putting on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Will highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I could tell when I opened it and felt it that it is high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> Toul√¥n Vitamin C Serum is like a little miracle in a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;The application of the serum is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I also see a little more vibrancy in my skin since using it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference with fine lines and wrinkles but have noticed my skin definitely feels softer and have only been using for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Toulon offers the highly touted combination of recommended ingredients for one&#x27;s skin care at a very competitive price.  </li>
            <li> What i like about this product, after i used at night, in a morning i feel like a different person, I look fresh and prettier, what I like the most i can put just a little on my finger, I can put it on my all face, this one is a keeper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to toss my old moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin, I am really picky about the products I use.</li>
            <li> I am seeing a real difference in less noticable fine lines and</li>
            <li> &quot; look but a much improved natural look.</li>
            <li> I often have some blemishes and using the serum has helped clear them up much quicker than they would heal without help from the vit c.  </li>
            <li> I feel like some manufacturers make there pumps waste more than needed</li>
            <li> My laugh lines will always be there, but I&#x27;ve noticed the smaller lines have begun to fade.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I like wrinkles</li>
            <li> Love the feel of it on my skin and just after a few days of using there is a softness to my cheeks.</li>
            <li> This feels like a nice thin water based product that spreads so easily; it&#x27;s not thick, greasy or sticky, as many other products can be.</li>
            <li> Many other products I have tried have left my acne prone skin feeling very oily.  </li>
            <li> No intense redness follows application on my sensitive skin so it is fine to wear during the day under Toulon moisturizer and cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> The serum is light and not sticky at all like some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> The price is fantastic compared to other vitamin C serums, and I started using this immediately for some acne scarring -</li>
            <li> I tried ordering this product again now that they seem to have adopted a new name/manufacturer...</li>
            <li> Even if it is or was, my concern is why would I not have rec&#x27;d a new bottle of the Toulon product.  </li>
            <li> its a new must have in my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I am always in the sun (I live in FL)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not heavy at all, and really seems to be helping clear my skin up.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clean and immediately sinks into your skin.  </li>
            <li> This serum goes on smooth and clear with absolutely no odor.</li>
            <li> I have aging skin that is still acne prone and has some scarring and is very sensitive as well</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is pretty enough to leave on your dresser</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Too precious to waste!</li>
            <li> There was a definite change in my skin after only a week of using the serum, and I generally only use it at bedtime :).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my sensitive skin either!  </li>
            <li> Even on these hot, summer days in NYC, my face feels and looks younger and softer.</li>
            <li> I first bought the product because of some scarring from acne when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, because she had been interested in trying a topical vitamin c.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 years old and still get pimples!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve forwarded the link to some of my &amp;#34;mature friends&amp;#34;: who would appreciate the Serum and would all want to stay young !  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tonight I did my first application after  double cleansing.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a week so far and already see a difference!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft, I feel like some of my fine lines have been diminished &amp; some of my freckles &amp; dark spots have lightened.  </li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin I am always hesitant about using new products.</li>
            <li> Since I have sensitive skin, I‚Äôm always cautious about trying new items on my face.  </li>
            <li> but recently she found more dark spot on her cheek area.</li>
            <li> But since I hit the big one (I won&#x27;t say which one), for the first time, I am actually checking out how much gray I have in my hair.</li>
            <li> First thing is that I love that it is natural and organic as I am working on eliminating unnecessary chemicals from my beauty routine.  </li>
            <li> After trying several anti-aging products out there, with much unsuccessful results, a friend told me about  this new product on the market, Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little over a month and already see HUGE skin improvements.</li>
            <li> Used only for a short time, but I already am experiencing a definite improvement in skin appearance; diminished fine wrinkles, skin discoloration.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôd rather pay a little more for a product that actually does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The finer lines around my eyes are much less noticeable and I am excited to see what happens after extended use.</li>
            <li> With other C serums I have tried I have felt my skin tightening and seen a difference with my mild Rosacea.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many things to minimize pores and help with some of the uneven tones of my skin with little success until now.</li>
            <li> There is a slight tightening &amp; tingling feeling after I apply it to my clean face, which I assume is the shrinking.</li>
            <li> I should point out that this product came sealed in clear plastic wrap).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old woman who has oily/dry skin and have been using this twice a day for 4 weeks with no change in my skin.</li>
            <li> After a month of using Toul√¥n Vitamin C serum, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin tone has been completely evened out.</li>
            <li> and so far it has my skin glowing</li>
            <li> This one is actually priced really well too.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it worked so well for me.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The lines at the corner of my eyes have smoothed considerably, there is a glow to my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having my 16yr old son use it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 yrs old and my skin looks like it did when I was in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The pump action is rigid, and you can&#x27;t control the amount that is forcefully squirted out.  </li>
            <li> I am 53 years old.</li>
            <li> I have had no adverse affects on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and a young man asked me if I was 30 yet?</li>
            <li> and I wasn‚Äôt sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Too early to comment on any improvements</li>
            <li> but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for just over a week so far.</li>
            <li> My overall complexion is much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin has a much healthier look overall.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is when you push to pump the serum, it comes out with too much pressure and you lose a lot of what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It is really the only change I made.  </li>
            <li> I have never had such noticable results this fast.  </li>
            <li> The scar mark from the burn is already completely gone .  </li>
            <li> , I found it absorbed into my skin fast but did not make me feel like I had it on once it dried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 20&#x27;s, with a pale skin tone and wear sunscreens daily, so I&#x27;m using this to keep my skin in top form.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one piece construction makes for no waste and no mess.</li>
            <li> And when you press down to dispense it, it kind of shoots out at an odd angle.  </li>
            <li> It is starting to lighten my dark spots and soften fine fines.</li>
            <li> I have recently been traveling in dry climates and have found this serum to be of tremendous helpful in keeping my skin moist.</li>
            <li> Reality is though ladies there is no magic that undoes the time we have lived so enjoy your time, respect the fact that you have earned the badge of what ever age you are.  </li>
            <li> Since using it everyday for the last week, I notice my skin has a smooth and clear quality.</li>
            <li> The consistency is clear and light, so you&#x27;re not putting a heavy cream on your face that could potentially clog your  pores.</li>
            <li> With regular use, I have definitely noticed a gradual improvement in the texture, glow, dark spots, fine lines, and remnants of acne on my mature skin.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned because this serum isn&#x27;t super pricey</li>
            <li> There are similar products that are more expensive, but this one does the job just right.</li>
            <li> After working for a medical device manufacturer, I had the chance to try lots of new cosmetic products like serums and this one blows all others I tried out of the water.  </li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of vitamin C serum, have used a few different brands, and the Toulon serum did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and didn&#x27;t feel heavy on my sometimes oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I never expected this problem to corrected by this serum!</li>
            <li> I have tried many expensive products that promise results, but this one actually delivers AND at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I have not used anything on my face apart from general body moisturizers.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a cream ....not the least bit greasy and very,very light.</li>
            <li> I have dark sun spots have lightened and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are far less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The dark sun spots on my face have lightened and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are far less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I jump at every opportunity to try and test them as a consumer because I inherited my mothers rooster neck which barely exists anymore.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and over the last 5-10yrs have tried dozens of prescription and over-the-counter to try to improve the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> So far, the serum definitely seems to help!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how soft my skin feels after using this product - it has become an essential part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I barely notice it&#x27;s on anymore.</li>
            <li> My skin is finally glowing again as if I was in my early 20s.</li>
            <li> So far I have been using it daily</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much better, it&#x27;s tight and firm</li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s part of my daily routine, I&#x27;ve noticed that my dark sun spots have lightened and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are far less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need anything else other</li>
            <li> A very small amount (not enough to cover your face) comes out with one pump, and it soaks into your skin very quickly, so I was using 2 pumps every night.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the subtle scent it gives off when applied.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this vit C serum for a short time but have already noticed my smile lines are beginning to be less.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about my skin care products, but after reading a little about the company and the product, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Also, when looking at a picture that was taken this past spring, I feel like some of the more pronounced lines and age spots on my face are beginning to be less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I can tell you that my face use to be dry and now  it is soft.  </li>
            <li> It also absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy or thick.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, thick or sticky..</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I first started using it because it was thinner than a serum I had used in the past, but I like how a little goes a long way and absorbs so fast.</li>
            <li> This is definitely inexpensive compared to other high end products that offer the same results</li>
            <li> This serum is gentle, but has made little difference to the appearance or feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that it will only last me at best, a month of nightly application.</li>
            <li> my skin is so sensitive and usually I have that problem when I try new products.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to get a call from one of the founders of the company, who explained that the re-labeling was due to copyright concerns and the product was produced this year.  </li>
            <li> I have used vitamin C in the past and much prefer this product.  </li>
            <li> and oh so functional which is why their products last so long.</li>
            <li> It does NOT feel like the same product, and it also lasted about 1/2 as long...</li>
            <li> Look forward to continuing the use and long lasting benefits!!!</li>
            <li> Initially I wasn&#x27;t so sure if I cared for the pump bottle dispenser, as I thought this may waste the product unnecessarily.</li>
            <li> and I am always a little nervous when trying something new.</li>
            <li> No greasy or waiting for it to dry before going to the next step of face care.  </li>
            <li> Instantly my skin felt smoother and not as dry.</li>
            <li> My second bottle has lasted about 6wks, and when I opened a bottle that was empty, there was not a drop left inside.</li>
            <li> I applied a small amount over my entire face and neck both in the morning and at night, after cleansing and before applying my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li> BUT, the pump offers little control over direction/aim, nor speed/force of projection</li>
            <li> I have spent countless amounts of dollars on creams and serums that promise to erase lines/wrinkles or take away my sun damage.</li>
            <li> These are minor details to me.  </li>
            <li> I am careful about what I put on my skin because so many  vit c serums are harsh and irritating.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, this product is natural and does not have any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I havent been using the serum too long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a long tall glass of enriching liquid for my face....</li>
            <li> and what I like the most about it, it that it tightens and smooths my skin without being overly tight and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Personally I feel like their giving it away possibly due to the competitive nature of serums on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Previously when using other serums at night, my eyes would become irritated even when the serum was not applied near them.</li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t dry out using this serum.</li>
            <li> I also applied it to the dry skin on my elbows.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything except dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It never makes my skin feel greasy or dry.  </li>
            <li> about a week and do find that I need moisturizer as it seems to leave my skin feeling dry,</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be on the dry side.</li>
            <li> -store moisturizers for years, but noticed  my skin was getting duller and was still dry.  </li>
            <li> Then the foundation makes the skin dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days and have noticed my acne scars are already starting to lighten.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed a difference in my skin; especially the dulling of my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like other products.  </li>
            <li> (well, I notice them, along with my 4 year old daughter who informed me I had zig zag lines on my forehead, but everyone else claims not to see them when I point them out) and one small age spot on my cheek that bothers me, both of which remain unchanged.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a vitamin c cream that would hydrate and possibly help with dark spots that I like to call freckles but</li>
            <li> have not used it enough to see improvement on the dark spots</li>
            <li> I have some small moles which are old</li>
            <li> This means it is a very lightweight, thin liquid that only requires a minimal amount.</li>
            <li> it was loose</li>
            <li> Also noticed less acne after using twice daily.</li>
            <li> You only need less that half a pump to cover the entire eye area, it covers both eyes.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I am left curious as to what a bottle of just hyaluronic or just vitamin C would do, but I may be too lazy or frugal to buy several bottles</li>
            <li> Tried again a few weeks later and broke out again.</li>
            <li> When dispensing into your hand you have to be careful or it can partly squirt out of your palm.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the serum at night for a few days, so I cannot say definitively how it has changed my skin.  </li>
            <li> and then I would wet my hands so that I could spread it all over my face.</li>
            <li> I am 35 and have  only have a few noticeable wrinkles on my forehead</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost empty</li>
            <li> and I have had absolutely no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with what I use on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am already seeing visible results after only a few days of use.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a few weeks, but after I apply it to my face and neck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the serum for a few weeks and am hopeful that my complexion will continue to improve.</li>
            <li> that is has minimal ingredients which are beneficial and results oriented.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly not allergic to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of small fibrous blemishes on my face for the last few years, and actually had an appointment with my dermatologist to actually cut these out, but decided that was a pretty extreme measure to rid myself of these blemishes, so I cancelled that appointment &amp; have been unhappily living with this problem.</li>
            <li> I am 53 years old and have seen my skin change these past few years.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It also has Aloe and Jojoba among other organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely not the case!</li>
            <li> My family actually gathers round for the comidy!  </li>
            <li> Maybe that is due to the addition  jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical if vitamin c serum would really work to fight aging but after only a few days I can see a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Other then my face wash</li>
            <li> I have only had a small pump sample not the actaul size pump.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have not tried any other vitamin C serums to compare it with.  </li>
            <li> I just threw out the other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I apply a thin coat on my face after cleansing, and, occasionally, when my face felt a little too tight, I just apply a tiny dab of my regular moisturizer over it.  </li>
            <li> Also, and I find this hard to believe, it actually does remove my wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I do still have some dark spots even after some use</li>
            <li> /&gt;Helps plump up wrinkles with Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Helps even out skin tone, blotchiness, sun spots, dark spots, and hyper-pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Did not get rid of my dark pigmentation.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much softer and smoother and the lines that I have between my brows have decreased a lot!  </li>
            <li> I decided to try it, and after three weeks of using it i noticed the dark spots around my eyes gradually disappearing and the wrinkles reduced.</li>
            <li> puffiness, dark circles and crows feet are all improving.</li>
            <li> apply this product after the brightener and before my glycolic acid souffl√© (as often as possible throughout the day-- at least morning and night).  </li>
            <li> It clears my skin so well, and I can now say goodbye to acne scars and dark marks.  </li>
            <li> seeing diminishing sun spots and its improving my under eye dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of using this serum, one of these fibrous blemishes was gone, and the other almost undetectable!</li>
            <li> My puffy, dark under-eye circles have become much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to dry, combination and oily skin!!!!</li>
            <li> All darker areas of skin from previous sun exposure/damage is gone.</li>
            <li> Is that typical?</li>
            <li> AFTER I ordered this lasted less than a month</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for less then a week and</li>
            <li> You need to have a little patience because it&#x27;s not a quick fix</li>
            <li> and it does take a little bit of time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month</li>
            <li> I decided that I could use a little anti aging too.  </li>
            <li> As a guy, I am not usually so excited about skin care products.</li>
            <li> My biggest issue has always been that any skin care program leaves an &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling, so that no matter how little I put on, I just want to wash it off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any tingling or irritation, just a little tightness.</li>
            <li> I wind up having to wash my hands with all the waste when I&#x27;m finished using it.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Some serums tend to be heavy and oily,  but not this one.  </li>
            <li> It tends to splash off or around finger tips, so plenty of the product is wasted.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and normally am unable to use products of this type.</li>
            <li> feel heavy or greasy&lt;</li>
            <li> br /&gt;Leaves your skin firm, and matte</li>
            <li> After a few days, I noticed my skin became firmer and tighter</li>
            <li> It makes my skin firm and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> In the mornings I follow the serum after a few minutes with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes of drying, I applied HABA VC-Lotion and organic rosehip oil over the serum (on face, neck, d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;, hands).</li>
            <li> Just a few weeks</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of this other brand of serum on my fingers and rubbed it around, and it was thick, sticky, and a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it ran out so quickly</li>
            <li> Other serums I&#x27;ve used are thick and cause break outs</li>
            <li> I had bought some other brand which felt thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> There is no strong smell</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve tried a lot that were even less expensive and either they irritated my skin or just simply didn‚Äôt work.</li>
            <li> It is less expensive when compared to similar products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like water and comes out with such force that it wastes some because you&#x27;re unable to catch it so to speak.</li>
            <li> The darkness has faded and I have very little puffiness.  </li>
            <li> It just seems shady.</li>
            <li> So I tried the serum and have continued to use it for the past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Over the past couple of years, I have noticed some wrinkles showing on my face.  </li>
            <li> It has over the past months brought a glow to my skin that was never there before.  </li>
            <li> I ho-hummed about which products to buy and as usual I do my product research on ewg.org and Amazon to read reviews.  </li>
            <li> Been using this past week an my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li> but before period I usually get skin troubles</li>
            <li> so I find very few products that don&#x27;t cause issues for me.  </li>
            <li> I have found others that were irritating to my skin with an intense stinging sensation and others that have had an artificial citrus smell to them.  </li>
            <li> The writing on the packaging was a bit small and hard to read.</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin and find that moisturizers often don&#x27;t have enough of a base to help with the dryness.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to tell.  </li>
            <li> I do wish it was a little thicker, it is a little runny and difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> I like this serum alot, but it is a little too thin for my liking.  </li>
            <li> However, by biggest complaint is the delivery system.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it feels but didn&#x27;t see any results (not nearly as much as my garnier serum/moisturizer) and my skin breaks out from these products sadly</li>
            <li> lately</li>
            <li> and I did some research to find out how I could get rid of the at least the melasma once and for all</li>
            <li> 9 times out of 10 it usually is!  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> I have used vitamin c serum in the past that stings and this one does not!</li>
            <li> We all know the unbelievable markup of beauty products but Toulon doesn&#x27;t seem to be playing that game.</li>
            <li> I switched Vitamin C serums because this one was less expensive than what I was using.  </li>
            <li> All in all, not a good product.</li>
            <li> and I have squirted product the wrong way a few times.  </li>
            <li> and I have squirted product the wrong way a few times.  </li>
            <li> I learned that vitamin c serum is not good to expose to air for its shelf life or potency, so I have not wanted to buy it in a drop bottle.  </li>
            <li> It has a very thin consistency, which I like since with serums you are usually layering.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is not effective at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to cause any skin irritation or use a product that has poor ingredients.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so even and clear, those awful fibrous blemishes are gone (without surgery), and some lines &amp; wrinkles from aging that were beginning to appear are no longer noticeable.</li>
            <li> I feel like a lot of these products have &#x27;fake&#x27; reviewers.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical about vit c serum.</li>
            <li> Seriously!!.</li>
            <li> Though I was very frustrated with the forced pump, the product seems to work well, so ordered another.  </li>
            <li> Until now, this experience has been a very unhappy and expensive ordeal.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of weeks I noticed a brightness to my skin and a reduction to those ugly age/sun spots that I have been hiding with make-up.</li>
            <li> Perhaps mine is defective, but it shoots out violently at 90mph at an awkward angle...</li>
            <li> It does for my skin what vitamin C does for a cold: knocks wrinkles out of the park!</li>
            <li> Dispensing is annoying.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing!!</li>
            <li> But the dispenser is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am 53 years old and have seen my skin change these past few years.  My best friend mentioned Toulon Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid to me, at first I was a bit sceptical as I usually am, however, I know my friend and if she says it&#x27;s something special 9 times out of 10 it usually is!  I have been using Toulon products for  about a month now and I can honestly say I am definitely seeing some improvement. You need to have a little patience because it&#x27;s not a quick fix and it does take a little bit of time.  You didn&#x27;t cause your skin issues overnight so don&#x27;t expect a miracle overnight either.  I can tell you that my face use to be dry and now  it is soft.  The fine lines aren&#x27;t as pronounced as they once were.  I am very happy with the results!  I will continue to use the products from now on because I know my skin will only get/look better!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the cheap price let you think this isn&#x27;t a quality product. Personally I feel like their giving it away possibly due to the competitive nature of serums on Amazon. We all know the unbelievable markup of beauty products but Toulon doesn&#x27;t seem to be playing that game. I&#x27;m equally impressed with their moisturizer which I&#x27;ve been using for months and seems to have a bottomless bottle. I have to believe that it has to run out soon but it still keeps pumping it out. I&#x27;ve  been using vitamin C serum since October of 2014. Twice a day and several different brands because I&#x27;m a product tester. I jump at every opportunity to try and test them as a consumer because I inherited my mothers rooster neck which barely exists anymore. I deeply appreciate the discount I was provided to test this one because I feel like it provides qualities that others don&#x27;t. First of all, it comes in a box suitable for gifting. Most of the others don&#x27;t. Not one that I have tested came sealed in plastic once you open the box. This really impressed me because they took an extra step that&#x27;s not required by law yet at the same time cost them more money and yet they offer their product at this fair price that nearly anyone can afford. The pump is great! It&#x27;s one piece construction makes for no waste and no mess. Some come with droppers in a basic brown jar which ensure a whole lot of waste. I wind up having to wash my hands with all the waste when I&#x27;m finished using it. This is pretty enough to leave on your dresser and oh so functional which is why their products last so long. Finally, I need to add that most serums have the same ingredients. Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid and that&#x27;s it. These are much more drying and require a lot of moisturizer after applying the serum. This has it all. It also has Aloe and Jojoba among other organic ingredients. Please do follow with their moisturizer but you won&#x27;t dry out using this serum. I&#x27;m highly impressed and would buy this at full price. After all, we can all afford it.e can all afford it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for three weeks and I have noticed a difference in my skin; especially the dulling of my dark spots.  I&#x27;m excited to purchase the Eye Renewal Serum next to see how it helps with my crows feet.  More to follow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a change.  Will keep you posted if/when I do see that &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; change. Fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again was like water, no benifits what&#x27;s ever.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is not effective at all. My wife wants to get rid of the sun spot and the pigmentation but nothing has been changed. She used this over a month but recently she found more dark spot on her cheek area. I don&#x27;t know how you (5 star reviewers) have that remarkable bright skin not work for her. Very diasppointed. Please write down what really you have experienced people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old woman who has oily/dry skin and have been using this twice a day for 4 weeks with no change in my skin. I&#x27;ve actually had more breakouts on my chin since I&#x27;ve been using it. I feel like a lot of these products have &#x27;fake&#x27; reviewers. They all say how great it is and that it&#x27;s the miracle formula- I just don&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product but I&#x27;m not crazy about it. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. I had expected more of an oil. This drives extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month and although I still have acne (this product is not to blame), I&#x27;ve noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t produce as much oil. I like it.</li>
            <li> Dispensing is annoying.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in skin tone or elasticity.  All in all, not a good product.</li>
            <li> THOUGHT I WOULD SEE BETTER RESULTS AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS, WOULD NOT HAVE PAID FULL PRICE, OKAY BECAUSE GOT  THIS ITEM FOR A LARGE REDUCTION IN PRICE</li>
            <li> MY SKIN KIND OF DID&#x27;T LIKE THE SERUM.. THREE STARS BECAUSE OF THEIR AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE</li>
            <li> A lot of Vitamin C Serums are very sticky when applied to the face and by this, I know that they are working and have quality ingredients.  This serum is very sticky but goes away quickly once it soaks into the skin.  I have noticed a difference in my fine lines around my mouth from using this.  I enjoy the subtle scent it gives off when applied.  I received this as part of a promotion and I am happy to say that this serum works the way it should.  This company has a lot of products that are very effective and useful to our everyday uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found this wonderful product! I have extremely sensitive skin, and over the last 5-10yrs have tried dozens of prescription and over-the-counter to try to improve the appearance of my skin. Until now, this experience has been a very unhappy and expensive ordeal. Toul√¥n Vitamin C Serum is like a little miracle in a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;The application of the serum is fantastic! This feels like a nice thin water based product that spreads so easily; it&#x27;s not thick, greasy or sticky, as many other products can be. I recently received a promotional deal on another brand of Vitamin C &amp; Hyaluronic Acid serum, and promptly gave the product away. I put a few drops of this other brand of serum on my fingers and rubbed it around, and it was thick, sticky, and a bit greasy. There was no way I would consider using this after being spoiled by my wonderful Toul√¥n serum!&lt;br /&gt;With the Toul√¥n serum I experienced so many amazing changes in my skin in the first couple of weeks. Within the first day or two, my skin felt so unbelievably soft and silky. Just this one benefit of beautifully soft skin alone would keep me using this product, but there&#x27;s so much more! I&#x27;ve had a couple of small fibrous blemishes on my face for the last few years, and actually had an appointment with my dermatologist to actually cut these out, but decided that was a pretty extreme measure to rid myself of these blemishes, so I cancelled that appointment &amp; have been unhappily living with this problem. Within 2 weeks of using this serum, one of these fibrous blemishes was gone, and the other almost undetectable! I never expected this problem to corrected by this serum! Wow! After a month of using Toul√¥n Vitamin C serum, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin tone has been completely evened out. All darker areas of skin from previous sun exposure/damage is gone. I&#x27;ve now been faithfully using the Toul√¥n serum for just over 2 months. My skin looks so even and clear, those awful fibrous blemishes are gone (without surgery), and some lines &amp; wrinkles from aging that were beginning to appear are no longer noticeable. My skin feels so wonderful, and the only makeup that I wear is maybe a light dusting of power.&lt;br /&gt;Using this serum twice daily as directed, a bottle of the serum lasts a bit more than a month....and I&#x27;m pretty generous with the amount of serum that I use during application. Initially I wasn&#x27;t so sure if I cared for the pump bottle dispenser, as I thought this may waste the product unnecessarily. This is absolutely not the case! My second bottle has lasted about 6wks, and when I opened a bottle that was empty, there was not a drop left inside. This pump is really a pretty efficient dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy with the results I&#x27;ve experienced, and have recommended (and even shared) this product to nearly everyone I know. Everyone I know who has tried Toul√¥n Vitamin C serum is just as thrilled with with the product and results as I am. I will continue to recommend this product and share my great results with everyone that I can. I&#x27;m a pharmacist, and have a lot of experience with all prescription and over-the-counter products, and out of the hundreds of products on the market today, this is the one single product that I happily recommend and encourage people to try. Thank you Toul√¥n!!</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  It&#x27;s refreshing and definitely helps with fine lines and wrinkles, as well as age spots.  The company is fantastic with customer service, too.  Ordered 6 bottles in one month, I really love it.  Going to try their moisturizer next.  Keep up the great work.</li>
            <li> I just started using the serum and so far it has my skin glowing I&#x27;m certainly not allergic to it my skin is so sensitive and usually I have that problem when I try new products. It seems to leave my face soft and smooth and my skin seems to feel more tighter and firm. I&#x27;m really happy with the results so far. Great product.!!!</li>
            <li> I have aging skin that is still acne prone and has some scarring and is very sensitive as well so I find very few products that don&#x27;t cause issues for me.  I have been using this for a couple weeks and it&#x27;s been wonderful, it&#x27;s not heavy at all, and really seems to be helping clear my skin up.  Additionally the customer service with this company has been wonderful.  I am now a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Saw no changes in skin. Felt like nothing but water.</li>
            <li> I swear after just 2-3 weeks the fine lines around my eyes have diminished.</li>
            <li> My esthetician  recommended I start using a vitamin c serum along with my moisturizer, so I decided to give this one a try since I was able to try it at a promotional discount. I really do like the added moisture it provides. It has a very thin consistency, which I like since with serums you are usually layering. This one is actually priced really well too. It is  a pump type bottle, and you only need one pump for your entire face, so it should last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I love the vitamin C serum!! I have very sensitive skin so I was hesitant to try, but I am so glad I got a promotion because this product is amazing! I love how soft my skin feels after I apply it. The product soaks in well and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue like many other products! It shipped very quickly and was packaged very well. The bottle is easy to dispense, and would be very easy to travel with. I have only used it for about a week but have noticed a difference in my skin, I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few weeks. I highly recommend the product!</li>
            <li> This product is indeed very helpful in promoting skin tightening.  I wear it under makeup.  I was surprised that it worked so well for me.  Great company to do business with and good customer service. Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> Since I am getting older I am looking for better skin products.  I was excited to receive this as part of a promotion for my review.  I have some specific sun spots I was hoping to tackle.  First thing is that I love that it is natural and organic as I am working on eliminating unnecessary chemicals from my beauty routine.  The packaging is very attractive and the dispenser is very easy to use and gives you a perfect amount so no wasting product.  So far so good.  It goes on clean and immediately sinks into your skin.  No greasy or waiting for it to dry before going to the next step of face care.  My skin looks healthier for sure.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it is a drastic difference but it is helping the sun spots, wrinkles and circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Sometimes when I use it right out of the shower, it burns. Is that typical?</li>
            <li> This is a good serum! There is no strong smell (it&#x27;s kind of a light cucumber as opposed to a lemon you might expect) and it&#x27;s substantial. You know how you get some serums and they are more watery? Not this one. It&#x27;s not quite a gel, but truly has a good consistency. Also, it does not burn. I&#x27;m kind of a serum expert at this point and usually they tingle. I will say if you get it too close to your eyes it won&#x27;t feel great, but I&#x27;m sure you already know that. I also like container - it&#x27;s got a round top with an easy push-down mechanism as opposed to just a spout. I got this during a promotion period, but I&#x27;ll be buying again. NOTE - You still need to use moisturizer with this. It goes on after washing, but before lotion.</li>
            <li> It made my skin break out, stopped using it and went away. Tried again a few weeks later and broke out again. I also didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> I like the product and it works with my sensitive skin which is amazing! I do still have some dark spots even after some use but I am not expecting it do Cosmetic Laser Surgery. My skin looks great besides a few spot which I think have lighted. I would suggest using a high SPF as Vit C Serum can make sunburn easier.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  I have fair sensitive skin and was a little nervous, happy to report I worried for nothing.  I love how smooth my face is after applying this.  I&#x27;ve noticed my fine lines are finer then they were when I started.  I would certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as part of a promotion to review. I have a background in skincare and have tried many many products over the years. What I liked about this serum is that it&#x27;s lightweight to the touch and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on the skin so I can put it on under my makeup and go. I felt that the container however squirted out quite a bit more product than I prefer to use at one time but I used the excess on my neck and the back of my hands. Over the last week I have seen my skin tone and texture improve to the point that I know it&#x27;s working and i&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll have that glow look that i&#x27;m looking for in the next month.  For the price this is a steal!</li>
            <li> So far, the serum definitely seems to help!</li>
            <li> Makes,my face feel smooth and soft when applied, though it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any real lasting effect (after about a month of use).  However, by biggest complaint is the delivery system.  This is a VERY watery product that will slide right through your fingers if you pump it into your hand to apply it.  An obvious solution would be to pump it directly onto your face and then quickly smooth it around (before it drips right off).  BUT, the pump offers little control over direction/aim, nor speed/force of projection (the stream is forceful enough to hit a wall 2 feet away).  Thus hilarity ensues as you try to apply this product... lean your head back, close your eyes, &amp;#34;pump the trigger&amp;#34;, and hope for the best.  My family actually gathers round for the comidy!  UPDATE:  I tried ordering this product again now that they seem to have adopted a new name/manufacturer... It does NOT feel like the same product, and it also lasted about 1/2 as long... i.e. it seemed like the bottle was only about 1/2 full.  Very disappointing!!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product again.  The serum comes out of the dispenser to fast so it splatters all over.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with a coupon I received as part of a review opportunity and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. All I can say is this product is amazing!! My skin has never looked so bright and clear. I have tried so many things to minimize pores and help with some of the uneven tones of my skin with little success until now. This is an excellent product and i highly recommend giving it a try. This will forever be in my skin care routine from now on!</li>
            <li> Sleek bottle, smells great.  I have been using this 2x a day after washing my face. Love it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff! After working for a medical device manufacturer, I had the chance to try lots of new cosmetic products like serums and this one blows all others I tried out of the water.  The packaging first off, is simply gorgeous.  Before even opening, you feel the high quality, spa-like feeling.  It absorbs quickly and didn&#x27;t feel heavy on my sometimes oily skin.  I do have large pores and didn&#x27;t feel like this blocked them.  I also have some sunspots and I can see some reduction in those already. My skin feels brighter, fresher and lines seem diminished.  At 42, that is exactly what I am looking for! Some serums tend to be heavy and oily,  but not this one.  It was the perfect match for my skin and the perfect summer accessory and I am so glad I got the chance to try it out under a special coupon.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I thought it would probably irritate my skin but I tried it anyways. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and my skin feels smoother.</li>
            <li> I am currently using the serum and I do see a difference. So I am very happy with the results. I have tried and spent money on so many things that didn&#x27;t work , so I am overjoyed.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and so affordable, I wish I had discovered it years ago. I noticed an immediate overnight change in the texture of my skin, it was smoother, my pores were smaller. I have sensitive skin. I even use it on my neck, ears, decollete and the back of my hands. Of course that means I use it up faster but its affordable! There is a slight tightening &amp; tingling feeling after I apply it to my clean face, which I assume is the shrinking. It does not sting or burn. Ladies, give this a try before you buy something more expensive. The lines at the corner of my eyes have smoothed considerably, there is a glow to my skin and I swear the wrinkles on my forehead have softened. Follow the directions and apply a good moisturizer with sunblock after it has dried. Be aware that this product will not make your wrinkles go away permanently, it just diminishes them so you have to keep on using it.  I was lucky enough to get this with a promotional code.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 months and have been very happy. I noticed more radiance in my face after 2 weeks. Also noticed less acne after using twice daily.</li>
            <li> I was scared to use at first because I have very sensitive skin and once I used a Vitamin C serum and it made me itch. But, I gave it a shot and used in at night first. Felt great, no after feel, no grit or stickiness, when I woke it, my skin was soft and smooth. no break outs or redness.  so., now I have been using it everyday morning and night for a week and its great. No smell, no stickiness, my sensitive/acne prone skin really likes it.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of vitamin C serum, have used a few different brands, and the Toulon serum did not disappoint.  Very generous amount for the price, especially for a serum that has such high quality ingredients and more importantly, works.  I use it 2-3 times a week and what I like the most about it, it that it tightens and smooths my skin without being overly tight and uncomfortable.  Maybe that is due to the addition  jojoba oil.  I apply a thin coat on my face after cleansing, and, occasionally, when my face felt a little too tight, I just apply a tiny dab of my regular moisturizer over it.  My skin really is noticeably smoother and tighter since I have been using this product.  Perfect for when you want your skin to look dewy and fresh for a special event or even everyday.  I didn&#x27;t really understand how some reviews said they got no results at all.  I see results every time I use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More of why I love this product:  A lot of Vitamin C serums have ingredients in them that can actually harm your skin like preservatives, or DMAE and retinyl palmitate.  The ingredient list on the Toulon serum meets my high standards for putting on my skin.  You have to be so careful, way too many products out there that have harmful ingredients.  Natural and/or organic is very important to me.  Also, for a Vitamin C serum to be the most effective and for proper absorption, it needs to have a vitamin ration of 10% or above, with 20% being optimal.  The Toulon has 20%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has REALLY sold me on the Toulon brand of vitamin C serum is the price for what you get.  I went to a very popular online seller of cosmetics and looked at 8 different brands of Vit C Serum ranging in price from $45 to $155, all the same size at Toulon, 1 oz.  The ingredients were almost all the same!  Unbelievable!  You don&#x27;t need a fancy &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; to get spa-like results, that is for sure.  I did receive a promo code in exchange for an honest review of this product and my review is honest and truly the experience I had.  There really is nothing to NOT like about this product so it was an easy review.  Well, one small thing, the pump is great but be careful to make sure it is pointed at your hand.  It comes out fast and I have squirted product the wrong way a few times.  Too precious to waste!is honest and truly the experience I had.

            <li> I am a 51 year old woman who has, regrettably, not taken very good care of my skin until the past five years. I have spent countless amounts of dollars on creams and serums that promise to erase lines/wrinkles or take away my sun damage. So, when I was offered this product as a promotional discount, I was somewhat reluctant. But, figured I had nothing to lose. As stated, this is a serum. This means it is a very lightweight, thin liquid that only requires a minimal amount. When dispensing into your hand you have to be careful or it can partly squirt out of your palm. I found that it is important (as with most products) to follow the instructions. I applied a small amount over my entire face and neck both in the morning and at night, after cleansing and before applying my normal moisturizer. Within a couple of weeks I noticed a brightness to my skin and a reduction to those ugly age/sun spots that I have been hiding with make-up. My skin looks refreshed! I love this product so much that I ordered another bottle for myself and one for my sister.</li>
            <li> Loved this moisturizer.  You are going to like it.</li>
            <li> This serum is the best!  Trust me, I have tried almost every popular brand out there and abandoned them after a few weeks.  Any problems encountered with them are non-existent with Toulon.  It is lightweight, odorless, and absorbed quickly.  No intense redness follows application on my sensitive skin so it is fine to wear during the day under Toulon moisturizer and cosmetics.  Previously when using other serums at night, my eyes would become irritated even when the serum was not applied near them. This does not occur with Toulon. With regular use, I have definitely noticed a gradual improvement in the texture, glow, dark spots, fine lines, and remnants of acne on my mature skin.  Toulon offers the highly touted combination of recommended ingredients for one&#x27;s skin care at a very competitive price.  That fact and its effectiveness make for one great product.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Nothing better than a product you can&#x27;t wait to use again. The hyaluronic acid acts a sponge and absorbs the moisture right to your skin. Instantly my skin felt smoother and not as dry. Having sensitive skin I am always hesitant about using new products. I had no reaction and I love the way my skin feels. It is starting to lighten my dark spots and soften fine fines. I don&#x27;t give many 5 star ratings when I review products but this one deserves it.</li>
            <li> This serum isn&#x27;t oily like some.... It is soaked up quickly by my skin and leaves it glowing.  There was a definite change in my skin after only a week of using the serum, and I generally only use it at bedtime :). I purchased this during a promotional period and I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I did so. I love the way it makes my skin feel and look!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this serum since reading how great Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid is for your skin. I liked how smoothly the serum went on and it make my skin feel soft and smooth. It also absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy or thick. I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference with fine lines and wrinkles but have noticed my skin definitely feels softer and have only been using for about two weeks. This is definitely inexpensive compared to other high end products that offer the same results so am planning to keep using it. I was happy to receive this product as a promotional discount and write a review for it.</li>
            <li> I am constantly searching for a good facial moisturizer so I picked this one up during a promotional period.  This is a good moisturizer with a pleasant scent &amp; a soothing texture. I feels so good on my skin.  I can tell a difference in my skin. Since beginning use of this product my skin has more of a glow &amp; is so soft.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet</li>
            <li> I love this serum!  It is so light and not sticky at all.  Leaves my skin feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like other products.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my sensitive skin either!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I like be the serum, esp the witch hazel that dries quickly. But the dispenser is terrible. Perhaps mine is defective, but it shoots out violently at 90mph at an awkward angle...so I end up wasting a third of it. Very disappointed that it will only last me at best, a month of nightly application.</li>
            <li> Love it so far!  Excellent customer service.  I had a question and they answered within minutes!  I use 1-2 &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; to cover my face and neck at night on clean face.  I&#x27;m noticing my skin very soft!  I&#x27;m having my 16yr old son use it too.</li>
            <li> After receiving a promotional coupon, I was excited to try this Vitamin C Serum product.  I&#x27;m pretty picky about my skin care products, but after reading a little about the company and the product, I decided to try it.  The instructions were clear and the product was easy to use.  The serum is lightweight and you can put it on prior to adding moisturizer or even make-up.  The instructions advise using 1-2x a day.  I have only been using the serum at night for a few days, so I cannot say definitively how it has changed my skin.  However, I can say that it is easy on sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  The skin absorbs it quickly and leaves it feeling soft.  I look forward to continuing to use this product.</li>
            <li> I will only buy a product after reading the reviews, and the great reviews lead me to this product. I am so happy I found this anti-aging serum because it is amazing compared to other high quality serum.  I love, love, this product, my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> i feel my skin gets over breakouts way quicker using this product. skin looks better, it absorbs really quick so I feel i need to use more and I can&#x27;t really massage it in as much as it says to.</li>
            <li> I bought the Vitamin C serum and had been using that for a while before I ordered the glycolic acid face cream that they recommend to use with it. A very small amount (not enough to cover your face) comes out with one pump, and it soaks into your skin very quickly, so I was using 2 pumps every night. Then I finally got online and read the instructions that you only need 5 drops, so I started doing one pump and then I would wet my hands so that I could spread it all over my face. I have been using the serum since the beginning of December, and I am still using the serum and its February. The glycolic face cream I ordered AFTER I ordered this lasted less than a month and that was using it only at night most of the time. I was disappointed that it ran out so quickly and I did not notice any results. I am 35 and have  only have a few noticeable wrinkles on my forehead (well, I notice them, along with my 4 year old daughter who informed me I had zig zag lines on my forehead, but everyone else claims not to see them when I point them out) and one small age spot on my cheek that bothers me, both of which remain unchanged. I will finish using the bottle but I won&#x27;t be ordering any more.</li>
            <li> This is a really fantastic serum for the 40-something year old to help take care of wrinkles and age spots.  If you are looking for a nice, lightweight serum this one is great.  Not greasy at all and absorbs immediately.  I received this at a promotional price and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I love all natural products.  I have been applying this before I put on make up and it seems to set everything just right.  I think my skin feels smoother too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a one because I need to draw attention to something that concerns me.  I just purchased this product and have been using it for almost a week. I actually like it. It tightens the skin and makes my pores look smaller.  My big concern is that, tonight when I was checking the container for an expiration date I held the bottle up to a bright light and noticed that the TOULON label had another label underneath...OZNY Skincare anti aging serum.  (The Toulon label was simply glued on top of it...I should point out that this product came sealed in clear plastic wrap). It looks like OZNY Skincare was an affiliate of Toulon but it&#x27;s hard to tell.  Even if it is or was, my concern is why would I not have rec&#x27;d a new bottle of the Toulon product.  Why the disguise. And if OZNY is an offshoot of Toulon how long was that because my original container indicated this was originally an OZNY product. It just seems shady. And it casts doubt on the age and content of the product I received.  ***UPDATED POST  I probably should&#x27;ve contacted the seller before posting my review.  I was surprised to get a call from one of the founders of the company, who explained that the re-labeling was due to copyright concerns and the product was produced this year.  (Understandable) I would not have updated this post with a 5 if I did not just love this stuff.  I&#x27;m 46 yrs old and my skin looks like it did when I was in my 30&#x27;s.  I hope this company is around for many years.  I have tried just about everything and I won&#x27;t be trying anything else anytime soon.  UPDATE 7/3/15  I had to buy 2 more of these.  This stuff is amazing! I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet but this product tightens my pores and my skin just beams.</li>
            <li> The Vit C anti age serum was a great find for a few reasons: it was in a very convenient container to get the most of out the product, unlike most anti age serum it was loose but I did not find it watery, I found it absorbed into my skin fast but did not make me feel like I had it on once it dried. I got this as a promotion but can say that its very worth its while.</li>
            <li> Great feeling cream!  I was looking for a vitamin c cream that would hydrate and possibly help with dark spots that I like to call freckles but are probably sun damage. The cream bottle is very pretty and looks for fancy on my vanity. I also love the amount that is dispensed. Not too much!  I feel like some manufacturers make there pumps waste more than needed so you buy more. This is not the case here.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it enough to see improvement on the dark spots but I can say that it is very hydrating and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I was able to review for a promotional code. I gladly provide a raving review as this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer I bit more consistency, it&#x27;s thinness makes me wonder if there is anything in it at all, however my skin does feel better after application, so that indicative of something.  I do not like the delivery pump system.  The pump action is rigid, and you can&#x27;t control the amount that is forcefully squirted out.  It tends to splash off or around finger tips, so plenty of the product is wasted. I used in tandem with the anti-wrinkle cream, and i dermaroll.  I&#x27;m getting get results from needling!  **Update** Though I was very frustrated with the forced pump, the product seems to work well, so ordered another.  This time the pump seems to pump much better. It is not dispensing so forcefully that you end up wasting product. Product comes out nicely and doesn&#x27;t splash all over the place.  Perhaps the first one was defective.  I will still complain that the pump has flaws.  The pump doesn&#x27;t have a tube that reaches to the bottom of the bottle, so by the time it&#x27;s almost empty you have to unscrew the cap and dab onto finger to use up all the serum. With all that said, it&#x27;s still a great product and I&#x27;m seeing results.  I use with the wrinkle cream daily and intermittently use a derma roller.  If I were more diligent and used the .25mm nightly before application, I imagine my results would be even more noticeable.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on the way my skin looks!  I assume this product will be a staple in my age-defying mission!</li>
            <li> I am 53 years old. I have extremely sensitive skin and normally am unable to use products of this type. I have been using this serum for about 3 weeks (both morning and night) and my skin texture is already SO much better than it was and I have had absolutely no skin irritation. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Now that I am in my 30s, I need quality facial products that can repair sun damage from my younger days, and protect me from further signs of aging.  This Vitamin C does both of these things.  Personally, I am using this product to help fade sun spots and hyper-pigmentation that I have struggled with.  I refuse to use products with harsh chemicals on my skin, but am more than happy to use products with natural and organic ingredients, such as this Vitamin C Serum.  To be more specific, here are some great benefits to using this serum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fights signs of aging, like fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Helps plump up wrinkles with Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Helps even out skin tone, blotchiness, sun spots, dark spots, and hyper-pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin firm, and matte&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;Will not break out sensative skin&lt;br /&gt;Money Back Guarantee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is clear, has no scent, and is very light.  I do wish it was a little thicker, it is a little runny and difficult to apply.  It kinds of runs between my fingers as I am trying to get it to my face. I also think there could be some improvement on the bottle and dispenser.  I like the look of it, but I think mine leaked during shipping.  And when you press down to dispense it, it kind of shoots out at an odd angle.  These are minor details to me.  I am most impressed with the quality of ingredients in the serum. I am confident that with continued use, my skin appear more even in textures, and bright and healthy.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Started using this vit c serum with hyaluronic acid after I saw it at an event in Manhathan.  I am impressed.  The serum is light and absorbs quickly into my skin leaving the skin soft and supple.  I use it both day and night and moisturize once it has absorbed.  I see a significant difference in lines on my forehead and around my eyes and mouth.  I am very pleased with the product and even bought the other TOULON products because of the high quality of the serum.  Will highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> One of the best serums ever !</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum twice daily for over a week. There is no smell to the serum, and it absorbs quickly. I have had no adverse affects on my sensitive skin. That&#x27;s the good. With other C serums I have tried I have felt my skin tightening and seen a difference with my mild Rosacea. I have not seen this or felt this with this particular serum. I was given a sample of this product for my unbiased review. This serum is gentle, but has made little difference to the appearance or feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying using this product.  The serum is quickly absorbed into the skin and makes it  feel great.  It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.  It will be part of my regular &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; regimen.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels but didn&#x27;t see any results (not nearly as much as my garnier serum/moisturizer) and my skin breaks out from these products sadly</li>
            <li> I am a big believer in vitamin c but they are not all created equal.  Great potent ingredients in Skincare.  That is why I am getting results.  Super simple fast pump, great viscosity of product, fast absorbing, no fragrance, and leaves the skin really soft.  I can feel a difference already.  I am especially excited and motivated to share with people that the crows feet around my eyes are slowing disappearing...this serum is like magic!! Love it.</li>
            <li> Smooth, rejuvenating... NOT sticky.  Really great stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells great, goes on smooth, and leaves skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.  Even on these hot, summer days in NYC, my face feels and looks younger and softer.</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly, feels great on the skin. blends well with my current skin care regime. a great nighttime treatment!</li>
            <li> Loving the serum.  I like how it makes my skin smooth and I am looking really great.  Even my girlfriends have commented.  It feels great, absorbs, quickly, and has helped reduce some of my lines.  really great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Used only for a short time, but I already am experiencing a definite improvement in skin appearance; diminished fine wrinkles, skin discoloration.</li>
            <li> Vit C is sheer and gives a no clog feeling.  It is easy and is helping heal my skin.</li>
            <li> There are 2 very popular and necessary in our skin care active ingredients: Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;The concentration of Vitamin C is 20% which is very high and works fast and great on my skin to reduce Hyper-pigmentation (sun damage) and Hyaluronic Acid helps me to keep my skin hydrated especially in winter season. It helps to improve healing process of acne issues also.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing light and in the same time rich product.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to dry, combination and oily skin!!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful customer service and follow up! Plus, I&#x27;m loving this product. It&#x27;s been 14 days and I am already seeing improvement in my complexion!! Will happily order again and again!! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for only 2 weeks now and my skin already feels softer and appears smoother.  It goes on easy and is not greasy and absorbed in under 2 minutes!  Easy addition to your morning and evening ritual.  No ingredients that damage or stain sheets and towels.  Look forward to continuing the use and long lasting benefits!!!</li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and a young man asked me if I was 30 yet? Love this product ;)</li>
            <li> After a friend‚Äôs recommendation, I decided to try this product.  Since I have sensitive skin, I‚Äôm always cautious about trying new items on my face.  I first tried the serum on my neck and chest area.  After a few days, I noticed my skin became firmer and tighter and I wasn‚Äôt sensitive to it.  I was impressed!  I‚Äôm now using the product in my daily routine for my face.  I really like it!  It‚Äôs lightweight and I follow it up with moisturizer.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Great product! Nice clean smell, very gentle</li>
            <li> Love this serum.  I am a guy who takes care of his skin.  I can feel the serum tightening my face.  It has also been great for helping my complexion and clearing up my skin..  I especially like to use the serum as an after shave.  It helps prevent ingrown hairs and with my pores open, I can feel it working.  I got this tip about using the serum after shaving from a make up artist. You really feel it and you really see the results too.</li>
            <li> Really thrilled with this vitamin C.  I received it nearly two weeks ago and have already noticed some pretty amazing results. Over the years I have tried many products with varying results. OZ.NY Vitamin C is definitely a keeper. My skin feels smoother and some of the finer lines are beginning to fade, especially around my eye and on my forehead.  I tend to have dry skin and find that moisturizers often don&#x27;t have enough of a base to help with the dryness.  Loving the results and happy that it is working for me!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product! I am careful about what I put on my skin because so many  vit c serums are harsh and irritating.  I don&#x27;t want to cause any skin irritation or use a product that has poor ingredients. I believe that your body makes collagen to keep skin tight, so using the right ingredients on your skin can stimulate your body to make its own collagen and provide a more firm youthful look. I looked at the ingredients before buying this product and it has the best combination of ingredients. I could tell when I opened it and felt it that it is high quality. I would recommend it as a daily facial treatment and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to add Vitamin C to my skin care routine and was pleased to find this serum.  It feels good on my skin--no greasy residue and works well under my makeup.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days and have noticed my acne scars are already starting to lighten.  I&#x27;m looking forward to continued positive results!</li>
            <li> My sister turned me on to vitamin c serum for my face awhile back.  I have liked using it and have continued to search for one that I really like.  I have tried many that were too watery or had the opposite problem and seemed oily on my skin.  I have found others that were irritating to my skin with an intense stinging sensation and others that have had an artificial citrus smell to them.  Having tried so many, I was over joyed to come across Vitamin C serum with HA.  I can get all the benefits of the vitamin c and HA - specifically lightening of age spots and decreasing appearance of fine lines...without putting watery or oily serum on my face.  I love that it is fragrance free and is very gentle on my sensitive skin.  It has made such a drastic difference in a relatively short period of time to my skin.  I have even begun to rub it on the back of my hands.  Your hands are one of the first places that show your age.  This product rocks!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and I am always a little nervous when trying something new. I am happy to say I had no negative reaction to my skin and notice that it is helping to even out some blemishes I am having on my face. This serum is very light weight and it absorbed into my skin really fast. My face feels fresh after applying it and it works well with my favorite moisturizer. I have now added it to my daily routine. I highly recommend this vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Comparable to high-end vitamin C products. Serum goes on smooth and is absorbed quickly with no residual stickiness. Perfect for use right before bed time underneath regular moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product; very moisturizing and incredibly effective.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job clearing and moisturizing the skin. The serum plumps and brightens the skin as well.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! its easy to use and my skin is looking good!!! its a new must have in my skin care regimen. Its light and no stickiness. You dont even notice you put it on. LOVE&amp;#62; LOVE&amp;#62;LOVE.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  Since I began using it I have noticed smoother skin, and reduction in fine lines.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this vit C serum for a short time but have already noticed my smile lines are beginning to be less.  I first bought the product because of some scarring from acne when I was younger.  It has made a huge difference.  The scars are still there but they are smaller and lighter. I also love the consistency and the way it makes my skin look and feel.  My wife is loving it too. It is a great product that will revolutioinize the way we care for our skin.</li>
            <li> I have been seeing great results with my new vitamin c serum.  I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful with what I use on my skin.  The serum has been very gentle and feels great.  It is soothing on my skin and makes my skin feel very smooth.  I have not had any breakouts or reactions.  My complexion is looking great.  In fact, my face is looking like it has more of a glow.  Who wouldn&#x27;t love that?</li>
            <li> I am using my Serum for 3 days and my face is smooth and soft. The serum is light and not sticky at all like some other products I have tried. Too early to comment on any improvements but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product. The serum leaves your skin smooth and glowing. The consistency is clear and light, so you&#x27;re not putting a heavy cream on your face that could potentially clog your  pores. Would I recommend it? Absolutely!</li>
            <li> I love this serum!!! I love having healthy, glowing skin and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve tried that has given me everything I ask! Other serums I&#x27;ve used are thick and cause break outs but the vitamin C serum actually clears up and prevents break outs. My skin is tighter, smoother, and it FEELS healthy!!! I have gotten so many compliments on my skin and i now have the confidence to meet new people! I absolutely LOVE this product!!!!</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS GREAT, WOULD BUY AGAIN. MY SKIN LOOKS GREAT AFTER ONE WEEK OF USING PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Using it on my face but also on my d√©collet√©, Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.  I have been enjoyed this serum as I feel like it is not only keeping my skin hydrated, soft, and healthy during these drier months but also helping to combat some skin challenges.  I am seeing improvment with my complexion and fine lines around my eyes.  This  vit C serum is great for my skin.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> skin feels great --  ease of application -- odorless</li>
            <li> Loving the way it feels, I wanted to find a way to not break out because I have semi oily skin, keeps my skin healthy and acne free. Love it highly recommended! Dr oz was right, vitamin c all the way</li>
            <li> Did not get rid of my dark pigmentation. .my face looks the same</li>
            <li> An effective serum.  Light and refreshing.  The vit c serum with hyaluronic acid keeps my skin hydrated and treats the skin before I moisturize.  Frangrance- free is important for my skin&#x27;s health.  Like the effective serum adn will keep using.</li>
            <li> Best vitamin c serum I have used.  It absorbs quickly into my skin and helps keep my skin looking great.  Really happy with this vit c serum with hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for just over a week so far. I have been noticing more and more lovely fine lines around my eyes lately so I was excited to try this item as a promotion. I have noticed some improvement in the degree of these eye wrinkles. A nice side effect is that my skin feels much more soft and supple than it had been feeling. I also see a little more vibrancy in my skin since using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now and am very impressed.  My puffy, dark under-eye circles have become much less noticeable.  The darkness has faded and I have very little puffiness.  While I received a coupon code for this product, I will happily and eagerly continue its use.  My skin feels so much softer and smoother and the lines that I have between my brows have decreased a lot!  I only apply to my problem areas, which happen to be oily places for me.  I love that this serum leaves me feeling fresh and light, rather than greasy like other similar products have.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, because she had been interested in trying a topical vitamin c.  And, she is using and enjoying this serum.  But, I wanted to leave a review because this product is not just for women.  I decided that I could use a little anti aging too.  So I tried the serum and have continued to use it for the past couple of weeks. It absorbed quickly into the skin and has left my skin feeling smooth.  Over the past couple of years, I have noticed some wrinkles showing on my face.  I am happy to report that the serum is actually helping make these less visible. You have to be happy about that.  Looks like I found a winning formula for my wife and me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the results from this vitamin C serum. It goes on smoothly, and absorbs quickly, which is important to me. My skin feels tighter and toned after applying it. I think it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Its doing great things.  I have been using this vitamin c serum.  Have used others before...this one is great...much better than others I have bought... doesn&#x27;t irritate me but gets results...seeing a difference with both the age spots and the fine lines.  Just what I wanted.  My skin seems firmer. Love that it is fragrance free.  Also, have really enjoyed the ebook I got for free with the purchase!  Great tips on skincare.</li>
            <li> This is such a terrific product! I was so pleased  that it felt so light - an not greasy- on my face!  I also applied it to the dry skin on my elbows. My skin does look and fell healthier!  I will advise my friends and colleagues to get it!</li>
            <li> Love this serum already seeing some great results.  Will recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am really happy I tried this face serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Vitamin C to improve the health and appearance of my skin so I value quality ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This serum has worked tremendously; around my eyes the lines are really less and under my eye is lighter and less puffy.  My overall complexion is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really do get what you pay for.  I‚Äôve tried a lot that were even less expensive and either they irritated my skin or just simply didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôd rather pay a little more for a product that actually does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People at work even noticed.  I think it is both the glow (have been doing some of the exfoliating tips in the free eBook too) and the fact that my pores have totally become unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the Vitamin C Serum I have always been looking for and now I know I‚Äôve found it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything except dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great, it makes my skin smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> I just got this serum yesterday and have used it once. My rating right now is strictly on the consistency and the way it comes out of the bottle. It&#x27;s like water and comes out with such force that it wastes some because you&#x27;re unable to catch it so to speak. After a couple of weeks I&#x27;l re review on performance.</li>
            <li> I am pretty fussy about my skin care products. I have read a lot of good things about the use of Hyaluronic Acid with Vitamin C. I came across this Skincare. It had all the right ingredients and thus far has provided outstanding results. I enjoy the healthy glow that my skin has and the way if makes my skin feel...</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I am already seeing visible results after only a few days of use.  Like the feel of the product and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Great serum. It goes on clear and clean. Feels light and great on your skin. Give it a try, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly, odorless, and has met my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li> I love the way this serum goes on very light, not heavy. Since I have been using the this  product, my skin is softer and  smoother and I have noticed spots and lines fade. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum!! I have tried many expensive products that promise results, but this one actually delivers AND at a reasonable price! Thank you, Toulon, for making this product available through a special promotion! My very sensitive skin is significantly softer and bright - with no redness in using this product! It feels like silk and applies very easily, providing my otherwise dry skin with much needed weightless moisture. I can&#x27;t get over how soft my skin feels after using this product - it has become an essential part of my morning routine. Even my co-workers have noticed that my skin seems brighter, and with no irritation. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum - I have worked in many spas and am very familiar with high quality skin care products, and this is by far one of my favorites. I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;m very picky, and this product is very light weight, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy. I already notice a difference in how my skin feels. Will definitely keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical if vitamin c serum would really work to fight aging but after only a few days I can see a difference in the texture of my skin. My face looks brighter and is so much smoother. I love this product and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This serum is terrific!  Now that it&#x27;s part of my daily routine, I&#x27;ve noticed that my dark sun spots have lightened and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are far less noticeable.  Even my pores appear smaller.  The serum goes on so smoothly and makes my skin feel like silk.  Even my esthetician has noticed the difference!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I first heard of this serum from a friend in Florida who really watches her skin for signs of aging/ sun damage. It does for my skin what vitamin C does for a cold: knocks wrinkles out of the park! It goes on light and non-greasy. Lasts all day too. I&#x27;m in the mid-life years &amp; wishing I&#x27;d never tanned and had use sunscreen WAY earlier. This serum has been rejuvenating the skin around my eyes, and my upper lip wrinkles. It&#x27;s firming and tightening all over. I find I&#x27;m needing less foundation because my skin tone is more even. I do love this stuff! They need to make a bathwash for the rest of me. :)</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and i am acne prone ans this serum is working great!  My skin looks better than I can ever remember and it feels great too.  I&#x27;m ready to toss my old moisturizer.  Looking forward to future products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meredith</li>
            <li> Great facial vit C serum.  Absorbs quickly into my skin instantly giving my skin a silky feeling.  It has really helped with pigmentation issues and keeping my skin hydrated.  I have used it regularly and have given it time to work.  Will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> I only recently heard how helpful using a good serum under a moisturizer can be for your skin. I wanted to try a vitamin c serum because I saw that t Dr. OZ (who I love!) was recommending it as an anti aging solution. I have recently been traveling in dry climates and have found this serum to be of tremendous helpful in keeping my skin moist. It also gives it smoother texture and I nice glow! Highly recommend to anyone looking to try a serum!</li>
            <li> This serum is fantastic! I use it as part of my daily routine. I have dark sun spots have lightened and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are far less noticeable.  The serum goes on so smoothly and makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I always have issues with skin care. Either my skin breaks out or the product is just too oily. This product is different from anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. It sits so gently on my skin I barely notice it&#x27;s on anymore. My skin feels so much better, it&#x27;s tight and firm and I just feel better. This serum is a great new addition to my skin care routine and I don‚Äôt know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li> This product is unique - I had a couple of blemishes that weren&#x27;t clearing up for anything that cleared up right away in one night!!! I have tried multiple skin care lines and nothing has cleared me up like this has. I have been using this serum for less then a week and my complextion and overall color of my skin has already improved by 40%. My skin is finally glowing again as if I was in my early 20s. Other then my face wash this is the only thing I&#x27;m using. I wanted to make sure when I tried it I could write a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; review. I really don&#x27;t need anything else other then this one product. No need to use 5 different products to get the perfect skin, just use this one.</li>
            <li> The serum felt great on my skin and I did notice it&#x27;s clarifying effects rather quickly. I like that is not greasy and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used lots of Vitamin C products and I love this one!  It makes a wonderful foundation for applying makeup and feels terrific on my skin,.</li>
            <li> This item was for my wife. She is satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am loving this silky serum. I will only use this from now on. I searched and searched. Now I am hooked. I just received the lotion to go with it. Cant wait to see what they do together.</li>
            <li> With-in a minute of using the serum I could see and feel a difference in my skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> The product was easy to use, clear and left a nice clean feeling on my skin / unlike many products that I have tried that were greasy and thick.&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced the scientific value of vitamin A &amp; C for skin tone and anti aging properties. I will continue to use this product and look forward to more of it&#x27;s kind from this company.  R. Singer</li>
            <li> This product is great!  Love the way it makes my skin feel.  Has reduced some wrinkles already!</li>
            <li> I am a guy who takes care of my skin. I wanted to write a review because I&#x27;m impressed with this serum. It glides on easy and I do see that my fine lines are looking better since I started using it a month ago. I was surprised when I first started using it because it was thinner than a serum I had used in the past, but I like how a little goes a long way and absorbs so fast. I feel the antioxidants are helping to repair my skin since I was out in the sun a lot this summer. My tip is that you don&#x27;t need much to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to friends and family.  This vitamin C serum has improved my hyperpigmentation significantly, leaving my skin bright and healthy looking.  I use it daily and it works great a s a spot treatment, as well.  At the first sign of a skin irritation I dab some on and this vitamin C serum clears up any signs of irritation.  This serum has worked better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum with vitamin c and loving it.  I have only had a small pump sample not the actaul size pump.  I am excited to get the pump bottle of the vitamon C serum and continue to use the product.  It is light weight and sheer and absorbs quickly into my skin.  Since starting with the TOULON line my skin has been looking great.  I really like the TOULON vitamin C serum because it comes in a pump bottle.  I learned that vitamin c serum is not good to expose to air for its shelf life or potency, so I have not wanted to buy it in a drop bottle.  Excited to see a high quality option in a pump.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  Using it every morning and night has made my face and neck feel much smoother.  Additionally, this product is natural and does not have any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I found this product. The price is fantastic compared to other vitamin C serums, and I started using this immediately for some acne scarring - I&#x27;m 36 years old and still get pimples! I definitely noticed a smoothing of my skin tone in the affected areas and will definitely order this again once I run out of this bottle!</li>
            <li> It has made my skin more smooth and even. It has reduced the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love that the serum quickly absorbs into my skin for a quick beauty treatment before heading out to work.  This serum leaves my skin feeling smooth making it easier to apply makeup.  It never makes my skin feel greasy or dry.  It is the perfect balance. -D.Lewis</li>
            <li> My wife is using this and I see a difference in her skin.  it doesn&#x27;t feel oily when I touch her after she just put it on herself.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid w Vitamin C Serum for Face has worked well for me.  I have been using this product for about a month now and my skin seems to be softer and clearer.  This product goes on easy and feels as if your face comes back to life.  I recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt better! I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve lived for 34 years without access to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product!  I am always in the sun (I live in FL) and I really have to take care of my skin.  Yes, even guys want to have healthy skin.  I&#x27;m 46 and the lines and wrinkles are making themselves known more than ever.  Since I have started using this Vitamin C serum from OZ/NY I have noticed my skin is brighter and smoother.  My laugh lines will always be there, but I&#x27;ve noticed the smaller lines have begun to fade.  This is definitely a product that I will continue to use!</li>
            <li> Excellent Service and Product!  Thank you for making something so perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a few weeks, but after I apply it to my face and neck I actually feel the skin tightening. I wish I had taken some &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pictures so I could track my &amp;#34;progress&amp;#34; to healthier skin.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and makes skin feel much softer.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Amazingly noticeable difference in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Cannot tell if it is working...been using it for 3 months!</li>
            <li> After trying several anti-aging products out there, with much unsuccessful results, a friend told me about  this new product on the market, Vitamin C Serum. I decided to try it, and after three weeks of using it i noticed the dark spots around my eyes gradually disappearing and the wrinkles reduced. And not to mention my skin is smoother than ever. I am verry happy with this product. It&#x27;s great and i recommmended to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have tried many anti-aging creams and serums. I tried this anti-aging serum on a recommendation and I have been really enjoying it and best of all seeing results. I use it both day and night. My skin overall is looking much healthier and does actually have more of a glow to it. ... puffiness, dark circles and crows feet are all improving. Love the serum especially around the eyes</li>
            <li> Great product! The serum goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel smooth and silky.  The dark sun spots on my face have lightened and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are far less noticeable. My skin has a much healthier look overall.</li>
            <li> I havent been using the serum too long but I have noticed my skin is a lot smoother exactly where I have been applying it</li>
            <li> The serum is convenient to apply and gives my skin a wonderful glow!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, I have used it for the past month and I have already seen a reduction in the size of my pores and evenness of skin tone. The product is light and easy to apply to the skin, it does not leave me feeling greasy or shiny. The product leaves my skin feeling fresh and it is perfect for my under eyes especially after long nights. I recommend the product and it is well worth its money. There are similar products that are more expensive, but this one does the job just right. Highly recommend! Product also shipped and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> This product works better than ALL the expensive  creams, serums and potions, combined, I have bought over many years.</li>
            <li> I have been using different vitamin C serums for years.  I have really enjoyed this serum.  It is different because it is very light weight and sheer and absorbs quickly.  Its sheer nature also has acted almost as a foundation primer.  Makes my foundation stay on longer, look better, and my make up pops more.  I can feel the serum tightening and firming my skin.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This serum is perfect for my skin.  It has over the past months brought a glow to my skin that was never there before.  I have used vitamin C in the past and much prefer this product.  I see the fine lines disappearing around my eyes and my skin is much tighter.  I will continue to use this product and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Excellent product you can feel the difference in a very short. time. Pleasant smell and very chic packaging. I&#x27;ve forwarded the link to some of my &amp;#34;mature friends&amp;#34;: who would appreciate the Serum and would all want to stay young !  Great price too ! Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> I really have been enjoying my serum. ¬†I like the pump bottle and the free book that I received with the product. ¬†The product itself is rejuvenating my skin. ¬†It is soothing and feels smooth and silky on my face. ¬†It is lessening lines and wrinkles and it has even begun to lessen some acne scars that I have. ¬† Will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! my skin is smooth,soft and youthful.also toulangroup.com is very helpful and a wonderful company! Charlee Barton</li>
            <li> This face serum is great!  It seems to work like magic on the skin. And when combined with a good regimin, it helps you stay young!</li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing results of this serum after a month or so! So far I have been using it daily&lt;br /&gt;For about a week and do find that I need moisturizer as it seems to leave my skin feeling dry, but I like that it goes in easily. I have used vitamin c serum in the past that stings and this one does not! Seems like a good product!</li>
            <li> I suffer from malasma and some freckles which I&#x27;ve had them since childhood. I decided enough was enough and I did some research to find out how I could get rid of the at least the melasma once and for all (short of lasers).  I had been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Brightening Dark Spot Corrector because it has safe ingredients and I thought it worked pretty well (and I continue to use it) but I sort of felt like I &amp;#34;plateaued&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t see any further results.&lt;br /&gt;From my research, I knew I needed to add/incorporate 3 main ingredients into my regime: 20% vitamin C, MSM (sulfur), and hyaluronic acid. I ho-hummed about which products to buy and as usual I do my product research on ewg.org and Amazon to read reviews.  This one had not only a great reviews but also had all three ingredients including other ingredients which are beneficial.  I purchase the product at an introductory sale price.&lt;br /&gt;I apply this product after the brightener and before my glycolic acid souffl√© (as often as possible throughout the day-- at least morning and night).  It goes on very smooth-- non-sticky, non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using the product for only 3 weeks and I feel like it is softening my skin a bit.  I debate as to whether to give this 4 or 5 stars.  Amazon says that a 4 means &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; and 5 means &amp;#34;love.&amp;#34;  I feel like I really like this product so I will give it a 4.  But I also feel like I could certainly use it longer and see more benefits.  Also, I have not tried any other vitamin C serums to compare it with.  Again, there is something to say about the convenience of all of the most important potent ingredients in one bottle.  I am left curious as to what a bottle of just hyaluronic or just vitamin C would do, but I may be too lazy or frugal to buy several bottles and I know the main ingredient, aloe, takes well to my skin.  Lastly, I think that I would buy this again, but I would debate about it if I had to pay the retail price because there are so many competitors that offer a seemingly similar product for around $20.;</li>
            <li> Lets just say I am really happy with this product an company!  Been using this past week an my skin is glowing. The customer care is excellent an they respond right away if you have any questions.  I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  With the high cost on many beauty products this is budget friendly an provides the results I wanted</li>
            <li> Great Price, Great product!</li>
            <li> Gentle and calming.  This is a lovely product and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The best Vitamin C I have ever used.  It is so light and absorbs immediately.  It makes my skin firm and refreshed.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical about vit c serum. I have sensitive skin and I heard that hyaluronic acid can irritate the skin. After 2 days using it my fears were put to rest. My face is smoother and feels great. I really like this vitamin c and it is toning my skin and giving me a glow that people are noticing it.  Will continue to use this vit c and will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Very effective!would definitely order more of this!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but it does not go very far.  Would have like a stronger results more like a peel.  I like this product line and as a first time user of the line I am pleased that is why 4 stars. I am going to look to see if there is a more concentrated version if not I will more than likely re-buy.  Reality is though ladies there is no magic that undoes the time we have lived so enjoy your time, respect the fact that you have earned the badge of what ever age you are.  So many do not make it as far as you have.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ts not sticky or smelly, goes on great and after a few minutes kind of gives you a tightening of the skin. Just started my second bottle and have noticed my face seems brighter and a sun freckle under my eye has lightened.</li>
            <li> I am rather impressed at how quickly I noticed a difference in the skin on my forehead, cheeks, and jaw after starting with the Vitamin C serum. I just followed the instructions in the ebook and a month or so my skin looked and felt noticeably better. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how much more I will improve.. For me, a really great value.</li>
            <li> It didnt change anything on my skin&lt;br /&gt;It seem more dry after 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for one week now. Already I have noticed changes in my skin. Seriously!!. After I use up my current organic moisturizer I am going to try OZ NY moisturizer with Glycolic.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product two times a day for one month and it really worked for me. The greatest difference is skin tone. My skin looks healthier, fairer, brighter and glowing! No signs of itching or blemishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles: Since I don&#x27;t have conspicuous wrinkles, I can&#x27;t really tell whether it works for wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Sun spots: I don&#x27;t have many sun spots. I have some small moles which are old so I didn&#x27;t expect that they would go away with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Skin tone: It got brighter, fairer and more glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;Acne: I don&#x27;t have it but before period I usually get skin troubles and I think that this product helps subside the skin troubles.&lt;br /&gt;Texture of this product: Very watery and quickly and smoothly applied. I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Literally no smell or very slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product!!!</li>
            <li> Cool, refreshing feel to this serum. Not a heavy gunk but instead quite light and easy to apply. Versatile: Great for morning or nighttime use.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of these vitamin c serums.  They all have had some quirks, some feel greasy, some have an odor.  This one is perfect!  No issues at all.  My face feels so smooth after using it.  I was lucky enough to get this with a coupon.  My face is breaking out less and just feels so much better and looks better</li>
            <li> I am almost 40 &amp; starting to age in my face.  I&#x27;ve been looking for products to help me &amp; make me look better.  I was so excited to get this with a coupon.  It arrived fast &amp; is packaged beautifully.  It smells great too.  I have been using it per the directions &amp; I can honestly say I really like this product.  It makes my skin feel soft, I feel like some of my fine lines have been diminished &amp; some of my freckles &amp; dark spots have lightened.  I&#x27;m very very pleased!!!</li>
            <li> -Just  started using this product and I have already noticed some difference. My skin feels softer and looks&lt;br /&gt;Great! A great product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This serum is wonderful! Having sensitive skin, I am really picky about the products I use. This serum did not irritate my skin, but within two weeks managed to diminish fine wrinkles. It goes on smooth, it is not oily or sticky. I also appreciate that it does not have an intrusive smell. Overall, a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> this is a really great product i love how my skin feels after i apply it . this is a home run babe</li>
            <li> So, after just a couple of weeks I am seeing my undereye area become less darkened, more hydrated and my fine lines that was getting more defined by the minute it seemed, well, it is nearly unnoticable! I realy love the feel of this stuff. The first application I overused. There is a pump so make sure you push it very lightly. You only need less that half a pump to cover the entire eye area, it covers both eyes. A little goes a long way. I cant imagine how amazing my eyes will look in a couple of months. I love the hydration I get without feeling greasy. This stuff sinks right in and your skin feels like magic. Thanks Oz Natural! I love what my skin is doing with the use of your proucts!</li>
            <li> I have a different brand of Vitamin c serum that I have been using but I wasn&#x27;t really sure it was doing much for me. I was given a promo code for this serum and thought I&#x27;d try it out. I added into my daily routine, immediately after washing. My complexion is brighter, clearer and I am pretty positive this serum is to thank. The finer lines around my eyes are much less noticeable and I am excited to see what happens after extended use. This is a really great product that i will totally purchase again!</li>
            <li> I was happy to try this Serum with Vitamin C for both my face and hands. I like how smoothly the serum goes on and it makes my skin feel tighter,smoother and softer for sure. It absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, thick or sticky.. I can&#x27;t really see if it has made much difference with fine lines and wrinkles but it definitely feels silkier and softer after only a couple of weeks. It is less expensive when compared to similar products so I feel that it is worth it&#x27;s money. I was happy to give it a try when offered a promotional price for it. Best of all it is made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I like this serum alot, but it is a little too thin for my liking.  Also it dries out my face instead of moisturizing any.  It does shrink your pores, but once you put a moisturizer on, it seems to dissolve.  Good for younger people looking for anti-aging prevention tools.</li>
            <li> I am a beauty snob and would only put the best on my face. I was a little concerned because this serum isn&#x27;t super pricey but it was recommended so I tried. I am always looking for great skincare to help reduce the signs of aging. But I am loving the results from this vitamin C. First it feels great. In a short period, a week or two, I can already see a difference with the fine lines around my eyes. I feel like my complexion is more vibrant and even. I can even...and this is a big one...see a difference in my pore size. Fantastic product. Super happy with it.</li>
            <li> Light, non-greasy, fragrance free and my skin eats this serum up like water in a desert.  I&#x27;ve just started using it and my face already looks softer, perfectly hydrated and smooth.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like after several weeks! LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I love that the serum feels like there is nothing on your skin after you just put it on.  My skin has a nourished look already. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love the texture of the serum on my skin because I feel an immediate tightening of the skin pores. I also like the packaging that dispenses just the right amount. You do not need that much to feel a difference. It also does not sting or burn my skin which is so important. Great new product!</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be on the dry side. I have not used anything on my face apart from general body moisturizers. Most of these leave my face feeling oily and/or clammy making me want to wash my face again after using them. This product was a revelation. After I tried it, my face felt moist,  and, more importantly, still felt clean. I love it.</li>
            <li> excellent product! My face and neck are appearing smoother and brighter already! I have very sensitive skin, so I have to be very careful which products I choose. This one is definitely working for me!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! As a guy, I am not usually so excited about skin care products. However, this one is different. My biggest issue has always been that any skin care program leaves an &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling, so that no matter how little I put on, I just want to wash it off. Not so with the Vitamin C serum I purchased. Also, and I find this hard to believe, it actually does remove my wrinkles! Normally, I like wrinkles - makes me look more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; (-: But since I hit the big one (I won&#x27;t say which one), for the first time, I am actually checking out how much gray I have in my hair. And so less wrinkles is a good thing now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, great produce. I am really glad I purchased it and tried it!</li>
            <li> have very sensative skin and tend to break out often when putting something new on my face.  I hesitated trying this serum but I have wanted to start with a high quality vitamin C because I am aware of the benefits to the skin.  I have been very happy with my choice.  I have not had any irritations or blemishes.  My skin is smooth and silky.  I like that there is no fragrance to the serum.  I am seeing a real difference in less noticable fine lines and the size of my pores seems to be shrinking.  Very happy with this vitamin C.  And I love that it contains aloe vera</li>
            <li> Very happy with the serum. It has made my skin firmer and given it a glow. More than that though, I am really happy that my skin  texture is evening out too.  I have struggled with marks and poxs for years and feel like I have found a solution.  I even had someone comment on my skin and ask me what I was doing different. Highly recommend giving it a try.</li>

            <li> Nice clean, non greasy feel.</li>
            <li> This is a great lightweight serum!  I&#x27;ve been using drug -store moisturizers for years, but noticed  my skin was getting duller and was still dry.  I&#x27;m glad to have switched over to this serum which is much lighter.  I feel like my skin literally drinks it in- it goes on very smoothly- and I&#x27;m started to notice that it&#x27;s brighter as well.  Look forward to continued improvements!</li>
            <li> Love this product, It does all it promises and more. I bought it for my girlfriend, and she is absolutely hooked. We will be re ordering is very soon</li>
            <li> This serum goes on smooth and clear with absolutely no odor. It is easy to apply with a fingertip and easy to work into a your skin care routine. In the mornings I follow the serum after a few minutes with moisturizer. At night, I put only the serum. I am happy with the results: my skin looks and feels more uniform and smooth; wrinkles seem less prominent and the overall texture looks younger.</li>
            <li> This serum beautifies your skin. I have been using it for a little over a month and already see HUGE skin improvements. I switched Vitamin C serums because this one was less expensive than what I was using.  I have been impressed with how it has taken away some acne scarring I have from using oily products in the past.  My skin is acne prone and oily in the T zone.  I have had no breakouts with this serum.  My skin appears clearer and is brighter.  The acne scars are fading. I am seeing it plump my skin and make it look healthier.  The results around my eyes are incredible.  I am also very happy that the product contains vitamin E which is great for nourishing the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only can I see a difference in my complexion from using it, but I can feel a difference as well. My face and neck feel firmer and the area around my eyes is tightening.  From what Dr. Oz has mentioned on his show about vitamin c serum, you should use it for 6 months to see the best results.  I am impressed with this serum after a month or so ‚Ä¶ I will continue to use it and am excited to see the results after 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to most products.  However, the Vitamin C Serum has performed beautifully.  I&#x27;ve not had any adverse reactions and feel as if my skin is looking and feeling better.  I&#x27;ve only been using the serum for a few weeks and am hopeful that my complexion will continue to improve.</li>
            <li> Heard about vitamin C on Dr. Oz, so this product was perfect! Very happy with the results. My skin looks great and I am getting lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Both product are good but after using it, the desired effects are not visible. One does tighten the skin and says it can be used under foundation but after awhile, it becomes flaky. Then the foundation makes the skin dry. I might buy this product again but I think I could buy an over the counter product with the same results.</li>
            <li> The product works awesome! Clearer, brighter skin. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is when you push to pump the serum, it comes out with too much pressure and you lose a lot of what you pay for. I literally wiped the mirror to get my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month now and have seen a difference in my skin and I only use it once a day.  Will definitely continue using this</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything different. Not happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice light serum. You can put it on and forget about. I had bought some other brand which felt thick and sticky. This feels great.</li>
            <li> I received this serum today, and I was very happy that the package came before expected. The serum itself is really well packaged - the bottle looks like that of a pricey high end brand. I like that it&#x27;s opaque and uses an airless pump, which preserves the contents well and allows for cleaner application. The ingredients are mostly natural, which is important if your skin is easily irritated by many commercial skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I did my first application after  double cleansing. I was pleased to find that the serum doesn&#x27;t have a smell. It goes on very smoothly and feels soft and moisturizing, almost like a light face oil. I didn&#x27;t experience any tingling or irritation, just a little tightness. After a few minutes of drying, I applied HABA VC-Lotion and organic rosehip oil over the serum (on face, neck, d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;, hands). It feels light under the other products I use, a positive asset for any skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 20&#x27;s, with a pale skin tone and wear sunscreens daily, so I&#x27;m using this to keep my skin in top form. I am expecting this to reduce some redness on my face and keep good  moisture, nutrition, and overall healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to write a quick review because my skin is looking great, and I think that it is because I added this vitamin c serum to my skin routine.  It is really the only change I made.  My complexion is beaming and much brighter than it was a couple of weeks ago.  Also, when looking at a picture that was taken this past spring, I feel like some of the more pronounced lines and age spots on my face are beginning to be less noticeable.  I am really happy.  I always struggle with what skincare to trust so I thought I would review this product to help others.  It is really helping me look and feel my best.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is the best vitamin c serum I have tried. I saw a difference in my skin very quickly. Just a few weeks and my facial lines are softer, my pores look smaller, and my skin feels silky.  I have never had such noticable results this fast.  I like how sheer the product feels.  For me, the pump bottle makes it easy to apply.  That is a real plus!</li>
            <li> This elixir makes me feel all a-glow. I saw my girlfriend for lunch this week, and she mentioned several times how great my skin is looking.  I knew this serum was working.  It is the only change in my skincare I have made recently. When I massage the serum into my face, I feel the skin around my eyes and mouth tighten up. My skin is glowing and very soft and smooth. I really like that the serum is frangrance free. I am even more amazed that it is actually helping to reduce my fine lines ... maybe dr oz is right vitamin c can drop a decade from your face.  Very exciting.  I guess I felt compelled to share it by writing a review!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product!  It clears my skin so well, and I can now say goodbye to acne scars and dark marks.  It is gentle enough for everyday use, as well, so it&#x27;s a great product to use before bed.  I love it, A+, and highly recommend it!  I have had great results...Thank you for making such an awesome product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the vitamin c serum it makes my face feel amazing with no sensitivity at all which i have had with other vitamin c products&lt;br /&gt;im seeing diminishing sun spots and its improving my under eye dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this serum in the mail. It came quick and I used it that night.  I love that is has minimal ingredients which are beneficial and results oriented.  It&#x27;s a generous size for the price and the packaging is sleek and modern. The writing on the packaging was a bit small and hard to read. The product glides on evenly and feels very smooth and refreshing on my skin.  Since using it everyday for the last week, I notice my skin has a smooth and clear quality. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have used it for a week so far and already see a difference! People have asked me what I have been doing as they have commented on how my skin looks like it is glowing! It has helped already with wrinkles around my eyes and mouth. This one is a keeper- I just threw out the other products I have tried. Gifting another one to my mom, she will also be amazed!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I feel this products absorption into my skin, topically it feels smooth also, and there are no uncomfortable after affects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for using lots of skin products and make-up. I prefer the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look... and feel. However, a friend of mine recommended this product to me with such enthusiasm that I decided to go ahead and try it.  Boy, do I owe my friend plenty of gratitude. I&#x27;m finding out that I can still have the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look but a much improved natural look. This skin cream seems to give me a special glow that I haven&#x27;t seen in many, many years. It&#x27;s like a long tall glass of enriching liquid for my face....but it&#x27;s a cream ....not the least bit greasy and very,very light. I use it in the morning and in the evening. And I seem to have smoother skin combined with more tone.....You can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product...it is easy to use, feels great to apply and I can see and feel a difference..my skin seems to love it!</li>
            <li> Ok serum can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing much.  Pump system squirts it at you.  Dispenser also gets clogged over time.</li>
            <li> This product does not have a serum consistency.  It is very watery!</li>
            <li> Love the feel of it on my skin and just after a few days of using there is a softness to my cheeks. Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I love that it is fast absorbing and non greasy.  Many other products I have tried have left my acne prone skin feeling very oily.  Not this product.  I can use it morning and night. I would suggest it for people who want an anti aging product but have acne prone and oily skin.</li>
            <li> What i like about this product, after i used at night, in a morning i feel like a different person, I look fresh and prettier, what I like the most i can put just a little on my finger, I can put it on my all face, this one is a keeper</li>
            <li> Skincare&#x27;s Vit C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid for your face is absolutely incredible.  I have been getting great results.  I love Vitamin C and have used it for years but tried this one about a month ago.  It is the best vitamin C serum for your face I have used. I believe the airless pump bottle helps keep light out and stabilize the vit c much better than the eye dropper bottles you open up each day.  I like to apply the serum both morning and night each day.    I have been thrilled with the results.  I often have some blemishes and using the serum has helped clear them up much quicker than they would heal without help from the vit c.  The serum definitely helps your skin heal.  I got a burn on my arm when baking halloween cookies two week ago, The burn from the oven rack caused a scar.  Since my Skincare Vitamin C with aloe in it I decided to apply it daily to the burn as well.  I am so happy I chose to try it on the scar.  You wouldn&#x27;t even know anything had happened.  The scar mark from the burn is already completely gone .  I love the vit c with hyaluronic serum and will continue to use it daily.  My tip...make sure you put it on at night.  This is when your skin heals the most.</li>
            <li> Fantastic fantastic fantastic, I m 75 years old, had some sun damage and wrinkles and all is sooooo much better. I love this product üòÄüòä</li>
